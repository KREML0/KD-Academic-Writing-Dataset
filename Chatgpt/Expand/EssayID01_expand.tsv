1	1	1	3	Dear local newspaper, the effects computers have on people are truly remarkable. They offer great opportunities for learning and growth, allowing us to connect with friends and new people, explore the world of astronomy, and stay out of trouble. In today's digital age, chatting with friends and colleagues online has become a norm, with various platforms like @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, Facebook, and MySpace providing avenues for communication. This shift to digital communication not only facilitates easy and convenient interactions but also opens up a world of knowledge and information at our fingertips.   By utilizing computers and the internet, we can expand our horizons and learn about different countries, states, and global events in real-time. This access to information not only enhances our understanding of the world but also broadens our perspectives. While some may worry about the amount of time spent on computers, it is important to recognize the value that these devices bring in terms of education and personal development.   Instead of being out and about with friends, potentially getting into trouble, our children can be safely at home or in a community space, engaging in productive activities on the computer. Through online research, educational programs, and interactive games, they can acquire valuable skills and knowledge that can benefit them in the long run. The computer provides a safe and controlled environment for learning and socializing, reducing the risks associated with unsupervised activities outside the home.  In conclusion, computers have the power to positively impact our lives by offering opportunities for learning, communication, and personal growth. Embracing the digital age and utilizing these tools wisely can lead to a more informed, connected, and productive society. Thank you for considering the profound effects that computers can have on individuals and communities.
2	2	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that using computers will benefit us in many ways. One significant advantage is the ability to connect with others and make friends through social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace. These platforms provide a space for communication and interaction that would not be possible without the use of computers.  Additionally, computers can help us in practical ways by enabling us to access information quickly and efficiently. By utilizing search engines, we can find coordinates, locations, and a vast amount of information on any topic. This can be particularly useful in situations where we need to navigate unfamiliar places or gather data for research purposes.  Furthermore, computers play a crucial role in modern work environments. They allow us to complete tasks more efficiently, such as creating house plans or typing up reports. For example, drawing up a house plan on a computer is much faster and more precise than doing it by hand. Similarly, writing a lengthy report for a job application is much easier when using a computer, as it enables us to edit and format our work effectively.  In conclusion, computers have become indispensable tools in our daily lives. They facilitate communication, provide access to information, and enhance productivity in various tasks. Embracing technology and utilizing computers can greatly benefit us in both personal and professional aspects. So, let's embrace the wonders of technology and make the most of the opportunities it offers.
3	3	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,  More and more people are utilizing computers in various aspects of their lives, sparking debates on whether this trend ultimately benefits society. Proponents of technological advancements argue that computers have a positive impact on individuals. Indeed, computers have become an integral part of modern life, serving purposes ranging from work tasks to recreational activities. They are undeniably one of humanity's most significant achievements, facilitating communication, information access, and entertainment through platforms like social media, news websites, and live streams.  While some may criticize the amount of time individuals spend on computers, particularly detracting from physical activity and face-to-face interactions, it is essential to recognize the diverse reasons why people engage with these devices. Many professions, such as writing or journalism, heavily rely on computer usage, highlighting their crucial role in numerous industries. Additionally, computers play a vital role in keeping individuals occupied and productive, potentially diverting them from engaging in negative behaviors.  Moreover, the benefits of computers extend beyond personal use to broader societal advantages. Law enforcement agencies, for instance, utilize computers to track down criminals, contributing to public safety. Overall, computers serve as valuable tools that enhance efficiency, communication, and knowledge sharing, ultimately benefitting society as a whole.  In conclusion, despite differing opinions on the impact of computer usage, it is evident that these devices play a vital role in modern society, offering numerous benefits in various aspects of life. As technology continues to evolve, it is crucial to acknowledge the positive contributions that computers bring to individuals and communities alike.
4	4	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper,   I have found that many experts say that computers do not benefit our society. In some cases this is true, but in most cases studies show that computers can help people. While nothing beats talking in person, computers can get really close; such examples are webcams or email. A percentage of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for research or to help find good books. Also, online catalogs or advertisements help the economy of stores worldwide. If people were not allowed to use computers, most of the modern world would not exist. One person said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back for much cheaper! Almost every single event I go to is planned on a computer by communication such as email. If a student ever needs homework because they are out sick or need help studying for a test, they can contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them, always email. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office said, ""It would be impossible to get mail to our customers if it were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is."" Newspapers that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist if it were not for the modern communication abilities that computers provide us. Because information can be communicated so quickly, so can research. When the country of Location 2 took a poll, a percentage of people used computers for any type of research, of those, a percentage were students currently in school and a percentage of them have good grades. When the same survey was taken in Location 1, a percentage of people used computers for reasons, and a percentage were students who had good grades. If it were not possible for me to access documents in the library online, I probably would not have gotten an A+ on my recent assignment! Could you imagine if suddenly your Newspaper reporters couldn't use the internet to work on their reports? The articles would probably be delayed after the events occur. Most businesses, including the Newspaper, use the internet to advertise, shop, or read. The association of Organization 1 reported that a percentage of Organization 1 used a website, and of them, a percentage were in good positions. The president of Company 8 Imports said that they use an online catalog because it is cheaper, but they can also promote that it is to save trees or for the customer's convenience. Small businesses can make websites to promote themselves and explain their star to potential customers. The owner of Organization 2's said that the internet saved her restaurant. If it were not for the internet, more people would be jobless in Location 3. In conclusion, computers help everyday people, and without them, most conveniences would not exist. They help communicate around the world, research subjects for school reports, and make the current economy better every day. In moderation, computers are the most useful tool out there.  Sincerely, [Your Name]"
5	5	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I know having computers has a positive effect on people. The computers connect families, contain information which is great for peoples education, and are very convenient. Computers are a step into the future and we should take advantage of it. First off the internet or e-mail will help family members connect. My family, which lives @NUM1 hours away by car, love to talk with me by e-mail. This helps me connect with my family and is just another reason why we should have computers. Another reason that includes family is when the family is just sitting around and are calling everywhere just to find a board game, it would just be easier to go online to find it. This way it would be quick and easy to find that one board game. The last reason why a computer would help a family is if a family wants to get into any kinds of activities and they need the number they could just go online. On the internet the family could find the numbers, and some information about it. This way more and more families can do activities together. As one can see the computer is bringing more and more families together. Another reason why computers are good for society is education. With information at the tip of your fingers more and more people will want to learn. Nowadays people try to find out, but with all the tools on the computers make people get the education. Secondly, computers are another way to go to college. If you aren't up to going to school/college because you're sick, you wouldn't have to miss anything because with a click of a button you will have the materials needed for what was missed. Lastly, everyone knows that in @LOCATION2 most classrooms can't afford one computer. The children want computers so hard. If they were to get one it would change so much. They would be able to learn so much more than before. The children could learn about different countries far away. As a result, computers would improve the way we learn. The last reason why computers are so helpful is convenience. Nowadays the world is crazy, so if we don't have to go out or talk to someone we won't. The computer will offer the ability to conference with other people so that there would be communication between work partners. With the ability to talk with another for work would make us a lighter nation. This is only one of the many reasons computers are very convenient, subsequently computers are convenient because you could book flights, vacations, rentals, and much more. With a click of a button, you should be going to @CAPS1 or a nice vacation. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by connecting families, enhancing education, and providing convenience in various aspects of life. Embracing technology and utilizing computers can greatly benefit society as a whole.
6	6	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers can have a negative impact on us. In America, a large number of people have daily access to computers, with @NUM1 individuals using them for at least an hour each day. This means that @NUM3 people may not be getting enough exercise, potentially leading to various physical ailments.  When we compare the physical activity involved in writing a letter versus sending an email, the difference is clear. Writing a letter requires getting up, gathering materials, walking to the mailbox, and returning home, while sending an email simply involves sitting down and typing. This lack of physical movement can have detrimental effects on our health.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can also lead to security risks, as personal information can be easily compromised. Additionally, prolonged periods of sitting at a computer can contribute to conditions like arthritis, as experienced by my grandfather.  It is important to be mindful of the potential negative consequences of excessive computer usage and to find a balance between technology and physical activity. Remember, the convenience of computers should not come at the expense of our well-being.
7	7	1	3	Did you know that more and more people these days are depending on computers for their safety, natural education, and their social life? In my opinion, the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society. Initially, ones safety while using a computer is at risk. To begin, when someone is talking to another on a computer, they never know who is at the other end of it. For example, a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her, it could be a predator. She will never know unless they meet us somewhere. At this point, it maybe too late. Moreover, studies show that 90% of people's information is more widely exposed in the last 5 years due to the new chat websites. Such as myspace and facebook. In these websites, people share their information. With this, their safety is at risk. Finally, people should stop using computers as much as they are now, in order to keep their safety safe. Furthermore, enjoying nature is a must, in our world full of immense landscapes, wide waters, dense forests, and lush valleys. If you depend on your computer to teach you about the world, you should cease this use. One must actually be outside, experiencing the feel, the smell, and even the taste of nature. A recent study shows that people who actually went to the grand canyon could write a 10-page essay on what they had learned. The people who didn't go and simply read information off their computer, could not write this much. Finally, society needs to back away from their computers, and stop into. Thirdly, a person's social life could be ruined from the use of computers for many reasons. One reasons for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending time with their family and friends. Sure, you can chat with people online, but that's nothing like chatting in person. There is no need to talk to a friend or family member online, when you could do it in person. Finally, if someone takes an embarrassing picture of you and puts it on their computer, it is there forever. Thus, you can lose friends, whether you're the person in the picture or the addict who put the picture on. With this, you can easily ruin your family/social life by using your computer too often. How would you feel if it was your fault that someone's safety is at risk? Wouldn't you rather enjoy nature in person instead of watching it on your computer and not get the full effect? Couldn't you talk to your friends and family in person rather than ignore them to use your computer? There are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society. I encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life.
8	8	1	3	"@PERCENT1 of people agree that computers make life less complicated. I also agree with this. Using computers teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lets people talk online with other people. I think that these are all very important. Why wouldn't you want to have strong hand-eye coordination? I think this a very important skill. Computers help teach hand-eye coordination and they keep it strong. While you're looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go. Good hand-eye coordination is used for a lot of things; mostly everything. If you play some sports like baseball, hand-eye is one of the most important elements. Why not make that stronger off of the field? Also, hand-eye can be used to @ORGANIZATION1 while taking notes. Hand-eye is involved with almost everything you do. you can't have a poor hand-eye coordination or else you won't be able to function properly. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors agree that hand-eye very important for healthy living. I love to travel, but I want to know about the place I'm going to before I get on the phone to go there."" said @PERSON1, a science teacher at @ORGANIZATION1. He feels the way, I'm sure, a lot of people feel. They want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current. The computer has plenty of information about a lot of different places in the world. Some books don't offer as much information or they need to be updated. Computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions. No one wants to be ignorant, right? People want to know what's going on in the world quickly and easily. The computer does this. I remember when I was about @NUM2, our phone broke in our house. We couldn't go out and get one right away either. The only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer. The computer made it easier to e-mail everyone and tell them why we weren't answering our house phone. This happens more often than you think. People need to communicate through computer a lot. At work, if you need to talk to an employee or co-worker and you can't leave your desk, you can just e-mail the information to them. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 employees say that it is much faster and easier to e-mail information as opposed to talking to them on the phone or in person. A lot of people agree that computers make life a lot easier. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people. The most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people. You can make a difference in the way people feel about computers. Write to your local newspaper. It's now or never!   Computers have undeniably simplified our lives by improving hand-eye coordination, providing access to information about distant places, and enabling easy communication. Embracing the benefits of technology is essential in this fast-paced world, where efficiency and knowledge are key to success. Let's continue to appreciate the convenience computers bring and utilize them to enhance our lives further."
9	9	1	3	Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has had a profound impact on human life, particularly through the invention of the computer. This technological advancement has revolutionized the way we conduct various activities in our daily lives. One of the most significant changes brought about by the computer is the convenience it offers in shopping. With just a few clicks, people can purchase a wide range of products online, from groceries to toys, without having to leave their homes. This ease of access has made shopping more efficient and accessible to a larger audience.  Furthermore, the computer has transformed the way we communicate with others. Through email and various messaging platforms, individuals can easily stay connected with friends and family members, regardless of their geographical location. This instantaneous form of communication has bridged the gap between distant relationships, making it easier to maintain connections and stay in touch with loved ones.  Additionally, the computer has opened up a world of entertainment possibilities. From watching movies to listening to music and playing games, there is no shortage of ways to have fun and unwind through the computer. The vast selection of online games, in particular, caters to a wide range of interests and preferences, providing hours of enjoyment for users of all ages.  In conclusion, the computer has truly transformed the way we shop, communicate, and seek entertainment. Its impact on human life has been immense, and as technology continues to advance, the possibilities for the future are endless. The convenience and accessibility offered by the computer have made it an indispensable tool in modern society, shaping the way we interact with the world around us.
10	10	1	3	In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?
11	11	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 people acknowledge the great advances that computers give us, but they also put us at @CAPS1 disadvantages. Computers have been known to help develop health issues. As people become more in tune with the online world, they tend to interact with their family less. Don't forget the danger of online predators - they're deadly. @CAPS1 people who do nothing but watch television are often referred to as couch potatoes. Those who are glued to their computer screens are no better. It is stated by numerous of @LOCATION2's top doctors that too much time spent on the computer can cause damage to your health. Exercise is highly stressed by doctors around the globe, and the only exercise a computer addict will be doing is typing up a storm. They can submerge themselves into obesity. This often causes depression as it begins to sink in. Addiction itself is a serious health issue. I wouldn't be surprised if they add a computer wing to rehab centers sometime in the near future. These problems are slowly spreading, and we must come together to abolish them! Family time is a treasured value to the @CAPS2 people, but lately, computers are ruining this tradition. With so @CAPS1 people absorbed with online drama, friends, and even video games, family interaction is declining. People slowly remove themselves from reality and enter an alternate world of cyberspace. They @MONTH1 only emerge from their rooms to use the bathroom and eat, scarcely resting. This can cause great tension or sorrow in @CAPS1 families. Who can erase the horrifying stories of abduction from their memories? Online predators are highly dangerous and extremely clever. Your children could be talking to someone they believe is another teenager looking for a friend to console in when, really, they are a forty-year-old serial killer waiting to find the right time to attack. Studies show that one fourth of online users have had an encounter with a dangerous person.  In conclusion, it is crucial for us to address the negative impacts of excessive computer use on our health and relationships. By being aware of the dangers posed by online predators and the risk of addiction, we can take steps to protect ourselves and our loved ones. It is essential to prioritize family time and physical activity in order to maintain a healthy balance in our lives. Let us work together to create a safer and more harmonious environment for all.
12	12	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I feel that computers do take away from people's lives and aren't as important as other aspects of life. The world is facing issues such as obesity due to lack of exercise, with computers playing a significant role in this sedentary lifestyle. Additionally, the use of computers contributes to global warming through increased electricity consumption. This environmental impact could lead to the melting of polar ice caps, resulting in catastrophic consequences for the planet. Furthermore, the prevalence of computers in daily life has also led to a decline in family cohesion, with relationships suffering as individuals prioritize screen time over quality time with loved ones. In conclusion, the negative effects of computers on health, the environment, and interpersonal relationships highlight the detrimental impact they have on society.
13	13	1	3	Dear local newspaper,   I read your argument on the positive effects of computers, and I wholeheartedly agree with your points. Computers have indeed revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and stay informed.   One significant advantage of computers is the ability to connect with people across vast distances. For example, if you have a cousin living in California while you reside in Maine, you can easily have a video chat and stay connected in a way that was once unimaginable. This kind of communication fosters relationships and bridges gaps caused by physical distance.   Moreover, computers provide access to a wealth of information and news from around the world. Whether you are on a plane or at work, having a computer at hand allows you to stay updated and informed about current events. This instant access to knowledge enhances our understanding of global issues and keeps us engaged with the world around us.   Additionally, many people rely on computers for their livelihoods. From working remotely to designing and manufacturing computers, these machines play a crucial role in various industries. For instance, the production of this very article would have been much more laborious without the aid of a computer.   In conclusion, the positive impacts of computers on our lives are undeniable. They facilitate communication, provide access to information, and drive innovation in countless fields. Embracing the benefits of technology is essential in this digital age, and we should continue to harness the power of computers for the betterment of society.   Thank you for considering these perspectives on the importance of computers in our daily lives.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]
14	14	1	3	My opinion about the effects of computers is that they can be a waste of time. Many people spend excessive amounts of time on computers, which could be better spent exercising, spending time with loved ones, or engaging in other activities. It is important to limit computer usage to ensure a healthy balance in life. Additionally, computers can expose individuals, particularly children, to inappropriate content such as pornography, leading to negative impacts on their mental health and future well-being. While computers can be used for productive purposes, it is crucial to be mindful of the potential negative effects they can have if not used in moderation. In conclusion, it is essential to recognize the drawbacks of excessive computer usage and strive to maintain a healthy balance in life to avoid potential harm.
15	15	1	3	Dear, In this world today, the use of computers is essential. Computers have a positive impact on people by teaching hand-eye coordination, providing access to information about distant places and cultures, and facilitating online communication with others. In today's digital age, computers serve as a vast repository of knowledge, offering a wealth of information at our fingertips. With the ability to search for information on any topic, computers have become indispensable tools for learning and exploration.  Children and adults alike are drawn to the convenience and speed of computers, spending hours browsing websites and engaging in online activities. Social media platforms like @CAPS1 and Facebook have become popular destinations for young users to connect with friends and share experiences. Additionally, web chat websites enable individuals to communicate with people from around the world through video calls, breaking down barriers of distance and language.  In conclusion, computers have revolutionized the way we access information, connect with others, and navigate the world around us. Every household should have a computer to harness the power of technology and enhance our daily lives.
16	16	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer blinked to life and an image of a blonde-haired girl filled the screen. It was easy to find out how life was in @LOCATION2, thanks to the actual @CAPS1 girl explaining it. Going to the library wouldn't have filled one with this priceless information and human interaction. Computers are a necessity of life if society wishes to grow and expand. They should be supported because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk to others online.  Firstly, computers help teach hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is a useful ability that is used to excel in sports. In a recent survey, 80% of kids felt their hand-eye coordination improves after computer use. Even a simple thing like typing can build up this skill. Famous neurologist Dr. Smith stated in an article last week that, ""Eyes and computer strengthen the brain. When on the computer, you automatically process what the eyes see into a command for your hands."" Improved hand-eye coordination can help people in sports such as baseball and basketball.  Additionally, computers allow people to access information about faraway places and people. If someone wanted to research @LOCATION1, all they'd need to do was type in a search and a world of information would be presented to them. Having the ability to learn about different cultures can make people more understanding and tolerant. Computers are a resourceful tool that can help people in every aspect of life.  Lastly, computers and technology can allow people to chat online. Computer chat and video chat can help bring people from different nations on good terms. When a story comes out about something that happened in @LOCATION3, people can just go on their computer and ask an actual @LOCATION3 citizen their take on the matter. Video chat and online conversation can also cut down on expensive phone bills and help people connect with family members they rarely visit.  In conclusion, computers are a useful aid in today's era. Their advancements push the world forward to a better place. Computers help people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with others. Imagine a world without computers or technological advancements - contact would be scarce, information would be limited, and the world would be divided. The internet is like thousands of libraries put together, providing valuable knowledge and connections. Let's continue to support and embrace the power of computers for a more connected and informed society."
17	17	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people's lives. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to a lack of physical activity and time spent with family. While computers can provide a wealth of information, they cannot replace the value of human interaction and real-life experiences. It is important for individuals to strike a balance between technology use and other aspects of life to ensure a well-rounded and fulfilling existence. Remember, the computer can be a useful tool, but it should not dominate our lives. Let's prioritize getting out, spending time with loved ones, and engaging in activities that computers cannot replicate.
18	18	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, experts are right about the negative impacts of excessive computer use on physical health and social interactions. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, causing weight gain and health issues. Instead of being glued to screens, individuals should prioritize exercise, relaxation, and spending quality time with family and friends. Engaging in physical activities such as walking, jogging, or playing sports can improve overall health and well-being. It is essential to find a balance between screen time and real-life interactions to nurture relationships and create meaningful experiences. Remember, life is precious, and it is crucial to prioritize activities that promote physical and emotional well-being. Make conscious choices to step away from the screen and embrace the world around you.
19	19	1	3	I agree with the advancement of technology. The development of technology is beginning to help find a cure for diseases. Technology was once thought of as something we would not have, leading us to explore the moon. Technology evolves as we progress. People rely on technology for the betterment of life. Famous inventors use technology like Leonardo da Vinci did to advance his flying machine. Technology is the greatest tool we have to enhance our lives.
20	20	1	3	Well computers can be a good or a bad thing. I don't really see computers as a bad thing for me. I also know computers can or will help people all around the world. I think computers have positive effects on people like me. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. It can help if you need to find out research for a school project. You can create lots of things on computers like music, designer t-shirts, logos, banners, and lots of other creative things. With computers, you can look up available homes and apartments. You can even go online and fill out a job application and save trips to stores - how cool is that! Well, I'm a regular person, not rich, not famous, but computers provide a lot of information people use today. That's why I think that computers have a positive effect on people, and you don't have to be super smart to use one.
21	21	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 daily, I am writing to address the issue of computers in our society today. While some may argue that computers are harmful, I firmly believe that they have brought immense benefits to our community.   One of the most significant advantages of computers is their role in facilitating groundbreaking discoveries in various fields. Without computers, many life-saving advancements in medicine would not have been possible. These technological tools have enabled researchers to identify and develop treatments for diseases that were once considered incurable.

Furthermore, computers have played a crucial role in enhancing production rates across industries. From manufacturing cars to producing household necessities, computers have significantly increased efficiency and productivity. This has not only boosted economic growth but has also created more job opportunities for individuals in need of employment.  Moreover, in today's interconnected world, social networking platforms have become a vital source of entertainment and communication for people of all ages. Whether it's connecting with friends and family or exploring new interests online, computers have opened up a world of possibilities for those seeking entertainment and social interaction.  In conclusion, computers have proven to be invaluable assets in our society, driving progress, improving quality of life, and connecting people in ways never thought possible. Rather than being seen as a threat, we should embrace the positive impact that computers have had on our community. Thank you for considering these perspectives.
22	22	1	3	Dear local Newspaper,   I propose that we take all our computers and distribute them to people around the world so they can stay connected with their loved ones from the comfort of their homes. Computers play a vital role in helping people connect with others globally, enabling kids to do their homework, and allowing individuals to stay informed about current events. By sharing our computers with those in need, we can help bridge the digital divide and ensure that everyone has access to the tools necessary for communication and education.  Sincerely,   [Your Name]
23	23	1	3	Dear local newspaper, have you ever seen a child glued to the computer for hours, neglecting exercise, face-to-face interactions, and mental stimulation? This excessive screen time can be detrimental to a child's physical and social well-being. As society advances, we become increasingly sedentary and disconnected from essential activities.  The rise in childhood obesity is a pressing issue, with a high percentage of kids in our community admitting to minimal exercise and a preference for screen time over physical activity. This trend is alarming, as it contributes to serious health problems in adulthood. By reducing computer usage and encouraging outdoor play and exercise, we can combat this growing epidemic.  Furthermore, excessive use of social media platforms has negative consequences on social skills and personal safety. Many students admit to engaging in online behavior they wouldn't replicate in face-to-face interactions, leading to misunderstandings, conflicts, and even cyberbullying. The anonymity and detachment of online communication foster a lack of empathy and accountability, ultimately harming relationships and mental well-being.  In addition, a heavy reliance on computers limits opportunities for nature exploration and critical thinking. By substituting real-life experiences with virtual ones, children miss out on hands-on learning and problem-solving. Encouraging a balance between screen time and real-world activities can foster creativity, curiosity, and cognitive development.  In conclusion, it is crucial to reevaluate the role of computers in our children's lives and prioritize physical activity, face-to-face interactions, and mental stimulation. By promoting a healthier balance, we can create a more active, socially adept, and mentally agile generation. Let's make a conscious effort to unplug, engage with the world around us, and nurture a well-rounded lifestyle for our youth.
24	24	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I've heard that not many people think computers benefit society. I disagree with that. Computers benefit society by teaching hand-eye coordination, allowing people to learn about foreign places, and allowing people to communicate with others online. Some people were basically born with hand-eye coordination, but most people weren't, like me, for example. But, thanks to computers, my hand-eye coordination has gone up! ""On average, computers can increase a person's hand-eye coordination by up to 20%,"" says an expert. Think of it, just by learning to type, your hand-eye coordination can go up 20%! That's amazing! Having good hand-eye coordination will get you far in life and helps with small, everyday things such as playing an instrument or doing household chores. It also helps in sports. You need good hand-eye coordination to throw, catch, and aim.  Have you ever heard of a country in Asia called Japan? By looking it up on the computer, you can become an expert on the country! The computer gives us access to a lot of knowledge, and will make us more aware of people around the world. This can improve our travel. Instead of going to the same place every vacation, you can go to a place you saw online that looks just as exciting. Also, by learning about other countries and the people in them, we gain respect for them. We can also learn about their traditions and culture.  Since global warming is a problem, we can learn how to preserve foreign places by learning about them on the internet. With a click of a mouse, you can virtually have the whole world at your fingertips! In a recent study, 70% of people said they don't have time to meet with old friends. The internet, however, has made it quick and easy to talk to people online. Websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram can keep your social life intact and can even reunite you with old friends.  For example, Facebook suggests family. You can keep in touch with many people through Facebook! Also, you can make new friends. Most teens say they are always willing to meet new people, and the internet is a great way to do so! Sites like Omegle and Chatroulette can help you find friends by connecting you in a chat room to a random person, just to talk. The computer can really amp up your social life.  As you can see, computers don't just ""rot your brain,"" they improve hand-eye coordination, help you learn about far away places, and improve your social life by allowing you to talk to others. Computers benefit society more than anyone will ever know!"
25	25	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 off, I believe that computers are very helpful to many people by looking up information, or talking to friends. Although many kids should be spending their time outside, the computer is a well-occupied environment that helps kids learn and interact with others. I believe kids should have the right to stay on the computer as long as they desire. Although, they should always make time go outside, hang out with friends, etc. The computer can be fun but it's always important to get outside and enjoy nature. Another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is because of their health. If a child gets addicted to the computer, it will affect how he interacts with others and can do serious damage to their brain. Although, I believe children should have the right to the computer, it's always important to spend time outside enjoying nature. Another reason why I think children should have the right to the computer is because of the information they learn and discover. Many kids grow up to have a career in computer making or program designing. Some kids may have their education online or teach others. The computer is a non-stop generation of intelligence based to help people learn, play, and discover. Many people have dreams to one day build a computer or make new programs. All students should have the right to spend time on the computer but also to save time to spend outside and with friends. Everyone has their own perspective on how they think and if staying on the computer all day is a good thing. I do not think kids should do this because it might affect their health and how others think of them. In conclusion, while computers can be beneficial for learning and connecting with others, it is important for children to strike a balance between screen time and outdoor activities for their overall well-being and development.

30	30	1	3	Dear Newspaper People, I think that computers do benefit society for a few reasons. Computers make work easier they can do things people can't like solve difficult problems, and kids like playing games on them. Computers make work easier and neater. Typing is often faster than writing, and is always easier to read. Studies have also shown that people who use computers to do work finish faster and have up to 15% more free time to do whatever they want. Computers also have e-mail, which allows you to send work that you have done to your boss without printing it and wasting paper. Computers can solve difficult problems that people either can't do, or don't want to waste their time doing. If you need to solve a math problem you use a calculated or a computer. So you don't have to figure it out yourself. I have to do a lot of math problems for homework and I think it is much easier to use a calculator. My last reason why computers are good is that kids like playing games on them. A lot of people say that kids shouldn't play computer games but some of them are educational. Even non-educational games help kids to have fun and have something to look forward to after their work is done. 80% of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to, and happier kids do better work. I hope that after reading this you will understand how much computers contribute to society. In conclusion, computers have become essential tools in our daily lives, making tasks more efficient, solving complex problems, and providing entertainment for children. Their impact on society is undeniable, and their benefits continue to shape the way we work and play.
31	31	1	3	I agree that computers are definitely an advantage to our society. They help us communicate and video chat with family and friends online, are a great tool for school work, and can be used for work purposes. Additionally, computers provide entertainment for children through fun computer games that also teach them valuable lessons, such as responsibility through games like Webkinz.  Social media platforms like Facebook make it easy to connect with friends and family, plan events, and send invitations quickly and efficiently. The convenience of sending invites via email or social media messages saves time and effort, making life simpler and more organized.  Webcam technology allows for face-to-face interactions with friends and family, even when they are far away. This feature enhances communication and strengthens relationships without the need for physical presence.  Furthermore, computers assist with school work by enabling students to type up reports and assignments, showcasing their work neatly and legibly. They also provide opportunities to search for jobs online and create professional resumes effortlessly.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in our society by enhancing communication, providing entertainment, aiding in education, and facilitating job searches.

32	32	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, my name is @PERSON1 and I am a @ORGANIZATION1 citizen. I believe that computers do NOT benefit society at all! In my opinion, they make our town worse. People spend way too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. All of these things are what computers are doing to our society and it's time to put a stop to it!  First of all, people are on the computer way too much. Teens are on social networking sites, adults are in chatrooms, and kids are playing computer games. Instead of that, people should be playing outside or going for a walk in the park. Did you know that 60% of adults are overweight? If people cut back the amount of time indoors, we could probably bring that number way down. Also, who knows what teens are doing on the computer. Computers have good things but they can also be bad. For example, chatrooms - who knows what kind of people are in chatrooms. Children need to be careful about what they say or show on the internet. Instead of playing games or talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends, teens should go outside and exercise.  Second, more citizens need to enjoy nature and the beautiful scenery around them. We're all so busy running to check our e-mail, we don't notice what a beautiful day it is outside. On a nice day or evening, people should take their kids to a local park or pond. This reminds me of last summer when I went to my cousin's house. My aunt only allowed us to watch one hour a day, including the computer. We were outside every single day, even if we were just staring into the clouds. This kept us active and enjoying the environment.  My last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that they take time away from interacting with family and friends. I know what you're thinking - when you're on the computer you are talking to family and friends, but it isn't the same. Instead of instant messaging, call them. Maybe even invite them out to talk face to face. That reminds me of my sister. When I get home, she will normally be on her computer. Now, instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me ""What's up?"" or ""How was your day?"" Computers help people communicate, but they also take communication away.  As you can see, I have given you three reasons why I strongly believe computers are badly affecting society. Not only in my town but everywhere! You need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they allow people to not enjoy nature, or interact with their families. Please, I'm asking you to understand that our society will crash if we don't fix this issue. So what are you going to do about it?"
33	33	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people in various ways. One significant benefit is their ability to provide access to a wealth of information, making learning easier and more convenient. Online tutoring platforms and educational websites offer valuable resources for students to enhance their knowledge and excel in school. Additionally, computers facilitate communication and social connections through social networking sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, enabling individuals to stay in touch with friends and make new acquaintances. Moreover, the option of pursuing online education allows individuals to further their careers by obtaining advanced degrees or certifications, leading to better job opportunities. Overall, computers play a vital role in enriching people's lives and expanding their possibilities.
34	34	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, there is a rumor circulating that computers have a negative impact on children's lives. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. Computers can actually benefit children in numerous ways, such as helping them with homework, enabling communication with friends, and assisting with school projects. Additionally, most children do not spend excessive amounts of time on computers.   Homework plays a significant role in a student's academic success. Computers provide access to websites that offer assistance with homework assignments, making it easier for children to understand and complete their work. Furthermore, social interactions are crucial for a child's development. Through platforms like AIM, Facebook, and Myspace, children can maintain friendships, resolve conflicts, and even make new friends from different locations.   Moreover, computers are invaluable tools for school projects. They allow students to research information, gather images, and create visually appealing presentations without the need for traditional supplies like paper and pencils. In essence, computers are essential for both students and parents alike, facilitating various tasks efficiently.  In conclusion, computers are a vital technological resource that enhances academic performance, social connections, and project completion for children. They are an indispensable tool in today's digital age and offer numerous benefits for young learners.
35	35	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Where would we be without them? Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about any subject they want, and allow people to communicate with each other, no matter how far away. Obviously, computers are beneficial.  Computers not only teach hand-eye coordination but also help improve fine motor skills, which are essential for various tasks in daily life. For instance, typing on a keyboard requires precise movements that can enhance dexterity. Additionally, video games and simulations can further enhance hand-eye coordination, making computers a valuable tool for skill development.  Moreover, the vast amount of information available on the internet enables individuals to expand their knowledge and pursue their interests. Whether someone is interested in history, science, or art, the internet provides a wealth of resources to satisfy their curiosity. This accessibility to information promotes continuous learning and personal growth, showcasing the positive impact of computers on education.  Furthermore, the ability to communicate with others through various online platforms transcends geographical boundaries and fosters connections across the globe. In today's interconnected world, maintaining relationships with friends and family members, regardless of distance, is made easier through video calls, instant messaging, and social media. The convenience of staying in touch with loved ones highlights the social benefits of computers in enhancing relationships.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in enhancing hand-eye coordination, facilitating learning opportunities, and promoting communication among individuals. The positive effects of computers on people's lives are undeniable, showcasing their importance in modern society. Embracing the benefits of technology can lead to a more connected and knowledgeable world.
36	36	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever wondered what effect computers have on people? It is a very negative effect. Computers are one of the main reasons why kids do not exercise and become obese, it can affect students' grades, and by being on the @CAPS6, you are isolating yourself from your loved ones. First of all, more and more kids are using computers way more often than they should. The result of this, you may ask? Since computers are used daily, especially by young adolescents, it is likely for that child to become obese. Researches from well-known colleges, such as @ORGANIZATION2 and @LOCATION2, discovered that 40% of kids who spend more than two hours on the @CAPS6 are obese or will become heavier when they are older. After speaking with @PERSON1, a graduate from @LOCATION1, he told me that when children spend more time on the @CAPS6, they are doing nothing but staring at a bright screen that can damage their eyes, and not spending their time outside enjoying the beautiful weather. As a consequence, kids start to gain body fat from sitting on a coach staring at the @CAPS6 all day instead of exercising! My second reason of why computers are a negative effects on kids is that it can harm your grades! After I spoke with a current student at @ORGANIZATION1, she told me that the reason why her grades drop is because she is too busy on @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc. She does not focus on her @ORGANIZATION1 work like she should and because she doesn't, her grades go from high A's to low B's. This shows that even ""A"" students are getting bad grades from being on the @CAPS6. Additionally, from being on the @CAPS6 so much and not paying attention at @ORGANIZATION1 work, it can affect your best grades on the @ORGANIZATION3's! This shows that by always going on the @CAPS6 you hurt your academic skills. My last and final reason of why computers have a negative effect on children is because it harms your social skills of being an outgoing, talkative individual! Every time you log into that death trap device, your self-esteem becomes lower because you never talk to friends or call them. You just sit on a hard chair, looking at an electronic device that is going to take you nowhere in life. Also, you are pushing your loved ones away by being on @CAPS6 for long periods. You will end up never spending time with them and you will never call your friends to see what they are up to if you keep on going on the @CAPS6. Furthermore, if your mom or dad tells you to get off your @CAPS6, you become cranky and rude to your family just because you want to go back on your favorite electronic device. Do you really want to act that way to your family? So, in summing up, computers are a negative effect on many young individuals, and the reasons for this are that you have less time to exercise, it harms your grades, and you are not able to be as interactive with people by being on the @CAPS6. The real question is, though, do you think computers have a negative or positive effect on people?"
37	37	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my attention that some people believe computers are detrimental to our well-being. While I understand their concerns, I firmly believe that computers bring numerous benefits to society. Computers play a vital role in facilitating learning, maintaining connections with loved ones, and staying organized. The internet serves as a vast source of information, allowing individuals to expand their knowledge effortlessly. Whether someone is researching a destination like @LOCATION1 or taking online courses, computers are invaluable tools for educational advancement. In terms of social connections, technologies like video chats and emails enable people to stay in touch with friends and family regardless of physical distance. Personal and professional communication has been greatly enhanced by the ease of sending messages globally. Moreover, computers aid in organization by providing a secure platform for storing important files and documents. The convenience of saving and retrieving data digitally ensures that information is easily accessible and less likely to be misplaced. Overall, the positive impact of computers on society is undeniable, as they facilitate learning, communication, and efficiency. Therefore, I believe that computers are an essential and beneficial aspect of modern life.
38	38	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the society we live in, more and more people are using computers, including myself. The computer, in my opinion, has to be one of the best inventions ever. The bad part is that some people think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers. Students can use computers to get information on almost anything, communicate with friends and family members, and even use it as a navigator to find directions to a certain location if they are lost.  One of the best things about computers is that you can find a vast amount of information. This option is useful for children attending school, looking to find information for a project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isn't enough. Additionally, if a student is looking for a job in their local area, they can search online for job openings.  Computers can also be used for communication. Whether it's reconnecting with a long-lost relative or chatting with schoolmates for homework help, online communication has made it easier than ever to stay connected. While online dating might not be for everyone, it's another option available on computers.  One of my favorite features of the computer is its ability to navigate to a specific location. If you forget where a relative's house is, you can simply enter your address and their address to get directions. This method can be used for almost anywhere you want to go.  If this did not convince you that a computer is a great piece of technology, then you're missing out. The computer is like a magical box that can be used for anything, so I highly recommend getting one.
39	39	1	3	Dear local Newspaper,  A lot more people use computers daily, but not everyone agrees that it benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. However, I do not entirely agree. It is better not to spend too much time on computers.   Firstly, exercising is crucial for a healthy lifestyle. Taking a walk around the neighborhood, going for a hike, or hitting the gym are all better alternatives to sitting in front of a screen all day. Regular exercise keeps you fit, healthy, and strong, which is essential for a long and fulfilling life.   Secondly, enjoying nature is a beautiful experience that should not be overlooked. Whether it's jumping off a waterfall, visiting a park, or feeling the wind on your face, immersing yourself in nature can bring a sense of peace and wonder that technology cannot replicate.   Lastly, interacting with family and friends is essential for maintaining relationships and creating lasting memories. Spending time together, watching movies, going out for ice cream, or visiting amusement parks can strengthen bonds and create meaningful connections that are far more valuable than any online interaction.   In conclusion, spending excessive time in front of a computer screen can detract from the real joys of life. By prioritizing exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with loved ones, we can lead a more fulfilling and balanced lifestyle. Let's not let technology hold us back from the genuine experiences that make life truly meaningful.  Thank you for considering my perspective.  Good day!
40	40	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1 and I am @NUM1 years old. I attend Naylor School and I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. One significant benefit of computers is the ability to connect with individuals worldwide. For example, my brother uses the computer to communicate with our family in @LOCATION1 through platforms like Skype, enabling us to stay in touch through video calls. Furthermore, computers can enhance hand-eye coordination, as I have experienced while playing ping-pong. The visual tracking skills developed while using a computer can translate into improved performance in sports like ping-pong. Additionally, computers provide access to a wealth of information, with my mother even finding a job online. Whether checking the weather forecast or staying updated on current events, computers offer convenient access to essential information. While some argue that excessive computer usage can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and potential health issues, such as obesity and relationship strain, I believe that the benefits of technology far outweigh the drawbacks. As technology continues to advance, it is essential for society to embrace these innovations and recognize the positive impact that computers have on our lives.
41	41	1	3	Computers play a crucial role in connecting people with their friends and family, serving as a convenient platform for communication. Additionally, computers are essential for job hunting, as many employers require online applications and resumes. However, it is important to strike a balance and not let excessive screen time on computers interfere with responsibilities like homework. Finding a healthy equilibrium between using computers for socializing, job searches, and academic tasks is key to maximizing their benefits in our daily lives.
42	42	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: Computers have a negative impact on people and their ability to connect with others because individuals tend to spend excessive amounts of time on the computer, limiting their social interactions and physical activities. One reason for this is that prolonged computer use can strain the eyes and potentially lead to vision problems. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of individuals who spend extended periods on the computer are at a higher risk of developing eye-related issues compared to those who spend more time outdoors. Additionally, individuals who are constantly indoors using electronic devices may lack essential social skills, making it challenging for them to form meaningful relationships with others. This can result in isolation and a reliance on online communication, which may not always reflect the true nature of personal interactions. Furthermore, a sedentary lifestyle associated with excessive computer use can lead to health issues due to a lack of physical exercise. People who spend most of their time on the computer may neglect their overall well-being, potentially leading to various health problems in the long run. In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential to strike a balance between digital interactions and real-world connections to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. Thank you.
43	43	1	3	The effect of people using computers is not necessarily bad, as there are many benefits to be gained from utilizing this technology.

Over time, individuals can learn to type without looking at the keyboard, increasing efficiency and speed.  Furthermore, computers make tasks such as writing letters much easier. Instead of using a pencil and paper, individuals can type their letters and simply print them out. This saves time and effort, as the computer does the work of writing and formatting for them.  In addition, computers are invaluable tools for research. Whether someone is looking up information about a particular topic or location, the computer provides instant access to a wealth of knowledge with just a few clicks. This efficiency in gathering information saves time and streamlines the research process.

From improving typing skills to simplifying tasks like writing and research, computers play a vital role in modern society.
44	44	1	3	People are spending too much time on computers. People that spend too much time on the computer do not have time to interact with family or friends. People spend too much time on the computer. The kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. They also get tired very easily. First of all, people spend too much time on the computer. A large percentage of kids spend several hours on the computer. I once spent several hours on my computer on a single day. Many kids visit various websites like Facebook, Twitter, and iTunes. My friend spent hours on those websites. People spend way too long on the computer. Another reason is that kids who spend time on the computer often end up with poor grades. A significant percentage of kids who spend a lot of time on the computer forget to study for tests. I remember spending all night on the computer once and failing a test the next day. Kids also tend to forget to do their homework. I have a friend who got so engrossed in the computer that he neglected his homework. Kids should prioritize schoolwork over computer time. My final reason is that kids get tired from spending extended periods on the computer. A notable percentage of kids become so exhausted that they struggle to do anything once they log off. I personally experienced extreme fatigue after spending too long on the computer and ended up taking a nap. Some kids even forget about plans they made after school because they are too tired. One kid I know blew off plans with his friends because he was too tired from being on the computer. It is crucial for kids to take breaks from the computer. In conclusion, excessive computer usage is a significant issue among people, especially kids. It not only affects their academic performance but also leads to exhaustion. Measures need to be taken to address this concerning trend.
45	45	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, it's true that computers can be incredibly helpful when it comes to research. While some may argue that spending too much time on a computer can lead to weight gain, it's important to recognize the many benefits that computers offer. For example, computers provide access to a wealth of information that may not be easily accessible through books alone. They allow us to explore our family history, learn about important events in history, and connect with others through social media platforms. Additionally, computers can help save money on long-distance calls by providing alternative communication methods such as web chat. Ultimately, the decision to use a computer for research and communication is up to you, but it's important to consider the many advantages that computers offer.

It is important to recognize and appreciate the positive impact they have on society.
48	48	1	3	Have you ever experienced time flying by while you're engrossed in your computer? You start at one in the afternoon, and before you know it, it's already seven in the evening. It's crucial to reduce computer time because it hinders outdoor activities, takes away precious moments with loved ones, and overlooks alternative ways of gathering information. Being outdoors, breathing in fresh air, and engaging in physical activities are essential for a healthy lifestyle. Sitting in front of a screen all day leads to inactivity, contributing to health issues such as obesity. Spending time on the computer means missing out on the beauty of nature and the joy of playing sports under the sun. Family time is invaluable, and excessive computer use can disconnect you from those closest to you. Your family won't be around forever, so cherish every moment spent with them instead of isolating yourself with a device. Furthermore, there are numerous resources other than the internet to acquire knowledge and explore new places. Books offer a wealth of information on various subjects and teach valuable skills like using an index. Additionally, traveling to a location of interest provides a firsthand learning experience and an opportunity to create lasting memories with family. In essence, reducing computer usage allows for more time outdoors, strengthens bonds with family, and encourages diverse learning experiences beyond the digital realm. Embrace life's adventures and connections, rather than letting time slip away in front of a screen.

In conclusion, computers are a fundamental tool that has opened up endless possibilities for humanity, allowing us to achieve feats that were once unimaginable.
51	51	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever wondered how to get somewhere without a map nearby? Computers can be a lifesaver in these situations. With just a few clicks, you can easily find directions to your desired destination. Not only that, but computers are packed with valuable information and resources that can make our daily lives easier.  One of the most convenient features of computers is the ability to connect with others through video chat. Whether you're missing a friend or a loved one, you can easily catch up with them online. This is especially handy for sharing photos and staying in touch with those who are far away.  Additionally, computers provide access to weather forecasts, allowing you to plan your week ahead without any hassle.

53	53	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that some people believe computers are overused, but I see them as valuable tools that bring more good than harm. Computers provide access to sources that can't be found in books, allowing for thorough research and a deeper understanding of topics. Additionally, computers facilitate interaction between people, enabling communication, sharing of photos, and even gaming with friends. Moreover, the advancement of computer technology will continue to improve and offer new possibilities in the future. Instead of trying to change people's habits, we should recognize the benefits computers bring in terms of information, connectivity, and progress. Ultimately, the use of computers is a personal choice that should be respected for its positive contributions to society.
54	54	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1! I am an @NUM1 grade student at @PERSON1. I was reading your paper and I notice you had an article on how people are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time going outside, getting exercise, enjoying nature, and that it doesn't benefit society. I completely disagree with these comments. Let me explain...  Having computers definitely benefit all students. Sometimes kids forget their textbooks at school. But if they have a computer, they can just Google the information. That way they get their homework done and don't have to take a zero. Another thing is, I am sure you have heard of a website called Study Island. If you haven't, it's a website for all the students in the @LOCATION1 to take online courses for math, reading, and science. They are time-consuming, but they count for a huge chunk of our grade. So, if we get an A on Study Island, we get an A in one of our classes.  Not only does the computer help students, but it helps me in a kind of personal way. I love the piano. But, there are no instructions in my area. However, there is a program on the computer called Synthesia. It helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano. Learning an instrument can help you achieve things later in life.  Now, one thing you said in your article is that people aren't getting enough exercise because of sitting in front of a computer all day. This is not completely true. In fact, most people go on the computer researching diet plans or local gyms. How do I know this? Well, one day when I went on Google, the top search of the day was ""Weight Watchers diet plan."" Also, my mom uses an online video workout website for her bad back.  So, with this letter, I hope you realize that the computer does benefit our society. Yes, we should not spend too much time on it. But online learning sessions can be time-consuming. It helps many people figure out the right diet and workouts so they can stay happy and healthy. In conclusion, while it's important to find a balance, the computer can be a valuable tool in education, personal growth, and overall well-being."
55	55	1	3	Computers are indeed a valuable tool for various reasons. One significant advantage is that they allow kids to efficiently complete their homework. In instances where a textbook is forgotten at school, a computer can provide access to necessary information. Additionally, computers facilitate video chats, enabling individuals to stay connected with friends and family, even when separated by distance. Furthermore, the vast resources available on the internet make computers a valuable tool for research and information gathering. Whether searching for answers, images, or creating presentations, computers are a versatile and essential resource. In conclusion, the versatility and functionality of computers make them an indispensable tool for both personal and professional use.
56	56	1	3	Over the past decade, the percentage of people using computers has increased by approximately 20%. All of a sudden the world and its people have become dependent on information that computers provide. The variety of databases and resources, the increased communication, and the skills computers allow you to portray prove that they are essential for this generation. Communication over computers benefits society by enabling interaction between individuals. Personally, I have been able to talk and see my family who live overseas through the advanced technology on computers. Different communication programs such as Skype, Zoom, and email, the most commonly used, facilitate these connections. Without access to a computer and its contents, residents have a difficult time immersing themselves in the rest of society. Computers allow for essential activities such as keeping track of school events, sports schedules, and staying in touch with faraway family and friends.  Parents and teenagers these days have become lazier compared to how they used to behave. They are not interested in going to the library to research information on people, places, and family heritage. Computers have been a huge convenience in a person's life by providing all the information that was once found in books throughout the internet. For example, when doing a school project, the internet can provide all the necessary information. It is truly astonishing how much one electronic instrument can impact and influence a life.  Being a student, I am often curious about the references teachers make and additional information that is not provided. The internet allows any person with a computer to research topics of interest and provide responses almost immediately. The benefits of computers can outweigh the few negative effects as they allow individuals to discover various information on any desired subject. In addition to searching for information, computers can be used to document personal data. Microsoft has developed several applications that allow users to graph information, design presentations, and neatly record drafts of writing. No person is flawless and is incapable of mistakes. Microsoft helps mask imperfections by making a neater copy of an essay or putting lists of data into graph form to make it more visually appealing.  Society has become reliant on sources scattered throughout the databases on computers, and implementing restrictions on this information source can enable society to benefit from the positive contributions that computers have on our way of life.
57	57	1	3	in @DATE1 has become far more advanced. Computers are one of the most futiristic objects. The computer is good for connecting to people around the world. However, computers have bad effects on people's lives. Children are taking time out of their homework to go on the computer, citizens are gaining weight, and children are being kidnapped. School is very important and valuable if you want to suceed in life. However, computers have made it difficult for students to concentrat on their homework. This is a horrible habbit and a bad effect on students every where. Students grades will suffer and will not obtain class credits if this problem is not mentioned. Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1, five out of every ten @CAPS1 are either overweight or obese. This can lead to death. The problem is that people are spending hours on the computer each day. Most of that time can be used to exercise. Exercising can be an important benefit to someone's life. If this problem is not addressed millions of americans will be overweight, @CAPS2 is a very serious and dangerous topic. Every month dozend of kids are kidnapped. Since the internet was invented there is a twenty percent increase rate of kids missing children will go on poppular networking websites such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and twitter and give out their important information. Pedophiles use the internet to trick children in to giving their address. This problem needs to stop and be addressed by the police. Everyday, more and more people use computers. Compuers have good and bad effects on peoples lives. The bad effects are very serious and dangerous. How would you feel if your child fails school, gains weight, or gets kidnapped because of the computer? It is essential to be aware of the negative impacts of excessive computer use and take proactive measures to ensure a healthy and safe environment for everyone.
58	58	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I'm writing to you about the debate that you are having asking if people should use computers. The article stated ""more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society."" I think people should not use computers. Also technology needs to slow down, it's getting too advanced. My first reason why people need to stop spending time on computers is that you don't want to always say to your spouse on your honeymoon ""we could have gone to a beautiful location from our computer."" Your life will go by fast, and you won't even notice it, ending up overweight and old. Additionally, 70% of people who use computers are overweight because they don't exercise.   Secondly, the more technology there is, the less connected we become. It feels better when you work with your hands instead of just sitting on your computer, receiving a monthly paycheck without truly earning it. In conclusion, you live a happier life when you explore the world around you. 20% of people who use computers end up committing suicide, showing the negative impact of excessive computer usage. If it were up to me, I would limit the use of computers. Read all about the downsides of excessive computer usage, and you might start to think like me. I used to be a computer geek, but now I see the importance of living a more balanced and active life. Let's slow down on the technology and focus on what truly matters - human connection and experiences that can't be replicated by a screen."
59	59	1	3	Some people may find it hard to believe, but there is a common belief that computers have a negative impact on people. Despite the widespread use of computers, not everyone owns one and some individuals perceive them in a negative light. One of the reasons people choose to own a computer is to stay connected with friends, especially those who live far away in different states or countries. Social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter facilitate these long-distance friendships, allowing individuals to stay in touch with loved ones across the globe. Additionally, owning a computer can open up opportunities for educational growth and exploration. For instance, high school students can take online college courses to advance their education, and individuals of all ages can use the internet to learn about different cultures and places. Furthermore, computers can inspire people to travel and explore the world, as they can easily research destinations and plan their trips online. Overall, computers have the potential to have a positive impact on individuals by fostering connections, facilitating learning, and encouraging exploration. It is important to recognize the benefits that computers can bring to our lives and to embrace their positive influence on our minds and experiences.
60	60	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I agree that computers are beneficial to society. Computers have a positive impact on individuals, improving hand-eye coordination and providing opportunities to learn about different cultures and religions around the world. Through computers, people can communicate, connect with others, and engage in conversations online. Additionally, computers serve as valuable tools for accessing information quickly and efficiently. Overall, computers play a significant role in helping people in various aspects of their lives.
61	61	1	3	People need to reduce their time spent sitting in front of computers to combat the growing obesity problem and improve social interaction. Obesity is on the rise due to lack of exercise from computer use, so it is essential to incorporate physical activity into daily routines. Additionally, face-to-face interaction is crucial for developing social skills and overall happiness. Spending time outdoors, engaging in physical activities, and connecting with others in person can have a positive impact on both physical and mental well-being. It is important to prioritize real-life experiences over excessive screen time to lead a healthier and more fulfilling life. So, let's unplug from our computers, go outside, and enjoy the world around us.
62	62	1	3	Using computers can be beneficial for individuals as it allows them to learn new things and connect with people. While some may argue that computers can be a distraction, the advantages of using them outweigh the drawbacks. People who work on computers all day are often doing so to support themselves and their families, rather than to appear trendy or popular. Computers provide a platform for individuals to expand their knowledge and social circles, offering a valuable resource for both personal and professional growth. Ultimately, utilizing computers can enhance one's learning experience and facilitate meaningful connections with others.
63	63	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people for several reasons. Firstly, computers provide a wealth of educational resources, allowing individuals to learn new information easily. If someone has a question or needs clarification, they can quickly find the answer online without having to search through books or other sources. This accessibility to knowledge is invaluable in today's fast-paced world.  Furthermore, computers enable individuals to stay informed about current events and news stories from around the globe. By simply browsing the internet, people can learn about the latest developments, celebrity gossip, or even check the weather forecast. This real-time access to information is not only convenient but also helps individuals stay connected to the world around them.  Additionally, computers allow for efficient organization and storage of personal information. With the use of programs like spreadsheets, individuals can easily keep track of data and create visually appealing graphs. This not only helps in maintaining a neat and organized record but also aids in data analysis and decision-making.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive influence on people by facilitating learning, keeping individuals informed, and aiding in the organization of personal information. The benefits of computers in our daily lives cannot be understated, and their role in enhancing productivity and knowledge is undeniable.
64	64	1	3	I believe that computers are beneficial for various reasons. They offer access to the internet, social media platforms like MySpace, videos, and are valuable tools for schoolwork such as math and essays. Computers can assist with a wide range of subjects including math, writing, spelling, science, and literature. They provide resources like online research, writing tools, and educational websites that enhance learning experiences. Additionally, computers can aid in printing out necessary materials, making tasks more efficient and organized. Overall, computers play a crucial role in education and are essential for academic success.
65	65	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, People are spending way too much time on the computer and it is not right. They should be exercising and interacting with friends and family. Having a computer also distracts them from schoolwork. Computers normally have effects like this on the people that use them. Instead of sitting at the computer all day, people should be out getting exercise. The United States is one of the countries with the most overweight people. Many teenagers are inside all day at the computer waiting for their friends' screen name to pop up so they can talk to them. They don't need to be completely gone, but while they're waiting for their friend, they could be exercising. All they need to do is put on some fun music and start dancing around, that will get them the exercise they need for the day. They also could do ten push-ups and twenty curl-ups, or even more if they wanted to. Instead of sitting at the computer all day, exercise. Having a computer affects the owner because they don't have a lot of face-to-face conversations with friends and family. You can call your friend up and have them come over to your house instead. If they can be at home on the computer for hours, then they probably can hang out in real life. Instead of video chatting with your cousins in another state, plan for them to come visit you guys one day. That way you can actually talk to them and see what they're doing too. You could also play board games, hide and seek, etc. It is much more fun to be with someone in real life than to talk with them online. The last but definitely not least effect that computers have on people's lives is it distracts them from school. Once you start talking with one of your friends, it's pretty hard to stop. Many people don't know how to stop, so they don't do the homework they were supposed to do, or they didn't study for the big test the next day, therefore they end up failing it. Some kids will do homework and be on the computer at the same time, the homework is probably wrong because they weren't concentrating on it hard enough. Having a computer affects your life in many different ways, some positive and some negative. Some ways are it ""stops"" you from exercising, it doesn't let you have face-to-face interaction with friends and family, and it distracts many kids from school.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is important for individuals to strike a balance in their usage to ensure they are also engaging in physical activity, maintaining personal relationships, and focusing on their education. It is essential to remember that technology should complement, not replace, these vital aspects of life."
66	66	1	3	Wouldn't it be great to use computers in everyday life? In this country, we can. Computers offer a wide range of benefits that make daily tasks easier and more convenient. One of the most significant advantages is the ability to connect with people from all over the world, rekindling old friendships and maintaining relationships regardless of distance. Platforms like social media and video chat services allow us to see and talk to loved ones with just a few clicks.  Moreover, computers provide invaluable assistance with academic work. They enable students to research and gather information quickly, type and edit essays efficiently, and access online dictionaries for language support. This not only saves time but also enhances the quality of work produced. With the help of computers, students can focus on other activities, such as spending time outdoors, engaging with family, and enjoying hobbies.  In conclusion, the use of computers in daily life brings numerous benefits that enhance communication, education, and overall productivity. Embracing technology allows us to streamline tasks, stay connected with others, and access a wealth of information at our fingertips. Ultimately, integrating computers into our daily routines can greatly improve our quality of life.
67	67	1	3	Computers have a significant impact on people's society in various ways. Firstly, computers facilitate communication with friends and family, allowing individuals to stay connected with loved ones regardless of their location. This connectivity helps maintain relationships and fosters a sense of community. Additionally, computers serve as a valuable tool for learning about history. They provide access to vast amounts of information on historical events, figures, and places, enabling individuals to expand their knowledge and understanding of the past. Finally, computers offer a means of keeping busy through activities such as researching for school projects, playing educational games, or making travel arrangements. Overall, the presence of computer technology enhances social interactions, educational opportunities, and leisure activities in society. Its benefits are evident in how it promotes connectivity, enables learning, and provides entertainment and productivity options for individuals.
68	68	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe that there can be both good and bad effects. Computers make things easier for people, but they are also too dependent on. Man-kind should use books for research also not just computers. Computers are very helpful for people. For example, if you really wanted to see a certain movie but you don't want to stand in line, people can go to movie tickets.com and purchase their tickets. Then, once you get to the movie theater, all that's left to do is walk over to the kiosk and redeem your tickets. Another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes. There is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer. Once the software has been installed, it will usually lead you, step by step, through the process of paying your bills. It's much faster and much easier than paying ""manually"". These are some really good effects that computers have on people. Computers also have their flaws. Over time, computers have caused most people to be lazy. Some people have become too dependant on their computers. Business owners, or businessmen and women in general, are @CAPS2 on their laplops or blackberries. Everywhere you look there is another adult on the internet or e-mail. Not only adult's do this though. Students are becoming more dependant on the internet. For every assignment practically, students use google or bing. Sometimes they use or wikipedia. Students should just take the time to use their extbooks. The student body would rather watch @CAPS3, play video games, or text than do homework. This is understandds because homework can be boring but it all pays off in the end. Taking the extra @NUM1 minutes to use a textbook won't kill anyone. No one has died yet from using a book instead of google. Also, in using a textbook, you will understand how to do whatever you're doing. That isn't so bad, is it? Computers, as you can see, have both good and bad effects. It's easy to use the internet for homework but that doesn't really help you. Making purchases is fun though. It saves gas money and time. I hope you and the readers of this paper see my point of view.  In conclusion, while computers offer convenience and efficiency, they also pose risks of over-dependence and laziness. Finding a balance between utilizing technology and traditional resources like books is essential to maintain critical thinking skills and avoid becoming too reliant on digital tools. By recognizing the advantages and disadvantages of computers, individuals can make informed choices in utilizing technology in a way that enhances rather than hinders their overall well-being and development."
69	69	1	3	Some people think it is a good idea and some do not. My opinion is that people spend a lot of time on computers for good reasons. Grownups work on computers for tasks like taxes, paperwork, and booking tickets, making it more convenient than traditional methods. Students also benefit from learning how to type, improving their skills for both digital and physical writing. Additionally, computers facilitate communication, allowing people to easily connect with others and make plans. Overall, using computers for various purposes can be productive and beneficial in today's digital age.
70	70	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3,   Life without computers would be drastically different. We would lack quick access to information, socialization opportunities, and the ability to keep personal data secure. The world today greatly benefits from technological advances, with computers playing a vital role in various aspects of our lives. As a student, computers are essential for completing assignments efficiently. Tools like @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS7 provide valuable assistance in checking grammar and spelling, ensuring academic success. Businesses also heavily rely on computers for their operations, highlighting the importance of technology in the workforce.  Furthermore, computers offer entertainment and valuable knowledge. With just a few clicks, one can access a wealth of information on any topic of interest. Technology not only entertains but also educates, providing resources at our fingertips. The general consensus is that technological advancements are beneficial to society, improving efficiency and accessibility in various areas of life.   In conclusion, the role of computers in our daily lives is indispensable. From education to business operations to entertainment, technology continues to enhance our experiences and contribute to societal progress. Embracing and continuing to advance in technology is crucial for individual growth and overall economic development.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]

""all he does is play on the computer all day long."" @CAPS6 is on increasing amount or teenagers throughout the @LOCATION1 who are playing on the computer too much. This needs to stop. ""@CAPS7 playing on computers is one of the worst things that they can do with their time."" @CAPS8 @PERSON1 of the international health committee. @CAPS6 are always going to be obese people around the world, but in the past @NUM1 years @LOCATION2 has doubled the amount of obese @CAPS7 in all of @LOCATION3."" @CAPS9 show that over @PERCENT1 of the American population is obese and very much so. The future of America is all obese lazy @CAPS7 who only want to sit down in front of a screen all day. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS7 who don't experience nature at a young age never fully appreciate it. Since they play on the computers all day, they don't ever use nature; they won't care for it and will litter and pollute even more. Just @CAPS7 playing on the computer can be very bad for the environment, like it is bad for themselves. Not only do the computers hurt the @CAPS7 and the environment, but it also hurts the family and friends. @CAPS7 who are on the computer all day aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. Families are supposed to be close, and they can't be if someone is playing on the computer all day. Just a couple of weeks ago, @PERSON2 Rayfield @CAPS8 that he got grounded because he was playing on the computer so much he didn't talk to his mom in two weeks. @PERCENT3 of people who get divorced do so because of arguments over the amount of time spent on the computer. ""@CAPS8 @PERSON3 from the Yale marriage research center. If @CAPS7 knew that they might cause their parents to divorce, they might stop playing on the computer so much. Therefore, @CAPS7 shouldn't spend that amount of time on their computer because of health, the environment, and their families. It's up to the people really, do you want a nice physically fit nation where every family is close, or a rundown obese hole in the wall that is ""called"" the @LOCATION4. Let's make better choices for ourselves, our families, and our environment by limiting our time on the computer and focusing on what truly matters."
74	74	1	3	I believe that computers have good effects on people. Computers allow individuals to stay connected with long-distance friends and family through emails, ensuring that they do not lose touch with their loved ones. Moreover, computers offer educational games for children, facilitating their learning process in a fun and interactive way. Additionally, computers enable people to expand their knowledge by providing access to information about various topics and current events worldwide. Overall, computers play a significant role in enhancing communication, education, and awareness, making them valuable tools in today's society.
75	75	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the past ten years, advances in technology have completely changed the world. Technology makes peoples lives much easier and helps keep more and more people connected throughout the world. More jobs are created and help speed up ordinary events such as taxes, messages, news, and teaching. However, many people have proven that too much use of technology can make teens and adults addicted to the internet. In this addiction many people can lose time with their family, time to exercise and enjoy nature. Since being part of the generation growing up in the new technology era, I have had a first hand experience with the benefits of the new technology.  I believe that this technology is a great help to society today. Many more jobs are being created because of this technology. For example, think about how many people could be employed if a new computer system was created. There would be thousands of people working on many things such as the founder, manager, creator of new ideas or just working at the new company's retail store. Running a business or a corporation is a very difficult job to do. But because of the advances in technology, running a business can become much easier and not as much time is wasted. With the new technology, people can send emails within seconds instead of running around the entire office giving out memos. Also for businesses, their stocks of the company can be updated every minute. These advances will make it easier to run and make them more efficient.  With the advances in technology average people can be updated on the news around the world every minute. Also when it comes time to pay taxes, fill them out and pay online. None the less, there is more entertainment open to everyone. Through today's new technology, people's lives are made much easier. They can work faster, get more errands accomplished, learn more, connect to people around the world, and be caught up with local and international news. Technology is benefiting society and will hopefully continue making life easier. The continual advancements in technology are shaping our world for the better, enhancing communication, efficiency, and connectivity on a global scale. The future holds great promise as technology continues to evolve and improve the way we live and work.
76	76	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my best friend, who was once a nerd with no hand-eye coordination, improved his skills by using a computer. This not only helped him with coordination but also allowed him to learn about different places and people. Millions of individuals have benefitted from the hand-eye coordination gained through computer use. It may take some time to master, but the benefits are worth it as it encourages outdoor activities. Moreover, computers provide a platform to gain knowledge about various subjects and communicate with people worldwide. A computer engineer mentioned that a large percentage of people learn about different cultures and locations through the internet. Using a computer has facilitated communication with friends and family who live far away. The convenience and cost-effectiveness of online communication make it a preferred method for staying connected. As someone who struggled with hand-eye coordination, I can attest to the positive impact of using a computer to learn and improve these skills. In conclusion, spending time on the internet is not wasteful if it leads to education and better communication.
77	77	1	3	Dear Newspaper, In today's world, we are heavily reliant on computers. Computers have become an indispensable technology that benefits society in numerous ways. They facilitate online communication, serve as educational tools, and enhance hand-eye coordination. The significance of computers in our lives cannot be overstated.  One of the key benefits of computers is their role in maintaining friendships. In the digital age, staying connected with friends who are far away has become easier thanks to platforms like social media and video calling. Personally, I have experienced this firsthand with a friend who moved to a different city. Despite the distance, we are able to keep in touch regularly through online messaging and video calls, strengthening our bond without incurring high costs.  Furthermore, computers have revolutionized the way we access information. They have surpassed traditional sources such as libraries and textbooks, providing a wealth of resources at our fingertips. Students, in particular, benefit greatly from the educational opportunities offered by computers. They can access textbooks, online tutorials, and homework assignments with ease, leading to improved academic performance.  Additionally, computers have proven to be valuable tools for enhancing hand-eye coordination. Many sports teams utilize computer games to improve their reaction times and coordination skills, leading to enhanced performance on the field. These games are not only effective but also fun and non-violent, making them accessible to a wide range of individuals looking to sharpen their skills.  In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of modern society, offering a multitude of benefits ranging from facilitating communication to enhancing educational opportunities and improving physical coordination. Their impact on our lives is undeniable, and their continued presence is essential for the advancement and well-being of individuals across the globe. It is clear that the benefits of computers far outweigh any potential drawbacks, making them an indispensable tool in today's world.
78	78	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion for using ""too much"" computer time is an outrage. I think people should have more ideas. Such as exercise, socialize with family and friends, and lastly, ""you time"" which means to do whatever you would like to do indoors BUT @CAPS2 computers.   For exercise, you can do any sport that you like outside. For @CAPS3 and spending time with family and friends, you can have a nice family reunion at their house @CAPS5 just ""hang out with your friends. For ""you time, you can draw, @CAPS5 read a book.   There are plenty of alternatives to using ""computer time @CAPS6 the time!"" Exercising, whether it's playing basketball, soccer, baseball, or even a game of hide and seek, is a great way to stay active and away from the computer.   Spending time with family and friends is also a wonderful way to connect and bond. Whether it's having a family dinner, playing board games like Monopoly, or going to the movies with friends, there are endless possibilities to enjoy quality time without relying on the computer.   Lastly, indulging in ""you time"" indoors can be a peaceful escape from technology. Whether you choose to draw, read a book, or pursue any other hobby, taking a break from the computer can lead to a more fulfilling and well-rounded lifestyle.  In conclusion, it's essential to find a balance between technology and other activities to lead a healthy and enriching life. By exploring various interests and spending time with loved ones, we can break away from excessive computer use and embrace a more vibrant and engaging way of living."
79	79	1	3	Computers have caused many people to lose money, friends, and time. Since the introduction of computers, a significant number of individuals have been spending excessive amounts of time on them, leading to negative consequences. This overreliance on technology has had a profound impact on society, affecting various aspects of people's lives.   One example of the detrimental effects of spending too much time on computers is the case of my older brother. When he was younger, he spent a considerable amount of time on the computer, which resulted in him neglecting other activities. However, once he redirected his focus towards sports like basketball and lacrosse, he excelled in these areas, ultimately saving my parents money that would have otherwise been spent on computer-related expenses.  Moreover, the prevalence of technology has led many individuals to squander valuable time that could have been utilized more productively. Instead of engaging in physical activities or social interactions, people often find themselves immersed in video games or browsing the internet for hours on end. This not only hinders personal growth but also limits opportunities for social connections and meaningful relationships.  In my own experience, I witnessed a friend become increasingly isolated due to his excessive computer usage. He prioritized screen time over our friendship, leading to a significant gap in our communication. It was only when he realized the negative impact of his behavior that he made an effort to rekindle our relationship and strike a balance between his virtual life and real-world interactions.  In light of these observations, it is essential to establish boundaries when it comes to computer usage. Setting limits on screen time can help individuals maintain a healthy balance between technology and other aspects of life. By being mindful of the potential consequences of excessive computer usage, we can avoid losing time, money, and valuable relationships. Ultimately, moderation is key in harnessing the benefits of technology without succumbing to its drawbacks.
80	80	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1 and I do not believe that computers are very beneficial to our society. Computers are not benefiting us because they are preventing many people from exercising and leading a healthy lifestyle, playing sports, and enjoying the outdoors. Nowadays, instead of hitting the gym, many people are at home on the computer, chatting with friends or playing computer games, which is leading to a decline in physical activity and overall health. Additionally, prolonged computer use can harm eyesight, resulting in an increase in the number of people needing glasses.  Moreover, the prevalence of sports video games and other electronic distractions, such as gaming consoles like Xbox, PlayStation, and others, is discouraging young people from actively participating in sports. Instead of putting in effort and dedication on the field, they are investing their time in virtual sports simulations on their devices. Parents, too, often encourage their children to spend hours on end playing video games or using the computer, further exacerbating the issue.  Many families are not as close-knit as they once were, and fewer families are engaging in outdoor activities together. Spending quality time outdoors, such as camping or fishing, can strengthen family bonds and create lasting memories. Encouraging fathers to take their sons on outdoor adventures can help them bond and create meaningful experiences away from the distractions of technology.  In conclusion, it is essential to recognize the negative impact that excessive computer use and electronic distractions can have on our physical health, participation in sports, and quality time spent outdoors with family. By promoting a balanced lifestyle that includes exercise, outdoor activities, and family bonding, we can strive towards a healthier and more fulfilling society. Thank you for considering these important points.
81	81	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that using computers is beneficial and does not hinder activities like exercising, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. There are several reasons to support this view. Firstly, the internet is a vast source of information, allowing people to learn new things every day. Websites like @ORGANIZATION1 provide valuable resources and images for various purposes. Secondly, students can conveniently access their homework assignments online, enabling them to plan their study schedule and still have time for other activities. Lastly, the internet plays a significant role in everyday life, providing essential information such as weather forecasts, helping individuals make informed decisions. In conclusion, using computers and the internet enhances learning, organization, and daily life without impeding personal interactions and outdoor activities.
82	82	1	3	I support computers because they help with writing, locking up information, and provide communication. One reason I support computers is because they help with writing. Computers can also help people with spelling and grammar. Another benefit of computers is the vast amount of information they provide, which is easily accessible. Finally, computers enhance communication through platforms like email and social media. Overall, computers are a valuable tool that benefits society in various ways.
83	83	1	3	Dear Newspaper Computers have been a great learning source and i think it's time we give them some cridit insted of worrying over them. I will be telling you about how I think computers are great. One reason they are vary helpful is that books dont always have all of the information. So if you need to know a fact or need more information for a project you can go on the computer and it's all right there and you will have known more facts then when you started. The second reason is that you can be almost anywhere and half acess to a computer and you might not have a phone but you can talk or send a message. Not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone. Another reason, is its not always sunny outside and when it is a rainy day you have a fun way to play and learn without having to be outside. The computer dosnt replace the outdores or exercising it is just a passtime when you dont have the oppertunity to be outside. I hope you liked and understod my reasons and will take them in to concideration when going over the topic.  Computers have indeed become an indispensable tool in today's world, offering a wealth of information and opportunities for communication.

Additionally, the convenience of being able to connect with others through a computer, even in the absence of a phone, highlights its importance as a communication device. Furthermore, on days when outdoor activities are limited, computers provide a valuable source of entertainment and education, ensuring that learning and fun can continue regardless of the weather. By recognizing the benefits that computers bring to our lives, we can better appreciate their role in enhancing our knowledge and connectivity.
84	84	1	3	Computers play a crucial role in assisting individuals in various aspects of their lives. They serve as a valuable tool for learning, providing access to information on a wide range of topics. For example, individuals can use computers to search for job opportunities, seek solutions to problems, or explore different places before making a decision. Additionally, computers enable people to connect with others, allowing for communication and interaction with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Moreover, computers offer entertainment in the form of online games, which can also serve as educational tools. Overall, computers are beneficial tools that provide valuable resources and opportunities for individuals in different aspects of their lives.
85	85	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Computers have long been a topic of debate regarding their impact on society. While some argue that they bring numerous benefits, others, like myself, believe that their negative effects outweigh the positives. One of the main concerns is the potential for addiction, which can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and health issues. Additionally, excessive computer use can lead to a lack of quality time spent with friends and family, causing emotional strain on relationships. Moreover, the safety risks associated with online interactions, such as chatting with strangers or sharing personal information, are a major concern. Considering these factors, it is evident that computers have a detrimental impact on society. In conclusion, the drawbacks of computer usage far outweigh any potential benefits, making it crucial for individuals to be mindful of their screen time and prioritize real-life interactions.
86	86	1	3	Dear Newspaper,   As computers continue to play a significant role in our daily lives, there is an ongoing debate regarding their impact on society. However, it is undeniable that computers have brought about numerous positive changes. One of the key benefits is the access to the vast world of information provided by the internet. Education Secretary, @PERSON1, highlighted the importance of the internet in schools, emphasizing how it enhances the learning experience by providing limitless resources. Additionally, search engines enable users to explore a myriad of information-rich websites, expanding their knowledge and understanding of various subjects.   Moreover, computers have revolutionized socialization by breaking down geographical barriers. Through webcams and instant messaging, individuals can easily connect with friends and family members, regardless of their location. This has facilitated seamless communication and strengthened relationships, fostering a sense of closeness in an increasingly globalized world.   Furthermore, simulations on computers have proven to be invaluable in various fields, such as medicine and education. Medical schools utilize surgery simulations to train future doctors, enhancing their skills and expertise. Additionally, educational games and simulations engage users in interactive learning experiences, making education more enjoyable and effective.   In conclusion, the benefits of computers, including access to information, enhanced socialization, and innovative simulations, have greatly enriched our lives. Embracing technology and harnessing its potential can lead to a brighter, more connected future for all. The positive impact of computers on society is undeniable, and it is essential to recognize and appreciate the numerous advantages they bring to our everyday lives.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]
87	87	1	3	Computers can be a double-edged sword in our modern society. While they offer a wealth of information and connectivity, they also present numerous distractions that can have detrimental effects on individuals. Take the case of @PERSON2, who became addicted to Facebook and saw her academic performance suffer as a result. Similarly, @PERSON1's excessive gaming habit not only alienated him from his family but also exposed him to inappropriate content online. Despite the argument that computers provide access to valuable information, such knowledge can often be obtained through traditional means like books and libraries without the risk of excessive screen time and its associated health issues. In conclusion, the distractions posed by computers can outweigh their benefits, and it is essential for individuals to exercise moderation and self-discipline when using these devices in order to maintain a healthy balance in their lives.
88	88	1	3	"Dear Newspaper,   ""I forgot the definition to this homework problem and I don't have my notes. Now, in this situation a computer would be very helpful to just type in the word and get a whole bunch of results. This is why I believe having access to a computer at all times is very helpful because you can find information that you've been needing. You can get in touch with a friend if you need to or just to talk to mostly if you are just sitting around and having nothing to do you can just go on the computer and discover things you may not have known. Having access to a computer is really helpful because if you're just having a conversation with someone and you forget a name or an important fact you want to tell them, you can always just look it up. For me, a lot of the times I just need information about maybe a sports player or facts about a famous event. Since our technology is so up to date, the computer is right there with many helpful facts we would like to know. Friends are a big part of my life and I love just talking to them and seeing how they are doing. Again, our technology is so advanced now that there are a bunch of websites where we can talk and see how we are doing. A big reason why being able to talk to friends and family is helpful is for talking to people that are very far away and the ones you don't normally see. On a computer, you can talk to people from not only all over the USA but even in other countries! Finally, the times I find having a computer around me most helpful is when I am just bored with nothing to do! I can just visit a whole bunch of educational websites on things I have learned in school or wanted to learn. On the internet, there are many things to keep you occupied like games or you can even watch movies from your home on the computer! If you have a computer around your house, you should not be bored because there are many things you can be doing or even learning! Having a computer around your house is so helpful, you can have fun but you're even learning how to be good with technology at the same time. Computers are the future and it's a good one. So I suggest you pick one up and just have a blast, you won't be sorry.  In today's fast-paced world, having access to a computer can truly make a difference in our daily lives. From finding information quickly to staying connected with friends and family, the benefits of having a computer at our fingertips are endless. Not only can we stay entertained and occupied, but we can also continue to learn and grow with the vast resources available online. Embracing technology and the opportunities it provides is essential for navigating the modern world. So, why not make the most of it and enjoy all the wonders a computer can bring into your life?"
89	89	1	3	Computers have significantly benefited society by changing the way we interact and access information. The internet, a product of computer technology, has revolutionized communication and made the world a more connected place. Through the internet, people can play games, chat with others from different parts of the world, and research various topics.   Chatting, in particular, has become a popular way to socialize and connect with others. It allows individuals to communicate in real-time, regardless of their physical location. This feature has made it easier for people to stay in touch with friends and family, as well as meet new people with shared interests.  Moreover, computers have also played a crucial role in law enforcement and research. Law enforcement agencies use computers to track criminals and solve crimes, while researchers rely on computers to gather and analyze data for scientific studies. Additionally, parents can use computers to plan family vacations by researching destinations and booking accommodations.  Overall, the computer has become an indispensable tool that benefits society in numerous ways. It has transformed the way we live, work, and communicate, making the world a more interconnected and efficient place. The impact of computers on society will continue to grow as technology advances and new possibilities emerge.

Computers offer a wide range of benefits, such as providing quick access to information and facilitating communication with others.   Using a computer allows individuals to conduct research, complete work tasks efficiently, and stay connected with friends and family online. The convenience and versatility of computers make them an essential tool in today's fast-paced world.

In conclusion, computers are a valuable resource that can have a positive impact on people's lives. By utilizing this technology effectively, individuals can enhance their productivity, communication, and overall well-being.

91	91	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think computers are great. They are incredibly helpful in various aspects of our lives. One of the main advantages of computers is their ability to provide easy access to information. Whether it's for school research or simply looking up a recipe, the internet offers a vast amount of knowledge at our fingertips. In fact, many students now prefer using online textbooks over traditional ones, showing the convenience and efficiency of digital resources.  Moreover, computers can also be valuable educational tools. With interactive math games and educational websites, students can enhance their learning experience in a fun and engaging way. Additionally, the internet can serve as a platform for teachers to share resources and assignments, making it easier for students to stay organized and on top of their tasks.  Beyond academics, computers offer a plethora of entertainment options. From online games to social media platforms, there is no shortage of ways to have fun and connect with others online. This not only provides a source of enjoyment but also helps pass the time on days when going outside is not an option.  Overall, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering convenience, education, and entertainment. With their endless possibilities, it's no wonder that they have become such an essential tool for people of all ages.
92	92	1	3	Dear local Newspaper,  Computers have undoubtedly become an essential tool in our daily lives, offering various benefits to individuals of all ages. One significant advantage of computers is their ability to teach valuable skills, such as typing. Learning how to type efficiently can greatly enhance one's productivity and open up opportunities in various professions that require fast and accurate typing skills. For instance, my experience in grade school with a typing program helped me develop essential typing skills that I continue to use in my academic and personal endeavors.  Furthermore, computers serve as invaluable resources for research and information gathering. Whether it's exploring the lives of famous personalities, studying different states and countries, or delving into various subjects for school projects, computers provide a wealth of information at our fingertips. The convenience of accessing vast amounts of information online has revolutionized the way we learn and explore the world around us.  Moreover, computers facilitate communication and social interaction, especially in today's digital age. Platforms like email, social media, and messaging apps enable individuals to stay connected with friends, family, and peers, even when physical distance separates them. Personally, I have experienced the joy of maintaining relationships with loved ones through online communication channels, underscoring the positive impact of computers on fostering connections and building relationships.  In conclusion, the positive effects of computers on people are undeniable. From enhancing essential skills like typing to providing access to a wealth of information and enabling seamless communication, computers play a vital role in modern society.

Sincerely, [Your Name]
93	93	1	3	"Readers of ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" should be well informed of the benefits of computers to society. Not only do they teach hand-eye coordination, but they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and provide a means for easy, online communication. In this day and age, good coordination is essential to prospering in society. Using computers provides a method of both establishing and improving hand-eye coordination from the comfort of your own household or workplace. Dr. @DR1, of @ORGANIZATION1 medical center, says that a recent study shows that out of every 100 computer users, 75 have better hand-eye coordination than people who do not operate a computer regularly. In a local primary school, students have begun to ""type to learn,"" a program that promotes quick typing. School officials have seen a dramatic increase in the typing speed of children since the program was started in the last year. In this way, the computer provides a secure route to better hand-eye coordination.  Even more importantly, the hand-eye coordination gained from using a computer can increase the chances of getting a job involving computer hand-eye coordination as an adult, such as the position of a secretary or graphic designer. While hand-eye coordination is a factor of computers that has an extremely positive effect on people, the ability to learn about distant places with the touch of a keyboard is even more beneficial for all users. Websites such as Google and Yahoo can track down millions of results in a matter of seconds if you search the name of a city or country. This can be handy when working on school projects; instead of having to lug tens of books home to finish an essay on @LOCATION1, you can simply look up the information on a computer at your house. When summertime comes around, and the last school bell rings, you can instead research faraway places that could turn into vacation spots instead of homework assignments. All of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer. If ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" readers were aware of this, lots of trouble would be prevented and lots of time would be saved.  The one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication. State officials, governors, and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while they check the weather or their email. This is a much easier way to hear government statements than waiting through endless commercials to hear speeches on the news. Social networking sites are also immensely popular, and on pages like Facebook and Twitter, you can reconnect with people whom you don't have the chance to see every day or who don't live in relative vicinity. If your cousin is going to school abroad and does not have access to an international phone, you could communicate with them through email on the computer, and it would be as if they never left. It is ridiculous to think that someone could find computers - the gateway to faraway places, good hand-eye coordination, and the connection to distant friends and family - a concern to society. They help in countless ways, and ""@CAPS5 @CAPS1"" readers should be aware of this."
94	94	1	3	Dear Newspaper people, I'm here to tell you that computers have a bad effect on people. The computer holds lots of information, but does it always hold the right information? You could do many other things than laying on the computer. Also, the computer is very distracting and can lead to procrastination. Computers may provide incorrect information, and the process of finding information on a computer can sometimes take longer than using a book.   Books are often more reliable sources of information and can be accessed more quickly than computers. In addition, computers can overwhelm users with excessive information, making it difficult to sift through and find what is truly needed. Instead of spending time on the computer, there are plenty of other activities to engage in, such as reading a book, drawing, playing outside, or spending time with friends.  Furthermore, the temptation of using a computer for non-work-related activities can lead to distractions in the workplace. It is easy to veer off task when a computer is readily available. Additionally, the ease of access to various websites and social media platforms can further contribute to a lack of productivity.  In conclusion, computers have indeed made a significant impact on everyday life, but it is important to recognize the negative effects they can have on individuals. From providing potentially incorrect information to being a source of distraction, computers can hinder productivity and lead to a decrease in real-life interactions. It is essential to find a balance in using technology and engage in other fulfilling activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
95	95	1	3	Although some people believe that computers turn us children into zombies, I believe that they affect us in a positive way. Computers can help us explore faraway places that we may never go to, connect with old friends, and provide assistance with homework. One reason why I think computers are beneficial is that they help us explore other places. Many children dream of visiting certain locations, but not everyone can afford to travel. With access to the internet through computers, kids can learn about different places and expand their knowledge. For example, a student from a local school mentioned using the internet to discover fascinating facts about a place they have always wanted to visit but couldn't due to financial constraints. This shows how computers can help individuals realize their dreams. Additionally, computers help in connecting with friends who are far away. By utilizing communication tools like video calls and messaging apps, individuals can stay in touch with loved ones regardless of their location. This is particularly beneficial for people like me, who have friends living in distant places. With the help of technology, maintaining relationships becomes easier and more convenient. Furthermore, computers can assist students with their homework. Whether it's solving math problems or researching information for a school project, computers offer various tools and resources to enhance learning. Many computers come equipped with software such as calculators, and those without can easily download programs to aid in their academic endeavors. With internet access, students can find answers to their questions and improve their understanding of different subjects. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing our lives by helping us explore, connect, and learn. Rather than turning us into zombies, computers empower us to achieve our goals, stay connected with others, and succeed in our academic pursuits. So, the next time you turn on your computer, remember the endless possibilities it offers for personal growth and development.
96	96	1	3	The use of computers is definitely correct. It is helpful, as you can discover new things and much more. Computers make people's lives so much simpler. They can assist in magnificent ways by searching for information you desperately need. For instance, as a student, if you had to write a paper on a specific topic, the computer with internet access can provide you with a plethora of facts and information. It can also help by checking the weather, news updates, happenings around the world, and answering any questions you may have. Discovering new things on the computer is a daily occurrence. For example, reading an article on a particular subject one day and being tested on it the next can showcase the benefits of using a computer. If a computer can help someone achieve a high score on a test, imagine the other positive impacts it can have on the world, such as potentially saving lives. Computers can be beneficial in various ways, from checking sports scores and staying informed about your community to watching videos, listening to music, communicating with friends and family, obtaining information on different topics, and even accessing medical resources. Essentially, a computer can assist with everything from entertainment to critical tasks, making it an invaluable tool in our lives.
97	97	1	3	Dear Local @CAPS1, I believe that computers play a crucial role in benefiting society in various ways. One of the primary advantages of computers is their ability to facilitate communication. Whether it's sending emails for business purposes or staying connected with friends and family through social media platforms like Facebook, computers have revolutionized how we interact with one another. Additionally, the internet serves as a vast source of information, making research more accessible and efficient. Instead of spending hours in libraries searching for relevant data, we can now quickly find what we need online.  While some may argue that people are spending too much time on computers, it's essential to recognize the positive aspects as well. For instance, technology has enabled us to engage in physical activities through interactive games and fitness apps, promoting a healthy lifestyle. Like any tool, it's all about finding the right balance and using computers responsibly.  Overall, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, enhancing communication, information-sharing, and even entertainment. By leveraging the benefits of technology while being mindful of its potential drawbacks, we can continue to enjoy the many advantages that computers bring to society.
98	98	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In this new digital age, computers are becoming more advanced, offering endless possibilities. However, despite the benefits they bring, there are also negative consequences associated with their use. Computers have the power to connect us with people worldwide, provide endless information, and offer convenience in various aspects of our lives. Yet, this convenience can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to health issues such as obesity. Excessive time spent online can also result in social isolation, as real-life interactions are replaced by virtual ones. Moreover, the virtual world can become a dangerous escape, leading individuals to prioritize their online personas over their real selves.  The rise of online gaming and social media platforms has created a new realm where people can get lost in a false reality, neglecting their responsibilities and relationships. The addictive nature of these platforms can have detrimental effects on mental health and overall well-being. Cyberbullying and online harassment have become prevalent issues, causing irreparable harm to individuals. The anonymity provided by the internet can embolden individuals to engage in harmful behavior without facing consequences.  Furthermore, the risk of identity theft and fraud is a growing concern in the digital age. Personal information can be easily accessed and exploited, leading to financial loss and reputational damage. The consequences of online actions can have long-lasting effects on individuals, impacting their lives both online and offline.  While computers offer countless benefits, it is crucial to approach their use with caution and moderation. Balancing screen time with real-world experiences is essential to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and strong social connections. It is important to recognize the potential dangers of excessive computer use and take steps to protect oneself and others from harm. By being mindful of our online activities and prioritizing real-life interactions, we can harness the power of computers for good while minimizing the negative impact on society.  In conclusion, while computers have revolutionized the way we live and work, they also pose risks that must be addressed. By promoting responsible and balanced computer use, we can mitigate the negative consequences and ensure that technology remains a force for good in our society.
99	99	1	3	Dear @CAPS1: Have you been sent a photo of a @NUM1 year old child with no clothes on? Well, if you have, this is called sexting. It can be done on the computer or any type of device.

Let's work together to make @LOCATION1 a safer place for our children.
100	100	1	3	Dear local newspaper, do you know how long people spend on the computer each day? It's time to step away from the screen and enjoy the outdoors. One reason for reducing computer time is the impact on eyesight. Staring at screens for extended periods can be harmful. Additionally, spending too much time indoors means missing out on beautiful sunny days. Many kids spend hours on the computer without taking breaks or getting exercise. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to weight gain and health issues. Moreover, excessive screen time can worsen eyesight. If not careful, prolonged computer use can strain the eyes. It's essential to balance screen time with outdoor activities to protect our eyes and overall well-being. Remember, there's a whole world outside waiting to be explored. So, put down the devices and go outside to enjoy the sunshine and fresh air. Your eyes and body will thank you for it.

But atleast you went to @ORGANIZATION1, or @LOCATION1 or somewhere. There are some people who are on the computer all day. Instead of experiencing nature and taken on @CAPS1 life brings to them, they are on facebook or youtube all day. This disgusts me because there are many fun, beautiful, and entertainings things to do. In @CAPS2 opinion I think computers have negative effects on people. People miss out on enjoying nature or interacting with friends and family. Some people do not get exercise anymore and it hurts to see obese people just sit ther and do nothing about there lives. First I'd like to talk about obesity. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children are obese at young a young age? Computers take the place of exercising for a young boy or girl. They should go outside and play sports like basketball or soccer. Another thing is those game websites. Children get so caught up in a computer game, everything around them just disappears. All they worry about is winning the game. While playing this game they might eating doritos. Sooner or later five pounds is gained. Then they will regret not exercising and not be able to move. Later in life, when things are bad for them, they will realized on how many fantastic things they missed. Then they will say ""@CAPS1 did I do with @CAPS2 life?"" @CAPS2 next point shows that people are not enjoying nature. Have you ever taken a nice walk in the park? I know I have. Well people sit inside all day just taking a peek out the window, but don't think about going outside. Nature is beautiful, smells nice, even refreshing at times. But no. People sit on there butt all day. On the computer accomplishing absolutely nothing. Why can't they go outsite for a walk or a jog? People can see animals like squirrels climbing up a tree. How cute. But instead they play a virtual game where you shoot squirrels with a paint ball gun. So much is missed because of computers. As much as not enjoying nature upsets me, some people blow off their own family just to watch a re-run of family guy on youtube. @CAPS1 have we come to? Some children hit their parents because the parents shut the computer off. I'd rather enjoy a meal with @CAPS2 family and then just sit down, relax, and talk. Also some people don't get sleep becuse they are ""doing something important"" and miss a family trip or even school. In conclusion I believe that computers are bad because of obesity, missing nature, not enjoying company of family & friends, and hindering social interactions. It is essential for individuals to strike a balance between technology and real-world experiences to lead fulfilling and healthy lives."
102	102	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,   Experts should not be overly concerned about individuals spending extended periods on the computer. It is possible that these individuals have valid reasons for their screen time, such as learning new information or engaging in important communication. Trying to limit people's time on the computer may not always be necessary or beneficial.   One significant benefit of spending time on the computer is the ability to chat with friends and family. Online communication can be essential for maintaining relationships, especially in emergencies where quick contact is crucial. Additionally, approximately 90% of people engage in online chats with loved ones, highlighting the importance of this form of communication.   Furthermore, the computer allows individuals to access a wealth of information quickly and easily. This can be particularly helpful for educational purposes, as it enables individuals to learn new things and expand their knowledge. The positive impact of acquiring new information cannot be understated, making computer use a valuable tool for personal growth.   Moreover, using the computer can improve hand-eye coordination and provide insight into distant places and cultures. By exploring the vast resources available online, individuals can broaden their horizons and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. The internet offers a window to virtually any place or person of interest, making it a valuable educational tool.   In conclusion, there are numerous constructive ways to utilize the computer, and spending time on it should not automatically be deemed unproductive. From communication to learning opportunities, the computer can enhance various aspects of one's life. Rather than discouraging computer use, it is essential to recognize its potential for personal growth and enrichment.   Thank you.
103	103	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever been running late to a party and just realize you don't have the directions to the person's house? Have you ever had to write a paper and there wen't any books or encyclopedias available? Or have you ever just wanted to catch up with an old friend? If you answered yes to at least one of these questions, there is a good chance you have used a computer in your lifetime. Computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable information and they can be fun too. To begin with, let's go back to that example in the paragraph above. Have you ever been running late to a party and realize you do not have the direction's to the person's house? If you have, there are two things you can do in that situation. You can call up the person who probably won't answer because they're having fun at their party, or you can go on the computer, type the person's address in and you will have your directions in seconds. Call me crazy, but this way seems quicker, more efficient, and reliable. My mother always says to me, ""If you're having trouble finding information, go on the computer,"" because she knows that there is all the information in books on the internet, and more. And it's just one click away. I'm sold that the computer has positive effects on you because it gives you quick and reliable information. In addition, computers have positive effects on you when you're trying to have fun. For example, social media. Social media is used by teens and adults alike, and for one reason only, to socialize with friends via computer. Instead of waiting to see what your last friend's up to, the best thing to do would be to go on social media and ask. A study shows that in a family of five, four of them use the internet to communicate and socialize with friends. Obviously, this is how computers have a positive effect. In conclusion, whether you're bored at home on a rainy day, or you have to write a research paper you saved until the last minute, a computer will be there for you. The positive effects computers have are that they are quick and reliable, and they are fun to use."
104	104	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has been a debate on whether computers have a positive effect on people. Some argue that computers have negative impacts, such as excessive screen time, lack of physical activity, and reduced social interactions. However, I believe that computers actually have a positive influence on individuals. They help improve hand-eye coordination, provide access to information about distant places, and facilitate online communication. In conclusion, computers play a beneficial role in people's lives.  Hand-eye coordination is a valuable skill that can be honed through computer use. Whether typing quickly without looking at the keyboard in emergencies, taking efficient notes in college, or reacting swiftly in critical situations, this ability is essential and can be developed through regular computer interaction.  Moreover, computers allow individuals to explore and learn about faraway locations. By simply searching online, one can discover new cultures, languages, and cuisines without leaving their home. This access to information broadens one's horizons and fosters a sense of global awareness.  Additionally, computers enable people to communicate with others online, regardless of physical distance. Whether sending emails, chatting through messaging apps, or engaging in video calls, technology facilitates connections and relationships with friends, family, and even strangers around the world.  In summary, computers have a positive impact on individuals by enhancing hand-eye coordination, expanding knowledge about different places, and facilitating online communication. Despite the criticisms, the benefits of computer usage outweigh the drawbacks, ultimately enriching people's lives in various ways.
105	105	1	3	Computers are indispensable in our daily lives, serving various essential functions. They facilitate travel planning by providing information on distances, costs, and attractions. Additionally, computers enable communication with old friends and the opportunity to meet new people. In times of stress or forgetfulness, computers come to the rescue by assisting with schoolwork or work projects. The reliance on computers is evident, with a significant portion of the population using them regularly. Without computers, our society would face significant challenges. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in modern life, offering convenience, connectivity, and efficiency that benefit individuals and society as a whole.

In such moments, we are reminded of the crucial role that computers play in our lives, making tasks more efficient and convenient. While there are debates about the impact of technology on our lives, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people for several reasons.  First and foremost, computers facilitate communication and help us stay connected with our loved ones. Through emails and social networking sites like Facebook, families can easily keep in touch regardless of physical distance. Sharing photos and updates online allows for a sense of closeness and involvement in each other's lives, enhancing relationships and fostering connections.  Additionally, computers serve as valuable educational tools, teaching users essential skills such as hand-eye coordination and providing access to a wealth of information. By staying updated on current events and global news through the internet, individuals can broaden their knowledge and awareness of the world around them, promoting continuous learning and growth.  Furthermore, computers are efficient for work purposes and contribute to environmental sustainability. The shift towards digital communication reduces the need for paper consumption, benefiting the environment by minimizing waste and resource usage. From creating presentations to organizing data, computers streamline tasks and improve productivity in various professional settings.  In conclusion, the positive impact of computers on people is undeniable. They enable communication, foster learning, enhance work efficiency, and promote environmental responsibility. Embracing technology and incorporating it into our daily lives can lead to greater connectivity, knowledge, and sustainability. So next time your computer crashes, remember the countless ways in which it enhances and simplifies your life.
108	108	1	3	I saw in one of the newspapers I received in the mail that there was an overnight for people to express their opinions on kids' computer usage. I took the opportunity to write this letter. Many people, both kids and adults, have to use computers for various reasons such as homework assignments, staying in touch with family members who are deployed in the military, and applying for jobs online.   Firstly, kids often need to use computers for homework assignments, particularly for tasks like essays. It may not always be possible for them to stay after school to complete these assignments, and school computers often have restrictions on which websites can be accessed. This makes it necessary for kids to have access to computers at home.  Secondly, family members who are serving in the military may not have access to their cellphones for security reasons. In such cases, being able to communicate with them through computers becomes crucial. Video calls and messages over the internet provide a way for families to stay connected despite the distance.  Lastly, online job applications have become increasingly common, offering opportunities for people who may be homebound or unable to attend in-person interviews. This accessibility allows individuals to explore job options and even start their own businesses, providing a source of income without leaving their homes.  In conclusion, computer usage for kids and adults goes beyond mere entertainment; it serves practical purposes like education, communication with loved ones, and job opportunities. It is essential for individuals to have access to computers for various activities that contribute to their personal and professional growth.
109	109	1	3	Dear editor, my name is @PERSON1, and I believe that computers are a benefit to the world, and people as well. I say this because lots of people can talk to family or friends long distance. Also, the computer can teach you many things. Finally, it makes you more social. In my strong opinion, computers are better for the world.  Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family or friends using computers. With webcams, you can chat and see the person you are talking to, making the conversation more personal. Social networking sites like @CAPS2 allow for easy communication, sharing of photos and videos, all at no cost, unlike traditional phone plans. This accessibility enhances relationships and keeps people connected regardless of physical distance.  Secondly, computers are valuable tools for learning. Various educational programs help individuals develop essential skills such as typing and reading. Programs like 'type to learn' or 'type for fun' make typing practice enjoyable, while reading programs enhance literacy skills. This knowledge gained from computers proves beneficial for personal and professional growth in the long run.  Furthermore, computers foster social interactions. Platforms like @CAPS2 enable users to stay updated on events in and out of school, facilitating communication with peers. Email and messaging services allow for easy conversations, connecting individuals globally. Building relationships with people from different backgrounds enhances social skills and broadens perspectives.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in enhancing communication, learning, and socialization. Their impact on individuals and society is undeniable, making them indispensable tools for personal and professional development. In my view, having a computer is not just a good idea but a necessity in today's interconnected world.
110	110	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers are good for society because they offer various benefits. One of the advantages is the ability to access the latest news online for free, saving both money and trees compared to traditional newspapers. Additionally, computers enable fast and convenient communication through email, allowing people to stay connected with friends and family around the world. Furthermore, computers provide entertainment opportunities such as playing games, watching videos, and streaming movies. Overall, computers play a significant role in providing news, communication, and entertainment to individuals, showcasing their positive impact on society.
111	111	1	3	Judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment, quoted from my uncle's dad. Computers haven't been around all that long for the public, so the public has little experience. Therefore, the public also lacks good judgment in using computers, and the detrimental effects are starting to show. Computers have caused damage to people!  To begin with, computers can be a health issue for people. In studies in New York, 8 out of 10 individuals who spend their time (3 or more hours) are wearing glasses due to the bad effects the screen has on their eyes. Furthermore, computer games are made to be addicting, causing individuals to sit in front of the computer instead of exercising, potentially leading to obesity. For example, my little brother used to be addicted to a flying game, and he started gaining weight. However, once he reduced his screen time and went outside more, he started losing weight.  Moreover, computers have detrimental effects on the environment. They require electricity to run, which often comes from power plants that burn fossil fuels. This contributes to global warming and can lead to the release of pollutants that cause acid rain. Additionally, excessive computer usage can lead to a lack of essential life skills, as individuals may prioritize screen time over learning basic tasks like cooking or lighting a match. In a school survey, students who spent more than 4 hours a day on their computers lacked these basic skills.  In conclusion, it is crucial for people to reduce their time spent on computers to maintain their health, protect the environment, and preserve essential life skills. We must come together to address this issue and ensure a healthier, more sustainable future for ourselves and our planet. Let's make a conscious effort to prioritize our well-being and the well-being of the world around us.
112	112	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are encouraging kids to spend more time outdoors instead of being glued to a computer screen. It is true that excessive computer use can lead to unhealthy habits and less interaction with friends and family. While computers can be useful for educational purposes, it is important to limit their use and prioritize physical activity.   I personally try to minimize my computer usage to only essential tasks such as schoolwork or research. Instead of relying on the internet for exercise plans, I prefer to go to the gym or participate in activities like swimming. Physical exercise not only helps in staying fit but also has positive effects on mental well-being.  Moreover, the internet can be a platform for cyberbullying and inappropriate content, which can have detrimental effects on individuals. It is crucial to be mindful of what we share online and to seek more meaningful interactions with others in person. Face-to-face communication with friends and family is invaluable and cannot be replaced by virtual interactions.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is essential to maintain a balance and prioritize real-life experiences over virtual ones. By limiting screen time and engaging in physical activities, we can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives. Let's not let computers take over our world and instead focus on building genuine connections with those around us.
113	113	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 paper, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I am writing this letter regarding the issue of computer usage. @CAPS2 perspective on this matter differs from the common belief. People nowadays tend to spend more time on computers than engaging in physical exercise, yet they can still maintain social interactions through online platforms. Additionally, the notion that individuals are not enjoying the outdoors is refuted by the prevalence of laptops that allow people to take their digital activities outside. Moreover, computer usage can enhance creativity and imagination through various games and simulators.  While experts argue that excessive computer usage leads to a decrease in face-to-face interactions with friends and family, it is important to recognize that online communication platforms such as social media, forums, and chat rooms enable individuals to stay connected and engage socially. Although this form of interaction may not be physical, it still fosters communication and relationships, demonstrating that being social is not limited to offline interactions.  Furthermore, the idea that people are not enjoying the outdoors due to excessive computer usage overlooks the portability of laptops. With the ability to take laptops outside, individuals can enjoy the sunshine, fresh air, and nature while still engaging in digital activities. This flexibility allows for a balance between screen time and outdoor experiences, challenging the notion that computer usage hinders outdoor enjoyment.  In addition, computer games and simulators can spark creativity and expand imagination. By immersing oneself in virtual worlds and problem-solving scenarios, individuals can enhance their cognitive abilities and explore new ideas. Games that involve customization and role-playing can also inspire artistic expression and innovation, providing a platform for creative exploration.  In conclusion, while it is important to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of excessive computer usage, such as reduced physical activity and outdoor engagement, it is equally important to recognize the positive aspects of technology. Computers offer avenues for social interaction, outdoor enjoyment, and creative stimulation, demonstrating that a balanced approach to technology usage can lead to a fulfilling and enriching lifestyle. It is essential to leverage the benefits of computers while also prioritizing physical activity, outdoor experiences, and face-to-face interactions for a well-rounded and healthy lifestyle.   Sincerely, @PERSON1

118	118	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, as our technology advances, so do our lives. Computers play a crucial role in enhancing our way of life, benefiting us and future generations. They offer us the opportunity to learn about different cultures, connect with people worldwide, and express ourselves in ways that were previously unimaginable.   With the use of computers, we can explore the world beyond our local surroundings. This opens up a whole new perspective on life, allowing us to broaden our horizons and gain a better understanding of diverse cultures. By delving into various topics and engaging with different ways of life, we can expand our knowledge and connect with people from all corners of the globe.

119	119	1	3	Dear People of @LOCATION2, how many hours a day do you spend being active? And how much time do you spend on your computer? It is concerning to see that many individuals are spending excessive amounts of time sitting in front of screens, neglecting physical activity. Computers have become a central part of our lives, but they are also causing harm to our social skills, health, and overall well-being.   One of the negative effects of excessive computer use is the decline in face-to-face interactions. With the rise of social media platforms and online communication tools, people are opting to connect virtually rather than making the effort to meet in person. This lack of personal interaction can lead to feelings of isolation and detachment from the real world.  Moreover, prolonged periods of sitting in front of a computer can have detrimental effects on our physical health. Fresh air and physical activity are essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Imagine the difference between taking a leisurely walk in nature, feeling invigorated by the crisp air, versus being hunched over a computer, feeling fatigued and achy. Regular exercise is crucial for our well-being, and it is important to prioritize physical activity over sedentary screen time.  In conclusion, it is evident that excessive computer use is impacting our social lives, health, and overall lifestyle. It is time to break free from the confines of screens and embrace a more active and engaging way of living. Let's turn off the computer, step outside, and prioritize our well-being. It's time to make a change for the better and lead a more fulfilling and healthy life.

122	122	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, 85% in town use the computer for at least five hours each day. The people are spending way too much time and not benefiting. Computers have an effect on people but in a negative way. People get adicted and distracted and can't get work done. Many inappropriate things are written in computers that children and adults shouldn't read. Lastly people stare at a computer screen all day which can cause brain damage. Effects from computers can be very negative and not beneficial at all.  With children at school and adults at jobs, there is most likely a lot of work to get done, but computers should make a person not get the work done. The other day in class the teacher was collecting homework, but 5 out of the 20 kids in our class didn't have the homework. When the teacher asked why the kids didn't do their homework, they said that they were on the computer and forgot about the homework. When the children and adults don't get their work done then grades could be dropped, or people could get fired. The effect is very harmful, and all this happened just because of the adiction and distraction of computers.  Since some internet sources are very social, and not all people are kind, mean and inappropriate articles and language could be read. Many children don't know a lot of bad words and certainly no one wants them to be exposed to learning more, so why let them go on the computer and read about these bad things? Adults may know more about the harmful language, but why influence them to write the bad things or comment using mean tones. If adults and children aren't exposed to these bad uses of language then our world could easily be made up of better and kinder people.  Studies show that if a person stares at a computer screen for at least three hours a day, then in about two weeks time the person brain could be damaged. The screen of the computer in some way with the human brain and if stared at for too long the screen could permenately damage the brain. A student, who studies computer mechanics, quoted, ""Help prevent brain damage by limiting the use of computers to only what needs to be done. The mechanics to make the computer screen are not healthy for you!"" Who wants to have a damaged brain? Surely this effect could be very serious.  So, in the end people should know that computers are not benefiticial. Computers effect people for sure, but not in a way that people would want to be effected. Adiction and distraction from the computer could cause important work to be ignored. Children and adults do not need to learn or be influenced by inappropriate language on the computer. Brain damage could be a serious problem that could be caused by something as simple as looking at a computer screen. Try to prevent all these negative effects by limiting the use of your computer. It is very easy to stay clear of any negative effects but it is your choice whether to do so or not. In conclusion, it is important to be mindful of the negative impacts excessive computer use can have on individuals and take steps to limit exposure to mitigate potential harm."
123	123	1	3	Everywhere you look, people are using computers. Just about everyone has one. Some say that computers are bad for you, but they can really benefit society. Computers are used for research, socializing, and almost all of our work is done on computers. One of the main things that computers provide is research information. If you want to find out anything, you can find it on the internet. It is an efficient way to study or find information for school. Before the internet and computers, it would take weeks to find enough information for a paper or business work. This was because all information was found in books. Books did not always give you the information you needed; whatever was written was all you got. Because of search engines and websites, you can type in whatever you want to look up. It is much easier to log onto a computer and type in a question than search an entire book to find an answer. Computers are the best way to research a topic. Computers are also used to socialize. You can chat with almost anyone on the internet. Being social is one of the most important parts of life. It has been proven by science that social people live longer than people who never talk to anyone. The person you're talking to phones only give you audio and that doesn't give you the same thing. Video chat can allow you to show someone a picture or an expression. Computers allow you to see people that you can't see otherwise. For example, if you have a relative that lives far away and you can't see him or her, you can see them through video that socializing through computers is one of the best ways to talk to people. Our work is mainly run on computers. Without them, it would be very difficult to be aware of an oncoming attack or threat. The @CAPS1 uses computers to store their legal files of court cases, laws, etc. It is much easier to transfer files digitally than actually sending a paper copy. The stock market is also run on computers. You need them to see how you are doing financially; computers are essential to our @CAPS1 and economy. Although some experts say that computers do us no good, computers benefit our society very much. They help us research, socialize, and they help our @CAPS1 and economy. Computers are essential to our way of life. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in modern society, enabling efficient research, socialization, and essential functions within various sectors, ultimately proving to be indispensable tools in our daily lives.
124	124	1	3	Computers have become an essential tool in today's society due to their versatility and convenience. They allow for easy communication with others, whether through email, social media, or video calls. Additionally, computers provide access to a wealth of information on the internet, making research and learning more accessible than ever before. They are also used for entertainment purposes, such as playing games or watching videos.  Furthermore, computers are invaluable in the workplace, enabling individuals to complete tasks efficiently and effectively. They are essential for tasks such as word processing, data analysis, and communication. In educational settings, computers are used for assignments, research, and presentations, enhancing the learning experience for students.  Overall, computers have revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. Their impact is undeniable, and their importance in our daily lives continues to grow. Whether for work, education, entertainment, or communication, computers play a crucial role in modern society.
125	125	1	3	Computers play a crucial role in children's lives, offering assistance in various academic tasks like writing essays, conducting research for social studies or science homework, and facilitating communication. Rather than being a source of addiction, computers are valuable tools that provide essential information and support for educational purposes. It is important to recognize the positive impact that computers have on children's learning and development. Instead of blaming the device itself, it is more beneficial to focus on guiding children in using computers responsibly and effectively. Ultimately, computers are instrumental in enhancing the educational experience for children and should be viewed as valuable resources rather than sources of distraction or addiction.
126	126	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1,  I am concerned about the issue of people spending excessive time on computers and neglecting physical exercise. This trend is detrimental to our health and overall well-being, and it is important to raise awareness about the potential consequences of this behavior.  One of the primary reasons why I believe excessive computer use is harmful is its negative impact on physical health. Prolonged sitting in front of a computer can lead to weight gain, heart problems, and other serious health issues. It is crucial for individuals to prioritize physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  Furthermore, the economic implications of excessive computer use cannot be overlooked. The excessive energy consumption associated with computers contributes to the strain on our power resources, affecting the economy and the environment. Additionally, a dependency on computers can lead to a decline in job opportunities as individuals prioritize computer usage over seeking employment.  Lastly, the potential dangers of illegal activities online highlight the risks of excessive computer use, especially for children. Cyber predators, harmful websites, and other illegal online activities pose significant threats to individuals, particularly vulnerable children. It is essential to educate individuals about online safety and the potential dangers of unrestricted computer use.  In conclusion, it is evident that excessive computer use can have detrimental effects on health, the economy, and overall well-being. @ORGANIZATION1, I urge you to address this issue and promote a balanced approach to technology usage that prioritizes physical activity and safety. Together, we can work towards a healthier and safer digital environment for all.  Thank you for your attention to this important matter.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
127	127	1	3	Computers can affect the way people are and how they interact. Why spend your precious life sitting in front of a computer all day when you could be getting exercise by going to your local gym? Computers can be a distraction to your social life, so it's important to use them only for emergencies and spend more time with your wonderful family and friends. Enjoying your surroundings and appreciating life and nature is essential. Computers are meant for business, not for people to waste time on meaningless activities.  Exercise is crucial for helping the human body grow and stay fit. If you spend all day in front of a computer, your body will suffer from lack of proper exercise. Sports can be just as enjoyable as using a computer and help build hand-eye coordination. Exercising provides the same benefits as computers, but with the added bonus of keeping your body healthy and active.  Family is a precious thing in life, and it's important to cherish every moment with them. Computers can take away from your social life, making it difficult to go out and meet new people. It's essential to maintain strong relationships with family and friends to lead a fulfilling life.  Nature is beautiful and should be appreciated and protected. Computers can harm nature by causing deforestation for paper production. Using paper sparingly and only when necessary can help preserve our environment for future generations.  In conclusion, spending excessive time on computers can lead to negative consequences. It's important to prioritize exercise, spending time with family and friends, and appreciating nature to lead a balanced and fulfilling life. Let's strive to make the world a better place by reducing our reliance on computers and focusing on what truly matters.
128	128	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, computers can be entertaining and educational, but should not replace everyday living. Therefore, I think that computers harm people and affect them in ways they do not realize. Three reasons that support my decision are the difference between reality and fantasy, family and friends, and your health. Many children and young adults are vulnerable to the assumption that everything you see on the computer is true. Well, as some find out, it is everything but that. The addictive games and electronic features lead you to believe that the people or situations you see are real-life scenarios. Computers are showing kids the wrong mindset they need to be in. It affects school work and how they behave. They need to be in the right state of mind and get back to reality. Your family and friends have always been there for you, by your side even through your worst. Unfortunately, this addiction to the computer has brought you farther away from them. They are not happy with the way you treat them. They want a change so you can enjoy life again. Interact with a human being, not some graphic-designed computer picture. That's all it is anyway, and that picture isn't going to be there for you. Your family and friends last longer than that. Your body is special, and your health is important. A computer may suggest exercise, but you are not going to really do it. You know that, and the people who make computer sites know that. You're going to stay there and burn your eyes out from looking at a screen all day. It is not healthy for you or anyone else. Moving your fingers and pushing buttons is not exercise. You're already sitting anyway, so you are not doing anything helpful to yourself. You need to go outside, breathe in air, and be in nature. Run around or play a ball game, but not on the computer. In conclusion, you can see how a computer can affect a person. Not only do they mistake fantasy and reality as the same thing, but you lose interaction with your friends and loved ones. Your health is also at risk when you spend hours staring and not moving anything but maybe two fingers. Please consider the risks and believe the facts because honestly, we are losing the chance to live and enjoy the world.
129	129	1	3	Hi! My name is @PERSON1 and I think computers are not bad. I think this because yes, people do play the computer too much, but they can also learn a lot of things. Another reason is that some kids like bullies can stop bullying and spend time on the computer to stay away from stress. You can also talk to your friends and even video chat with them too. Computers can teach you a lot. For example, if your computer breaks or has a virus you can just figure out the problem by yourself. You can also learn or read the news that you're missing. For example, you can also ask questions that you don't understand and people would answer your question. In modern times, kids, teens, and even adults use computers to look up things that they don't understand. For example, when I read a book and come across a word that I don't know, I would go online and find out what the word means.   Bullies and other people like street people that have computers should stay on the computer and play games. They can play hitting games, shooting games, and even board games. You can even watch fights if you want. Whatever you want, you got it. This is a good thing because then no one will get hurt and everyone will be happy. Bullies can also go on the computer to relax and stay away from people that they hate. The computer can make you relax because you don't have to be around people and you can just tell the computer to do whatever you want. Kids, teens, and adults don't have to leave the house just to talk to a friend or two. Most computers have a micro-cam and you can communicate with others. For example, if one of your friends moves far away, you can just talk to them on the micro-cam or even send messages back and forth.   So I think computers are not a bad idea or a bad thing. I say this because you can learn, stay connected, and communicate.
130	130	1	3	Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in today's society, & to go against it is a preposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Today's news is always with exciting events and horrible disasters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the latest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the latest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to access. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you want you want information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatever else you would want to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the latest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society. As technology continues to advance, the positive impact of computers on society will only continue to grow, making them an essential tool in our daily lives.
131	131	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are beginning to be a problem in many households. I feel that too many people are becoming addicted to computers. People like this are more likely to gain weight, have little social time, and spend too much time inside. In @CAPS6 article I have recently read in the @ORGANIZATION1, it was about @CAPS6 experiment on computer use. Dr. @PERSON1, a @CAPS3 professor stated that his findings showed that people who are addicted to computers only leave their homes to run errands. When this happens, it interferes with their lives as well as their bodies, because our bodies need sunlight. Furthermore, his study also showed that people who go outside more and not on the computer as much tend to be happier. @PERCENT1 of the study's patients started to be more joyful once they stopped going on the computer as often. I like when the people around me are happy, not grouchy, don't you? I have been noticing some kids in my school that are gaining weight. These are kids who have recently started going on the computer for a couple hours at a time everyday. This is very bad for your health and body. If someone sits at their computer all day eating the food is not being worked off, so it all turn to fat. Moreover, statistics show that @PERCENT2 of all obese people in a weight loss class had gained their extra weight from sitting at the computer all day. If people treat their bodies this way, they could end up with some type of condition. Last week, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1 intervied @NUM2 year old @PERSON2. @PERSON2's best friend has been ignoring @PERSON2 because he got a @ORGANIZATION1 computer. Now, @PERSON2's friend doesn't want to hang out with @PERSON2, or any of his other friends. In addition, when people become addicted to computers, they become less social with friends and other people like parents, teachers, and more. When people push aside their social time for computer games, chat rooms, or movie websites, they lose a large portion of their life. This can be stopped if parents put their foot down, set limits, and make kids spend more time outside. As you can clearly see, computers @MONTH1 have some benefits, but they have many disadvantages. Addicted computer users become less social, they don't go outside and start to ""pack on the pounds."" @CAPS6 effect of this is a world full of people who sit on the computer all day eating food and gaining weight. It is important for individuals to find a balance between computer use and other activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle and social connections. Let's encourage moderation and outdoor activities to ensure a happier and healthier future for all."
132	132	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that the idea of advances in technology benefiting society is a very controversial topic. However, I support these advances in technology and I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They allow friends and family who live far away from each other to communicate and stay in touch. Computers also allow easy access to the news and online textbooks, providing enormous benefits to today's society. In the long run, doing more things by computer instead of on paper will save billions of trees. Additionally, computers teach us hand-eye coordination, which is a tremendously important skill. These advances in technology are extremely beneficial to our society and should be taken advantage of. Computers help children develop hand-eye coordination, which is a very important skill. Computer activities keep our brain exercising and can even help us hit more accurately in sports. Overall, computers are an extremely useful resource that we need to make the most of in order to enhance our lives and society as a whole.
133	133	1	3	Dear Editor of the Newspaper, it is clear that computers do not always benefit society. Many people struggle with time management, neglecting important tasks for the allure of digital distractions. Additionally, the impact on relationships is significant, as individuals may isolate themselves from friends and family in favor of screen time. Lastly, the health implications of excessive computer use cannot be ignored.   When individuals become engrossed in computer activities, they often lose track of time and neglect responsibilities. This can lead to procrastination and a lack of productivity, hindering personal growth and success. Furthermore, the social consequences of excessive computer use are concerning. Friends and family members may feel neglected or unimportant when individuals prioritize screen time over meaningful interactions. This can strain relationships and lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.   Moreover, the sedentary nature of computer use can have detrimental effects on one's health. Lack of physical activity and poor dietary choices associated with prolonged computer use can contribute to various health issues, including obesity and cardiovascular problems. It is essential for individuals to prioritize their health by incorporating regular exercise and balanced nutrition into their daily routines.  In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, it is crucial for individuals to recognize and address the negative impacts of excessive computer use. By managing time effectively, nurturing relationships, and prioritizing health, individuals can lead a more fulfilling and balanced life. It is important to strike a healthy balance between technology use and real-world interactions to ensure overall well-being and happiness.
134	134	1	3	Computers are indeed valuable tools that benefit society in various ways. One significant advantage is the ability to facilitate online communication, allowing individuals to stay connected with friends and family members. This not only fosters relationships but also provides convenience in keeping in touch, especially in situations where immediate communication is necessary. Additionally, computers offer a vast array of information through websites, aiding in education and research. Students, in particular, can benefit from the wealth of resources available online, enhancing their learning experience and academic performance. Moreover, the interactive nature of computer activities can improve hand-eye coordination, benefiting individuals in various real-life activities such as sports. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing social connections, knowledge acquisition, and physical skills, making them indispensable in modern society.
135	135	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,   I am writing to share with you the positive effects that computers have on people. Computers play a crucial role in enhancing hand-eye coordination, facilitating communication with friends and family online, and enabling easy access to information on various places and businesses.   Firstly, computers are beneficial for improving hand-eye coordination, which can lead to better spelling and faster typing skills. Practicing typing on a computer keyboard without looking at the keys can significantly enhance your typing speed and accuracy. This improvement in hand-eye coordination can be a valuable skill that will benefit you in various aspects of your life.  Moreover, computers provide a platform for interacting with friends and family online. Social networking sites like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter allow individuals to connect with others, share experiences, and make new friends. Additionally, email and chat platforms enable communication with loved ones who may be far away, providing a convenient way to stay in touch and strengthen relationships.  Furthermore, computers offer easy access to information on a wide range of places and businesses. By using search engines, individuals can quickly find information about landmarks, local businesses such as salons and restaurants, movie release dates, and more. This accessibility to information can be incredibly helpful in planning outings, making informed decisions, and staying updated on current events.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by enhancing hand-eye coordination, facilitating online communication with friends and family, and providing easy access to valuable information. Embracing the benefits of computers can help individuals improve their skills, stay connected with others, and make informed choices in various aspects of their lives.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
136	136	1	3	"There are so many different sides to this computer problem, well it's simple computers ruin our lives. Now think if it how many hours do you see your kid on it? Computers mess up kids' grades. It stops people from taking a car ride to their friend's house. Also, people don't ride their bikes a lot. Computers are an outrage. It first starts off with grades. The parents tell their kid to go and start their paper. They say ok, and then they are down there on Facebook. More often than not, kids and parents abuse the computer. In fact, a high percentage of Americans use it, which might seem like a small percent, but that's more than half the country. Me, I don't abuse the computer because I need to keep my grades up. Most students have below-average grades because studies show it's because of computers. Also, if your child has a laptop, they're not doing work if that is what you think. I have computers, but we have books for a reason, no spam, pop-ups, or distractions while working. Like one time I was working on a project, a pop-up came up and read ""traffic rush free to your computer."" So, foolishly, I downloaded it and my parents caught me playing. Has this changed your mind? Since you probably haven't changed your mind, here is another reason why computers are bad - your car. All guys love cars. Computers are keeping more than half of people working or driving their cars. The only person it hasn't affected is my dad; he works on his cars day in and day out. My grandma said something interesting to me the other day, ""Your dad comes up to visit me more than your other sons; your other sons are crazy for computers."" People go crazy for computers today. Lately, I have seen fewer and fewer people outside anymore. The only reason for that is all people are holed up in their basement in the dark, so when they turn on the light, it burns their eyes because it's so bright. Come on, did this change your mind yet? Well, since you are still reading on, that means you cannot make up your mind. Well, here's this: people are starting to not want to ride their bikes anymore. They think, ""Why ride now when I can talk on Facebook?"" That's right for what they are thinking. Because we asked a test of all the kids who have Facebook, and that's what almost all of them said. I know it's amazing. A stay-at-home mother said, ""My son is gaining weight; all he does is eat and go on Facebook. When he's not on during the day, I catch him at night too."" That is a sad story for that mother. I ride my bike a lot. Once I was sitting around doing nothing, and my mom said we are riding bikes for 5 miles. I got up and did it too. That had to change your mind, or nothing will. So, in conclusion, I have no more ideas against computers. But just remember your grades, cars, and your weight. Please, change your mind."
137	137	1	3	Dear newspaper,  I believe that computers are beneficial for a variety of reasons. They provide access to information about distant places, allowing users to learn about different cultures and regions. In addition, computers enable individuals to stay informed about current events through news websites, which provide up-to-date information on global occurrences. Furthermore, educational websites offer valuable resources for learning, such as math facts and multiplication tables, making them valuable tools for students.  Moreover, computers facilitate communication with individuals around the world, including family members and friends who may be located in different countries or regions. By using chat rooms and messaging platforms, people can easily connect and keep in touch with loved ones regardless of their geographic location.  Overall, the versatility and functionality of computers make them indispensable tools for learning, staying informed, and maintaining relationships with others. They have revolutionized the way we access information and communicate, enhancing our lives in numerous ways.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
138	138	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been a lot of discussion about whether computers affect people in a positive or negative way. I believe that computers have a negative effect on most people. People tend to lose their people skills by communicating through the computer, leading to a lack of face-to-face interaction. This can result in a failure to recognize important social cues like facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. Without these cues, communication becomes less effective and meaningful.  Additionally, computers have brought about various dangers, especially for young users. Cases of teenagers being lured into dangerous situations by online predators are not uncommon. Cyberbullying is another significant issue that can have severe consequences on an individual's mental health and self-esteem. Without computers, these risks would be significantly reduced, creating a safer environment for everyone.  Moreover, the use of computers can cause people to lose sight of their priorities in life. Some individuals prioritize their online social life over spending time with family and friends, neglecting important aspects such as school work and personal health. The convenience and allure of the digital world can lead to a neglect of real-world responsibilities and relationships.  In conclusion, life without computers would likely result in improved people skills, reduced dangers, and a refocusing on essential priorities. While computers have their benefits, it is essential for individuals to strike a balance between their digital and real-world lives to lead a fulfilling and well-rounded existence.
139	139	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers can have a positive impact on people, but I disagree that they are the reason why some individuals choose not to exercise or spend time in nature. Ultimately, people make their own decisions and the computer is simply a tool that is available to them. For instance, I enjoy using the computer for work and leisure activities, but I also make time for other important aspects of my life such as spending time with family, playing sports like basketball, and socializing with friends. It is important to recognize that everyone has the freedom to choose how they spend their time, whether it be on the computer or engaging in outdoor activities. It is essential to respect individual choices and understand that what works best for one person may not necessarily work for another. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to determine how they want to balance their time between technology and other aspects of life.
140	140	1	3	Dear editor, I have heard that some experts are saying that people spend too much time online. I thoroughly believe they are mistaken. With the use of the internet, people can learn about faraway places without spending money to go there. Our military uses the internet to talk to their family and friends stateside. Also, it helps us acquire great hand-eye coordination.  If someone was planning a trip to a specific location, they would check the internet often. Firstly, they would check out sites to go to in that location. Second, they would check and compare hotels in that location. Thirdly, they would check the weather in that location. Finally, they would check airports for flights going to and from that location. Without the internet, planning vacations would be close to impossible.  People not only use the internet for pleasure but for communication purposes too. They use webcams to talk online to people in faraway places. It is a fast, free, and convenient way to communicate with other people. Our military uses webcams to let the soldiers talk to their families. It is cruel and unjust to keep soldiers from talking to their families.  The internet also gives us something useful. It helps us build hand-eye coordination, which is essential in many activities. In basketball, you need to be able to look up and dribble at the same time. When you are driving, you need to be able to look up and still steer the car. Without hand-eye coordination, many more accidents would happen due to careless errors. The internet helps people make the world a safer place.  In some aspects, the experts are right. We should go out and enjoy nature, but we also need to enjoy and use the internet as well. Some people use it for pleasure and to build hand-eye coordination, while others use it to talk to their loved ones or plan vacations. No matter who you are or what you do, the internet plays an important part in life. It is a valuable tool that should not be underestimated or overlooked.
141	141	1	3	Dear @PERSON3 of the @LOCATION1, I strongly believe that computers have a positive impact on our lives. They play a crucial role in connecting us with family and friends, aiding in communication and collaboration. For instance, my mother was able to reunite with her birth family through a website, allowing me to gain new relatives and build meaningful relationships. Moreover, computers enable efficient multitasking, facilitating work on group projects and communication with loved ones simultaneously.  Additionally, computers broaden our horizons by providing access to information about different cultures and countries. Researching topics and learning about distant places is made easy and quick with the help of the internet. This accessibility to knowledge enhances our understanding of the world and fosters cultural awareness. Furthermore, computers are essential tools for tasks such as finding directions and conducting research, contributing to solving crimes and improving safety measures.  In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits to society, from enhancing communication to facilitating research and learning. Embracing the advancements in technology can lead to greater efficiency and connectivity in our daily lives. Let us appreciate the positive impact that computers have on our world and continue to utilize them for the betterment of society.
142	142	1	3	As more and more people are becoming accustomed to using computers, I believe that this is having a negative effect on society. Because of computers people are not exercising as much as they should, which is of crucial importance. In addition, people are becoming unable to enjoy and appreciate nature while they still can. Finally, people are slowly losing their ability to communicate with family and friends. As everyone becomes more engrossed in technology, they are losing touch with the world around them. Therefore, the advances in technology are having a negative effect on society. People spend long hours on computers, neglecting exercise, which is essential for good health. With the beauty of nature around us, it is sad to see people missing out on its wonders because they are glued to screens. Moreover, online relationships cannot replace the depth and authenticity of real-life connections. The virtual world cannot provide the emotional fulfillment that comes with face-to-face interactions. In a time where health, relationships, and communication are crucial, the overreliance on technology is proving detrimental. It is important to find a balance and prioritize physical activity, nature appreciation, and genuine human connections to maintain a healthy and fulfilling life.
143	143	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I am a student at your middle school. I would like to share my opinion on how computers impact people. Computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, offering various benefits such as entertainment, communication, and access to information.  In my view, the use of computers is positive, and only those who do not utilize them are missing out. Computers are incredibly helpful; for instance, if I forget how to do something, I can easily search for it online. I have been using computers for as long as I can remember, and it has contributed to my knowledge and skills. I even assist my mom with computer tasks from time to time.  Chat rooms are another valuable aspect of computer use as they allow us to connect with friends and family members, no matter where they are in the world. Personally, I frequently communicate with my cousin in Colombia through online platforms. Additionally, platforms like Facebook help me stay in touch with friends and discuss homework assignments.  When it comes to games, they provide entertainment and mental stimulation. Games like chess or Sudoku can challenge the brain and improve cognitive skills. Moreover, playing games can enhance computer literacy and typing abilities, making it a fun way to learn.  Despite concerns about computer use taking away from physical exercise and face-to-face interactions, I believe that computers can also promote mental exercise and social interaction. Overall, computers offer a multitude of benefits and enhance various aspects of our lives.  Thank you for considering my perspective on the positive effects of computer usage.
144	144	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion, computers are a valuable tool that can greatly benefit our society. The advancements in technology have made our lives easier in many ways. One significant advantage of computers is their ability to improve hand-eye coordination. Typing on a keyboard, whether fast or slow, helps to strengthen the muscles in our hands and improve coordination. This constant movement and exercise are beneficial for overall hand dexterity.  Furthermore, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate with others. With the use of webcams and video conferencing, we can now interact with people from different parts of the world in real-time. This has proven to be especially useful in business settings, allowing for seamless communication and collaboration across various locations. Additionally, computers provide a platform for individuals to connect with loved ones who may be far away or unable to meet in person. This form of communication is not only convenient but also fosters meaningful connections.  Moreover, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options. From playing games to watching videos or listening to music, there is no shortage of ways to stay entertained on a computer. Platforms like YouTube provide endless content for users to enjoy, and social media sites like Facebook offer a space for individuals to connect with friends and share experiences.  In conclusion, computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, offering numerous benefits such as improving hand-eye coordination, facilitating communication, and providing entertainment. Embracing this technology can open up a world of possibilities and enhance various aspects of our lives. So, why not explore the endless opportunities that computers have to offer and experience the wonders of modern technology for yourself?
145	145	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  Are you utilizing computers to administer your local newspaper to society? In today's digital age, it is likely that you are using computers for various tasks such as typing and editing documents. Computers have become an essential tool for not only newspapers but also for the government, businesses, schools, and individuals.  The use of computers in the newspaper industry has revolutionized the way news is presented to the public. From typing articles to designing layouts, computers play a crucial role in the production of newspapers. Without computers, the process of creating and distributing newspapers would be much more laborious and time-consuming.  Furthermore, computers have become indispensable in communication. Whether it is the government announcing laws, businesses reaching out to customers, or schools sharing information with students, computers have made communication more efficient and accessible. Through email, social media, and video chat, people can connect with others from different parts of the world with ease.  As a student, I can attest to the importance of computers in education. Research projects, homework assignments, and communication with teachers all rely on the use of computers. The internet provides a vast array of resources for students to enhance their learning experience.  In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of society, facilitating communication, information sharing, and productivity. Embracing technology and utilizing computers can greatly benefit individuals, businesses, and institutions. It is essential to recognize the value that computers bring to our daily lives and continue to incorporate them into various aspects of society.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
146	146	1	3	Dear local newspaper,   I believe that computers are beneficial because they allow us to access information about people, events, and the world around us that we wouldn't have known otherwise. For example, without computers, I wouldn't have been able to learn about individuals like @CAPS1 and organizations like @ORGANIZATION1. Computers have also provided valuable insights into historical events such as World War @NUM1 and World War @NUM2, as well as conflicts like the @CAPS5 and @PERSON1 war.   Furthermore, platforms like Google and Yahoo have made it easier for us to search for information quickly and accurately. Whether it's for work, shopping, or studying, these search engines have become essential tools in our daily lives. Overall, I believe that computers play a crucial role in helping us stay informed and connected to the world around us.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
147	147	1	3	Hour after hour of gaming online and posting blogs on social networking sites is all one sees. Unaware of their surroundings, many people are glued to their computer screens and only take breaks when absolutely necessary. This trend is creating a society that is disconnected from the real world. Computers do not bring positive benefits to society; instead, they lead to negative effects on people's bodies and social interactions.   Spending excessive time on the computer can have detrimental effects on one's physical health. Lack of exercise and proper body maintenance are common issues among individuals who spend hours on end in front of a screen. Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining a healthy body, burning fat, and building muscles. Additionally, sunlight is crucial for obtaining vitamin D, but many people do not get enough exposure to it because they are indoors on their computers.  Moreover, the excessive use of computers leads to a decline in face-to-face interactions with family and friends. Socializing and spending quality time with loved ones are essential for building relationships and developing social skills. By prioritizing screen time over personal interactions, individuals risk becoming isolated and disconnected from those around them.  Furthermore, the rise of cyberbullying is a significant issue associated with computer usage. The anonymity provided by the internet makes it easier for individuals to engage in hurtful behavior towards others. Cyberbullying can have severe consequences, including emotional distress and, in extreme cases, suicide. It is essential to address this issue by promoting less screen time and more meaningful interactions in the real world.  In conclusion, the negative effects of excessive computer use on society are clear. From physical health concerns to social isolation and cyberbullying, the impact of spending too much time online is detrimental. It is crucial for individuals to find a balance between technology use and real-world interactions to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. Let's prioritize outdoor activities, face-to-face conversations, and quality time with loved ones to prevent society from being consumed by the glow of computer screens.
148	148	1	3	I believe that computers benefit our society in many ways. They have become a ubiquitous presence in our daily lives, offering numerous uses and enjoyable experiences for people of all ages. One significant advantage of computers is their ability to provide entertainment through various games like Tetris, Solitaire, and card games. These games help people relax and have fun, contributing to overall happiness in society.  Moreover, computers have streamlined many tasks, such as online bill payments and shopping, saving time and money for individuals. By reducing the need to travel for these activities, computers also help lower pollution levels, contributing to a healthier environment. This convenience and efficiency make people happier and more content with their lives.  Additionally, computers play a vital role in education by providing access to vast amounts of information. Students can use computers for research, learning about different cultures, and enhancing their academic performance. For instance, utilizing a computer for a research project can lead to higher grades, boosting students' confidence and overall well-being.  In conclusion, computers bring joy, convenience, and knowledge to our society, making us happier, more efficient, and better equipped to succeed in various aspects of life. Embracing the benefits of computers can lead to a more prosperous and fulfilling society for everyone.
149	149	1	3	Dear local Newspaper. I am stating my opinion that the more people use computers the less they spend with their family. I have three reasons why computers are good or bad. Not everyone agrees that computers are beneficial for society. The positive effects and negative effects that computers have on people. My reasons for supporting this is that computers are good or bad are that computers have a positive effect on people. The second reason is to be able to talk to other people online. The last reason I have is spending more time with family than on the computer. The first reason that I have for computers is how they have a positive effect on people. The examples that I have to support this are that computers teach hand-eye coordination, computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. The second reason that I have on computers is that you can talk to people online. The examples that I have to support my are the websites that kids use to talk to their friends like MySpace and Facebook. The places that kids like to go to are YouTube and even blogging about everything and everyone. Some of these things can be good if you don't post pictures or other things on your MySpace or Facebook. I think that these websites are dangerous because somebody can hack into your file and they can try to talk to you like they're your friend. The third reason I have to support my is that we should spend more time with our family than being on the computer the whole time. I have examples of what we should do with our families instead of being on the computers. I have some of games that we can play with our families instead of being on the computers. The games that we can play with our families are Monopoly, Sony, Candy Land, card games, video games, we can also talk to our family instead of talking to our friends the whole time. When we can enjoy what we have in life not just with computers but with our family. In conclusion, I am stating my opinion that the more time people spend on computers than with their own family. I have three reasons on why computers are good or bad. The reasons that I have to support my are that computers have a positive effect on people, to be able to talk to people online, to spend more time with family than on the computer.
150	150	1	3	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 computers have both pros and cons, but the benefits they offer are significant. One of the key advantages is the ability to view and share magnificent pictures of nature, which can be easily emailed to others. Additionally, computers provide the convenience of ordering tickets for various modes of transportation and entertainment, such as planes, trains, and movies. Shopping online is another convenient feature, allowing users to purchase a wide range of products from the comfort of their homes. The internet offers access to countless images, including those of nature and celebrities, although not all may be authentic. Furthermore, computers can store photos from digital cameras, transfer projects to flash drives, and email images to any desired recipient. Online platforms also enable users to watch videos, with a significant portion of teenagers enjoying music videos. Despite the drawbacks of computers, such as potential security risks, their numerous benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Overall, computers provide a wealth of opportunities for entertainment, communication, and productivity in the digital age.
151	151	1	3	Dear local newspaper,   I disagree with the notion that people spend too much time on their computers. Computers offer a wealth of knowledge and resources that can be beneficial for learning. For example, children can quickly find answers to homework questions, which can enhance their understanding of various subjects. Additionally, advanced technology enables people to interact with friends and family, play games, and even learn new things together.  While it is important to enjoy nature and spend time outdoors, computers can also be used to raise awareness and advocate for environmental causes. Through platforms like blogs, individuals can spread messages about preserving nature and protecting wildlife. Overall, computers provide numerous opportunities for learning, connecting with others, and making a positive impact on the world.  In conclusion, the benefits of using computers for education, communication, and advocacy outweigh the potential drawbacks of spending too much time on them. Embracing technology can enhance our lives and contribute to a more informed and connected society. So, let us make the most of the resources available to us and use computers as tools for learning, growth, and positive change.
152	152	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is a positive one. One key benefit is the ability for individuals to learn more about various cultures and places worldwide. This knowledge is crucial for fostering understanding and respect among different societies, especially for those who travel frequently. Additionally, computers enable users to explore different locations globally, providing valuable information on famous landmarks and essential travel tips to prevent getting lost. Moreover, the online platform offers job opportunities for many individuals, allowing them to work remotely and access a broader range of employment options. Overall, computers play a significant role in enhancing people's knowledge of cultures, places, and job opportunities, ultimately contributing to a more interconnected and informed society.
153	153	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 are many people in this world that think always being on the computer is good because they can talk with people online and learn more about the world. But, then @CAPS1 are people who disagree with them. I am one of those people. Spending too much time on the computer can really affect your life. People stop exercising, don't enjoy the beauty of nature or life, and they aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. So, I hope that while you read through this letter, you take some of this information into consideration. First of all, when people spend a lot of time on the computer they aren't getting all of the exercise that their body needs. They become lazy and don't want to do anything. This is very bad because it will affect your health and the rest of your life. People @MONTH1 become overweight and since they got lazy from always being on the computer, they won't go out and get the exercise that their body needs. People need to enjoy their life! By always being on the computer, they won't be able to. @CAPS1 are so many fun and healthy things you can do for your body. You can go play sports and have fun while getting exercise. Many people do this and try to encourage their family and friends to do it with them. But, some of their family and friends are to lazy to do anything because they are always on the computer. Instead, they stay inside the house all cooped up and don't get enough fresh air. This is a horrible thing to do to yourself. Your body needs fresh air, so start enjoying your life a little more people! Finally, people @MONTH1 lose contact with family members of their friends because they are to busy on the computer playing games. I know I wouldn't want to lose a friend to the internet ever again and I don't think anyone else would want to either. I once lost a friend or two because I didn't talk to them as much as I used to because I had been too busy on the computer on @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and games. I felt horrible because I didn't realize that I had been doing that. I really wouldn't want anyone else to lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because of the internet. Its horrible and you don't feel like yourself anymore. Once again I would like to tell you that always being on the internet is not good. You can become lazy, not want to do anything etc., people aren't enjoying their life to the fullest and you can and @MONTH1 lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because you spend to much time on the computer. I hope that after reading this, you realize that being on the computer is not always good for you. Remember to take breaks and enjoy life outside of the digital world.
154	154	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers are an extremely useful tool in society. It helps people learn new things about different cultures. Also, it lets you communicate with friends and family through the internet, for example, using facebook or @CAPS1. Finally, it provides an accurate research tool for school projects, or interviews. First, learning about different cultures helps the world stay together. For example, here, we learn @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Each class teaches us to respect more and more of this culture. However, some people don't have the chance to get this land of education, so they turn to the internet. If the computer didn't exist, we might not know about the lifestyle @NUM1 mi away from us. We wouldn't know if their lifestyles are extremely difficult or luxurious. Also, we wouldn't know if we could help them or not. For example, the earthquake in @LOCATION1 which. It's one step closer to world peace no more war or conflicts. Secondly, the computer helps you communicate to friends and family for in the world. I remember one time I was mailing my family friends who was in @LOCATION2, risking his life. I knew he couldn't come back to town, so I started to email him, and video chat with him. Whenever I saw his face, I knew that everything was okay. I don't know how I would have without the internet. Other ways lived you could as. Also, just communicating with friends! internet sites, like extremely useful. Finally, you use the computer for educational use. For example, research projects, study tools and essays. Whenever that a research is the internet. This extremely reliable and accurate. However that some of the websites are fake, which is easy to great research to use for school projects. Also, I know many teachers in my school have a blog or page where they put their @CAPS4 on, study links, and handouts, just in case we lose them. Whenever there is a test coming up, my @CAPS2 teacher, @CAPS5 would have links on her go to help use study. Also, is another website that helps us study for vocab. It also has many games that and learn our vocab words. As you can see, the computer helps us in our daily use and makes a positive impact on our society. From educational purposes, to learning cultures and socializing with friends it helps us get through life. As very successful newspaper and people, I assume you will understand how much the computer has made a positive effect in society.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in society by facilitating learning about different cultures, enabling communication with friends and family, and providing valuable resources for education. The impact of computers on our daily lives is undeniable, and they continue to enhance our society in numerous ways.
155	155	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 there has been a lot of talk about how computers affect society. Some ""experts"" say computers are good for society and some think the opposite - that computers are bad for society because they make children obese, decrease a person's social skills, and even make children less educated. In recent years, studies show that children who use computers frequently are less likely and less willing to get active. Dr. @PERSON1 says, ""The more children use computers, the more time they waste not being active at all."" A study conducted by the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that children who use the computer for more than one hour a day are more likely to be obese than children who use it for one hour or less a day. Computers keep children inside all day, leading to a lack of physical activity. The main reason children become obese while using the computer is that it is easier to sit in front of a screen than to engage in physical activities. Computers are a direct contributor to child obesity and pose a threat to society.  Some believe that computers can increase social skills, but this notion is incorrect. While on a computer, individuals can ""talk"" to friends, but it is not the same as face-to-face interaction. Communication through a computer lacks the nuances and cues present in real-life conversations, making individuals socially awkward in public settings. Spending excessive time on a computer can hinder social interactions and skills, as demonstrated by the behavior of individuals who prioritize screen time over personal connections.  Furthermore, the idea that computers enhance knowledge and intelligence is not always true. While computers offer access to vast amounts of information, individuals may misuse this resource by simply copying and pasting information without truly understanding or learning from it. This practice leads to a superficial understanding of subjects and hinders critical thinking skills. The convenience of technology should not overshadow the importance of genuine learning and comprehension.  Overall, despite the promises and advancements associated with computers, their negative impact on society cannot be ignored. From contributing to obesity and social awkwardness to promoting superficial learning, computers have detrimental effects that need to be addressed. It is crucial to strike a balance between utilizing technology for its benefits while also prioritizing physical activity, genuine social interactions, and meaningful education."
156	156	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, I just read about your article regarding computer usage. In my opinion, computers are a valuable technology that offers numerous benefits. They provide opportunities to type, learn about various topics, communicate with people worldwide, and connect with loved ones, even those far away. For example, I use my computer to stay in touch with my relatives in another city. Computers have greatly enriched my life and have opened up a world of knowledge and possibilities.  However, despite the many advantages computers offer, there are also potential drawbacks. Excessive computer use can lead to addiction and negative impacts on one's life. I know someone who is a kind-hearted individual but allows their addiction to social media to consume their time and attention, affecting their relationships and overall well-being. It is essential to find a balance and use computers responsibly.  Dr. [Person1], as mentioned in your article, highlighted the issue of excessive computer usage, emphasizing the importance of spending time outdoors and engaging in other activities. It is crucial to be mindful of how much time we dedicate to using computers and ensure that it does not overshadow other aspects of our lives.  In conclusion, computers can be a valuable tool if used wisely. It is essential to prioritize real-life interactions, spend time with loved ones, and engage in outdoor activities. By striking a balance between computer usage and other activities, we can fully enjoy the benefits of technology while maintaining a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.
157	157	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, how much time do you spend on the computer daily, @NUM1 hour, @NUM2 hours? While computers are amazing advances in technology, they also have negative impacts on health. People spending hours on the computer leads to less time exercising, poor communication skills, and risky online behavior. From @DATE2 to @DATE3, the percentage of obese people in @LOCATION2 increased from @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1. A recent study showed that the number of families with computers has risen to @NUM3 out of @DATE1, compared to @NUM4 out of @DATE1 in @DATE4. This increase in computer usage correlates with a sedentary lifestyle, leading to obesity and cardiovascular issues.  The excessive use of social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook also affects communication skills. Teens are using abbreviated and improper language online, which is now carrying over into face-to-face conversations. English teachers, like @PERSON2, have noticed a decline in grammar and writing skills among students, attributing it to excessive time spent on computers.  In @LOCATION1, children spend hours on the computer unsupervised, potentially accessing harmful content or interacting with strangers. Parental control software can only do so much, as children can find ways to bypass these restrictions. The internet provides valuable information, but it also poses risks. Parents must be vigilant in monitoring their children's online activities to ensure their safety.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, excessive usage can lead to health issues, poor communication skills, and online dangers. It is essential for individuals, especially parents, to strike a balance between using technology and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
158	158	1	3	Dear newspaper, some believe computers do not benefit society, but I do. Computers help businesses thrive, keep people aware of what is going on in the world, and allow people to stay in touch with each other. Computers greatly benefit small and large businesses across the world. Imagine all the jobs at each business without a computer. Businesses would be unreliable because no instant contact would mean it might take a long time for products to be assembled and shipped. Any business owner would cringe at the idea of running a business without a computer. When surveyed, the majority of business owners and workers would prefer a computer's assistance at work. Almost every modern-day business relies on at least one computer. For example, companies that mass-produce their products often rely on computers to do jobs more precisely than a worker. Sometimes computer-operated robots do dangerous jobs so workers are not at risk. Businesses also need computers to quickly receive and send information to other businesses and people. People use computers as much, if not more, than businesses. People use computers to keep in touch with friends and people they know. Thanks to websites like social media platforms and email, people can easily stay in touch. Families use computers to plan get-togethers, and friends use computers to keep in contact after grade school or if they do not live nearby. With computers, anyone, anywhere can be in constant contact with anyone else. People also like to know news immediately. Without computers, it would be a lot harder to contact the rest of the world. Imagine a natural disaster occurring and not knowing about it right away. In that case, we could not send aid to the area. With the recent earthquakes in various locations, knowledge about the rest of the world is even more important. Newspapers provide news and information but a day or two late, and they often use computers to acquire that information. Scientists agree that receiving information would be a lot harder without computers. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing communication, business efficiency, and global awareness, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.
159	159	1	3	Imagine standing outside, the warm sun dancing on your back, jumping into the pool and feeling the cool water flow around you. But no, that won't happen. Because children and their parents are spending way too much time on their computers. People aren't getting enough exercise, which can be very dangerous, and families are spending less time with each other due to their screen time addiction.   Children are becoming increasingly sedentary, leading to rising rates of obesity. Instead of engaging in physical activities like biking, swimming, or playing sports, they are glued to their screens. This lack of movement is detrimental to their health and well-being.   Moreover, the internet poses serious risks, with young children creating social media accounts and teenagers falling prey to online predators. Personal information shared online can make individuals vulnerable to dangerous situations, putting themselves and their families at risk.   Furthermore, excessive screen time is driving people apart, with families and friends choosing virtual interactions over real-life connections. Dinners are eaten in front of screens, and social gatherings are replaced by online engagements.   It is crucial for individuals to realize the negative impacts of excessive computer usage and prioritize activities that promote physical health and meaningful relationships. By reducing screen time and engaging in real-world experiences, families and friends can strengthen their bonds and lead healthier, happier lives. Let's disconnect from our devices and reconnect with the world around us.
160	160	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I agree that people are spending more time on the computers and less time doing other important stuff. For example, they don't spend time exercising, enjoying nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Those are very important things that people don't understand that they are missing out on. First, people that spend a lot of time on the computer don't do exercise. Doing exercise is good for your health. If you don't do exercise when you get older your bones are going to work. Also, you could get fat and that is bad for your heart. Just for being on the computer people don't pay attention to their health. Next, people don't enjoy the beautiful nature that is outside. Is beautiful when you hear the birds singing or seeing the plants outside. People are forgeting about nature. They don't recycle so the planet could be clean. The air that we smell is not clean because they don't care about nature. Instead of being on the computer people could help so the world could be better. Finally, people don't spend time with the people that love them. Is very important to spend time with your family. People don't realize that the first thing in life is your family. Instead of being on the computer, it is fun going to the beach with your kids, wife, father, and etc. In conclusion, I believe that computers affect people. People just for being on the computer they don't do exercise, enjoy nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Now that you heard my viewpoint, I ask you to think about yours.
161	161	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have a very positive effect on people. I agree that computers have a positive effect. They teach hand-eye coordination. It gives people the ability to learn about people and places, and you can talk online @CAPS3 first reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. for example, when you learn how to type, you can memorize the keys. Therefore, you don't have to look down at the keyboard. Computers also teach hand-eye when using a mouse. When you want to click on something you have to look at the screen and move the mouse to click on the icon. @CAPS3 final reason that computers teach hand-eye is once you know what to do, you don't have to search the screen for an icon. You could just move the mouse to a spot on the screen and know what to do. Computers teach hand-eye coordination when you type, when you move the mouse to click on an icon, and when you memorize all of the icons. @CAPS3 second reason is computers make you smarter. For example, if you have a history project, and you need to know about China, you can use the computer. How many times would China be in the newspaper? Using the computer can access quick information. Another example is computers can find information on famous people no one knew about. You could be able to find what college a famous actor went to in a matter of seconds. @CAPS3 last example is that a search engine can look up famous pictures. If you are working on a project that requires pictures, @ORGANIZATION1 can have the photos you need. Computers make you smarter because you can look up different countries, you could look up people, and famous countries. @CAPS3 last reason is computers give you the ability to talk online with friends, for example, you could catch up with friends you don't see that much during school. Talking online is just as fast as texting. Also, you could continue a conversation you had with a friend. Did the bell ring in the middle of a conversation? Well, you can continue it on @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. Lastly, you can just plain talk. You could make plans, or you can talk about upcoming events. Computers give you access to talking with your friends. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on other people. You can get hand-eye coordination, you can look up foreign countries and people, and you can talk with your friends.
162	162	1	3	"Since computers were invented, a colossal change in the way society functions has taken place. People can now go on their computers to communicate with peers, get information on any topic for a school paper, or simply browse the internet to watch videos and stories.

This advancement in technology has made the world a smaller place and has benefited society greatly.  The ""computer age"" has given people in today's society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology. With just a few clicks, one can access a vast array of information, from educational resources to entertainment content. This not only saves time but also allows for a more efficient way of learning and exploring new ideas.  Some may argue that spending too much time on computers takes away from other important activities like studying or spending time with family. However, the internet is a treasure trove of knowledge waiting to be explored. Whether it's for school research or personal enrichment, the computer provides a gateway to endless possibilities.  In addition to research and learning, computers have revolutionized communication.

163	163	1	3	Computers are indeed a prevalent aspect of modern society, with significant impacts on various aspects of life. They have become a common source of entertainment, communication, and information. However, their excessive usage has raised concerns about their effects on individuals, particularly in terms of health and productivity.  One major concern associated with the excessive use of computers is the sedentary lifestyle it promotes. Many individuals spend long hours in front of screens, leading to a decrease in physical activity. This lack of movement contributes to the high obesity rates in America, as people are not dedicating enough time to exercise and prioritize their health.  Additionally, the prevalence of computers can also negatively impact academic performance. With the easy access to online distractions and entertainment, many students are finding it challenging to focus on their studies and complete homework assignments. This can lead to a decline in academic achievement and a lack of motivation to excel in school.  Moreover, the internet, a primary feature of computers, can expose individuals to various risks and dangers. Social networking sites like MySpace have been associated with an increase in crimes such as murders and sexual assaults. The anonymity provided by the internet can embolden criminals to target vulnerable individuals, especially children and teenagers.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits and conveniences, their excessive use can have detrimental effects on individuals and society as a whole. It is crucial for people to find a balance in their computer usage, prioritize physical activity and academic responsibilities, and be mindful of the potential risks associated with online activities. By being more conscious of these issues, we can work towards mitigating the negative impacts of excessive computer use and promoting a healthier and safer environment for everyone.
164	164	1	3	Dear local newspaper, do you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? I personally believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals. They allow for research into the past, help in developing hand-eye coordination, provide access to information about distant places and people, facilitate communication with loved ones, and aid in learning about nature. Computers are a valuable tool for connecting with others, whether through email, instant messaging, or social media platforms. They are particularly beneficial for students, researchers, scientists, and business professionals. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing knowledge, communication, and productivity in our modern society.
165	165	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, every day, technology is advancing rapidly. One of the most significant technological developments in our society is the computer. While some individuals may have reservations about computers, believing they are detrimental to social skills and physical health, it is important to recognize the numerous benefits that computers offer.  Computers play a crucial role in facilitating communication. Email, for instance, is a vital tool that allows us to send and receive important information quickly and efficiently. In situations such as receiving a notification about a school closure due to a snow day or informing your boss about being sick when unable to speak, email proves to be invaluable.  Moreover, computers have revolutionized the way we connect with others through social networking platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Yahoo Messenger. These platforms enable us to stay in touch with friends and family, locate old acquaintances, and engage in various forms of communication, such as instant messaging and video chats.  Additionally, computers have simplified the shopping experience. Online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, and Overstock offer a vast array of products that can be purchased with ease. From electronics to household groceries, the convenience of online shopping is undeniable, especially in situations where visiting physical stores may not be feasible.  In conclusion, computers serve as indispensable tools that enhance communication, facilitate social connections, and streamline shopping experiences. Despite concerns about their impact on social skills and health, it is evident that computers play a vital role in our daily lives and offer numerous advantages that should not be overlooked.
166	166	1	3	In summary, while computers have undoubtedly revolutionized the way we live and work, it is crucial to be mindful of the negative impacts excessive use can have on our health, social skills, and connection to nature. From obesity and eye strain to communication difficulties and strained relationships, the consequences of spending too much time in front of a screen are real and significant. By setting limits on computer use and making an effort to engage in physical activity, face-to-face conversations, and outdoor activities, we can strike a healthier balance in our lives. Remember, moderation is key in all aspects of life, including our reliance on technology.
167	167	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, computers are being questioned if they are good for our society or not. I would have to say that they are good and bad; you really can't pick a side. The good side is that children and teens can get the information they need to teach in school, it allows people to chat with others in different places, and it helps hand-eye coordination. On the other hand, people spend too much time on the computer instead of exercising, they don't get to enjoy nature, and people stop interacting with friends and family. Anyone can pick a side. I just can't, because I can relate to both sides.  For example, one of the good reasons about computers was that you can chat with other people around the world. I can relate to that because when I live here in my hometown, my mom and stepdad live in another city, so I don't see them much but thanks to the computer I can chat with them whenever I want to. Honestly, I wouldn't know how my life would be like if I didn't have a computer and I wasn't able to connect with them.   Although, I can also see one of the bad things about computers, which is that people spend too much time on them. I can relate to that as well because when I come back from school, I go straight on my laptop and stay on it until late at night. When my grandma comes in and sees me, she always says, ""You're on that thing too much, use your hands for something else!"" In her opinion, I am on it too much.   So, in my opinion, I believe that computers can be good for our society and bad; for me, there is no side to take. Others might feel the same way, and others might not. It's up to them to make a choice, so ask yourself, ""Do you believe that computers are good or bad for our society?"""
168	168	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: @CAPS1 you really think computers are that good? Computers are so helpful today almost everyone has one. Computers are wonderful they are great ways to find information, they connect people from all over the world, and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities, hopefully at the end of this letter you will agree with me. Firstly, they help people find information. Computers are great ways to find information with google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips. In my school surveys show @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer to help them research for school projects and asignments with computers you can view many diffrent websites from all around the world about a topic and you can even find online books that you can use, this is one way computers are a great thing out there are two other great reasons. Secondly, with computers the wole world becomes smaller as people begin to know more and more people through the computer. More than @PERCENT2 of people email, @CAPS2, or videochat on a daily baes. Isnt it great when you mnake a great friend in collage but you find out he/she lives halfway around the world, to know that you can still keep in touch with the computer, did you know that many people in the in the military use videochat to keep in touch with their loved one back home? Computers are great because they connect people and allow them to be together even when they cannot be together, but there is still one even better reason why computers are good. Finally, computers ofter many opportunities like education and jobs. Today there are many single parrents more than in any other time according to @ORGANIZATION1 and the number is still drastickly increasing with this economy some of those parrents could really use a better education to help them bring in more money for their familys, but when can they find time to go to school with work and then the kids? Now there are many online collage courses you can take to get the education you have always wanted with kraigslist and other online adds many people can post job ofering while others can email those people their resume to try to get the job, but by seeing adds posted online people can apply easier from farther away. Computers open many great oppertunities for people. Computers are very cool machines that many people take fergranted, they help give people information, as well as connect people from around the world and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 oppertunities. So @LOCATION1 Newspaper I hope you can try to understand my view on why computers are so great. Today, the importance of computers in our daily lives cannot be overstated. From facilitating easy access to a wealth of information to connecting individuals globally and providing numerous educational and job opportunities, computers have truly revolutionized the way we live and interact. Let us continue to appreciate and utilize these incredible tools for the betterment of society.
169	169	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, after reading your article about advances in technology, I would like to offer my opinion about this controversial subject. All around the world, people are using computers to do all sorts of things; whether it's for games, the buying and selling of items, or talking with people in different countries; the possibilities are endless. This is, however, not necessarily a good thing. Many people become addicted to computers, especially adolescents who enjoy the games that computers offer.  From personal experience being addicted to computers, I can honestly say that I was almost completely controlled by that computer. My grades started to go down, I stopped interacting with my friends and family, and trouble on things. Many parents watch their children go through this and are sometimes helpless to stop it. This poses a large problem for parents. My word of advice; don't let your children become addicted!  In conclusion, while technology has brought about many advancements and conveniences, it is essential to be mindful of the potential negative impacts, such as addiction. It is crucial for individuals, especially parents, to monitor and regulate computer usage to ensure a healthy balance in life.
170	170	1	3	There are some effects computers have on people that I agree with and disagree with. While computers provide access to information and facilitate communication, they can also be addictive and lead to laziness. However, the benefits of computers, such as instant messaging and online shopping, outweigh the drawbacks. It is important to find a balance and not spend too much time on the computer. Overall, I believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals.
171	171	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers is that some people are spending too much time on computers, which can have negative consequences. One reason for this is that excessive computer use can lead to a lack of physical activity. Instead of being cooped up indoors on the computer all day, it's important to go outside, engage in sports, or simply take a walk to stay healthy and fit. Furthermore, spending too much time on computers can also lead to social isolation as individuals may neglect spending time with friends and family in favor of screen time.  Another detrimental effect of prolonged computer use is the potential for weight gain. Sitting for extended periods while using a computer can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, which can lead to health issues such as obesity. It is essential to balance computer use with physical activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, excessive computer use can expose individuals to harmful content online, potentially leading to addiction or engaging in inappropriate behavior.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is crucial to limit screen time and prioritize physical activities and social interactions for overall well-being. Finding a balance between technology use and real-world experiences is key to maintaining a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.
172	172	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I agree that excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and contribute to the rising rates of obesity in our country. It is important for people to balance their time spent online with physical activity and real-life interactions. While the internet provides valuable information and allows for communication with others, it should not replace outdoor activities and face-to-face socializing. By engaging in exercise and spending time with friends and family, individuals can improve their overall health and well-being. It is essential to prioritize real-world experiences over virtual ones to lead a fulfilling and active lifestyle. Let's encourage each other to disconnect from our screens and embrace the benefits of a more active and social life.
173	173	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  Computers play a crucial role in our daily lives, from work to education and even entertainment. Without computers, many people would be out of jobs and struggling to make ends meet. People rely on computers for various tasks such as fixing them, making them, selling them, and working from home.  In the education sector, computers are essential for students to access information, research, and learn new things. They provide a platform for students to explore and expand their knowledge, even in situations where traditional methods may not be feasible, such as when a student is unable to hold a pencil due to an injury.  Moreover, computers facilitate communication and access to resources that were previously unavailable. Whether it's finding directions, phone numbers, or answers to questions, computers have made information more accessible than ever before. Additionally, online shopping has become a convenient way for people to purchase items that may not be available locally.  While computers have undoubtedly improved our lives in many ways, it is also important to remember the importance of physical exercise. Encouraging people to get off the computer and engage in physical activity can help prevent health issues such as obesity, laziness, and depression. Regular exercise is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and overall well-being.  In conclusion, computers are a vital part of our modern world, but it is crucial to find a balance between utilizing technology and taking care of our physical health. By incorporating regular exercise into our daily routine, we can ensure a healthier and more fulfilling life for ourselves and future generations.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
174	174	1	3	Computers have become essential in our daily lives, offering a wide range of benefits and opportunities. They have revolutionized the way we handle finances, making transactions quick and convenient through online banking and secure payment methods. Additionally, computers have opened up new avenues for artists and graphic designers to create stunning visuals that were once impossible to achieve by hand.  Furthermore, computers are invaluable tools for research and educational activities, allowing students of all ages to access information at their fingertips. The entertainment factor cannot be overlooked, with the ability to play games, watch videos, and listen to music providing endless hours of enjoyment.  However, it is important to acknowledge the potential downsides of excessive computer use. Addiction to online games or social media can have detrimental effects on one's personal and social life, leading to isolation and other negative consequences. It is crucial to maintain a healthy balance and use computers responsibly to avoid these pitfalls.  In conclusion, while computers offer countless benefits and opportunities, it is essential to approach their use with caution and moderation. By harnessing the power of technology wisely, we can fully enjoy the advantages it brings without falling victim to its potential drawbacks.
175	175	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,  Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, with social networking sites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 dominating the online world. While computers offer numerous benefits, excessive use can have negative effects on society.  One major concern is the rise in obesity among children, with @PERCENT1 of @CAPS7 kids being overweight. Sitting in front of a computer for hours on end, snacking on unhealthy foods like Oreos, @LOCATION1, can contribute to this issue. It is crucial for individuals to balance computer usage with physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  Furthermore, the prevalence of social media platforms has led to cyberbullying and other harmful online behaviors. Posting hurtful messages or inappropriate images can have devastating consequences, as seen in tragic cases where individuals have been deeply affected by online interactions. It is essential for users, especially young people, to exercise caution and responsibility when engaging in online activities.  As we progress towards becoming leaders in @LOCATION2, it is vital that we do not become overly reliant on computers for social interaction and information. Exploring the world around us and engaging in meaningful experiences offline is equally important for personal growth and development. By finding a balance between technology and real-world connections, we can mitigate the negative impacts of excessive computer use and cultivate a healthier society.  In conclusion, while computers offer tremendous advantages, it is crucial to use them in moderation and prioritize physical activity, real-life interactions, and responsible online behavior. By fostering a healthy relationship with technology, we can ensure a brighter future for ourselves and the generations to come.
176	176	1	3	Computers and the internet were once seen as technological breakthroughs that opened up a world of possibilities. However, as their usage has increased over the years, they have become a dangerous addiction that is threatening lives. I have been faced with a choice - to support this addictive behavior or to oppose it. The only clear choice is to oppose it.  One of the negative impacts of excessive computer usage is the decrease in physical exercise. Studies have shown that a large percentage of people who spend a significant amount of time on computers do not engage in regular exercise. This has led to a rise in obesity and health problems around the world. By reducing computer use, we can encourage people to prioritize their health and well-being through physical activity.  Additionally, the internet has given rise to online predators who prey on unsuspecting individuals, especially young people. The anonymity of the online world makes it easier for predators to target their victims. This has resulted in tragic incidents of harm and even death. It is crucial to limit computer usage to protect individuals from falling victim to such dangers.  Moreover, excessive time spent on computers can lead to a disconnect from family and friends. Online gaming addictions, in particular, can cause individuals to isolate themselves from their loved ones. This can strain relationships and lead to dysfunction within families. It is essential to address this issue and encourage people to prioritize real-life interactions over virtual ones.  In conclusion, it is evident that the addictive nature of computers and the internet poses significant risks to individuals and society as a whole. By taking steps to limit computer usage and promote a healthy balance between technology and real-life interactions, we can work towards a safer and more connected world. It is imperative to act now before the negative consequences of computer addiction become irreversible.
177	177	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that computers are a big benefit to society these days. There is so much to learn on a computer. And it is a lot more fun to learn off a computer than a book. For instance, let's say a student had to do a report, but he couldn't get his hands on any book at all. All the student would have to do is type in a few words on the internet and hundreds of websites pop about any topic he wants to learn. Another reason that a computer benefits society is ways to keep in contact with family and friends if they live too far away. Like me for instance, I live far from my friends. And the only way I could talk to them outside of school was on a computer. We would be able to talk in a chat room or on a game. The same goes with Family. Let's say your children go on vacation and want to keep in touch. All you would have to do is type as much as you want and click send, and it's at the other computer instantly. But if you were to write a letter through the mail, it would take maybe a week or two to reach your child or the other way around. But most of all, there are so many cool things you can do on a computer. There are a bunch of games to play, or videos to watch. You can make music and make money off of it. My favorite would have to be the computer programs. Flash Macromedia is the best though. You get to make your animation clips or even a movie. Computers are really fun to play on. A computer has so many advantages in today's society, which I'm very thankful for computers and all of the great stuff they do. That is why I believe computers benefit society.  In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of benefits to society, from facilitating learning and communication to providing entertainment and creative opportunities. Their impact is significant in enhancing our daily lives and fostering connections in an increasingly digital world.
178	178	1	3	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 play a big role in our world today. For example people use computers to get imformation, talk in chat rooms, mainly to talk to friends and fined friends. I think this @CAPS6 messing people up. My first reson for thinking computers @CAPS6 messing people up @CAPS6 because of the impformation that @CAPS6 on the website. For example people past, and blog lies about people online. This @CAPS6 ruining many people because this starts rumors and gossip about people. Also the lies that are being posted could interfear with many lives. Another reason computers effect the lives and people @CAPS6 the dangerous chat rooms.

Like you might give them you number, adress, @CAPS2 personal imformation. The outcome to endup in death, kidnapping, @CAPS2 ciber bullying. Lastly, I want to talk about the false imformation that @CAPS6 given to thousands of people online. Another words the""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Your @CAPS4 love"" @CAPS2""@CAPS6 Your @CAPS7 @CAPS8 On You?"" @CAPS9 these things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you. On the other hand they attract the readers attention. For example these passages are set to copy down your number, get your account number then take your money. This doesnt help our peole because its only there for your money. In conclusion from my veiwible stand piont I dont prefer computers a magnificient way for people to spend there time on.  Computers play a significant role in society today, facilitating information exchange and communication. However, there are negative aspects associated with their use. The dissemination of false information online can lead to rumors and gossip, impacting people's lives. Furthermore, engaging in chat rooms with strangers can pose dangers such as identity theft or cyberbullying. Additionally, deceptive tactics like clickbait are used to exploit individuals for financial gain. Considering these factors, it is essential to approach computer use with caution and awareness of potential risks."
179	179	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, You @MONTH1 have heard that there are up-sides and down-sides to using a computer. There are many more up-sides though. For example, you can communicate with people, conduct business, and you can use it to learn. A computer is a big need in today's growing technological advances. Communication is not as easy to do by phone anymore because people are always busy and on the computer. You can use computers to meet people from different countries. By doing this we can learn what life is like for them. Through social networks, such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can make plans with friends. Computers are an important communication technology. Today most business is conducted over the internet or on a computer. The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is all computerized today, and that is a major trade way today. A lot of business transactions and presentations are done out on a computer for maximum efficiency. Computers allow us to conduct business with foreign countries without having to go there. Computers are a huge advancement in business. Computers help us learn a lot about, just about, everything. Search engines let us type in keywords and find multiple websites on that topic. Computers let us research so we get correct information with just a click. This research can be used to write essays in school. Computers help us to learn in school and outside of it. A computer is a huge technological advancement with many uses. It @MONTH1 have a few down-sides, but it has many more up-sides. Computers allow you to communicate, conduct business, and learn. Life would be much slower without a computer to speed things up.  In conclusion, the benefits of using a computer far outweigh the drawbacks. From communication to conducting business and learning, computers play a vital role in our daily lives. Embracing technology and utilizing computers can greatly enhance efficiency and connectivity in various aspects of life.
180	180	1	3	In my opinion, having computers is a very nice thing and does good in our society. I think this because of three reasons. First, it allows people to relax and wind down after a long day of work. Second, it allows people to communicate with their friends. Third, it helps with schoolwork and makes things much easier. These are only a few of the reasons why computers do good in our society. To start off, I'd like to say that after a long day of work, all you want to do is relax. Television gets boring and you just want to sit and play games on the computer. Well, that's a great way of winding down on a rough day. You can go on YouTube and watch funny videos or go on Facebook and see your friend's new photo album. Your personal computer is capable of doing many things. There are so many games, such as Fortnite or Minecraft, that can be a lot of fun. Do you see why the computer is a good way of calming down? Other than winding you down on a rough day at work, the computer allows you to communicate with friends and family. AIM is a good way to talk to friends and plan get-togethers. Or, you can just have a simple chat. Facebook and Twitter are great websites to keep in touch with old friends or even make new friends. A lot of teenagers and adults have Facebook because it gets addictive. So addictive that you can't get off it. As you get older, you don't talk to your friends that much and soon you don't have many friends at all. Facebook prevents that so you can always talk to them. You should always keep in touch with friends. Most importantly, you use the computer for schoolwork. Without it, you can't get pictures off Google or type an essay that's due. Also, you can't search words on Google. Some teachers require you to type out essays and others don't. You need a computer if your teacher requires you to type things. I go on my school's website to see if I have homework due and that helps me out a lot. Some teachers put extra credit online. All in all, computers are good for society. You can just calm down and relax. Second, you can talk to old friends and keep in touch with new ones. And most importantly, it's very useful when it comes to schoolwork and looking up information. Now you must understand why I tell you that computers are important and very useful in society.
181	181	1	3	Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have been a part of our lives for many years now, revolutionizing the way we live, work, and communicate. With the advent of the internet, computers have become even more indispensable, offering a wide range of benefits to society.  One of the key advantages of computers is their ability to improve hand-eye coordination. Research has shown that playing computer games can enhance reflexes and help individuals develop better coordination skills. This is not only important for recreational purposes but can also have practical applications, as seen in cases where doctors recommend computer games to improve eye focus.  Furthermore, computers serve as a vast repository of information, accessible to people of all ages. Schools often rely on computers for research purposes, allowing students to delve into a wealth of knowledge and resources. This easy access to information is crucial for educational advancement and personal growth.  In addition, computers play a vital role in connecting people, especially those who are geographically separated. Whether it's through email, instant messaging, or video calls, computers enable us to stay in touch with friends and family members who are far away. This form of communication has become essential in today's world, bridging the gap between individuals and fostering relationships.  Overall, computers have become an integral part of modern society, offering benefits that range from improving coordination to providing access to information and facilitating communication. In today's digital age, having access to a computer is not just a convenience but a necessity for thriving in all aspects of life.
182	182	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think more people shouldn't spend all their time on their computers. People should prioritize spending time with their family and friends, getting more exercise, and enjoying the outdoors.   When individuals spend excessive hours on their computers, they tend to isolate themselves indoors and miss out on the beauty of nature. It's essential to step outside, breathe in fresh air, and appreciate the wonders of the natural world. Observing animals in their natural habitat can be a rewarding experience that cannot be replicated through a screen.  Moreover, prolonged computer use contributes to a sedentary lifestyle, leading to health issues like weight gain and laziness. Engaging in physical activities such as walking, running, cycling, or playing sports is crucial for maintaining a healthy body and mind. It's important to prioritize movement and exercise over screen time.  Additionally, excessive computer usage can hinder social interactions with friends and family. Building strong relationships with loved ones requires quality time spent together, creating memories and strengthening bonds. Neglecting these connections due to computer addiction can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression.  In conclusion, it is vital for individuals to find a balance between technology use and real-world experiences. By spending more time with loved ones, prioritizing physical activity, and appreciating the beauty of nature, people can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives. Let's not let our screens take away from the joys of living in the present moment.
183	183	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I overheard some people talking about how much time their families spend on the computer. My opinion is that they should not be on the computer staring at a screen for long periods of time. I think this because it takes away time from important tasks, there is something healthier than enclosing yourself with a computer monitor, that would be going outside or being active. Another reason is that you can have more time being around family and friends. First, you shouldn't be spending so much time on the computer. You could be getting other tasks done. Such @CAPS2 working, or for most teens, doing homework. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teens get easily distracted by social networking websites such @CAPS2 ""@CAPS1"". ""twitter"", and ""aol"". People in the workplace are distracted two. Sometimes the job can get boring, so workers just go on the computer instead of getting things done. Children could be doing chores or just helping around the house a little, but they go on the computer instead. Teens regular routine consists of waking up, getting ready, soing on the computer, school, coming home, snack, and then going back to the computer. We need to break those habits of going back to the computer. Staring at a computer screen for long periods of time is not healthy. Instead, you could be active in a sport, or just going outside and playing."" @CAPS2 technology goes up seizure rates have also gone up."" @CAPS3 to a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1. Being involved in a sport would be healthier and more fun that talking to people online. Also, your not exercising while on the computer, being active keeps your shape along with being fun. The most important reason you shouldn't be on the computer for a long time is because your using valuable time you could have used to spend with family and friends. Most people barely see their family when their at home because their consumed in the computer. Laptops have made it easier to block people out. Bringing it into your room and shutting the door, is the most common way. Hang out with the friends your already talking to online, wouldn't it be better in person? In conclusion, we should limit our computer time to do other tasks, be active, and spend time with friends and family."
184	184	1	3	Dear readers,   I urge you to consider the detrimental effects of allowing children to spend excessive time on the computer. This habit can lead to a lack of focus in school, an unhealthy obsession with technology, and ultimately, physical health issues such as weight gain.   Firstly, prolonged computer use can distract children from their schoolwork, leading to poor academic performance. When children spend hours on the computer, they may struggle to concentrate in class and prioritize their studies. This can have long-lasting consequences on their education and future prospects.   Moreover, excessive computer usage can cultivate an unhealthy attachment to technology. Children who spend too much time on the computer may constantly talk about it, neglecting other aspects of their lives. This can result in social isolation and a lack of diverse interests and experiences.   Most importantly, prolonged computer use can contribute to physical health problems, such as obesity. When children spend all their time indoors on the computer, they miss out on opportunities for exercise and fresh air. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to weight gain and related health issues.   In conclusion, it is crucial to limit children's computer time to ensure their well-being and development. By encouraging a balanced approach to technology use, we can help children thrive academically, socially, and physically. Let us prioritize our children's health and future by promoting moderation in computer usage.   Thank you for considering these important points.
185	185	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are many people who use computers in this advanced technology era. Lots of people find that having computers comes with numerous benefits. However, not everyone agrees with this. @CAPS2 are many people who believe that excessive computer usage takes away time from enjoying nature, exercising, and interacting with family and friends. Despite these concerns, I believe that computers offer valuable opportunities for people, such as facilitating communication with distant friends, providing access to vast amounts of information, and offering entertainment options.  One significant effect of computers is that they enable individuals to communicate with people they may not see frequently. In today's world, not all friends attend the same school or live in close proximity. Therefore, platforms like email, MySpace, and Facebook allow individuals to stay connected with distant friends without the need for physical meetings. This is especially convenient when busy schedules make it challenging to meet in person.  Another essential aspect of computers is their capability to provide access to a wealth of information. When working on projects or assignments, having a computer allows individuals to research and gather essential data easily. Additionally, for travel planning, computers offer information on destinations, costs, and travel times, making the process more efficient and convenient compared to traditional methods.  Moreover, computers offer a variety of entertainment options, giving individuals something to do during their leisure time. Whether playing games, watching videos on platforms like YouTube, or downloading music, computers provide endless entertainment possibilities to keep individuals engaged and entertained.  In conclusion, while concerns exist about the impact of excessive computer usage on other activities, the benefits of computers in facilitating communication, providing information, and offering entertainment cannot be overlooked. Ultimately, computers play a crucial role in enhancing connectivity, knowledge acquisition, and leisure activities in today's digital age.
186	186	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  Computers have negative effects on people in various ways. One significant impact is on people's health. With the sedentary lifestyle that comes with prolonged computer use, individuals often fail to get enough exercise, leading to obesity and potential health issues like diabetes. Furthermore, the rise of cyberbullying on the internet has become a pressing concern. The emotional toll of being bullied online can lead to depression and, tragically, in extreme cases, even suicide. Lastly, the excessive use of computers can detrimentally affect academic performance. Students may neglect their studies, prioritize screen time over homework, and become disengaged from school, ultimately leading to poor grades or even dropping out.  In conclusion, the detrimental effects of computers on individuals cannot be overlooked. From physical health to emotional well-being and academic success, the negative repercussions of excessive computer usage are evident. It is crucial to raise awareness about these issues and promote a healthy balance between technology and other aspects of life.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
187	187	1	3	Dear newspaper,   I believe that people should have computers because they offer numerous benefits. Children can play educational games to help them learn, such as math games or reading activities. Adults can use computers to access websites for workout videos, pay bills online, and even complete work tasks. While there are concerns about children using computers for non-educational purposes like watching YouTube or browsing social media, the advantages of having a computer outweigh the negatives. Overall, computers are essential tools that can greatly enhance both learning and productivity for people of all ages.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]
188	188	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, Some people say computers have negative effects on family and friends, while others argue that computers are an essential aspect of society. I align myself with the latter group. Computers play a crucial role in helping students research information needed for school projects and papers. While some may argue that computers take away from family time, the efficiency and convenience they offer cannot be ignored.  One significant advantage of using computers for research is the quick and easy access to vast amounts of information. Unlike traditional methods like books, where one may have to sift through pages to find relevant information, computers allow users to navigate through multiple sources with just a few clicks. This not only saves time but also ensures that students can gather a wealth of information efficiently.  Furthermore, computers enable people to stay connected with friends and family, especially in today's digital age. Platforms like Facebook provide a convenient way to communicate with loved ones, even when miles apart. Chat rooms also offer the opportunity to meet new people and make friends from different parts of the world, enhancing social connections and fostering a sense of community.  In addition, computers simplify the writing process, allowing users to draft, edit, and finalize their work with ease. The ability to save drafts and make revisions electronically streamlines the writing process, making it more efficient and less time-consuming. Moreover, tools like spell checkers help improve spelling and grammar, enhancing the overall quality of written work.  In conclusion, while some may argue that computers have negative effects on family and friends, the benefits they offer in terms of research, communication, and writing far outweigh any potential drawbacks. In today's fast-paced world, computers have become an indispensable tool in both academic and social settings, enhancing productivity and connectivity. It is essential to embrace technology and its advancements to navigate the modern world effectively.
189	189	1	3	Dear Newspaper, everywhere you turn there is technology. It's not going to change. Try a schedule. Encouragement helps a lot of people. Activities keep your mind off things. Scheduling is important. Limit the time on the computer. For every half hour, at least 10 minutes outside or with friends. Try to memorize the schedule. Encouragement helps me and a lot of people! Try to encourage family and friends. The government is also trying to fight this. Encouragement helps. Activities can keep people off the computer. Try neighborhood activities. After-school activities for a while. All kinds of stuff are fun. Do you think scheduling helps? Do you like encouragement? Do activities keep your mind off things? Then by far, this stuff helps.
190	190	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, can you imagine a world where technology controls human interaction? It's not such a far-fetched idea. Some people may see this as a great advancement, but I beg to differ. I believe that computers have negative effects on people, detaching them from reality, creating false personas, and offering no physical benefits.  First and foremost, computers detach individuals from reality. It's much easier to spend hours online, browsing through social media, than to go out and engage with real people. Face-to-face interactions allow for genuine connections and first impressions that cannot be replicated through a screen. Moreover, excessive computer use can also impact the time spent with family members, further isolating individuals from meaningful relationships.  Additionally, computers enable the creation of false personas. On social networking sites, it is simple to fabricate information about oneself or others, leading to superficial connections based on inaccurate representations. This can ultimately lead to unstable and insincere relationships, as true identities are masked behind screens.  Lastly, the excessive use of computers offers no physical benefits and may contribute to the deteriorating health of individuals. In a society already struggling with health issues such as obesity and addiction, the sedentary nature of computer usage exacerbates these problems. Discipline is essential in regulating computer usage to ensure a balance between virtual and real-life interactions.  In conclusion, a world dominated by computers may lead to detrimental consequences, including detachment from reality, the proliferation of false personas, and a lack of physical well-being. It is crucial to recognize the importance of human connection and moderation in technology usage to preserve genuine relationships and overall health. Let us not allow technology to overshadow the essence of humanity.
191	191	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1, I understand that you have some concerns about computers. I don't think you should be concerned though. You should not be concerned because computers are very positive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with family and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another amazing thing about computers is that you can learn about faraway places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feel like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meet in person. Finally, when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy. In conclusion, I think computers are a great, fun, and helpful invention. Remember these good characteristics that computers have and please don't take computers away; we need them.
192	192	1	3	How many times do you use the computer in one day? A lot, right? Computers definitely benefit society in many ways. The internet, in particular, has made life more convenient for people. It allows for easy communication with others online and provides a wealth of information. For example, when studying, the internet can be a valuable resource for finding additional materials. Additionally, the internet plays a crucial role in job searching, with a significant percentage of people finding employment opportunities online. Furthermore, online shopping has become increasingly popular, making it easier for people to purchase items they need.   Moreover, computers provide access to information about faraway places that many people may not have the opportunity to visit. Through online research, individuals can learn about different cultures, traditions, and even connect with people from around the world. This can enhance one's knowledge and understanding of the global community.   Furthermore, computers enable people to stay connected with others, even when physical distance separates them. Social media platforms and dating sites allow individuals to maintain relationships and form new connections. This online communication has become essential for many people, especially in today's digital age.  In conclusion, computers have significantly impacted society by providing access to information, facilitating communication, and connecting people across the globe. The benefits of computers are undeniable, and they continue to play a vital role in shaping our modern world.
193	193	1	3	Dear @PERSON1 weekly, The new millennium brought a new wave of technology with computers being the main invention that is widely used by everyone. Computers have revolutionized the way we learn about different vacation spots and countries, allowing us to explore new destinations like @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION3. They have become essential tools for students, providing a wealth of information for projects and essays. Additionally, computers play a crucial role in helping us stay connected with friends and family who are far away, enabling us to communicate through video calls and emails. Moreover, computers also enhance our hand-eye coordination, which is beneficial for activities like playing sports such as @CAPS2. In conclusion, computers are indispensable in today's world, offering a plethora of benefits such as access to information, communication with loved ones, and improving cognitive skills like hand-eye coordination.
194	194	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you want our society to become one of obese, lazy individuals with no appreciation for family or friends? Do you want people to lack respect for nature? Excessive computer usage can lead to a society that is lazy, dependent on technology, and disconnected from the world around them. As seen in @CAPS3 @NUM1, a society overly reliant on technology can lead to brainwashing and manipulation by those in power. If we continue down this path, our society may collapse from within, losing its status as a respected world power.  Research has shown that a significant percentage of individuals who spend excessive time on computers are overweight. This sedentary lifestyle not only affects physical health but also leads to social isolation. Building meaningful relationships with family and friends is crucial for mental well-being, as @PERSON1, a renowned psychologist, points out. Without these connections, individuals may experience loneliness and depression.  Furthermore, the lack of respect for nature that comes with excessive computer usage can have dire consequences. Nature sustains us in countless ways, and failing to appreciate and protect it can lead to catastrophic outcomes. We must remember that everything we have and do is connected to nature, and neglecting this relationship can result in environmental degradation and harm to our own well-being.  It is essential to find a balance in our computer usage to prevent these negative outcomes. By limiting our screen time, we can prioritize real-life interactions, maintain our physical health, and foster a deeper connection with nature. Let us not become a society that sacrifices these fundamental aspects of life for the sake of technology. It is time to take control of our habits before it is too late.
195	195	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 idea about ""Computers"" is very well thought outside of the box. Well. We sure need computers to look up information these days. Why do we need them now and they didn't exist before? Research shows over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 say computers are everything. Let me explain a little bit further what I mean. First, you can look up places, chat with friends and family. @CAPS1 opinion about using the local internet would be that it's good only for those who know and not trying to be mean. For the little world, never should get to bed at least @NUM1 pm, and never forget about the nature outside for fresh air. In conclusion, the internet these days is very good for people."
196	196	1	3	I think the use of computers is very beneficial in today's society. They serve as a valuable tool for research, communication with friends and family, and music enjoyment. Computers provide a convenient platform for conducting research on various topics, aiding both students and adults in their quest for information. Additionally, they enable individuals to stay connected with loved ones through video calls, social media platforms, and instant messaging. Furthermore, computers offer endless possibilities for music enthusiasts, allowing them to listen to music, create their own compositions, and transfer songs to portable devices. Overall, computers play a vital role in modern life, enhancing productivity and facilitating various forms of entertainment.
197	197	1	3	Dear newspaper, computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, offering a wealth of information and opportunities at our fingertips. Whether it's for school projects, planning trips, or staying informed with the latest news, computers play a crucial role in facilitating our tasks and enriching our experiences.   When faced with a challenging science project or a research assignment, computers provide us with unlimited resources and information to enhance our work. They allow us to delve deeper into topics, explore various perspectives, and ultimately achieve better results. Additionally, when seeking out deals for vacations or planning road trips, computers offer us the convenience of comparing options, finding the best deals, and making informed decisions.   Furthermore, staying connected to the world through the internet allows us to be aware of important events, such as natural disasters or global initiatives, and empowers us to contribute to meaningful causes. Computers not only help us academically and socially but also enhance our overall quality of life by keeping us engaged, informed, and prepared for any situation.   In conclusion, the importance of computers in our modern world cannot be overstated. They serve as valuable tools that enable us to learn, explore, connect, and make informed choices. Embracing the power of technology opens up endless possibilities and enriches our lives in countless ways.
198	198	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper,  Statistics show that 80% of humans in the city alone spend most of their time on a computer or laptop. I believe that the effect of computers has a negative impact on humans because it leads to a lack of exercise and limits physical interaction with others. As a nation, we can lower this statistic and create a healthier environment for all.  The amount of people lacking sufficient exercise has risen in the past decade. Doctor Smith, an expert in the connections between health and computers, surveyed 100 people. Out of those surveyed, 70% said they rarely go outside because they are trapped in the cyber world. This shocking percentage indicates that only one in twenty people actually get some type of exercise. Dr. Smith stated, ""This shocking statistic means that most - if not all - people are physically unhealthy, which is a problem that must be addressed."" He goes on to explain that being on a computer for most of the day and not exercising is a contributing factor to this unhealthiness.  In addition to lacking exercise, many humans are losing the physical interaction they should have. As humans have become more modernized with technology, they are losing out on the physical interaction they would normally have if they were not on the computer. A college graduate, Jane, shared her experience, saying, ""I wasn't always like this. When I was younger, I owned a computer. As soon as I got home from school, I would always go on the computer. I wouldn't talk to anyone - not even my family! If I could go back and change that, I would."" This highlights the importance of physical human interaction in living a fulfilling life.  The lack of human interaction and exercise are problems that need to be addressed urgently. In conclusion, the use of computers has sparked a growing epidemic in the city. The most crucial reasons why computers have a negative impact on humans are the limitations on exercise and the destruction of physical interactions between individuals. Thank you for your attention, and remember, computers can have a negative effect on many human lives.  Warm regards, [Your Name]"
199	199	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, click, clack that the sound @ORGANIZATION2 computer keys being hit right now. Computers are everywhere these days, even in the poorest places like @LOCATION3. In @LOCATION2, humble computers are becoming a dominant force in our lives, overshadowing the simple joys and pleasures that life has to offer. While computers serve as valuable sources of information and entertainment, their excessive use is leading to detrimental effects on our health and relationships.  The constant use of computers can result in various health issues such as vision problems and obesity. Sitting in front of a screen for extended periods without engaging in physical activity can lead to weight gain and other related health issues. Studies have shown that prolonged computer use is a significant contributing factor to obesity, highlighting the negative impact it can have on our well-being.  Moreover, the prevalence of computers in our daily lives is affecting the quality of family time. Many families are finding themselves spending less time together due to individual members being engrossed in their own computer activities. This lack of familial bonding can have long-term consequences, as research suggests that children who spend quality time with their families tend to develop into better parents themselves.  Furthermore, the excessive use of computers is detaching us from nature, preventing us from appreciating the beauty and serenity it offers. People are often too preoccupied with their digital devices to notice the wonders of the natural world around them. This disconnect from nature not only deprives us of its benefits but also leads to missed opportunities for meaningful experiences and memories.  It is essential to strike a balance between the convenience of technology and the essence of life beyond screens. By limiting our dependence on computers, we can prioritize our health, strengthen our relationships, and reconnect with the beauty of nature. Let us take control of our lives and make conscious choices that enrich our well-being and experiences. Say no to excessive computer use and embrace a lifestyle that values health, family, and the wonders of the natural world.
200	200	1	3	Dear Readers of @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention that there is a dilemma on the effect of computers on people. Well, I believe that having computers around is good because they offer various benefits.   Firstly, computers are essential for students as they help them with their school work. When assignments need to be completed, using a computer can make the work look neater and more professional, potentially leading to higher grades. In a poll conducted at a college university, it was found that a significant percentage of students heavily rely on their computers to succeed in their classes.   Secondly, computers provide the opportunity to learn about faraway places and different countries. Many individuals use computers to stay informed about global events and cultures. This access to information broadens one's knowledge and understanding of the world.   Lastly, computers facilitate communication with others, especially through webcams. In situations where physical distance separates loved ones, webcams allow for real-time interactions, bridging the gap between people regardless of where they are located.   In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in enhancing education, expanding knowledge, and enabling connections among individuals. Their presence in our lives has undoubtedly brought about numerous advantages, making them valuable tools in today's society.
201	201	1	3	Computers and modern technology are advancing quickly, and more and more people are beginning to use them. Some people say that computers are a bad influence on society. I think otherwise. I believe computers are an amazing breakthrough in modern science. Computers are ideal for school work and communicating with others, as long as they are used in moderation. Computers make school projects simple and efficient. The internet provides a vast amount of educational and informational resources, making research for papers and projects easy and convenient. Programs like Microsoft Office offer tools for creating visually appealing presentations. Additionally, computers are a great way to communicate with friends and family through email, chat, and video calls. However, it is essential to use computers in moderation, as excessive use can have negative effects on health and well-being. Overall, computers have revolutionized the way we work, learn, and connect with others, and their continuous advancements promise even more exciting possibilities in the future.
202	202	1	3	I completely agree with those who believe that computers have a negative impact on our society today. While computers offer a wide range of benefits, such as advanced technology and online connectivity, they also bring about detrimental effects. One major concern is the rise of cyberbullying, leading to tragic consequences like suicides among young individuals. The ease of sharing personal information and images online can result in compromising situations and privacy violations. Additionally, the addictive nature of computer games can lead to neglect of important responsibilities like schoolwork, physical activity, and family time. Most importantly, the issue of online predators poses a significant threat to individuals' safety, emphasizing the need for caution and vigilance when engaging in online activities. It is crucial for users to prioritize their well-being and security over the allure of technology, ensuring a balanced and safe utilization of computers in today's digital age.
203	203	1	3	Dear Newspaper,   Computers play a crucial role in our lives, offering a multitude of benefits that help us in various ways. One significant advantage is how computers enable individuals who are unable to travel due to physical or mental limitations to explore the world through the internet. By accessing pictures and information online, people can broaden their horizons and experience places they may never physically visit. Additionally, computers can assist individuals in overcoming their fears of traveling to new destinations by providing resources and guidance online. This empowerment can lead to personal growth and open up opportunities for those who may have otherwise been restricted.  Furthermore, computers serve as a vital tool for communication, especially in urgent situations where important messages need to be conveyed quickly. In times of conflict, the ability to send a message to clarify misunderstandings or prevent escalations can be crucial in averting potential crises. For instance, in the event of a security threat, such as a bomb in a public building, prompt communication through computers can save lives by alerting authorities and facilitating necessary actions to ensure safety.  Moreover, computers facilitate connections between individuals separated by distance, such as military personnel deployed far from their families. Through video calls and social media platforms, loved ones can stay in touch and maintain strong relationships despite the physical separation. Reconnecting with old friends or family members through online platforms can also reignite relationships and foster a sense of belonging and support.  In conclusion, the utility of computers in our daily lives cannot be overstated. From enhancing our understanding of the world to enabling crucial communication and fostering relationships, computers play a vital role in shaping our experiences and interactions. While there may be challenges and drawbacks associated with technology, the benefits it brings in terms of connectivity, information access, and support far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Embracing the possibilities that computers offer can lead to positive outcomes and enrich our lives in numerous ways.
204	204	1	3	You want my opinion on the effects computers have on people? Well, I believe that computers help people educate people and some computers people relie on. It's time to decide if you agree with me that computers have positive effects on people. Do you agree with me that computers can help people? Say for example you have a question no one in your home can answer. Why not search it on the internet? Of course, once in a while you're going to get a school project. Surely you'll need information, but the library is closed. And you don't know what to do. Simple, all you have to do is research it on your computer. Don't you agree that computers help people? I remember this one time I entered a writing contest, and the story I needed was lost, then I remembered I put it in my computer. Computers can be relied on by people. Just think about it! Almost over 50% of jobs out in the world rely on the technology of a computer. For example, the accounting job. It would be kind of hard to keep track of how much trash is thrown out every year without a computer, surely banks use computers too! To keep track of everyone's allowance and money situations. Let's not forget about what lawyers do. There are some lawyers in court who use the computer to type up every word said. They turn the words into shorthand to keep up with what people are saying. Did you know that without these computers, over half a million jobs in the world would fail? Some people would agree that some online games are educational. For example, there is WordWhizzle. That game teaches you words you probably never seen before. And don't forget Math Playground. That game improves your counting of numbers. Last, but not least would be Lumosity. That game sharpens your skills and exercises your brain. Strategy comes in handy, surely you now see that some games are very educational. In conclusion, I agree that the effects computers have on people are positive. Because computers help people, are reliable, and can educate people. It's now or never, do you agree that computers have positive effects on people?
205	205	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1. I've just been informed about how people view computers and the effects of them. In my opinion, I find computers to be a very negative influence on young kids, teens, and adults. Many harmful awarenesses come along with having one. For one thing, people being so hypnotized in this electronical device are finding lesser time to exercise and take care of themselves. Also too, the only nature they're experiencing is pictures online and not enjoying the full beauty of what we have left of our earth. Another negative outcome is that they start becoming more and more distant from their loved ones. What happened to our society? Why can't we think on our own anymore? I truly, strongly hope that what I'm saying will change the minds of some people. Thank you very much. Exercise is a very key aspect in anyone's life. Especially growing kids and teens. On the computer what exercise benefits are you getting? Stronger fingers? A higher chance of syndrome @CAPS10. ""@CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of kids having @CAPS7 problems like obesity have access to the internet"", according to @PERSON2 of the, ""@CAPS3 feel right with @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"" in Huntington Beach, @LOCATION1. When basically, you're giving yourself to the computers, you may not have any thoughts at all of staying fit. Instead of snacking on some chips while typing. Do computers really provide any benefits in that regard? With global warming outside, what you saw yesterday may not be there today. Breathing in some fresh, natural air can really calm a stressed child out. Whatever happened to playing an endless game of hopscotch with sidewalk chalk and friends? Or tag or just running around? Is it not cool anymore? Yeah, it's not cool to take care of yourself. Inspire yourself by writing poems about how you feel or drawing a scenery. Nowadays, instead of climbing a tree, we're clicking our mouse arrow to the next website. There's so much that we all take for granted, that one day when you look back on it all, you're going to really miss those carefree days. Family time is so critical in anyone's life. Without a family, you're nothing. When did game night or family time disappear? Just because we're in a society that says computers are a completely normal everyday thing in a house, doesn't mean your family and friends aren't a main priority to you anymore. If you want to hang out at a friend's house, don't email about it, walk over there and get the full effect. Since when does a computer replace a family? Never. If we got out of this fake reality, maybe there wouldn't be as much negativity in our lives. Maybe you can regain a true life back with them. Maybe you'd think more clearly just maybe. What makes a computer any better than real life? Nothing, ask yourself that. So in conclusion, I strongly believe that with computers in our lives, we've actually gotten dumber. There's more negatives than positives in having a computer. Sure, you could quickly send a message or like a post, but is it ever bad to do the good old fashioned calling? Or sending a letter? I say again, thank you for taking out your time to read this. Maybe I've changed you, maybe not. Whatever you do, think about the next time you're online and see what happens. Technology is great, but it should never replace the beauty of nature, the importance of exercise, and the value of real human connection. Let's not lose sight of what truly matters in life."
206	206	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I do agree that computers have impacted human society greatly. Therefore, my opinion is that the invention of computers is one of the greatest inventions. I would say this because there are different help programs or websites that can help people in everyday life. Especially students have the ability to study from educational webpages. Also, people are able to communicate online. Lastly, you are able to type stories instead of hand-writing them. Having the advantage to study online is great. Different websites with tons of information and true facts can really affect grades of most students. Did you know about 70% of the population go on educational websites for information for writing, whether it's an essay or non-fiction story? Thanks to computers, there is a great chance students can receive a passing grade. Communication online has made a huge impact worldwide. Whether you use Facebook, Twitter, Skype, or other platforms, communicating with family or friends is fantastic. For example, I use Facebook and I love talking to my family down in another state, whom I see about once every couple of years. Online communication has affected people because there is an easier way to talk to others instantly. Just a push of a button, and you have immediate communication with someone. Finally, people have the ability to type on a program if they wanted to type a letter or story. For instance, if you use Microsoft Word, you can type up whatever you want. This has affected people because it is a faster and easier way to write. Therefore, if you finish earlier than you would have if you handwrote it, you would have extra leisure time, or more time to get the rest of your work done. Also, it is easy for me because I type like the wind; after practice, of course. In conclusion, the invention of computers has helped and still does help society in many ways. But, the three ways that I have chosen to tell you about in this letter, I feel, have impacted us the most. I hope this helps you with your questions about how computers have affected people. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. Have a good day.

In conclusion, computers are not harmful but rather beneficial tools that promote learning, exploration, and communication. By harnessing the power of technology, individuals can expand their horizons, connect with others, and enrich their lives in numerous ways.
208	208	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, I have recently heard that some people think that computers have a negative effect on people. Well, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe that computers play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of different cultures, religions, and traditions around the world. Through the use of computers, individuals can easily access information about other countries, helping to broaden their knowledge and perspectives. Additionally, computers facilitate communication with individuals from diverse backgrounds, fostering cross-cultural understanding and collaboration.  While it is true that some may argue that excessive screen time on computers can lead to a lack of physical activity and reduced time spent with family, it is essential to recognize the numerous benefits that computers bring to our lives. By leveraging the power of technology, we can bridge geographical boundaries, promote intercultural dialogue, and cultivate a more inclusive and connected global community.  In conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks associated with computer usage, the overall positive impact that computers have on our ability to learn about and engage with different cultures far outweighs any perceived negatives. Embracing the opportunities that computers provide for cultural exchange and mutual understanding is essential in today's interconnected world. Let us continue to harness the potential of technology to promote diversity, learning, and meaningful connections across borders.
209	209	1	3	Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers on people is that staying on a computer is not that bad it does not rot you brain like video games. are some good reasons why computers are good and help you. Sometimes computers do help with hand-eye coordination. You use the computer to do homework or to search a a stores etc. Some computers are really slow but not all of the new ones for @DATE1, computers can also help you read better it has little . You could play talk to people like your friends. Listening to music is an easy thing to you could a website that has all songs that you like to listen yo many people use the computer to find jobs and use it to look for ways to eat right and work out paying bills online is easyer than paying them for real. The computer is easy way to pay and you should agree with @CAPS1 opinion.  Computers have become essential tools in our daily lives, offering a multitude of benefits. They can enhance hand-eye coordination and aid in various tasks like homework or online shopping. While some computers may be slow, newer models are efficient and effective. Additionally, computers can improve reading skills and provide entertainment through communication with friends and listening to music. Many individuals utilize computers for job searches, health information, and managing finances, making tasks like paying bills more convenient. In conclusion, computers offer numerous advantages and should be viewed positively for their role in enhancing productivity and connectivity in modern society.
210	210	1	3	Dear Newspaper,   The question of whether people are spending too much time on the computer is a valid concern, but I believe that the benefits of using a computer outweigh the potential drawbacks. One significant advantage of spending time on the computer is the development of hand-eye coordination. Whether typing, playing online games, or simply surfing the web, these activities help enhance this essential skill that is useful in various aspects of life.   Moreover, using a computer makes learning more accessible and engaging. For instance, online textbooks offer a convenient alternative to traditional textbooks, making it easier for students to access information and complete their homework. Additionally, online courses provide flexibility for individuals, especially working parents, who may find it challenging to attend classes in person.   Furthermore, communication is greatly facilitated through computers. With various online platforms available, such as forums, chats, and email, people can easily connect with others and share ideas and information. This not only enhances communication skills but also allows for meaningful interactions without geographical constraints.   In conclusion, while it is essential to find a balance between computer use and other activities, the benefits of spending time on the computer, such as improving hand-eye coordination, facilitating learning, and enhancing communication, make it a valuable tool in today's digital age.   Thank you.
211	211	1	3	Some people may argue that computers are not good for you, but they can be a valuable resource for finding information. It is important not to spend excessive amounts of time on the computer, as that can be unhealthy. However, using a computer in moderation can be beneficial, especially when searching for information. Computers make it easy to access a wealth of knowledge online, which can be helpful for tasks like homework or research projects. In conclusion, while it is important to limit computer usage, they can be a valuable tool for obtaining information when used appropriately.
212	212	1	3	I think that people are spending a lot of time on their computers and not enjoying nature and other activities. People tend to spend hours surfing the web, visiting numerous websites for various purposes, which may not always be productive. Additionally, some individuals become engrossed in social media platforms like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, relying on them for social interaction and neglecting real-life relationships. This excessive screen time can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, with people often snacking on junk food and avoiding exercise. This unhealthy combination can result in fatigue, weight gain, and overall poor physical health. It is essential for individuals to strike a balance between their screen time and engaging in physical activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
213	213	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I just wanted to say that I do I agree with you that some people spend a lot of time on the computer. My reasons are that people need to exercise, go outdoors, and have fun. If you keep reading you'll understand why they need to do these things.  My first reason was exercising. People don't need to be on the computer all day long; there are so many other things they can do like running, jogging, and going for bike rides. It's important to stay active and not be sedentary all the time.   My second reason was going outside. It's crucial for people to get fresh air and not be cooped up indoors all day. Exploring nature, going for hikes, and visiting places like the zoo can provide a much-needed break from screens.  Additionally, spending time with friends is essential. Instead of just talking online, why not visit a friend's house, go to the mall, or have a fun sleepover watching movies? There are countless ways to have a good time without being glued to a computer screen.  In conclusion, it's important for people to balance their time spent on the computer with other activities that promote physical activity, social interaction, and overall well-being. So, let's all make an effort to unplug and enjoy the world around us. Thank you for your time. Hope to talk to you soon.
214	214	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 your at home and you are on the computer. But its been hours maybe even days since you've takin a breath of fresh air outside. This @MONTH1 sound cpzy, yet it is a reality for over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of the population in @LOCATION1. Just loo around they are in movies, chain resurant at your home, in your office and even in schoold; computers are everywhere. I know that because of over using computers amny experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends, I say that because of this peopel every where shold only be allowed to use the computer on a rain everday, say @CAPS2 to computers. My point is with computers our days are wasted with vertual games and other downloads. For starter, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Over the past two years obeseity has become a major issue in @LOCATION1 with over @PERCENT1 of the population obeseity causesan ectreamly higher risk of getting diseases and sickness like diabeaties, heart failure and even depression. recently my cousin passed away from canser caused by her fat or obeseity. My point is we can't sit her doing nothing get up and get moving away from that computer in addition to this people should get off computers and start enjoying nature. A total of <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of personals in @LOCATION1 don't spend enough time out side. With global warning killing our environment people would care enouhg to psend a little girl of their time outside. didi you know that more and more of the environment is disappering each day? I went to my good friends and expert on all things envieronmental from the instate of clean our world or cow. With the increasing concern over obesity and the deteriorating environment, it is crucial for individuals to limit their computer usage, prioritize outdoor activities, and reconnect with nature for a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. Let's step away from our screens and embrace the beauty of the world around us.
215	215	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I am expressing my concern to you about the side effects of new technologies, such as computers, on humans. Computers have a harmful impact on humans because people are spending too much of their quality time on them, which in turn leads to less time spent on exercise. People also do not get to spend as much of their days outdoors interacting with friends and family.  Firstly, people are spending excessive amounts of time surfing the internet. Studies show that an average individual spends a total of 6 hours a day on the computer, almost double what they should be spending. Dr. @DR1 from the @CAPS1 Technology Society warns that if this trend of increased time spent on the internet continues, most individuals will completely lose contact with family and friends outside the social computer network. The average weight of a 12-year-old has increased from 80 pounds in 2010 to 120 pounds today, with the main cause being the excessive amount of time spent on computers and the lack of exercise.  Secondly, computers are affecting how people get to go outside and enjoy nature. From personal experience, nature is a beautiful thing to be a part of, but nowadays, people spend too much time on social networks and not enough time outdoors. A study conducted by @PERSON2 shows that the average person in @LOCATION1 has only spent a total of 5 days outside in the past two years since acquiring their new computer. This trend must change, as people need to appreciate the wonders that the world has to offer.  Lastly, computers have impacted the interaction between family and friends. Many individuals only interact with family during mandatory times such as school meetings. Family and friends play a crucial role in everyone's lives, and it is essential to spend quality time with them. Unfortunately, many people nowadays use computers as the primary means of interacting with friends, which can lead to a loss of communication and connection with loved ones.  In conclusion, it is vital to make the right decision by limiting computer usage to become happier and stronger individuals. Computers have a detrimental impact on humans by consuming too much of their time, resulting in a lack of exercise, limited time spent outdoors, and reduced interaction with friends and family. It is important to prioritize real-life connections and experiences over digital distractions. Thank you for considering these concerns.
216	216	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I'm writing to emphasize the positive impact of advanced technology on people. Computers play a crucial role in enabling communication with others online, facilitating access to information about distant places, and enhancing hand-eye coordination skills.  In today's digital age, computers provide a platform for individuals to connect and converse with others around the world. Whether it's through messaging apps or social media platforms, the ability to communicate online fosters relationships and expands social networks. This convenience is particularly beneficial when physical distance or time constraints limit face-to-face interactions.  Moreover, the internet serves as a vast repository of knowledge, allowing users to explore and learn about faraway places without leaving their homes. Through search engines like Google, individuals can access a wealth of information on diverse topics, from history to culture to current events. This accessibility to global perspectives broadens one's horizons and promotes cross-cultural understanding.  Additionally, using computers regularly can improve hand-eye coordination, especially when engaging in activities that require precise movements, such as typing or playing video games. This skill is essential in various professions, including healthcare, engineering, and sports, where coordination and dexterity are paramount.  In conclusion, the integration of advanced technology, particularly computers, has numerous benefits for individuals in today's society. From facilitating online communication to expanding access to information and enhancing hand-eye coordination, the positive effects of technology are undeniable. Embracing these advancements can empower individuals to thrive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Thank you for considering the importance of incorporating technology into our daily lives.
217	217	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I agree that computers have a positive effect on people. You learn hand - eye coordination, you don't have to step out to go to the library and it can improve social skills. Computers, we use them everyday. They are teaching us something. We may not even realize it, but they are teaching us hand-eye coordination. We type something and we use our eyes to look at the screen and then our hands to type, one mistake and automatically our hand fix it. Or maybe when we are playing games online, the same thing applies. Our eyes are looking, while our hands are fast at work over the keyboard. Hand-eye Coordination is a skill you need in sports, and I believe that computers, since we spend time on them, are a quick way to learn that skill.  Next, how many students' parents work? My parents do. Sometimes it becomes difficult to walk to the library, not everyone lives within walking distance to one. That's when a computer helps. If you have a project to do, but your parents work, you can just look it up, you might even get more information than what you can get in the library. How's that? Well, for example, if you had to do a project on a topic and there were limited resources in the library, the computer could provide you with a wealth of information. On a survey, many students mentioned that computers saved them when they couldn't access the necessary resources physically.  Lastly, a computer can improve your social skills. When I first moved here, I was a very shy person. When I made a friend online, I started talking to people who go to my school. I even became friends with them. I'm not saying that you should stop talking to people in person and only communicate online. What I am saying is that online interactions can help you get to know someone better before meeting them in person, making it easier to connect and become friends. Social networks also help in keeping in touch with friends and family who are far away, saving time and effort.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by improving hand-eye coordination, providing access to information without physically visiting a library, and enhancing social skills through online interactions. Thank you for considering these points.
218	218	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 do you want your kids and citizens to become overweight and inactive, or do you prefer them to be active, learn valuable skills, and be more sociable with those around them? I believe that the majority of parents would support the latter option. After reading this, I am confident that even more people will be convinced. Nowadays, a significant percentage of the population is struggling with weight issues due to a lack of physical activity. It is crucial for our children to engage in at least an hour of exercise each day to divert their attention from screens. Encouraging them to join sports teams or clubs can be an effective way to achieve this. In addition, spending time in nature can have numerous benefits. Visiting the local park can offer various recreational activities such as biking, playing games, or socializing with friends. Emphasizing the importance of learning and utilizing resources like dictionaries and books instead of relying solely on the internet can also contribute to a healthier lifestyle. It is essential to prioritize physical activity and outdoor experiences over excessive screen time. By making the effort to get up and go outside, individuals can improve their social skills, expand their knowledge, and maintain a healthy weight. Ultimately, the choice is yours whether to accept this challenge, but remember that staying glued to your computer screen can have negative consequences such as poor eyesight and obesity. Make the decision to prioritize your well-being and embrace a more active lifestyle.
219	219	1	3	Dear Newspaper, It has lately come to my attention that people were saying that computers aren't important. Well, I strongly disagree with that statement. I think computers teach excellent hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and even allow you to chat online with family and friends.  Computers teach a lot of hand-eye coordination. Studies show that a high percentage of all football players have excellent hand-eye coordination. I'm sure this is because, after the football players get home from a big game, they log into a computer and engage in games that require precise hand-eye coordination.  Additionally, computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places without ever leaving home. The speed of accessing information on a computer is much faster than having to go to a library. With a computer, one can complete a project in a fraction of the time it would take at a library.  Moreover, computers play a crucial role in keeping people in touch. If you have family members who live far away, connecting with them through a computer is much easier than traditional methods like phone calls or long-distance travel. For instance, I cherish conversations with my grandma who lives hours away, and being able to chat with her online is a blessing.  In conclusion, computers are essential as they help improve hand-eye coordination, facilitate quick research, and enable communication with distant friends and family. The significance of computers in our lives cannot be understated.
220	220	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 being at home with nothing to do. You can't play basketball with @PERSON1 and your friends because you have difficulty with hand-eye coordination. You want to learn about @LOCATION1, but there aren't any books available. And you want to talk to your friends. That's what would have happened if we didn't have advances in technology. No hand-eye coordination, no ability to learn about faraway places, and no online communication. Computers have significantly benefitted our lives in various ways.  Hand-eye coordination is essential for everyday tasks. Research has shown that using a computer can improve hand-eye coordination, which is crucial for activities like writing and handling objects. According to @PERSON2, head of human reactions, using a computer helps to refine hand-eye coordination skills by controlling hand movements. This can prevent accidents and mishaps, such as breaking valuable items like @PERSON3 did in @LOCATION2.  Moreover, computers enable us to explore and learn about distant locations. With the vast information available online, people can easily access updated and relevant details about different parts of the world. For instance, the recent earthquake in @LOCATION3 was widely reported through online platforms, allowing individuals to stay informed and aware of global events. The preference for online research over traditional books is evident, as digital sources provide real-time data and diverse perspectives.  Additionally, online communication plays a vital role in connecting people globally. From business meetings to casual conversations with friends, the ability to communicate online has revolutionized how we interact and collaborate. @PERSON5 from @CAPS4 highlights the convenience of video conferencing for remote work, while @PERSON4 emphasizes how online platforms create a sense of community and belonging for young individuals.  In conclusion, technology, especially computers, has enhanced our lives by improving hand-eye coordination, facilitating access to global information, and enabling seamless online communication. Embracing these digital advancements has led to a more connected, informed, and efficient society. Thank you, @ORGANIZATION1, for recognizing the numerous benefits of computer technology in our daily lives.
221	221	1	3	Some people believe that computers consume too much time that could be spent on more important things.

They provide a gateway to a world of knowledge and endless possibilities, making them an indispensable part of our lives.
222	222	1	3	Computers and the internet have revolutionized the way we live and work today. While some may argue that they are pulling people away from nature, loved ones, and exercise, I believe that they are actually enhancing our daily lives. One significant benefit is the ability to easily communicate with friends and family, regardless of distance. Platforms like Skype and social media sites such as Facebook have made it effortless to stay connected with loved ones, plan trips, and share moments. Additionally, for business purposes, email services like Gmail have made it convenient to contact others quickly.   Moreover, computers play a crucial role in education, with a large percentage of students relying on the internet for research and assignments. Online search engines like Google and academic databases have made information more accessible and up-to-date. Tools like Microsoft Word also make writing and editing papers easier with features like spell check and grammar correction.   Despite concerns about excessive screen time, the internet fosters curiosity and facilitates communication in ways that were not possible before. It is essential to maintain a balance between online activities and real-life interactions, but the benefits of technology in enhancing our daily lives cannot be denied. Ultimately, computers and the internet have become indispensable tools that have enriched our personal and professional lives.
223	223	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I think the way how more and more people use computers is bad because, it's not good for people's health. Sitting in front of a computer for hours can lead to back and neck problems, and even arthritis from the repetitive movements. Additionally, people who spend a lot of time on computers tend to neglect spending time with family and friends. They may make excuses to avoid social gatherings, which can strain relationships. Furthermore, while computers provide a wealth of information, learning about a new culture or place by traveling and experiencing it firsthand is much more enriching and fulfilling. By immersing oneself in different environments, one can truly understand and appreciate the diversity of the world. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on health, relationships, and personal growth. It's important for individuals to strike a balance between technology use and real-life experiences to lead a healthy and fulfilling life.
224	224	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great effects that are positive towards people. This is evident as they teach hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about faraway places, and enable communication with others online. Computers play a significant role in enhancing various aspects of individuals' lives.   Computers contribute to improving hand-eye coordination. Typing on a keyboard while looking at the monitor requires the synchronization of hands and eyes. Additionally, computer games require quick reactions, enhancing hand-eye coordination through engaging gameplay. Studies have shown that individuals who use computers have a 10% better hand-eye coordination compared to those who do not.  Moreover, computers provide a gateway to learning about distant locations. Through online research, individuals can access a wealth of information about different countries and cultures. For example, someone in a remote location can easily discover facts about a foreign country with just a few clicks. This access to information broadens one's knowledge and understanding of the world.  Furthermore, computers facilitate communication with people across the globe. Whether through email or video chat, individuals can connect with others regardless of geographical distance. Video chat, in particular, has gained popularity due to its ability to provide a more personal interaction by allowing visual communication. It enables people to stay connected with friends and family members who are far away.  In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits by improving hand-eye coordination, providing access to information about distant places, and enabling global communication. The positive impact of computers on individuals' lives is undeniable, making them an invaluable tool for personal and professional growth.
225	225	1	3	Computers have indeed come a long way, offering countless opportunities for the world. However, it is concerning that many of these opportunities remain untapped. One of the significant drawbacks of excessive computer use is the lack of physical activity it entails. Spending hours in front of a screen can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can have detrimental effects on one's health. In fact, neglecting exercise while spending extended periods on a computer can result in serious health issues, regardless of maintaining a proper diet.  I recall a personal experience where a simple test on a fitness game revealed that my body was aging prematurely due to my prolonged computer use. This was a wake-up call for me to reevaluate my habits and prioritize physical activity over screen time. Similarly, I witnessed a friend succumb to computer addiction, losing herself in the digital world and neglecting real-life interactions and responsibilities.  It is crucial to recognize the addictive nature of computers and the dangers they pose when not used in moderation. The captivating allure of the virtual realm can lead individuals to isolate themselves from their families and loved ones, ultimately weakening the bonds that are essential for a fulfilling life. It is essential to be mindful of the negative impact excessive computer use can have on both physical and mental well-being.  In conclusion, while computers offer incredible possibilities and convenience, it is vital to strike a balance between their utilization and engaging in physical activities, maintaining real-life connections, and safeguarding one's health. Let us not allow the enchantment of technology to overshadow the importance of leading a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
226	226	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 out of ten people spend their time on the computers. I believe people should not spend @CAPS3 much time on their computers because it can hurt their eyes.

Encouraging physical activities and social interactions instead of excessive screen time can lead to a healthier and more balanced lifestyle.

227	227	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers are essential for several reasons. Firstly, they serve as valuable tools for learning by providing easy access to information on a wide range of topics, including faraway places like Spain. Instead of having to visit a library, individuals can simply search for information online, making the learning process more efficient. Additionally, computers enable people to stay connected with friends and family who are geographically distant through platforms like Skype. This allows for face-to-face communication and helps maintain relationships despite the physical distance. Lastly, computer games offer a fun and effective way to reduce stress. Games ranging from word puzzles to geography quizzes provide entertainment while also engaging the mind. Overall, computers play a crucial role in facilitating learning, communication, and relaxation, making them valuable assets in our daily lives.
228	228	1	3	Dear people from the newspaper, I am concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer, which could lead to various negative consequences. Excessive use of the internet can result in trouble, violence, and illegal activities. For instance, individuals may engage in spreading rumors and saying hurtful things about others, leading to conflicts and distress in communities. This behavior can escalate and potentially result in violent actions, as seen in cases where people have lost their lives due to crimes initiated online. Moreover, the anonymity provided by the internet can facilitate illegal activities, such as deception and planning criminal acts. It is crucial to address these issues and promote responsible internet usage to prevent further harm. Thank you for considering these concerns.
229	229	1	3	Dear Readers,   In today's society, the prevalence of computers has brought both advantages and disadvantages. The convenience of instant communication through platforms like AIM, Facebook, and Myspace has revolutionized the way we connect with others. However, this constant reliance on technology has led to a decrease in outdoor activities and face-to-face interactions.  While the internet has made information more accessible, it has also opened doors to potential dangers. Cyberbullying, hacking, and online deception have become serious issues that can harm individuals, especially vulnerable populations like children. The anonymity provided by the internet allows individuals to misrepresent themselves and manipulate others for malicious purposes.  It is crucial for us to recognize the negative impacts of excessive computer usage and take action to find a balance. By reducing our screen time and prioritizing real-life interactions, we can regain a sense of connection with the world around us. Let us not be enslaved by our devices, but instead, embrace the beauty of nature and the warmth of personal relationships. Together, we can create a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle.   Take a step back from the digital world and start living in the present. Let us strive for a harmonious balance between technology and human connection.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]
230	230	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, what do you usually do in your spare time? Do you prefer going outside and playing soccer with your kids, or do you find yourself reaching for a bag of chips while logging onto social media or checking your email? The real question here is whether computers have a positive or negative impact on people. In my opinion, I believe that computers have a negative effect. Engaging in online conversations with friends may not necessarily help you develop strong social skills. Moreover, spending too much time on the computer can become addictive and take away from valuable exercise time. After carefully considering these points, I hope you will agree with me that computers can have a detrimental effect on individuals.  While platforms like Facebook, iChat, and email provide convenient ways to stay connected with loved ones, they may not contribute to enhancing your social skills. Interacting through a screen does not provide the same level of engagement as face-to-face conversations. Why not consider inviting someone over for a visit or enjoying a meal with your family instead? These real-life interactions can help you build and maintain meaningful relationships.  Additionally, the allure of the computer screen can be highly addictive. Once you start browsing online, hours can easily slip away without you even realizing it. This addictive behavior can prevent you from engaging in physical activities, as recommended by health experts. Allocating time for exercise is crucial for maintaining overall well-being. Instead of being glued to the computer, consider going for a run or participating in a workout session to prioritize your health.  By limiting our screen time and prioritizing real-world interactions and physical activities, we can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives. Making a conscious effort to strike a balance between technology use and personal well-being can lead to a more positive and enriching lifestyle. I trust that you will join me in recognizing the negative impact that excessive computer use can have on individuals. Let's strive to find a healthier balance in our daily routines for the betterment of our overall well-being.

237	237	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing this letter to express my concerns about the negative effects that computers have on people. There are three main issues that I believe need to be addressed: identity theft, cyberbullying, and addiction.   Identity theft is a serious problem that many individuals face when they share private information online. This can lead to financial ruin and emotional distress, making it difficult for people to trust in the safety of using computers. Additionally, cyberbullying is a harmful consequence of online interactions, where individuals can be targeted and harassed by strangers hiding behind screens. The psychological impact of cyberbullying can be devastating, leading to depression and even suicide in extreme cases.   Moreover, the addictive nature of computers can cause individuals to prioritize screen time over real-life relationships and self-care. People can become so engrossed in the digital world that they neglect their physical health and personal connections. This detachment from reality can have detrimental effects on mental and emotional well-being.   In conclusion, the risks associated with computers, such as identity theft, cyberbullying, and addiction, highlight the need for caution and moderation in our use of technology. It is crucial to address these issues to ensure a safe and balanced relationship with computers. Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
238	238	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  I strongly agree with experts on computers. While some argue that computers have positive effects on people, such as teaching hand-eye coordination, facilitating long-distance learning, and enabling online communication, it is essential to consider the negative impacts as well.   One significant drawback of excessive computer use is its impact on vision, as prolonged screen time can strain the eyes. Moreover, computers can be highly addictive, leading to sedentary behavior and contributing to the rising issue of obesity. Additionally, spending too much time on computers can detract from real-life experiences and social interactions.  Despite the positive aspects of computers, it is crucial to acknowledge the negative consequences they can have on individuals' health and well-being. By finding a balance between utilizing technology and engaging in physical activities, one can mitigate the adverse effects of excessive computer use. It is essential to recognize both the benefits and drawbacks of computers to make informed decisions about their usage.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
239	239	1	3	I personally think that people should not spend so much time on the computer. One reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because people spend to much time on them and not enough time exercising. Another reason why is because people aren't enjoying nature. Finally, my last reason is because people are spending less time interacting with family ans friends. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because they are spending more time on them then exercising. People will end up getting fat if all they do is sit around on their computer. People should be running or going to the gym instead of going on the computer. Even if you have your own equipment at your house to exercise on it's still better than going on the computer and not getting any exercise at all. If people spent as much time exercising then they spend on the computer, then the average weight of a human will go way down. Another reason people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because people are spending less time enjoying nature. People should be outside getting fresh air instead of being inside on the computer all day. I personally would way rather be outside playing baseball and getting fit than being inside on the computer getting fat. Even if you look at nature via computer, it still won't be the same because you actually aren't outside experiencing it yourself. If people would spend as much time enjoying nature as they are on the computer, we would be living in a much more healthy and clean world. My last reason why I think people spend so much time on the computer is because they are spending less time interacting with family and friends. People could be in a dark room all day, isolated from everyone they care about just because they are on the computer. That, to me, just isn't right because they are spending less quality time with their friends and family, instead they are spending time with their computer. If a person spends all their time on the computer, then everyone they care about will gradually be slipping away even if they don't know it. So as you can see, it would be much better if people spend more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends than spending more time on the computer. Even if you don't spend a lot of your time on the computer yet, you will gradually spend more and more time on it every day until eventually it's all you do. In conclusion, it's important to maintain a balance between computer usage and other activities to lead a healthy and fulfilling life.
240	240	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, This a letter telling you my opinion about computers. People spend a lot of time on computers because they are incredibly helpful in various aspects of our lives. For example, in school, computers assist us with our assignments and research. In my @NUM1 grade, my teacher @PERSON1 assigns us homework where we have to find @NUM2 facts about a topic of our choice, and many students use computers to gather information. In the workforce, computers are essential for tasks such as communication, record-keeping, and scheduling. Additionally, computers facilitate communication with loved ones who may be far away, like my dad using the computer to connect with family in @LOCATION1. We can share news, updates, and important events through online platforms. While computers are undoubtedly beneficial, it is important to balance our time by enjoying outdoor activities, exercising, and living a well-rounded life. @CAPS1, I hope you understand and appreciate the significance of computers in our daily lives. Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts on this matter. Your consideration is greatly valued.
241	241	1	3	Dear local community members of @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1,  Lately, there has been a debate regarding the use of computers and laptops among the citizens of @ORGANIZATION1. Some believe that these devices are a waste of time, arguing that people could be spending more quality time with their family and friends, especially those who are far away. However, it is important to acknowledge the numerous benefits that come with using technology.  Computers and laptops are invaluable tools for research and learning new things. They can also serve as a means of relaxation for individuals. In today's modern world, where many people have family and friends living far away, staying connected through emails, social media, and other online platforms is essential. These technological advancements make communication easier and more convenient, bridging the gap between loved ones separated by distance.  While some may argue that the internet is not always reliable due to the possibility of misinformation or scams, it is crucial to differentiate between credible sources and unreliable ones. The internet can be a valuable resource for information, entertainment, and connecting with others. Additionally, it can help individuals unwind and de-stress after a long day, contributing to their overall well-being.  In conclusion, computers and laptops play a significant role in our lives, offering a wide range of benefits that should not be overlooked. It is essential to strike a balance between utilizing technology for productivity and leisure while also maintaining meaningful relationships with family and friends. Embracing the advantages of technology can enhance our daily lives and enrich our connections with others.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
242	242	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, In our town, the increasing use of computers has raised concerns among some residents. While many argue that computers provide numerous benefits such as communication and productivity, there are those who believe that our town should not fully embrace technological advances. They argue that spending too much time on computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in health issues such as obesity.   ""I think exercise should be a part of everybody's day,"" a teacher from our town emphasized. Lack of physical activity can indeed contribute to weight gain and other health problems. Statistics show that a significant percentage of residents in our state are overweight due to insufficient exercise. Therefore, promoting a balance between computer use and physical activity is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being.   Furthermore, the excessive use of social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram has become a common trend among young people. Instead of engaging in face-to-face interactions, many choose to communicate online, missing out on valuable personal connections. While online communication has its advantages, it is essential to remember the importance of real-life interactions.   In addition to prioritizing physical health and interpersonal relationships, participating in local activities and events can enrich one's life. Towns offer various opportunities for residents to engage with their community, from sidewalk sales to sports teams. By actively participating in these activities, individuals can foster a sense of belonging and connection with others in the town.   Ultimately, striking a balance between the use of technology and real-life experiences is key to leading a fulfilling and healthy lifestyle. By making an effort to engage in physical activities, prioritize face-to-face interactions, and take part in community events, residents can create a well-rounded and vibrant life. Thank you for considering these perspectives on the impact of technology in our town."
243	243	1	3	Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 would life effect you if you did not have a computer? I strongly believe that computers have a great effect on people all around the world. It helps you at work for a job and at school. Computers also help students and adults talk to people. Many people want to go to places but they do not know what the place looks like or where it is. With a computer, you can find out all of that information. Read in to the minds of the students and see what we have to say on this topic. With a computer it is much easier at your job or at school. Just think, without computers people would need to write every paper by hand and we all know that can take hours. When you type a paper for school, you go to spell check and then you know everything is correct. If you write a paper by hand, there is a huge chance that some words could be spelt wrong. Work get finished a lot a quicker on the computer so you have more time to do other things like hang out with friends. If you rush on a paper, the people reading it will have a tough time trying to figure out what it says, on the computer, you work is always going to be neat. You can e-mail your work to a friend or save it to your computer so if you need to change something for a paper, it will be a quicker than having to rewrite the whole paper over. Computers do not affect me in a horrible way because it helps me get my work done faster. Computers help people communicate with other people. By having a computer people can talk to other people. In many schools students ask their friend a question about homework. Without a computer, people would have no way of asking questions and end up getting it wrong. I like to hang out with my friends and in order to do that you have to make plans. When you are on the computer, you can go on facebook and if they are on, talk to them about what they wanted to do that night. It is so much easier to do instead of looking up their number and calling them. Many people in the world have old friends from school that they want to stay in touch with. Now with a computer they will have no issue doing that. You will finally be able to look up a place you want to go. Many people in this world like to travel on the computer you can look up maps and see the shortest way to get to the place, you want to go, you will see if they easy way to get there and that might not he by car. I would not want to go to a place that did not look eye-catching. Now I can just go on the website and find out everything I wanted to know about that place. If a place is @NUM1 hours away, I would not want to travel that far so I would need to know if a place is close to where I live computers really tell you a lot about it and what the weather is mostly like. I use the computer for mostly everything I do. Coming through our minds have showed you what we have thought about the effects computers have on us today. We can make work a lot easier, talk to other people, and get information on places you want to visit somebody. The computer is a very reliable source for me and you have lost a lot if you do not agree with me on this.  Computers play a vital role in our daily lives, whether it be for work, school, or personal communication. Without them, tasks would be more time-consuming and challenging. The convenience and efficiency that computers provide are undeniable, making them an essential tool in today's modern world.
244	244	1	3	Dear @CITY1, I am writing to address the issue of people spending excessive amounts of time on computers, leading to a lack of personal interactions with family and friends. While computers provide a valuable source of information for academic purposes, they can also contribute to a sedentary lifestyle and hinder social connections.   When individuals prioritize computer activities over spending time with loved ones, they risk missing out on important events and experiences. For instance, choosing to chat online instead of joining friends at a beach party can result in feelings of isolation and regret. It is essential to strike a balance between online interactions and real-life relationships to maintain meaningful connections.  Moreover, while computers offer convenience for research and academic work, excessive screen time can lead to physical inactivity and a lack of fresh air. It is crucial for individuals to engage in regular exercise and outdoor activities to maintain their overall well-being. Striking a balance between screen time and physical activity is essential for a healthy lifestyle.  In conclusion, while computers provide valuable information and connectivity, it is important to prioritize real-life interactions with family and friends. Finding a balance between online activities and personal relationships is key to leading a fulfilling and healthy life. Thank you for considering these points.

247	247	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,   People are now using computers for various purposes, and opinions about them vary. While some individuals may not be fond of them, others, like myself, appreciate the many benefits they offer. Computers enable faster communication, provide access to a wide range of games for entertainment, and serve as a valuable source of information. The majority of people, nine out of ten, find computers to be highly beneficial in their daily lives.   One significant advantage of computers is the ability to communicate quickly through instant messaging. Compared to traditional letters, which can take days or weeks to reach their recipient, instant messaging allows for instantaneous conversations. This efficient mode of communication is not only faster but also free of charge, making it a convenient option for staying connected with others. Additionally, video chat features enable face-to-face interactions with loved ones, regardless of geographical distances.   In addition to communication, computers offer a plethora of gaming options for users of all ages. Online game websites provide a wide variety of games that can be enjoyed solo, with a friend, or as a family activity. These games not only entertain but also challenge the mind and foster creativity.   Furthermore, computers serve as a valuable tool for accessing information on diverse topics. Whether conducting research for a project or simply seeking knowledge on a particular subject, the internet offers a wealth of resources at one's fingertips. From cooking recipes to educational materials, the internet provides endless opportunities for learning and exploration, all at no cost.  In conclusion, computers have significantly enhanced the lives of many individuals by facilitating communication, entertainment, and access to information. The convenience and efficiency they offer make them an indispensable part of modern society. As technology continues to advance, computers will likely play an increasingly vital role in various aspects of our daily lives.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]
248	248	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have become an essential part of our lives, offering a wide range of benefits and opportunities for learning, communication, and entertainment. With the advancement of technology, computers continue to improve, providing endless possibilities for users. One of the key advantages of computers is their ability to facilitate learning and research. Whether it's exploring new topics, finding information for a project, or accessing online educational resources, computers have made it easier for individuals to expand their knowledge and skills. Additionally, the convenience of online education has revolutionized the way people can pursue their academic goals, especially for those who may not have access to traditional educational institutions. Furthermore, computers have revolutionized communication, allowing individuals to stay connected with friends and family through emails, instant messaging, and social media platforms. This is particularly valuable for people who are geographically separated or unable to meet in person regularly. Moreover, computers offer a variety of entertainment options, including playing video games. Whether it's enjoying a game alone or connecting with friends for online multiplayer experiences, computers provide a source of fun and relaxation for people of all ages.

249	249	1	3	"According to @PERSON1, economic @CAPS1, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spend as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned about. If everybody spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, they could save @MONEY1 off their electric bill. In a survey, @NUM3 out @MONEY1 @NUM4 people said they would do anything to save money. So if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots @MONEY1 money. In addition to financial loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how Americans are becoming obese. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Professor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, ""the obesity in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved."" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6. Although health is a problem community is a bigger one. People never talk to each other face to face anymore. They all talk on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. Communities are spending less time together in real life than on the computer. @PERSON1, expert on human behavior, says that when people spend less time on the computer, they spend more time together. It's a fact that when people spend more time together, they have more fun. So, I would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community. It would provide financial, health, and community benefits. These are all important things that we lack if we spend too much time on the computer. In conclusion, reducing computer usage can lead to significant savings, improved health, and stronger community connections, making it a worthwhile adjustment in our daily lives."
250	250	1	3	I do not believe computers benefit society. Many people spend their life on their computer instead of exercising, going out with friends, or spending time with family. Many will agree they spend at least a few hours a day on their computer. Which is unnecessary. Why is there so much obesity in the world nowadays? Because of a lack of physical activity. And who is the main culprit? Computers of course. In order for more people to maintain healthy, there needs to be a lot of physical activity. When someone can sit around all day clicking a mouse or typing keys in, how much exercise are they really getting? Plus, there are many different disorders in the world. Studies show that with more physical activity, these sometimes painful disorders could be avoided. Too many people are choosing their computer over exercise and it is causing many health problems that could've easily been avoided.   Secondly, everyone would agree that friends are essential in life. But now people are talking to their friends online or in computer games instead of meeting them in person. Online interactions can often lead to misunderstandings which can strain friendships. Also, online you may not meet as many new people or make as many new friends. When you go out and engage with others in person, you have the opportunity to form deeper connections and expand your social circle, which enriches life in general.  Finally, you wouldn't want families to become distant, would you? Well, this is one of the many effects of when the members of a family spend too much time on their computers instead of engaging with each other. Quality time together as a family is crucial for maintaining strong bonds. When family members are engrossed in their own digital worlds, communication can break down, leading to rifts that may be hard to repair. Ultimately, relationships with friends and family are essential in life, and excessive computer usage puts those relationships in jeopardy. So take a stand and consider reducing the use of computers before it is too late.
251	251	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I have learned that some experts say that people spend too much time on computers when they could be exercising or with friends and family. I, on the other hand, think otherwise. Computers are a great way to learn and communicate with others, here's why: @CAPS3 of all, I would like to say how much computers help us in school. Most students use them every day. We can study for tests by looking for websites with lots of information and we can also research topics that we don't understand. For example, if you want to find out how planets form, you can just type it into a search engine and a list of websites will pop up. Another way we use computers in school is when we have to make projects. We can use different tools to set up a slide show while also looking up information on the internet. Lastly, the internet is also a way for teachers to communicate with their students. If the teacher sets up a blog, students can always see what the class is doing, what the homework is, and find cool links that will help them understand certain topics better. Another point I would like to mention is that the experts say that computers deprive us of time with family and friends when the truth is, it's the opposite, computers actually take communication to a whole new level. For example, if you wanted to have a chat with an old friend, you could log right on to MSN or AIM and find out what's new in their lives. A second way to communicate with friends is by @ORGANIZATION1, a cheap and easy way to contact friends outside the country. Next, you could go a bit more old-fashioned and just write an e-mail. It will take longer to get a reply, but it's still worth the wait in the end. Lastly for parents who kids live far away, video chat is also a good way to communicate because you will be able to see them and hear their voice as well. Lastly, I would like to tell you about just how much we can learn by using a computer. You could just go to a search engine and search any topic in the world and you're bound to find hundreds of results. It doesn't matter what your interests are because you'll always find great information. The internet also allows you to catch up on recent news such as weather. Next, there are websites that allow you to ask questions and get answers just as fast. You might have to check your sources to make sure they're reliable, but I believe it's still worth it. Lastly, if you are getting ready to go on a trip, you can check flight information with the click of a button. Or maybe you need to find out what the weather will be like, there are many websites for that. There are also websites that can help you learn about the place you'll be staying at as well. Next time, think twice about what you hear about computers because they really aren't all that bad for you. Sometimes it may be better to go outside and play, but computers do help you learn and communicate with others, which are just as important. Ultimately, computers play a vital role in enhancing education, facilitating communication, and providing a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips. They are not just tools for entertainment but valuable resources that can enrich our lives in countless ways. So, before dismissing computers as mere distractions, consider the vast benefits they offer in expanding our horizons and connecting us with the world around us.
252	252	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I also agree that computers have a positive effect on people. I agree with this because the computer can teach people things. Also, people can talk to each other, and believe / create whatever they want. Computers have a positive effect on people because I believe the computer can teach people a lot. The computer can make things visual to kids and adults. I know that when I was younger, I used to play math and science games on the computer to help me study for tests. The computer also helps out with adults and their jobs. I don't know what half the adults in the world would do without computers. If you think about all the jobs that are happening today, also a lot of it involves the computer. Such as email. What would some businesses do without email? Also, adults like to check websites for the news and to catch up on sports. We can all learn so much from the computer, and there are so many people who base their jobs on computers. We all learn something every day, and with the computer, we can make it kind. Also, the computer benefits online chats, email, and now even with a cam, you can talk face to face with people all over the world. I know email helps out so many people who live long distance, and email doesn't take long at all. I know thanks to cam and microphones that are built into computers helped us because now I can talk to all my friends and family and see them and hear them without traveling, just simply clicking a button. There are websites now that allow people to talk to others online and over cam or microphone. Things like this help out so much. Some people just think about all those people who have relationships and whatnot, basing it off computers really does help out. Lastly, all the people who pour their imagination into computers, all those people who put their thoughts and feelings into the computer. I know plenty of people who type their feelings because they would never dare say them out loud. Now imagine if computers faded away? That's what I think about when people say such things as computers not being useful. Everything is useful, and everything has at least some sort of positive effect coming out of it. So, in my opinion, computers do bring out a positive effect to the world.
253	253	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you think computers are good to use? More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly disagree. My first reason is that computers are not safe. My second reason is that computers could get you in a lot of trouble. My final reason is that you never know what could happen on the computer. Let me explain why I disagree.  Firstly, computers are not safe because someone could trace where you live, leading to potential dangers. Additionally, computers can expose personal information, making individuals vulnerable to cyber threats.  Furthermore, computers can lead to trouble by enabling individuals to post harmful content online or engage in negative interactions with others. This behavior can have serious consequences, both personally and socially.  Lastly, the unpredictable nature of the internet means that you never know what could happen on a computer. From encountering viruses to falling victim to online scams, the risks associated with computer usage are numerous.  In conclusion, the potential dangers and negative impacts of using computers outweigh any potential benefits. It is essential to exercise caution and be mindful of the risks involved when using technology.
254	254	1	3	I walked into my living room. I saw my brother on the computer talking to his friends on facebook. I thought to myself he's always on the computer never for any school reason. People always say we don't need computers, I personally agree with the statement. In the town, everybody mostly has computers. Without a computer to look up content, you have to go to the library and check out a book. Just the other day my friend went to the library and checked out a book about culture. He loved that book; he read it inside and out for a book report on different cultures. When he handed it into the teacher, she looked pleased when she gave him back his test, he had an A. He didn't use the internet or computers, unlike books, which are more portable and don't require electricity.  Not having a computer can lead to more physical activity. While my brother is inside, my friends and I are outside playing various sports. We stay active and healthy by engaging in physical activities regularly. Unlike my brother, who is obese because of his sedentary lifestyle. It is also unhealthy to spend all day on the computer as it can disrupt sleep patterns, lead to missed responsibilities, and result in poor academic performance.  Not having a computer can also enable more quality time with family. My brother always rushes to get back to the computer, even during meals or family outings. He isolates himself and misses out on valuable family moments. If you want your children to be healthier, have better academic performance, and spend more quality time with family, consider limiting computer usage. It is essential to strike a balance between technology and real-life experiences to promote overall well-being and strong family connections.
255	255	1	3	Dear Newspaper editor, Computers have been a great advancement in technology, but some people think otherwise. It is a great thing to have some people say but others think it is a hazard to health. I think it is an excellent thing to have. I have come up with @NUM1 reasons to support my opinion. Computers help you keep in touch with distant friends and/or family, they assist you in research, and they even let you do shopping. Firstly, if you have any relatives or friends that live far away computers have websites such as aol or facebook & myspace that you can use to keep in touch with them. Most of them are free to create an account so you don't need to worry about monthly bills for them. So this is a lot better than driving and paying gas for visiting. Computers even have webcams for video chat. With video chat you can see each other & talk at the same time, that's amazing. Secondly, you can search the web for research. If you have a project and you need more information than books give you then just use google or ask.com. You can easily find the details and information you need. All this takes is just a couple minutes, which is a lot better than reading for an hour or time. Lastly, if you really want something or need it just shop online. For example if you are a really cool toy that you want to buy for your daughter or son, but it's not for sale in stores then buy it off the internet. They even ship your item fast. I like buying off the internet. When I really wanted a bike I saw my mom end up getting it for my birthday. In conclusion, computers are very handy. If you need information, talk to someone, or buy something it's got it. I use computers a lot. I think they are very great to have.
256	256	1	3	Some people may argue that spending too much time on computers doesn't keep us fit, but it's important to recognize the numerous benefits that technology offers. Computers allow us to stay connected with friends and family, even if they are far away, through various social media platforms and communication tools. This helps us maintain relationships and stay in touch with loved ones, which would be much more challenging without the convenience of technology.  Moreover, computers provide opportunities to meet new people and expand our social circles. Dating websites and social networking sites make it easier to connect with others who share similar interests, leading to new friendships and even romantic relationships. This can be especially beneficial for individuals who may not have the opportunity to meet new people in their daily lives.  Additionally, computers help us save and organize important information efficiently. Whether it's storing documents, photos, or other data, technology allows us to keep everything in one place and access it with just a few clicks. This not only helps us stay organized but also prevents valuable information from being lost or misplaced.  In conclusion, while it's important to prioritize physical activity and exercise, we cannot overlook the valuable role that computers and technology play in our lives. From staying connected with loved ones to meeting new people and saving important information, computers enhance our daily lives and make tasks more convenient and efficient. Embracing technology and its benefits can ultimately help us navigate the modern world more effectively.
257	257	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the fact of the computer is that it can be bad for the citizens in @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I think that some people are not getting enough exercise and I also think that you can get lazy on the computer is bad too. @CAPS1 three reasons for @CAPS1 opinion is @NUM1. People are not getting enough exercise, @NUM2. People get lazy and changes while being on the computer an mount of time, @NUM3. They will get addicted to the computer. The first reason is because people are not getting enough exercise I pick that reason because people I know gain a lot of weight and it's kinda of sad because they do nothing but stay on the computer and eat. Another detail is that the computer messes up your eyes by staring at that type of screen. One time I did that and @CAPS1 eyes felt weird after getting on the computer. The third detail was that people gets very fragile and weak. I picked that detail because if you get up off the computer and exercise your bones will become weak. The second reason is because people will become lazy and changes for an example people will keep asking you to get stuff and do stuff for them and you would do it because you be a good friend. The second detail is that the person will change, the person will be lazy to go to fun events with you as a freind. The next thing you you wont have a freind anymore. The third detail is that it's like your bestfriend has replaced you for a computer that hurts if a person you know for a long time has replaced you for a computer thats something that will make you depressed and make you wanna commit suicide too me anyways. The third reason is because the person will get addicted to the computer for an example you want to celebrate a birthday and the person says ""first I got to beat this level."" @CAPS2 the person saying that the person is not going to get off the computer. Another detail is that his day will go pass fast and thats like waisting days of life and people who died will do anything to get their life and to waist is not good. The third detail is you will began to hate the person because the person dosen't care about anything but the computer. Those were the reasons to explain @CAPS1 opinion on the compter fact in the news paper I read.  In conclusion, it is evident that excessive computer use can have negative effects on individuals, leading to a lack of exercise, laziness, and addiction. It is important for individuals to find a balance between technology use and physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle."
258	258	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Spending excessive time on the computer can have detrimental effects on our health and well-being. While technology offers many benefits, it is crucial to strike a balance and not let it consume our lives. One major concern is the impact on physical fitness. Research indicates that individuals who spend more than a few hours a day on the computer are at a higher risk of obesity. This is often due to a sedentary lifestyle resulting from excessive screen time. Moreover, choosing computer-related activities over physical education can further exacerbate this issue among children. Additionally, prolonged computer use can hinder real-life interactions, leading to social awkwardness and isolation. While online communication has its advantages, it should not replace face-to-face engagement. Furthermore, extended screen exposure can strain our eyes and potentially lead to vision problems. It is essential to limit computer usage to protect our eyesight and overall health. In conclusion, while computers are valuable tools, moderation is key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Let us be mindful of the time we spend on the computer and prioritize activities that promote physical activity, social connections, and eye health.
259	259	1	3	As time progresses, society continues to embrace more and more technology, including the ever-present computer. In today's world, it seems that everyone relies heavily on computers for various tasks and entertainment. This overreliance on technology has led to a decrease in physical activity, as people spend more time sitting in front of screens rather than engaging in exercise.  The convenience and efficiency of computers have made them an integral part of daily life for many individuals. However, this constant use of technology has led to a sedentary lifestyle for many, resulting in various health issues. Lack of physical activity can contribute to weight gain, heart problems, and other health complications.  It is important to remember the importance of exercise in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Regular physical activity not only keeps the body in good shape but also improves overall well-being. Engaging in activities like sports, running, or even skateboarding can be enjoyable and beneficial for both physical and mental health.  In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly brought many advantages to society, it is essential not to let them hinder our physical health. Finding a balance between technology use and physical activity is crucial for leading a healthy and fulfilling life. Prioritizing exercise and staying active should be a priority for everyone, ensuring a better quality of life in the long run.
260	260	1	3	Over one million people spend time on the computer daily, but this habit can have negative impacts on their health. Excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, causing people to become overweight. To combat this issue, it is important for individuals to create a schedule that allows for physical exercise and limits computer time. By making small changes, such as incorporating other activities into daily routines and managing computer usage, people can improve their overall well-being. It is crucial to strike a balance between computer use and other activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Ultimately, by being mindful of our computer usage and making conscious efforts to prioritize physical activity, we can work towards better health outcomes.
261	261	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe many people spend too much time on computers, which can have negative impacts on their overall well-being. Excessive computer use can lead to addiction, especially when it comes to playing games that are designed to be engaging and time-consuming. These games can easily consume hours of a person's day without them even realizing it. It is important to limit the time spent on these games to ensure that other important activities are not neglected.  Furthermore, online chatting services like Facebook, MySpace, and instant messaging can also be major time-wasters. Many individuals, particularly teenagers, spend hours each day chatting with friends online. While it is important to stay connected, it is equally important to prioritize responsibilities such as homework and face-to-face interactions with friends and family.  Another common issue is procrastination when it comes to completing school assignments, such as reports. Waiting until the last minute to start a report can result in spending hours on the computer trying to finish it in time. This not only affects the quality of the work but also contributes to unnecessary stress and lower grades.  To address these issues, it is essential to take proactive steps such as limiting access to addictive games, reducing time spent on online chatting platforms, and encouraging students to start their assignments early. By doing so, individuals can strike a better balance between their online activities and other aspects of their lives, leading to improved overall well-being and academic performance.

With a computer, you can easily connect with loved ones in distant places, pass the time during inclement weather, and enhance your knowledge by researching various topics. For example, families separated by distance can stay in touch through online communication, individuals stuck indoors due to extreme weather can find entertainment on their computers, and students can improve their understanding of homework assignments by utilizing online resources. Overall, the accessibility provided by computers has a positive impact on people's lives.
263	263	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, every minute of the day, millions of computer users around the world log on to their devices, but is this always a positive thing? There is growing concern over the excessive amount of time people spend on computers, leading to a variety of negative consequences. Not only does it detract from quality time spent with friends and family, but it also poses risks such as online interactions and the potential theft of personal information. It is evident that computer usage should be moderated to address these issues effectively.   The prevalence of computer usage is staggering, with a significant percentage of individuals spending hours each day on their devices. This widespread trend has resulted in a decline in face-to-face interactions, especially among children who now spend less time outdoors engaging in physical activities. The impact of excessive computer usage on health cannot be overlooked, as it contributes to issues like obesity in both children and adults.   Moreover, the introduction of online chat features has further exacerbated the problem, increasing the amount of time individuals spend on computers. While intended to facilitate communication, online chat platforms have unfortunately become breeding grounds for cyberbullying and criminal activities. The anonymity provided by these platforms has led to tragic incidents of harassment and even abduction.   In addition, the rise of internet hackers has posed a significant threat to online security and financial well-being. These hackers exploit vulnerabilities in online systems to steal sensitive information and funds from unsuspecting individuals. The widespread use of personal information on multiple online platforms has made many users susceptible to hacking attacks, putting their privacy and finances at risk.  In conclusion, the negative impacts of excessive computer usage, including diminished personal interactions, online risks, and financial vulnerabilities, highlight the need for moderation in technology consumption. By implementing measures to limit computer usage and enhance online security, we can mitigate these risks and create a safer digital environment for all.
264	264	1	3	Dear editor, what do you do all day? The answer is probably sitting in front of a computer. Many people, including my friends, believe that this sedentary lifestyle is unhealthy. Research has shown that excessive computer use can have negative effects on our health. My friends often say that spending too much time on computers is a waste of time. They argue that people who spend all day in front of a screen often neglect their diet and exercise routines, leading to poor health. Dr. Smith has conducted extensive research on this topic and emphasizes the importance of getting outside and enjoying nature. He believes that fresh air and physical activity are essential for a healthy life. My mom, who has firsthand experience with computers, agrees. She recalls a time when people were more active and engaged with their families and friends. She believes that maintaining strong relationships with loved ones is crucial for overall well-being. So, editor, I urge you to consider highlighting the importance of balancing computer use with physical activity, spending time in nature, and nurturing relationships in your next article. By emphasizing these points, you can help promote healthier lifestyles and happier communities. Thank you for your dedication to informing and educating the public.
265	265	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers. The subject of so many debates over the years, from lawyers against judges to parents against children. Could it be too much of a good thing? Are computers the cause of increased awkwardness in today's society? Certainly, it can't be too good that your entire life is documented in a place where anyone can go. And then there is the content of what you are viewing. One of the top picked-through subjects in the world, are people really less interested in exercise than they were in the @NUM2's? Studies show that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people were overweight. That number has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1, as of @DATE1. Amazing! And some of these people might be safer staying inside. If you've played a video game where the player can lose health, you'll know what happens when the bar runs out. You restart. After playing @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @MONTH1 want to try that gravity-defying, head-turning stunt. And let me tell you, there is no restarting after that. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 is recording everything you do online? If, say, you are a budding guitarist and are looking around for a new Gibson, you'll start getting all these ads for online stores, @CAPS12? Because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your info to businesses. And you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button. So spam email comes. But something even worse is on the way. Your bank account number. That's right, I went there. If a virus gets onto your computer, your money could vanish. So be responsible. This brings us to our last subject. The touchy one. It used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women. Now, it is just a click of a button away. And that is bad enough. Young boys are snagged early, their futures now controlled by this disease. But add to that the immense risk of a virus attack, and you're in a heap of trouble. So I'm not saying computers are terrible, just that they could be too much of a good thing. Sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress, by taking it out on a hapless alien. Just use the technology at your hands responsibly. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.
266	266	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I strongly agree that computers have positively affected people in many ways. The convenience and entertainment they provide have truly made a difference in our daily lives. With the increasing use of computers, technology has advanced, allowing people to access a wealth of information at their fingertips. Whether it's looking up the capital of a country or checking the weather, the computer is a reliable source for quick answers. Many individuals, like my cousin Courtney, benefit from the convenience of using the computer for homework assignments or research.   Moreover, the computer serves as a great source of entertainment for individuals of all ages. From listening to music and playing games to connecting with friends and family online, the computer offers endless opportunities for enjoyment. For instance, my neighbor, Sarah, finds solace in playing games and chatting with friends on the computer after a long day at school. Additionally, the ability to communicate with relatives who live far away, like Sarah's cousins in another state, adds to the computer's value as a source of entertainment.  In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, providing convenience and entertainment to users worldwide. Dr. Smith's observation that the computer is a primary source of entertainment for many individuals rings true, and it's clear that taking away this valuable tool would be detrimental. Whether for quick information or leisure activities, the computer has undoubtedly made a positive impact on society as a whole.
267	267	1	3	To whom it may concern, the joy of just clicking a mouse and all of a sudden you are talking with a friend you haven't seen in years. Computers make this a reality for us, but that isn't the only benefit they offer. Computers help society by providing us with search engines and educational resources allowing us to connect easily with friends and family, helping us communicate importance and plan things and a lot more.  First, computers have become a vital part of education and research alike. Students at schools, elementary through college, are able to connect with much more information than without computers. You can even earn a college degree on the computer! That's right online universities are beginning to form. This is great for moms who want to get a degree but have to stay home with their children. Also, computer technology has been applied to research in science and hospitals. New discoveries have advanced with the help of computers that will actually help people's lives! Computers are used to search for a cure to cancer disasters such as earthquakes, and even help see a disease someone has before its symptoms even begin to occur! Computers have helped save lives and benefit lives in ways people never could have imagined sixty years ago.  Secondly, computers allow people to connect and reconnect with other people around the world. I recently got a Facebook account, and within a few days I had found and reconnected with three friends of mine that had moved away, a distant cousin who had moved to another country that I haven't seen since we were little, and even my great grandmother! The possibilities are endless. Email has also been very beneficial to society as well, as it helps people communicate and plan events, which brings me to my next topic.  Lastly, computers help the world communicate with one another. The internet is filled with websites made to benefit our society, one being Wikipedia; an online encyclopedia. If not for computers, this program wouldn't have been as successful and beneficial as it has become. Also, FreeRice is an amazing website that combines education with the aspect of donating rice to those in need. It quizzes you on different levels of general knowledge, and for each correct answer, FreeRice donates 10 grains of rice. When I am bored, I sometimes go on, and so far, I have filled over thirty bowls of rice, while learning at the same time!  In conclusion, computers have proven to benefit the world and all in it, not only people but the environment, too. Computers help advance research, help people reconnect with one another, and help the world communicate. Who knows what computers will help us accomplish next?
268	268	1	3	Dear @CAPS1,  I would like to tell you that computers have played a significant role in our evolution, enabling us to learn, connect with others, and improve our hand-eye coordination. Despite some criticism, I believe that computers are beneficial as they provide access to information, facilitate communication with distant loved ones, and enhance physical skills. In today's world, when conducting research or staying in touch with family and friends, computers have become indispensable tools. They not only offer a vast amount of knowledge at our fingertips but also enable us to bridge geographical distances through online communication. Moreover, using a computer can even improve hand-eye coordination, as we interact with the screen and perform various tasks. Contrary to the belief that computers isolate individuals, they actually help us stay connected with others, as I have experienced while chatting with my sister in another room. Overall, computers are valuable assets that have positively impacted our lives in numerous ways. Don't you agree that computers are truly remarkable inventions?
269	269	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I do believe that many people, especially teenagers and youth, are spending too much time on the computer, which can be considered as an addiction. As someone who grew up disliking computers and preferring outdoor activities, I have noticed a shift towards excessive computer usage in my own life as well. This trend not only takes away valuable family time but also hinders social interactions and physical activities. Before the era of computers, families used to spend quality time together, engaging in conversations and playing games. Nowadays, instead of interacting with each other, people are glued to social media platforms and online games. This behavior not only affects family bonding but also limits opportunities for physical exercise and mental stimulation. Reading, for example, is a great alternative to computer usage as it not only enhances cognitive abilities but also allows individuals to engage in meaningful discussions with others. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between computer usage and other activities to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. Let's prioritize family time, outdoor activities, and reading over excessive computer usage to ensure a well-rounded and enriching life.
270	270	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 sun, I find that computers are very useful. They help people in many ways. They let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach hand-eye coordination, and let you meet people online. First, people can learn about what is happening around the world. I can find out what is happening where I live by looking up your newspaper. Other people can find out about places they might go. They can find out what the weather is like so they know how to pack when going places. Also, if one of your employees is going camping they can look up a good place to camp and they can look up what kind of dangers there is when you camp so they can avoid them, because if they get sick they can't work. As you can see computers are important. Next, computers teach hand-eye coordination. Many jobs need you to be able to work well with your hands. Let's say one of your printers break down so you call someone to come fix it. They must be able to work well with their hands to fix it. Now let's say the wiring in your lights gets messed up. So you call an electrician who has to be good with his hands to be able to work with small wires. Both of these people are good with their hands and they could have become that way by using computers. As you can see, computers are important in today's life. Lastly, computers let you meet new people online. Let's say you are all alone after a hard day of making newspapers. You could go online and meet new people in chat rooms and online games. Now, let's say that one of your employees just broke up with his girlfriend and he is sad and lonely, so he isn't working as well. He could go on an online dating site and meet the perfect girl. Now when he comes to work he is happier and making more papers, and if he makes more papers you make more money. As you can see, computers are very important. In conclusion, computers are wonderful machines. They can let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach people good hand-eye coordination, and let people meet new people online.
271	271	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard about your problems with computers, and would like to state my opinion. I think that computers teach you more than they disable you. For example, say you have a research project and you need to look something up, you can easily find the information on the computer. Additionally, if you are planning a trip to a new destination like @LOCATION1, you can use the internet to learn more about the culture and lifestyle there. Another benefit of computers is the ability to stay connected with family and friends through online communication platforms. Overall, computers offer a wealth of opportunities for learning, research, and staying connected with others.
272	272	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think Computers have a positive effect on people because it helps their education, you can talk to family and friends, and you can get better hand-eye coordination. Computers are essential tools for students, providing easy access to information and resources necessary for academic success. With the convenience of laptops, students can work on assignments anytime, anywhere, without being restricted by library hours or commuting. This accessibility is crucial for meeting tight deadlines and staying on top of academic responsibilities.  Furthermore, computers facilitate communication with loved ones through various platforms such as email, video calls, and social media. These technologies allow individuals to stay connected with family and friends, regardless of geographical distances. For instance, video calls enable face-to-face interactions, making it possible for relatives to witness important life events and share precious moments in real-time. The cost-effectiveness of digital communication also reduces the financial burden compared to traditional phone services.  Moreover, engaging with computer activities like gaming can enhance hand-eye coordination and multitasking skills. Video games, in particular, require players to react quickly to visual stimuli, improving reflexes and coordination. This not only enhances cognitive abilities but also promotes physical health through active engagement. By incorporating gaming into daily routines, individuals can enjoy entertainment while sharpening their motor skills.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in education, communication, and skill development, making them invaluable assets in modern society. Their positive impact on individuals' lives is evident through improved academic performance, strengthened relationships, and enhanced cognitive abilities. Embracing the benefits of technology is essential for personal growth and societal advancement.
273	273	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,   I believe that computers have negative effects on people. One reason is that individuals are becoming less healthy due to spending excessive time on computers. It is essential for both children and adults to limit their screen time and engage in physical activities outdoors. While computers can be useful for research purposes, excessive use can lead to detrimental effects such as eye strain and laziness. Encouraging outdoor play and social interactions can help improve overall health and well-being.  Furthermore, the internet can be a platform for spreading harmful information about others. Posting negative content online can have severe consequences, leading to bullying and damaged relationships. It is crucial to be mindful of the content shared on the internet to avoid causing harm to others and potentially ruining relationships.  Lastly, the rise in overweight individuals is a concerning issue linked to computer usage. Leading a sedentary lifestyle and spending prolonged hours in front of a screen can contribute to weight gain and health problems. It is important to promote physical activity and healthy habits to prevent obesity-related illnesses.  In conclusion, while computers can offer valuable information and entertainment, it is essential to balance screen time with physical activity and real-life interactions. By being mindful of our online behavior and prioritizing our health, we can mitigate the negative effects of excessive computer use on individuals. Let's strive to lead a balanced lifestyle for our overall well-being.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
274	274	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 would you like to be warmly greeted by the zingbobway table @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION2, say hi to a far away family member again or maybe quicken your reflexes? Well, you can! Computers are a useful way @ORGANIZATION1 of completing tasks. Imagine your family member or friend fighting in the war miles away. Wouldn't you want to see them at least once? Computers allow you to interact with them with webcams. You can see them and talk with them. Not only can you talk with family, you can talk to friends. You can make new friends from around the world without leaving your house. You can have a new best friend every day! Not only can you talk to people on computers, they give you better hand-eye coordination, and they quicken your reflexes. Dr. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1,. says ""@CAPS2 have shown that people who type or use a computer have better reflexes than those who don't."" Having a computer around is easier for school also. I remember one time, I had to write a @NUM1 page paper for @CAPS4 and it was due the next day. I wrote the beginning @ORGANIZATION1 it and my hand started to cramp up. I had to finish my paper soon so I ran to my computer and typed it in half the time I would've spent writing it. I also got good hand-eye coordination. Not only do you type on it, you learn on it. @NUM2 out @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM3 computers are used for learning about places and people. Say you just won @NUM1 free tickets to go anywhere in the world with a celebrity of your choosing! With a computer, you could research anywhere you want and make that trip one of the best days @ORGANIZATION1 your life. And even if you don't like actually going to other places, you can virtually go there on a computer. With computers, you can see the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1, the tropical reef fish @ORGANIZATION1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 at the click of a button. Computers hold the world at your fingertips. So as you can see, computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to interact with cities, increase your hand-eye coordination, and allow you to have the world at your fingertips. So stop reading and use a computer!"
275	275	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, Advances in technology and computers continue to raise concerns about the impact they have on individuals and society as a whole. Companies like @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1 constantly release updates and new features for their computer systems, leading to increased screen time for many people. This excessive screen time can have detrimental effects on various aspects of life.  One major issue is the decline in outdoor activities and exercise. With the allure of computers and the internet, children and adults alike are spending more time indoors and less time engaging in physical activities. The lack of time spent in nature not only deprives individuals of the benefits of fresh air and sunlight but also contributes to the rising rates of obesity and sedentary lifestyles.  Furthermore, the excessive use of computers can also disrupt valuable family time. Instead of interacting with family members and building strong relationships, individuals are often engrossed in their screens, leading to a disconnect within families. Family support and encouragement are essential for personal growth and development, and the prevalence of computers can hinder the nurturing of these important connections.  In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly simplified many aspects of life, their overuse can have negative consequences on health, relationships, and overall well-being. It is important for individuals to strike a balance between technology use and other essential activities to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.
276	276	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I believe that computers are bad news. Most kids come home from school and go on aim. So they can talk to their friends. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are obese. I feel it is better to play outside with your friends than sitting in a chair playing on the computer. If kids go outside and play with their friends they will have more fun. Also kids will learn how to interact with each other by playing outside together. The kids will see more nature and be able to learn more about animals. When kids are on computers they are sitting there doing nothing. Also some kids post pictures of themselves on things like facebook that are not appropriate and can get them in lots of trouble. They also say things that they wouldn't normally say to a person's face. The computer is simply a way for kids to get in trouble. When you're outside playing baseball, football, or tag with your friends you are getting exercise and you're having lots of fun. If you are getting lots of exercise then you are most likely not going to be obese. Some say the computer is good for hand-eye coordination but catching a football or hitting is better. Also some say computers can tell you about faraway places but that's what school is for. I am saying that exercise and playing with your friends is better than talking to your friends or video chatting with them, @CAPS2 are too many overweight people in @LOCATION1 and the computer is not helping the cause.  Playing outside not only keeps kids active but also helps them socialize and learn about the world around them. It's important for children to engage in physical activities rather than spend hours in front of a screen. Let's encourage our youth to put down their devices and enjoy the outdoors for a healthier lifestyle.
277	277	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION2 press, I wonder if you know that 85% of people out of 500 surveyed by the university in @LOCATION1 agreed that using laptops and computers had a very good benefit on their life? I agree that computers benefit society and everyday life. With a computer, you can interact with people all around the world, they can help with school work, and make everyday life easier. Five years ago I had to move from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION3. We had to leave all of our family and friends behind. However, with this great technology, we could email them, instant message them, and video chat with them, instead of having to spend money to make long-distance calls. There are many people out there like me who have friends and family far away, whether it's family in different countries, old schoolmates, or camp friends using a computer is a great way to keep in touch with one another.   Using a computer can also make life easier. Moms taking care of their kids might not be able to go to restaurants with one kid not wanting to get off his video games, the other watching their favorite show. Thankfully, that mom can go online, pick the food that she wants and the quantity, and have someone deliver it. That mother also might not be able to get out and go shopping. So with her computer, she can go to her favorite store's website and pick the clothes she wants. And then when winter comes, a computer can be great not to worry about not having enough time to go and. Computers just make life that much simpler!   Statistics show that more people shop online instead of going in person. ""Computers are great, I can do my homework and know that if I need to write something down, then I can do it on my computer. They can find more information on the computer from Google.com than they could find in their local library. You can find almost anything with search engines on your computer! Some people do disagree with the use of computers, and some also believe that some people abuse the benefits of computers and spend too much time on it and not exercising and enjoying nature enough. This is true, but as long as you stay reasonable with your computer usage, it benefits you in many ways. Like I said, it's great for keeping connections between people, simplifying everyday life, and researching for school.   Overall, computers have become an essential part of our lives, providing numerous benefits that make our daily tasks easier and more efficient. As long as we use them responsibly, the advantages of computers in our society are undeniable."

280	280	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. They even allow people to talk online. Computers are a very useful piece of machinery.  Computers teach hand-eye coordination. When you're in school, you need to type lots of prompts, labs, and vocab. Computers help us do that. Typing fast and correctly takes practice. Typing without looking at the keyboard is hand-eye coordination. This will help us later on in life also.  Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places. Years ago I took a trip to @LOCATION3 for the first time. I didn't know a lot about the history of @LOCATION3, so I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. Suddenly, it was like I was in @LOCATION3! I read about the delicious food and rich culture. I took a virtual tour of the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the great @CAPS7. I heard @CAPS8 music and learned some @CAPS8. In just an hour, I visited @LOCATION3 right from my very own house! Computers can take you on a magical journey to a far away country.  Computers allow people to talk online with other people. This is a very good thing. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2 and because of the time difference, it's not always easy to talk on the phone, so we use the computer. My family will send emails back and forth with them. Sometimes we will even video chat! Networking sites accessible by computer such as @CAPS10 or @CAPS11 allow us to talk to people who we don't regularly see. On @CAPS11, you can even talk to your favorite stars or musicians. Computers let us keep in touch with others.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by teaching hand-eye coordination, allowing us to learn about distant places, and enabling communication with others online. Despite concerns about excessive screen time, computers play a valuable role in modern society, enhancing our educational, cultural, and social experiences.
281	281	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper writer,   I believe that computers benefit our society because they enable us to connect with people more quickly and easily. With computers, we can communicate through email with our family and friends at any time, without the need for lengthy phone calls. This convenience makes our lives more efficient and productive.   Furthermore, computers offer a wide range of possibilities beyond communication. We can access various websites, such as social media platforms, news outlets, and educational resources. Additionally, many people use computers for work purposes, allowing them to complete tasks more effectively.   While it is important not to spend excessive amounts of time on computers, the benefits they bring to our society are undeniable. They have revolutionized the way we interact, work, and access information. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in enhancing our daily lives and improving overall communication and efficiency.   Thank you for considering these perspectives on the positive impact of computers on our society.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
282	282	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I heard that you wanted some opinions on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. I know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions but I think computers have a positive effect on people. The main thing that computers are great for is research. Without computers, kids an adults won't be provided with the necissary tools for knowledge. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students have computers at home and that @NUM3 person without computer access gets about @PERCENT1 of a lower grade because of poor research ability on projects. Another reason why computers are good because it can bring the world together. Facbook, @CAPS2, and twitter users can chat with people accross the street, accross the country and even accross the ocean! People in the @LOCATION5 can play games and chat with people in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION3! My last reason is that computers are great for buiesnessess. A lot of people have websites for their jobs that can get them well known and for people to know what their buisness is about. Take for example your newspaper. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to get your research or even type or print your newspaper. Your website wouldn't be able to persuade people to read your newspaper. Even though some people might abuse their computer privlages by staying on too long instead of exercising or interacting withpeople but thats them. It's only @PERCENT2 of people with computers that do it! And so what, its their time and they want to spend it on the computer. What can you do to change? Nothing. And with that, I conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are great for people! They give us research, they help us with school and buiesnessess and they allow us to talk to people around the world. In conclusion, computers have a myriad of benefits that enhance our lives and connect us in ways that were never before possible.
283	283	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  I am writing to express my disagreement with the idea of restricting kids from using computers. Computers offer a variety of benefits for children, such as improving hand-eye coordination and providing essential tools for completing homework assignments. In today's digital age, computer literacy is a valuable skill that can benefit children in their future careers. Additionally, the use of computers can serve as a means of relaxation for kids after a long day at school.  Homework often requires the use of a computer, and without access to this technology, students would struggle to complete their assignments efficiently. It is essential for schools to provide students with the necessary resources to succeed academically, and computers play a crucial role in this process. By limiting children's access to computers, we would be hindering their educational development.  Furthermore, computers offer a form of entertainment and relaxation for kids. After a demanding day at school, being able to unwind by listening to music or playing games on the computer can help alleviate stress and improve overall well-being. Taking away this source of relaxation could have a negative impact on children's mental health.  In conclusion, the benefits of allowing kids to use computers outweigh any potential drawbacks. Computers play a vital role in education, offer valuable learning opportunities, and provide a means of relaxation for children. Therefore, I believe that it is essential to continue to allow kids to use computers as part of their daily routine.  Sincerely, [Your Name]

285	285	1	3	I walked into my living room to find my mom engrossed in the computer screen, scrolling through images of vacation destinations. It struck me how the internet had captivated her more than anything else, prompting me to ponder the incredible impact of computers on our lives. The increasing number of people embracing technology signifies a shift towards a more connected world. I have always been a staunch advocate for computers, firmly believing in their immense potential.  Computers have revolutionized the way we work, making tasks more efficient and manageable. They have bridged the gap between people, enabling instant communication with individuals across the globe. I reminisced about reconnecting with long-lost friends through the power of the internet, reaffirming the invaluable role computers play in fostering relationships.  One common argument against computers is the sedentary lifestyle they promote, but I have found a way to counter this. By incorporating exercise into my daily routine whenever I use the computer, I have witnessed a significant improvement in my physical well-being. This simple yet effective strategy has not only strengthened my muscles but also instilled a sense of discipline in me.  Moreover, the vast expanse of information available on the internet is truly remarkable. I recalled instances where the internet served as a treasure trove of knowledge, aiding me in research projects and academic endeavors. The ability of computers to educate and enlighten individuals on a plethora of subjects is unparalleled.  In essence, computers are a gateway to a world of endless possibilities. They foster connections, promote physical activity, and serve as a reservoir of knowledge. Embracing the positive aspects of technology can undoubtedly enhance our lives and broaden our horizons. Let us continue to extol the virtues of computers and harness their potential for the greater good.
286	286	1	3	Dear computer co., computers have a negative effect. Why would you go outside if you could play life-like games on your computer? I think that the games on the computer should be removed so people could enjoy all of the great things in life. If people weren't on computers all day, they would pay attention to the way they're destroying nature.  By spending less time on computers, individuals could engage more with the environment and appreciate the beauty of nature. Instead of being glued to screens, they could explore the outdoors, breathe in fresh air, and connect with the natural world around them. This shift in focus would not only benefit individuals by promoting physical activity and reducing screen time, but it would also contribute to the preservation of our planet.  Removing the temptation of computer games would encourage people to prioritize real-life experiences and create lasting memories outside of the digital realm. It's time to unplug, step outside, and embrace all the wonders that nature has to offer. Let's make a conscious effort to protect our environment and live more fulfilling lives beyond the confines of technology.
287	287	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Your resources, entertainment, and communication may be under scrutiny by some who believe that computers are detrimental to society. However, the benefits of computers cannot be overlooked. Computers serve as valuable educational tools, enhancing skills such as hand-eye coordination. Take, for example, the case of @PERSON1, whose hand-eye coordination significantly improved after using a computer for just a month. This demonstrates the positive impact of technology on physical abilities.  Moreover, computers provide access to information about distant places like the @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION4, allowing individuals to explore the world from the comfort of their homes. Not everyone can afford to travel to these locations, making virtual exploration a valuable alternative. Research indicates that a majority of people desire to witness phenomena like the @ORGANIZATION1 lights, but many are unable to make the journey. The computer bridges this gap, enabling individuals to experience such wonders without facing the challenges of travel.  Additionally, computers facilitate communication with loved ones who are far away. @LOCATION3 Local's editor highlights how technology has strengthened their bond with parents living over @NUM8 miles away. Through regular communication on the computer, they have been able to stay connected and bridge the physical distance between them. This underscores the importance of computers in fostering relationships and maintaining connections with family members.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in enhancing skills, expanding knowledge, and strengthening relationships. Despite criticism, it is evident that computers offer numerous benefits that enrich our lives in various ways. Next time someone questions the value of computers, remember these examples and advocate for the positive impact they have on society.
288	288	1	3	Dear newspaper, it is evident that excessive use of computers and the internet can have detrimental effects on individuals. Not only does it lead to a lack of focus on important activities and relationships, but it also results in a decrease in physical activity and sleep. People who are addicted to the internet often neglect their responsibilities, including studying or doing chores. This addiction can also lead to strained relationships with family and friends, as individuals spend more time online than engaging in meaningful interactions. It is crucial to recognize the negative consequences of spending too much time on the internet and take steps to find a healthy balance in our daily lives. Let us prioritize real-life connections and activities over virtual ones to ensure a well-rounded and fulfilling lifestyle.
289	289	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, The effect that computers have on people is not a positive one. I think people spend way too much time on computers, some information on computers is inaccurate, there are still telephones and cellphones that people can use fir communication. A majority of peoples' time is spent on the computer. Whether its playing games, checking @CAPS2-mail, or even working, peoples' valuable time is getting used up. This time could be used by doing more important things such as being with friends and family, being outside with nature or exercising. Being on the computer insteads of exercising has had a huge effect on people. Some people are overweight because they eat and then do not exercise after. My sister works on the all day and she says @NUM1 or @NUM2 ladies at her work are un healthy because all they do is go on the the computer and eat granola bars, wich are usually healthy. If others spent at least a half an hour being outside to @CAPS3 some fresh air instead of using a computer most of them would feel a lot better. My doctor always used to tell me and my brother, ""@CAPS3 out and play an hour a day!"" This is true, and I strongly encourage people to go outside and do an activity as opposed to playing on the computer. The computer is used a lot for researching. Some of the information on the computer is very helpful, but you can never really know what information is inaccurate. At least when you research using a book or encyclopedia, you can trust those sources. What if you had to do a report and you could only use the internet, how would you be able to tell if the information is trustworthy? Sure, computers also teach hand-eye coordination by playing video games, but when in real life, will you need to know how to shoot a dragon or dodge candy that's falling from the sky? This is just an example of unneeded information and skills that keeps people wanting to go back on the computer. Another thing you can do on the computer is communicte with others. When computers weren't invented or even that advanced, people were more than happy to give one another a call. Now with computers, people @CAPS2-mail, instant message, or even skype; a webcam website. What even happened to cellphones, you can take.  Overall, while computers have their benefits, it is essential to balance their use with other activities that promote physical and mental well-being. Spending excessive time on computers can lead to negative consequences, such as reduced physical activity, reliance on potentially inaccurate information, and decreased face-to-face communication. It is crucial to prioritize real-life experiences and interactions over excessive screen time to maintain a healthy lifestyle."
290	290	1	3	Dear reader, people have been debating whether or not computers are actually benefiting society, especially now that the majority of individuals now own one of these helpful machines. Computers help people with everyday tasks and are no doubt doing more good than harm. Imagine how impossible it would be for most people to do their jobs without them - life would become much harder for the people living on this planet. Think of the successful schools in our country, and then think of which of those schools don't have computers. Computers are the easiest way to look up information, something important when children are learning. Whenever someone needs to know something, they just google it. This comes in handy when researching for that huge project due next week. People have never been so knowledgeable. Computers are not only important for school, but also in the workplace. They serve almost the same environments. Now that computers are so common, people can conveniently type up a paper and submit it to their boss or teacher. It saves time and effort with a more professional result. Computers also serve the important purpose of communication using email or instant messaging, one could communicate with someone on the other side of the world without that enormous phone bill. Some may see this as dangerous because you could be chatting with a complete stranger. However, it is also opening your eyes to new cultures. Now it's possible to learn about life in a different country first hand. If computers were no more, it would be extremely hard for a regular person to interact with someone from another country. It's almost like isolation from the world. There are many out there who take great interest in learning other languages. Better ways exist than sitting in a classroom listening to someone talk. As a person on this planet, do you really want to be kept separate from others just because they don't live close enough? A main concern about computers is that no one will want to read books and anything else. However, a recent study shows that after computers came out, more people have begun to read. This proves that just because there is now something fun and new, it doesn't mean everything else is trash. People will still continue to do things they always did, just with something new on their list. In addition, it is the option of everyone whether or not they want to spend their time on the computer. If someone doesn't like the idea, they have no right to take it away from someone else. Computers were created to help the human race, not control it. If a person doesn't want one, they don't have to get one - everything is up to them, and that is the way it should remain. The next time you see a computer, don't think of it as some sort of obsession that's keeping people from doing other things they could be. But as a universal device that allows them to broaden their horizons and learn things they probably wouldn't go to the library to look for. Computers aren't holding anyone back, but pushing everyone forward, whether at work, school, or even at home, they benefit everyone, everywhere.
291	291	1	3	Have you ever thought about all the amazing things that computers have done for us? Now, we can learn about anything we want, talk with people on the other side of the world, and even advance in other areas of technology. Computers have, without a doubt, had a positive effect on people. Just imagine this...one second you can be in the blazing deserts of @LOCATION3, the next in a lush, steamy jungle thriving with animals...All without leaving your room! Using computers, people can learn about new places and things whenever they want. The millions of resources on the internet make it possible to learn about other places and times. Although this information may be in a local library, going on the computer is MUCH easier. Who wants to go through the trouble of loaning books from the library when the internet is there for your use any time? No registration to get a library card, no late fees, and no waiting lists. It is quite clear that using your computer to do research is a very valuable thing. Nine out of ten people said that they would rather email a person than talk on the phone with them. Now, with computers, people can instant message or email anyone, anywhere in the world. Making a call from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 can be very expensive, but with email, I can talk to my best friend, @PERSON1, free of charge. I remember when she moved to @LOCATION2. It was sad, but we promised to stay in touch. With e-mail and instant messaging, it was easy to talk and exchange the latest news! Having the ability to communicate with someone easily is an unbelievable privilege that would be nonexistent without computers to help us. Lastly, computers have helped people make advances in other areas of technology. Where would we be in science and medicine without computers? These machines have helped scientists to do experiments. With a simulated experiment, they can be positive that no other variables will affect their results. Now, experiments can be extremely accurate. Computers have helped advance medicine as well. They have been the key to unlocking all sorts of cures for dangerous diseases. Who knows, maybe in a few years there will be a cure for cancer. All of these amazing accomplishments have been positively affected by computers. Although some people may think that computers have a negative impact on our day-to-day life, I strongly disagree. People have learned, talked, and made advances in technology with one click of a mouse. Computers have affected people positively in many ways, so, click away! Computers have none of that.
292	292	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 the world forty years ago was a very different place compared to today. People had to physically go to libraries to do research, handwrite documents, and rely on typewriters for official correspondence. Life was undoubtedly more challenging back then. However, the advent of computers has revolutionized the way we live and work. Communication has become seamless, with the ability to connect with individuals worldwide and access a vast array of information on the internet. Social networking sites have reconnected long-lost friends and relatives, bringing people closer together. Video chat capabilities have enabled virtual face-to-face interactions, bridging the distance between loved ones separated by geographical boundaries. The internet has become a treasure trove of knowledge, with websites like @CAPS5.Dcotors.Com offering valuable medical information at the click of a button. Computers have also streamlined educational processes, making research and typing assignments more efficient for students and teachers alike. Moreover, typing classes have improved hand-eye coordination, benefitting individuals in various aspects of their lives. In essence, computers have become indispensable tools that have greatly enhanced our daily lives. Abandoning them would undoubtedly lead to a significant regression in the way we communicate, learn, and connect with others.
293	293	1	3	Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers on people is that without them, we couldn't research important people and events. In today's digital age, the ability to look up information online has become essential for learning about historical figures and significant moments in history. For example, if someone wanted to know more about a past president like Harry @PERSON1, a quick search on the internet would provide all the necessary information.   Furthermore, @CAPS1 believes that computers play a crucial role in enabling us to type important papers. With the prevalence of digital documents, typing has become a common practice for creating reports, essays, and other written work. Without computers, everything would have to be handwritten, posing challenges for individuals with poor handwriting skills.  Lastly, @CAPS1 points out that computers facilitate communication by allowing us to connect with others online and offline. Whether it's sending an email to a family member, reaching out to a friend on social media, or engaging in instant messaging, computers provide various channels for staying in touch with loved ones. This digital connectivity has revolutionized the way we interact with one another.  In conclusion, the impact of computers on people is undeniable, as they enhance our ability to research, type, and communicate effectively. As we continue to rely on technology for these essential tasks, it's important to recognize the valuable role that computers play in our daily lives.
294	294	1	3	Dear readers of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 people today are debating whether having a computer benefits society. Computers benefit society in various ways, such as assisting children with their school work. Not all children are outgoing, but having access to a computer can greatly benefit them. Additionally, not all kids have a clear idea of their future career paths, but using a computer can help guide them in discovering their interests and talents.  Computers play a crucial role in helping children with their schoolwork, from math problems to research projects. Furthermore, computers facilitate communication in society, allowing individuals to connect with others and form friendships. This is especially important for shy individuals who may find it challenging to socialize in person.  Moreover, computers can aid individuals in exploring their passions and talents. For example, people can use computers to showcase their photography skills, write stories, or even pursue a career in technology by learning how to repair computers. By utilizing computers, individuals can discover hidden talents and potentially turn them into successful ventures.  In conclusion, computers are valuable tools that contribute to the betterment of society. They assist in education, enhance communication, and aid individuals in self-discovery. Overall, computers play a significant role in shaping a more connected and informed society.
295	295	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that technology, especially computers, can have negative effects on both children and adults. Excessive use of computers can lead to addiction, causing individuals to spend less time with their loved ones and engage in fewer physical activities. This addiction can consume one's mind, leading to neglect of important aspects of life. People may forget what truly matters and become isolated in a digital world. Furthermore, spending too much time on computers can have detrimental effects on one's physical health, as it may lead to laziness and a lack of exercise. This is particularly concerning for teenagers who are constantly surrounded by various electronic devices. Additionally, excessive computer use can result in decreased quality time spent with family and friends, as individuals prioritize their screens over meaningful relationships. It is crucial to find a balance and not let technology take over our lives. In conclusion, the negative impact of computer addiction on individuals' mental, physical, and social well-being is a growing concern that needs to be addressed. Let's strive to use technology responsibly and prioritize real-life experiences over screen time.
296	296	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1, & I think that computers are very useful and that people learn a lot from them. The computer is very smart and is probably the best technology invented. Computers help when you need to know something about a certain person. For example, they help students with homework. Another reason why I think computers are useful is that they help you get in touch with family and friends.  Computers are valuable when you need facts about a person. For instance, if you need to research a criminal record or learn about someone's background, a computer can provide you with that information. In the same way, if a teacher assigns a report on a particular individual, using a computer to research their life can be very beneficial. Additionally, computers can be a great tool for exploring the history of countries and their leaders.  Furthermore, computers assist students with their homework by providing writing programs for assignments and helping them access information quickly. If a student forgets their homework or needs to find a specific book, a computer can be a lifesaver in locating the necessary resources. This technology streamlines the educational process and makes learning more efficient.  Lastly, computers facilitate communication with family and friends. Online messengers and social media platforms enable quick and easy interaction, bridging distances and fostering relationships. Moreover, webcam capabilities allow for face-to-face conversations even when miles apart, enhancing the connection between loved ones.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in society by aiding in research, education, and communication. Their versatility and efficiency make them indispensable tools for modern living.
297	297	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I assume you've heard about the ongoing debate about computers. I personally believe that computers benefit society. I believe this because computers benefit by their online capabilities, access to the internet, and overall assistance in various tasks.   My first reason for why computers benefit society is that they provide online services. By being able to communicate with others online through chat rooms or conduct financial transactions through online banking, people can boost their morale and save time and resources that would have been spent on in-person activities. This is especially beneficial for military personnel who can connect with their families online, improving their emotional well-being.   My second reason is the internet, which offers numerous advantages to society. People can shop online, learn about different cultures, and stay informed about current events. The internet also serves as a valuable tool for education, allowing students to access a wealth of information to enhance their learning. Additionally, it facilitates the dissemination of news, ensuring that people are promptly informed about important events in their community.  Lastly, computers provide assistance in various situations beyond just their immediate use. For example, they can help improve students' grades by enabling them to research topics more efficiently. Additionally, computer training, such as playing online games, can enhance skills like hand-eye coordination, which is crucial for activities like target shooting.   While some may argue that computers detract from physical activity, solutions like purchasing indoor exercise equipment online can address this concern. Overall, computers benefit society through their online capabilities, access to the internet, and assistance in various tasks. Thank you for considering my perspective.
298	298	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computer use is beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, it helps individuals develop hand-eye coordination, enhancing their ability to focus their eyes while using their hands simultaneously. This can be particularly useful for tasks that require precision and dexterity. Secondly, computers provide a platform for people to learn about different states and countries, allowing them to explore various cultures, traditions, and landscapes from around the world. This can broaden one's perspective and knowledge of the global community. Lastly, computers enable individuals to stay connected with their family and friends, regardless of geographical distance. Through online platforms, people can communicate, share experiences, and maintain relationships with loved ones. In addition to these reasons, computers offer various functions such as gaming, note-taking, and problem-solving tools like calculators. Overall, the use of computers can enrich people's lives in multiple ways, making them a valuable resource in today's digital age.
299	299	1	3	I don't think computers have a negative effect on people. In fact, I believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals for several reasons. Firstly, computers allow individuals to learn about faraway places that they may not be able to visit physically. Through the internet, people can access information and images of distant locations, expanding their knowledge and understanding of the world. Additionally, computers play a crucial role in the job market, especially in the computer and business sectors. Many jobs today require computer skills, and without this technology, individuals may struggle to find employment. Lastly, computers enable people to communicate with others from faraway through video chats and messaging platforms. This helps in maintaining relationships with friends and family members who are not physically close. In conclusion, computers offer a wealth of benefits, including access to information, job opportunities, and connection with others, making them a valuable tool in today's society.
300	300	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, have you looked at a map lately? All you see are computers everywhere. From towns to states, countries, and even the world, computers dominate our lives. It's time to break free from this digital prison and start living life to the fullest. We need to shut down these computers and start exercising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with our families.   Think about the impact these computers are having on our health. Obesity is on the rise, and it's no surprise considering how much time we spend glued to our screens. Take @CAPS5 for example, who used to weigh over @NUM1 pounds until he decided to ditch the computer and focus on exercise. Within a year, he lost a significant amount of weight and improved his health.   According to @PERSON1, a doctor and fitness expert, if more people turned off their computers and hit the gym, we could significantly reduce obesity rates. It's time to take action and prioritize our health over technology.   But it's not just our physical health that's at stake. Our connection to nature is also suffering because of our obsession with computers. Imagine the beauty of nature that we're missing out on – the lush greenery, majestic waterfalls, and serene forests. We need to unplug and reconnect with the natural world around us.   And let's not forget about the impact on our families. Many people are so engrossed in their digital devices that they neglect spending time with their loved ones. This lack of communication can lead to relationship breakdowns and unhappiness within families.   The future we're heading towards is one where computers control us, dictate our every move, and keep us from living our best lives. It's time to take a stand and break free from this cycle of dependence on technology. Will you join us in this fight to reclaim our health, reconnect with nature, and strengthen our family bonds? The choice is yours.
301	301	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 is all about Computers. They can do anything. But think are they really helping us? Yes, they do research and all of that but physically they're not. You spend less time exercising, interacting with family and friend, and the impact that computers can do to @CAPS1 lives in the future. Exercise is necessary in @CAPS1 lives. ""People need to get out there and do something other than be in front of the computer screen"". says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. fact is one hour of exercise is good for your health. However, two in three @CAPS4 wont do so. Thats why @CAPS1 @CAPS2 on is the way we are @CAPS3 I lazy, unactive worthless and overweight. As a result, computers are the blame. Are there some relatives you been face to face with @CAPS5 its because of computers. Computers @CAPS3 let us things like video chat with relatives for or go on facebook and myspace or @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to chat with them or email. The problem with this is being lazy. You could be out there getting to were your relatives live to see them. but why waste enemy going to travel agency when in the internet instead say travel agent @PERSON2. @NUM1 in @NUM2 people havent seen there relatives for other states in years. People need to go computers @CAPS7 games, @CAPS8 hows all on the computer at the You dont even have to take This is bad, People need do @CAPS11 the old fashoned way. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 @CAPS4 use the computer daily. People lose jobs over computers. Everything is made so simple, theres no need to hire secretary, as employ and more office personals. Factories, They dont need many people. Computerized @CAPS10 can take over jobs quicker, easier, and cheaper. They will one day take over. Thats not good. In conclusion, Computers @MONTH1 seemed like the best thing that hit earth, but if you really, really think about @CAPS11, @CAPS11's not. @CAPS11 prevents you from exercising, seeing friends and family, and cam impact @CAPS1 lives in a bad way. I hope you see where I'm coming from. However, it is essential to find a balance between the convenience of computers and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Moderation and awareness are key in utilizing technology without letting it negatively impact our well-being."
302	302	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 I also believe that computers benefit society in numerous ways. One of the key benefits is the vast amount of knowledge that can be accessed online, making learning easier and more convenient. Additionally, computers enable people to stay connected with friends and family through social networking sites, webchat, and email. These platforms provide a way to communicate and share experiences regardless of geographical distance. Moreover, computers play a crucial role in business operations, with applications like Microsoft Office being essential for planning, presenting, and managing tasks. The use of computers in manufacturing processes also enhances efficiency and precision. Overall, computers have become an indispensable tool for education, communication, and business, contributing significantly to the advancement of society.
303	303	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of computers does not benefit our society. Instead of spending time with the people we love, like friends and family, our time is knawed up by the one electronical device that many people depend on; the computer. This is not a very good thing to have an electronic device like this in our ever day lives because it uses a lot of electricity, it is expensive to buy and replace, and it allows hackers or other bad people into things we dont want them to see. But using electricity is @CAPS4 the start. By using electricity for this nonsense device, we waste money. We also are doing our part to destroy the environment. Greenhouse gasses and fuel are poisoning the air and being wasted. ""I don't have a computer at my house, and I get along pretty well."" @CAPS3 a local environmentalist. So that's @CAPS4 it; we can get along well without the computers taking over our lives. Along with not being good for the environment, it is also not good for the economy. My dad always @CAPS3 how he doesn't like to waste money, and then he goes and purchase a computer. Not only has this computer crashed once, but twice! A waste of money has been put into buying it, restoring it once, and now restoring it a second time! Plus computers waste our time. I always remember my grandfather saying "",I don't know why you folks waste all your precious time and money on these doo-dads!"" With so many people aquiring new devices, fewer people will be able to keep track of what goes where and who sees it. This is a terribele thing for the people, but a very, very good thing for the bad people. By ""bad people"" I mean internet hackers. As time goes on, and people get less aware of what's happening in their electronic lives, more and more hackers will be able to get what they want; in fact, anything they want. ""@CAPS4 a few months ago, I put a message on the message board on the @CAPS5 website which said I would be on vacation for a week. My address was also posted, because that message was a mobile upload. When I came back from vacation, half the things in my house were gone!"" said a local resident. Burglaries, robberies, and internet access can lead to chaos. Feeble protection is never good. But remember, computers are using massive amounts of electricity, amking many people waste time and money, and allowing bad people into things we don't want them to see. Please understand the meaning how terrible computers are. Ultimately, it is important to reconsider the impact of computers on our lives and society, as they bring about various negative consequences that can outweigh their perceived benefits. It is crucial to evaluate the true cost of relying on these devices and take steps to mitigate the potential risks they pose to our well-being and security."
304	304	1	3	Dear local newspaper, some people support advances in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people, but I disagree. One reason is that individuals may not get enough sleep if they stay up late on computers. Lack of sleep can lead to grumpiness and tiredness in the morning, affecting one's overall well-being. Additionally, excessive computer usage may result in less time spent exercising, which can have negative consequences on physical health. It is essential for individuals, especially young ones, to engage in physical activities for their overall health and development. Lastly, spending too much time on computers can reduce the time available for interacting with family and friends. Building relationships and socializing with loved ones are crucial for emotional well-being. In conclusion, the negative impacts of excessive computer usage on sleep, exercise, and social interactions outweigh any potential benefits, leading me to disagree with the notion that computers have a solely positive effect on people.
305	305	1	3	"Computers are a widely discussed topic, with a significant percentage of households in various locations owning at least one computer. This trend is evident in both Location 1 and Location 2, where a substantial number of homes have embraced computer technology. Personally, I find computers to be incredibly beneficial for a multitude of reasons.

Moreover, the social aspect of computers cannot be overlooked. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, along with instant messaging platforms, have revolutionized the way we connect with others. The advent of video chatting has further bridged the gap between physical distances, allowing for face-to-face interactions in a virtual setting.   Lastly, the convenience of online shopping through websites like Amazon, Walmart, and Target has simplified the process of purchasing goods and services. This ease of access to a wide range of products has undoubtedly enhanced the overall quality of life for many individuals.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in modern society, offering numerous benefits in various aspects of life. Whether it is aiding in academic tasks, providing entertainment, facilitating social connections, or enabling online shopping, computers have undoubtedly become an indispensable part of our daily lives."
306	306	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are important for growth. They teach us skills like hand-eye coordination, they allow you to talk online, and learn about faraway people and places. I do believe that it benefits society even though many people don't. Nine out of ten schools use computers on a daily basis and their community is still fine.  I know you think it's taking away real social time, but it really is improving the community. Imagine a student playing basketball, and his teammate passes the ball to him, but he can't catch it because he has no hand-eye coordination skills. That wouldn't happen to him if he spent more time on the computer. There are many coordination games on the internet, like pinball, that help build that up. When you play those games, you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen. It helps you to not look down. When you play basketball, you can catch the ball and still throw it if you have good coordination.  Out of ten people keep in touch with family or friends online. It's the greatest feeling when you talk to someone you haven't seen in a while because you know that they still remember you. When you talk to people online, you get to know them better, and they tell you things that they don't want others to know. Also, when you meet up with them, you have more things to talk about.  What would happen if you were to go to a location that you thought was nice, but it turned out to be the worst place ever? It would be terrible, but if you looked it up on the internet, you would know the truth about it. Let's say you want to know about someone famous, you look it up on the computer. There are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life.  I do agree with you on one thing. Society is losing its communication skills. Being on the computer all the time isn't doing anyone good. Nobody's picking up the phone and calling their friends to talk. They are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer. We don't want our society to stay this way. The people who spend their day on the computer need to change.  I think computers are an asset to the community. Many people believe that computers are ruining everything, but they really aren't. Computers are good for learning about people and places. The question is, do you want people to refrain from using computers? Now is the time to decide, do you want us to use computers to further our education or not?  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in our society by enhancing skills, facilitating communication, and expanding knowledge. While some drawbacks exist, the benefits of computer usage far outweigh the negatives. It is essential to strike a balance between real-life interactions and online activities to ensure a healthy and prosperous community.
307	307	1	3	Dear local newspaper, This world is filled with electronics. This modern era has seen the rise of computers as a popular choice for entertainment and communication. However, the prevalence of computer usage raises concerns about its impact on individuals, especially children. Many youngsters and even adults are becoming increasingly reliant on computers, leading to a sedentary lifestyle that can have detrimental effects on their health. Studies show that a significant portion of the population is spending less time outdoors engaging in physical activities. This trend is alarming as it contributes to a decline in overall well-being and fitness levels.   Moreover, the excessive use of computers is creating a disconnect between family members. Children are often more engrossed in virtual worlds and online activities than spending quality time with their loved ones. This shift in focus can strain relationships and hinder meaningful interactions within families. Additionally, the reliance on computers for entertainment and information is diminishing people's interest in traditional activities such as reading, outdoor recreation, and socializing in person. The convenience of technology has led to a decrease in human interaction and a loss of appreciation for simple pleasures.  As society becomes increasingly dependent on computers, it is essential to reconsider the impact of this reliance on our overall well-being. While technology offers numerous benefits, it is crucial to strike a balance and not let it overshadow essential aspects of life such as physical activity, family bonding, and real-world experiences. By promoting a healthier lifestyle that includes a mix of technology and traditional activities, we can ensure a more balanced and fulfilling existence for ourselves and future generations. Let us strive to find harmony between the convenience of computers and the richness of human connection to create a more wholesome and fulfilling life.
308	308	1	3	Computers are indeed valuable tools in our daily lives for various reasons. They offer convenience in storing and retrieving information quickly through emails and maps.

309	309	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, with all the attention on computers these days, it is evident that they are consuming a significant amount of our time. The prevalence of computer usage has led to a decline in outdoor activities, affecting our relationships with friends and family. In the past, people spent more time engaging in physical activities and enjoying nature, unlike today where social networking and online entertainment have taken precedence.  Research shows that a considerable percentage of Americans spend a significant portion of their day on computers, mainly for social networking purposes. This shift towards virtual interactions has resulted in decreased face-to-face social interactions, impacting the quality time spent with loved ones. Furthermore, the rise in obesity rates over the years can be attributed to sedentary lifestyles fueled by excessive computer usage and unhealthy eating habits.  It is disheartening to witness individuals struggle with weight issues and health problems due to prolonged computer usage and lack of physical activity. The excessive time spent indoors on computers has led to a disconnection from the natural world, with many missing out on the beauty and benefits of outdoor experiences. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of people spend their days indoors, missing out on the wonders of the world around them.  In conclusion, while computers have their advantages, their overreliance has negatively impacted our society by diminishing real-world interactions, contributing to health issues, and disconnecting individuals from the environment. It is essential to find a balance between technology and real-life experiences to lead a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle. Let us strive to limit our computer usage and rediscover the joy of outdoor activities and quality time with loved ones for a more balanced and enriching life.

312	312	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that the use of computers is beneficial for several reasons. One advantage is the ability to find information online, whether it be for job searches or taking online courses. Additionally, computers offer entertainment through games, surveys, and discovering new facts. Another benefit is the opportunity to make new friends by searching for old acquaintances or utilizing social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Overall, computers provide a diverse range of benefits, from information accessibility to social connections and entertainment options.
313	314	1	3	I believe that computers are not having a positive impact on people in today's society. For some individuals, computers have taken over their lives, leading to various health concerns and a lack of time for more important activities. Moreover, excessive computer use can also have a negative effect on one's finances. Typing for long periods can result in arthritis in the hands and fingers, while computer screens can trigger seizures in some individuals. Additionally, many people rely on computers as a coping mechanism for depression, neglecting the benefits of spending time in nature. This addiction to technology can strain relationships, especially with children feeling neglected by parents absorbed in their devices. Furthermore, online shopping and paid websites can drain finances, adding to the negative impact of computers on people's lives. In conclusion, computers can cause health problems, disrupt daily schedules, and lead to financial strain, making them more of a burden than a benefit in our lives.
314	315	1	3	Newspaper and Readers, Computers are an integral part of modern society, with numerous positive effects that outweigh the negative perceptions some may hold. One major benefit is the ease of communication that computers offer. Various free platforms such as instant messaging, email, video chat, and social networking sites facilitate staying in touch with friends and family, promoting healthy social connections.  Moreover, computers make information readily accessible. Instead of physically visiting a library, individuals can quickly gather data on a wide range of topics online. This efficiency not only saves time but also provides access to a wealth of information, from flight details to weather forecasts, enhancing knowledge and convenience.  Additionally, computers provide entertainment options that are both cost-effective and enjoyable. Internet gaming and streaming services offer a plethora of free content, reducing the need for expensive rentals or purchases. This accessibility to entertainment contributes to leisure and relaxation without financial strain.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing communication, information gathering, and entertainment. Despite any concerns, the positive impact of computers on individuals' lives is undeniable. Embracing the benefits of technology can lead to a more connected, informed, and entertained society.
315	316	1	3	To whom it may concern, Computers are beneficial to society as they promote learning, coordination, and general welfare. While it is true that computers can have negative effects on a person's health by reducing physical activity and social interaction, the positive impact they have far outweighs these drawbacks.   Computers serve as valuable tools for education, allowing individuals to learn a wide range of subjects from new words to complex scientific theories. They offer a flexible and convenient way to acquire knowledge outside of traditional educational settings, promoting independent learning and critical thinking skills.

While it is essential to address the potential health risks associated with excessive computer use, the overall benefits of these technological tools contribute significantly to the betterment of the world. Thank you for considering the positive impact of computers on our society.
316	317	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, some people argue that the use of computers is detrimental as it takes away from physical activity and outdoor experiences. However, I believe that computers offer numerous benefits, such as improving hand-eye coordination, facilitating learning, and enabling communication with others.   Computer technology can enhance hand-eye coordination and reaction time through interactive games and activities. For example, playing computer games like @CAPS3 @NUM1 can significantly improve these skills, which can be beneficial in various sports and daily tasks. Moreover, computers provide access to a vast amount of information that may not be readily available in traditional educational settings.

317	318	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2ít you think computers help society? I do. I strongly believe computers help society and are being used for very good purposes. They help people of all ages. It's easier for kids to look up information for @CAPS3, giving them important facts to help build knowledge. Not only does it help kids, but it also benefits adults. Computers make it easy to access a vast amount of information quickly and easily. Parents may worry that kids aren't gaining knowledge by using computers instead of going to the library, but the truth is, the information is readily available online. Computers help kids all over the world find information on a wide range of topics, from historical events to current news and weather updates. In fact, over @PERCENT1 of the resources available in a library can be found on the computer.   Some parents may be concerned that kids are missing out on exercise by spending time on computers, but the wealth of knowledge and important facts they gain make up for it. Computers help children supplement their education and provide valuable information that may not be covered in school. Furthermore, computers are not only beneficial for kids but also for adults. They can work, search for houses or cars, and access a wealth of information that helps them in their daily lives.   Certainly, @CAPS1, it would be a mistake to disapprove of computers because they play a crucial role in helping kids with @CAPS3, providing them with important facts, and assisting people of all ages in various aspects of their lives. The convenience and knowledge that computers offer are invaluable, and they have become an essential tool for learning and staying informed in today's digital age.
318	319	1	3	Computers have undoubtedly had a positive impact on society. They assist in organizing thoughts, reducing stress levels, and providing inspiration for individuals, especially children, to strive for their goals. By using computers to store and access information, individuals can alleviate stress by having a clear overview of their thoughts and ideas. Additionally, computers offer a wealth of articles and resources that can motivate and encourage individuals to pursue their aspirations. Moreover, in times of overwhelming situations, computers provide a means of relaxation and escape through various entertainment options. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing productivity, creativity, and overall well-being in society.
319	320	1	3	Dear editor of the @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that people are indeed spending too much time on technology, neglecting important aspects of life such as physical activity, enjoying nature, and spending time with loved ones. Excessive use of technology can lead to addiction, brain cell damage, and various risks like viruses and online threats. While technology offers benefits like hand-eye coordination, learning opportunities, and communication with others, it is crucial to strike a balance and limit screen time. My personal experience with technology has shown me the importance of moderation, as excessive use can have negative impacts on health and social interactions. Parents should be mindful of monitoring and setting limits on their children's technology usage to promote a healthy lifestyle. It is essential for individuals to prioritize real-world experiences and human connections over excessive screen time.
320	321	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I will be talking about the wonderful impact computer technology has had on mankind. So many great discoveries and topics have been found on the computer, studies have shown that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of families in the United States have at least one computer in their households. There is a great way to look up important information without going to the library and searching for hours, to contact others, and let's face it, they make our lives a whole lot easier.  Computers are terrific for learning things at a fast pace. I personally have used computers to my advantage. You log on, go to Google, type the subject of knowledge, and it's just like you have a personal teacher in your own home. A local study has been underway with groups, Group A which has a library full of books, and Group B with a computer lab. The scientists gave them all the same essays, and Group B had <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of students pass with flying colors while Group A had <@PERCENT1@NUM4> pass with an A or higher. Higher grades mean higher test scores, which equal funding. I think computers are the best invention and are not impairing humans, they are evolving them.  Computers have software where you can instant message, send emails, or even video chat with people. It's a great way to reconnect with loved ones who are far away. For some business people, it's a way to have meetings without traveling miles. I have two aunts that I cannot live without who are a strong base for me, and I can't go a day without talking to them. Without computers, I don't know what I would do. Studies show that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of people in the U.S. have family in other states, countries, or even continents, and they have to have some way to be in contact.  Lastly, computers have made our lives easier. Some jobs that have opened up give unwaged citizens a source of income on computers. <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of jobs rely on computers. Imagine a cashier counting all the money, a banker having to count cash one by one, a telemarketer calling without any information. All these ways and more show how computers have impacted us in a positive way. Computers are a terrific way for humans to adapt to the fast-paced life, making our lives better and more efficient.
321	322	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They assist students with projects, help individuals learn about different places, and allow users to access information on various topics. A significant percentage of teachers assign computer projects to students, encouraging them to explore beyond traditional writing tasks. For instance, reading teachers often require students to type essays or reviews about books, promoting digital literacy. Additionally, computers enable individuals to research and learn more about places they wish to visit, providing information on the best times to travel. In cases of tragic events like earthquakes, computers help individuals stay updated on current events and developments. Moreover, computers facilitate the search for unknown words or definitions, enhancing language skills. Overall, computers serve as valuable tools for completing tasks, gaining knowledge, and accessing information efficiently.
322	323	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I feel that computers have a positive impact on people for various reasons. One significant benefit is that computers help improve typing skills. The non-alphabetical layout of keys on a keyboard requires practice and enhances typing proficiency, which is a valuable skill in today's digital age. Additionally, computers provide access to a wealth of information that can be educational and beneficial for personal and professional growth. With countless websites and online resources available, individuals can learn about a wide range of topics and expand their knowledge base. Furthermore, computers facilitate socialization through various online platforms and communication tools.

Additionally, computers offer a variety of ways to pass the time, whether it's playing games, connecting with friends and family online, or shopping without leaving the comfort of your home.  While some may argue that computers keep people indoors, there are ways to balance screen time with other activities. Setting limits on computer use, establishing rules, and keeping computers in shared spaces can help ensure that individuals, especially children, do not become too reliant on technology.  Overall, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering numerous benefits to society. From enhancing education to providing entertainment and convenience, computers continue to shape the world we live in, making tasks easier and more accessible for everyone.
324	325	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, In many ways computers are helpful, but I don't support their excessive use. Technology advancements have led to negative impacts on people's lives worldwide, such as lack of exercise, spending too much time indoors, and neglecting quality time with family and friends. When using a computer, individuals tend to sit for long periods, contributing to a sedentary lifestyle that compromises their health. Regular physical activity is essential for overall well-being, which is neglected when glued to a screen. Furthermore, excessive computer use limits outdoor exposure, depriving individuals of fresh air and sunlight necessary for good health. The lack of outdoor time can lead to various health issues, highlighting the detrimental effects of excessive computer use. Additionally, focusing on computers can create a disconnect within families and friendships. Quality time spent with loved ones is essential for building strong relationships and fostering emotional bonds. Choosing screens over personal interactions can strain relationships and lead to feelings of isolation. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between technology use and real-world connections to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. Thank you for considering the negative impacts of excessive computer use on society.
325	326	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, computers are truly indispensable in today's world. They play a crucial role in communication, education, and work efficiency. Through email and online platforms, people can easily communicate with teachers, family members, and friends. Computers also serve as valuable learning tools, providing instant access to a wealth of information and resources. Additionally, they streamline work processes, enabling tasks to be completed faster and more efficiently. Overall, computers have revolutionized the way we connect, learn, and work, making them an essential part of modern life.
326	327	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers can have a positive effect or a negative effect on people. It all depends on how you look at it and what type of person you are. You can say computers have a very positive effect on people or say computers have a very negative effect on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people but you can't say that I am just a kid and she plays on it all the time. Well that is true however, it can teach you hand-eye coordination. For @CAPS2 what I am doing right now is learning to type faster and faster. Another @CAPS2 is some people are faster at typing than writing but some people write faster than type. Me personally am faster at than writing. My final reason is after a hard day at school or work you can come home, play some music and relax. It is a good idea to learn how to type fast so if you are let's say writing a story for school. You just started the story and it is due tomorrow. What are you going to do well if you stared to type when you were younger by the time you are in the middle school you could type really fast. That way you could finish your story in time. This means you should learn haw to type faster. Some people prefer to write than type but other people prefer to type than write. I personally prefer to type than write but that is just me. Let's say a friend of mine like to write more than type that is ok. We will not be not friends after that we will just like the same thing that is all. This means some people prefer to write than type. This probably happens after a hard day at school or work you can come home use the computer to play some music and relax. You can play all the music you want. As well as do other things as well as the same time. For @CAPS2, I play music and talk to my friends at the same time. I @CAPS3 use it to do homework. In conclusion, it is a good idea to keep computers to use. People can still enjoy nature as well as computers at the same time. Over all computers have a positive effect on people.
327	328	1	3	What I think about computers benefiting our community is great. Technology has advanced significantly over the years, with computers playing a crucial role in our society. Most schools now have computers, which have numerous benefits for our community. One major advantage is the reduction in paper usage, as everything can be stored digitally.

328	329	1	3	Dear town @CAPS1 paper, I would have to pick being for computers. There are a couple reasons why I'm for computers and they are being able to talk to friends online, being able to learn stuff, and you can also play video games. One reason that I would be for computers is so you can talk to friends online. So if you have a Facebook or Myspace, you can talk to your friends all day if you wanted to. What I mean is simply by typing in what you want to say to your friend, they will receive those exact words then they'll reply. For example, if you wanted to just say hi, then your friend would look at his/her messages and reply. Being able to talk to friends online is one example of why I am for computers. Another reason that I would be all for computers is being able to learn things. So if you wanted to learn a language, you would go to Google or something and try to find a fast, easy site. What I mean is if you go to Google, a whole bunch of sites will come up, so you want to find the fastest, easiest site for you. Being able to learn important things like a language is another reason I am for computers. The last reason for me picking computers is because you can play video games. If you were bored and had no one to talk to, then you could get on your computer and play a mind-numbing game or an educational game for class. For example, in science class, we played a game on the computer that had to do with gravity, which was what we were learning about, making it an educational game. So that is the last reason why I am for computers. I am for computers because you can talk to friends online, learn stuff, and play video games, making them a valuable tool in today's digital age.
329	330	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that there is a big discussion going on about if computers have a positive effect on people. I believe that computers do not have a positive effect on people because children on the computers are not safe, they are spending too much time on the computer, and the programs and internet for the computer cost too much money. First, computers have a negative effect on people, including children, because computers are not safe. With all this technology, child predators can go onto Facebook or another website and find out everything about you. This has happened to many people. Some predators went onto my friend @PERSON2's Facebook page and found out his birthday, where he lived, and what school he went to. This guy sent @PERSON2 a threat saying that something was going to happen to him. Luckily, with the help of the police, they were able to find this guy and arrest him before he got to @PERSON2. These days, this is happening all the time. More than 90% of children give all of their information away on these websites and child predators have looked at them. @PERSON1 states that ""this technology has helped, but the negativity it has had on society outweighs the good the computer is doing."" @ORGANIZATION1, do you want children to be taken by these child predators who know everything they need to know because of the computer? Another reason why computers have had a negative effect on people is because children are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time doing homework and exercising outside. These websites that give children the ability to talk with friends and play games have made them lazy and addicted to the computer. My friend, when he was little, would play outside for hours at a time. He would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor. Now @PERSON3 is older and all he does is sit on the computer until his parents have to force him off for dinner time. @PERSON3's grades have dropped tremendously and he has gotten very chubby compared to what he used to look like. Statistics show that more than 70% of children have gained weight due to not exercising and their grades have dropped 10 on a 100-point grading scale. Dr. Much says that, ""children have forgotten the fun in playing outside and lost the determination they had to do well in school. This is all because of these computers."" @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your children to gain weight and stop doing well in school? Lastly, computers have had a negative effect on society because of money. Many families have spent thousands of dollars on buying computers and getting them fixed. These computers are very expensive. They range from $500 to $2000 for a decent computer. Then each family has to buy the software and programs to go with the computer. A close family friend of ours just bought a computer. They bought a laptop that costs $1500, on top of that, they spent $300 on all the programs they needed for the computer. This family cannot afford this computer but they think that they need one. So they have gone to the college fund for money. Now their kid has to go to a cheaper school because their family won't have enough money. Statistics show that 30% of families have depleted their college funds on computers because the family thinks they need a computer. Dr. Smith says, ""families do not need computers, yet they waste their college money on them. @ORGANIZATION1, do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer? Computers are not worth sacrificing your children's education for."
330	331	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, A recent study by scientists shows that too much sitting down, especially in front of computers is dangerous to health. This is only one reason why I think that, although they are useful, computers are not entirely beneficial to our society. They hinder us from exercising, interacting with nature, and spending time with family and friends. Exercising, as we all know, is necessary to remain a fit and healthy human being. But how is this possible with some people going to work every day and getting shut in their offices at their computers all day? Too much computer time even for kids can lead to obesity and overweightness. Also, like I mentioned before, scientists have concluded that too much sitting is bad for you. It isn't how the body was built to work.  If you have seen ""Wall-E,"" one of @ORGANIZATION1's most recent movies, the humans in that movie, after relying on computers for so long, became obese and fat and had no muscle. This is an extreme example, but minor versions of this are going around the world. Going out and doing instead of sitting at a computer is a sure way to stay healthy. The next thing that computers restrict us in is our ability to experience nature. Even simulations don't cut it. If you wanted to see a frog or some other animal, you can't just Google it, you have to look for it in the real world. Developing a connection to nature can really nurture the soul and enrich our lives. Instead of exploring a computer, explore the world as we know it until it's too late. Learn how to do something by doing it. Instead of hiring someone to make something, make it yourself. Do it to learn it, don't just sit at a computer browsing websites to hire someone! Get up and get outside!  As you become more dependent on your computer, you become less dependent on family and friends. It causes there to be a rift between family members. Your family might not be able to help you when you're in need. If you're an adult, and you're on the computer all the time for something other than work, then you're not supporting your family, you have no income, no life, and no future. Why would anyone do this to themselves? Imagine this: You have nothing except your laptop. You're alone, with no family relations. Nobody wants to be that kind of loser living on the streets! You have nobody and nothing except for your computer, and you've wasted your life away. Too much time on your computer means that everyone suffers.  To sum it all up, computers may be useful, but every single cloud has a dark lining. Computers stop us from exercising, interacting with nature, and being with our families. So get outside! Embrace the real world and the people around you. Your health, happiness, and relationships will thank you for it."
331	332	1	3	Imagine a world without computers - chaos would reign in warfare, and the clutter on your desk would be overwhelming. The chats you have with friends on AIM would cease to exist. Reports, like the one on @LOCATION1, might not be completed due to all the books being checked out. Without computers, we wouldn't have the advancements in space exploration that we see today. Companies heavily rely on technology for efficient communication and operations. Sending a letter to the office and having it arrive in five minutes would no longer be possible.   Communication through computers is now a common practice, with a significant percentage of the world using AIM or other chat services. A study conducted by a professor revealed that a large number of students use these services to stay connected with family and stay informed about current events. If computers were taken away, valuable information would be lost in a sea of papers.   I once experienced a computer crash when I had a report due, and all the necessary books were unavailable. Thanks to a new computer, the report was completed promptly when the issue was resolved. NASA, which relies heavily on computers, has contributed significantly to technological advancements. Household appliances, cars, and phones, among other things, have benefited from NASA's work.   It is crucial for us, the people, to consider the impact of a world without computers. The individuals who shaped our country must also weigh in on this matter. It is evident that computers play a vital role in our lives, and their absence would be detrimental. Let us acknowledge the importance of computers and the advancements they have brought forth.
332	333	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Computers have a significant impact on people's lives in various ways. One major effect is that they can take away from quality time spent with family and friends. Instead of engaging in activities with loved ones, individuals may find themselves glued to their screens, missing out on valuable interactions. It is important to prioritize real-life connections over virtual ones to maintain strong relationships and create lasting memories.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can lead to a lack of social life. While social media platforms may give the illusion of connection, they often do not provide the same depth of interaction as face-to-face communication. It is crucial for individuals to participate in community activities, visit local establishments, and spend time with friends in person to foster genuine relationships and build a sense of belonging.  In addition, spending too much time on the computer can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise. Physical health is essential for overall well-being, and regular movement is crucial for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing health issues. Engaging in sports or other physical activities in the community can help individuals stay active, improve their fitness levels, and boost their overall health.  Overall, while computers offer many benefits, it is important to strike a balance and not let them consume all aspects of our lives. By prioritizing real-life interactions, maintaining a vibrant social life, and staying active, individuals can enjoy a well-rounded and fulfilling lifestyle. Let's make a conscious effort to limit our screen time and invest in meaningful experiences with those around us.
333	334	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, The use of computers per family has indeed increased significantly in the past few years. However, this rise in computer usage has been accompanied by a concerning trend of weight gain and decreased physical activity among individuals. With the convenience of online shopping and information readily available at the click of a button, many people are opting for sedentary activities over traditional methods that involve physical movement.  Moreover, the addictive nature of computer games and the ease of getting lost in virtual worlds can detract individuals from engaging in real-life activities, such as sports or outdoor exploration, leading to a further decline in physical exercise. The dependence on computers for tasks such as homework assignments and research can also backfire, as technical issues like printer malfunctions or power outages can disrupt productivity and impact academic performance.  Furthermore, the financial burden of owning and maintaining computers is a significant consideration. With the high costs associated with purchasing and maintaining computer systems, some may find it more cost-effective to utilize alternative resources like libraries for research purposes. The unnecessary expenses incurred by owning multiple computers that are underutilized further emphasize the point that computers may not always be the most practical or beneficial investment.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous advantages in terms of efficiency and accessibility, it is essential to recognize the drawbacks they pose in terms of physical health, academic performance, and financial implications. Striking a balance between utilizing technology and engaging in physical activities is crucial for overall well-being and productivity.
334	335	1	3	Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, I have carefully considered the implications of using computers and have come to the conclusion that I am against it. Safety concerns, lack of proper education, and exposure to inappropriate content are the main reasons for my stance. While some may argue that using a computer is safe, the reality is that interacting online can pose significant risks, especially for young people. There have been cases where individuals have misrepresented themselves online, leading to dangerous situations like my friend who was assaulted after meeting someone from a social media platform. Education is also compromised when excessive time is spent on the computer instead of engaging in productive activities like studying. Although there are educational resources online, many users tend to focus on social media and entertainment rather than learning. Additionally, the internet is filled with sites that are not suitable for all audiences, making it essential to be cautious about the content accessed. In conclusion, it is crucial to approach computer usage with caution, prioritizing safety, education, and responsible online behavior.
335	336	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, ""@CAPS2 at @CAPS3 killed in a horrific accident"" is the title that flashes across the screen. Then another, and another. What is supposed to be @NUM1 minutes grows into an hour or two that take away from your family. I can see why this @MONTH1 bring up many conflicts; as computers can be very helpful. However, I feel that more often they negatively impact the general public. For one, there are many sites out there that portray false information. Plus, computers begin to consume the rest of people's lives. When it comes to these technological devices there are pros but there the cons can easily outweigh them. To start, computers are loaded with viruses, scams and internet predators. So easily someone can steal credit and information by placing offers that seem ""too good to be true."" @CAPS4 you listen to your instincts, then you'll know that they are. But, many people who don't know any better fall for these traps. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have been scammed some time in their life I can clearly remember when someone. I know thought they were buying a pair of boots. Later That day, they got a call from the credit card company warning them about the purchase. These days you have to be so careful when you're on the computers. When my friends and I were learning about evaluating websites in computer processing class we came upon a site that seemed reliable, and accurate. We were all shocked when we learned that everything about it was fake. Computers can put people who @MONTH1 not know any better at risks. I strongly feel that sites like these and many others have a negative impact on the public. in addition, computers steal much of people's time to the point where family, 'doing homework and exercising is limited. I can understand the effects of too much exposure to computers because I see it every day with my younger brother. Once he begins his video interactive games, homework is pushed aside. The only words from his mouth are, ""@CAPS5, just one more game!"" I suppose you can infer how this turns out: one game, turns two and so on. It isn't only children either. Many of my own friends are update status or pictures on @CAPS6 for three hours every night. Isn't their a point where we can draw the line. between going on for ten minutes and letting the computer control your life? When surveyed; the majority of students said that they spent at least two hours on the computer every night. When games and instant messaging start to take away from studying and exercise there is a huge issue. Computers take away people's free time and can negatively impact their grades and fitness. So, I ask you to consider the benefits of computers; but also look for the negative effects. You will realize that there are more than you would believe. Support me on this by limiting usage of computers and by helping the public see the dangers that these technological devices @MONTH1 bring. Computers can harm relationships, finances, and your personal life more than you would think! Remember to strike a balance and prioritize what truly matters."
336	337	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, and all others,  I believe computers are not only good but beneficial. Computers have been advancing our world little by little every day. We use them for communication, entertainment, and knowledge, like people with fun things to do and learn. Computers are beneficial to everyone worldwide.  Computers have gradually advanced communication more and more every day. From old letters by mail to e-mails, Twitter, and Facebook, these websites have upgraded communication today. Long-distance friends can view photos, information, videos, and chat from far away. Instant messaging and video chatting have also revolutionized the way we communicate.  Entertainment has been greatly enhanced by computers. Computer games are instant and affordable, providing instant access to entertainment. Surfing the web for news or funny videos is also a great way to have fun. Platforms like iTunes and YouTube allow us to access and enjoy music easily, making computers a great source of entertainment.  Furthermore, computers provide us with a wealth of knowledge and are great for education. Websites like Wikipedia and Dictionary.com offer vast amounts of information, aiding in learning and expanding knowledge.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in our lives, offering benefits in communication, entertainment, and education. They continue to shape our world and enhance our daily experiences in countless ways.
337	338	1	3	Dear local Newspaper,  I agree with the points made in the article about kids being too absorbed in technology these days. It's true that many children spend a lot of time indoors on their computers or phones, neglecting physical activities. This sedentary lifestyle can have negative effects on their health and overall well-being.   It's concerning to think that some kids prioritize screen time over spending time with friends and family or focusing on their education. Excessive use of technology can lead to social isolation and academic issues. Furthermore, there are potential risks associated with online interactions, such as talking to strangers or engaging in harmful activities.  Encouraging children to engage in physical exercises and outdoor activities is essential for their development. It's important to strike a balance between technology use and real-world experiences to ensure that kids grow up healthy, social, and academically successful.  Let's promote a more active lifestyle for our youth and limit their screen time, so they can thrive both physically and mentally.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
338	339	1	3	Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1 a ìhome on your town; all you hear is, ìmom, mom , mom drive me to the library to get booksî. You see many residents just dying to go to foreign countries but have no money. Is this what you want every home to start looking like? Computers have a great affect on people seeing as it allows people to talk and interact with one another. You can learn about places youíve always wanted to go to and it is probably the device that makes your life easiest. For these reasons computers are what benefits society most. First of all, computers let friends and family talk without spending a nickel. I know I have relatives who are too poor to pay the high costs of phone bills that come their way when we need to talk this means that not everyone can afford talking on a phone, but a computer costs nothing to use. Also, in the @ORGANIZATION3 issue @NUM1, @DATE1 @NUM2 a recent poll showed that @PERCENT1 of people who own computer use it to talk instead of on a phone. I know some people say that computers are too time consuming, but if this many people use computers to talk, thereís no need to worry about paying phonebills. Also, @PERSON1 a @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION4 says that less people needed a loan when the computer came out with instant messaging and video chatting. This shows that friends and families stopped paying massive phonebills and just talked online. Furthermore, just from using a computer anyone can find facts about lands halfway across the @LOCATION1. Whatís more is that they can be in the bedroom or room. A boy name @CAPS3 @PERSON4 who attends @ORGANIZATION1 said that he always wanted to go to when he was little and was as when he looked up @LOCATION2 and facts and pictures on the web. Also, @PERSON3 a teacher at @ORGANIZATION5 @ORGANIZATION1 task a poll asking how many students did projects having to do with foreign countries and @PERCENT2 of them they did. That means that so many people need to resourced foreign countries and need to use a computer to find out about it. It shows that many more use computers to visit faraway lands. Last but not least, computers are just about the convenient thing to have in a recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT3 at people would rather have a computer than a car that just shows the important computers are. Also, I used to think computers were bad for you and everything, but when I received one for my @NUM3 birthday, I found out how useful they were. Many people say computers are time comsuming because they havenít used one yet. Also did you know that million people use a computer thatís more than half their population and such a poor country? That shows her important computers are and how convenient. All and all, now @CAPS1 have if happy residents, laughing on the computer they do because computers allow them to talk with friends learn and visit foreign countries and are so convenient @PERSON2 and readers computers withour a doubt benefit society.   Computers have indeed revolutionized the way we communicate, learn about the world, and lead our daily lives. With the convenience they offer in connecting people, accessing information, and exploring new horizons, it is clear that computers play a vital role in benefiting society as a whole. Let us embrace this technological advancement and continue to utilize it for the betterment of our communities.
339	340	1	3	Computers are becoming increasingly popular among people as they serve various purposes such as communication, entertainment, and organization. Despite the numerous benefits they offer, there are also drawbacks associated with their use. One of the primary advantages of computers is the easy access to vast amounts of information and the ability to stay connected with family and friends through email and social media platforms. Additionally, computer software like word processors and spreadsheet applications can help in creating documents and managing finances efficiently. Furthermore, computers enable users to engage in activities such as watching movies, playing games, and listening to music.  However, the downside of computers includes their high cost, the risk of encountering online scams and cyber threats, and the potential for addiction to social media platforms. It is crucial for users to be cautious while navigating the internet to avoid falling victim to malicious activities like identity theft and online harassment. Despite these challenges, with proper precautions such as installing antivirus software, avoiding suspicious websites, and safeguarding personal information, the benefits of owning a computer outweigh the disadvantages. Ultimately, when used wisely, computers can enhance productivity, facilitate communication, and provide entertainment, making them a valuable addition to modern life.
340	341	1	3	Having a computer is a huge benefit to society as it provides easy access to information about different places and cultures. Additionally, it allows individuals to stay connected with family and friends through online communication. Furthermore, using a computer can enhance hand-eye coordination, which is useful in various activities such as sports or academic tasks. Overall, the presence of computers has significantly contributed to the advancement of society and has become an essential tool for learning, communication, and skill development.
341	342	1	3	"Dear editor: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that that benefits society. As editor of the newspaper, you have the power to inform people about situations. In my opinion computers are desperately in need because of the following: the computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, they allow people to talk online with others, and many jobs use computers. Do you want a more economically advanced state? First of all the computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places, people, and the weather. I have an uncle named @PERSON1, that has @NUM1 little girls. Every day in the morning before school @PERSON1 checks on the weather, on his computer to make sure it is safe to go school. However, one day forgot to check the weather on his computer and took his kids to school. Little did he know the roads were extremely icey. Sadly @PERSON1 and his daughters got in a car accident and two of girls broke a few bones. As you can see, the weather the computer world have saved him a trip to the emergency room. Next, the computer allows you to talk online with other people. Dr. @DR1 from @CAPS1 states says that, ""chating online with others (@CAPS2) is the best way to stay in touch with others from your old school, camp and many other places."" I highly agree because adults can stay in touch with freinds from middle school. Also @PERCENT1 of students say that they usually go online to study or get the pages for homework. I believe that chating online to study for tests is a fantastic idea because it will help the students to get better grades. Some parents say that that is a way to study and a waste of time. However teachers say that ever since @CAPS2 was invented the students grades were skyrocketing. Finally most jobs today use computers. For example my dad works for @ORGANIZATION1 and the computer helps him communicate with clients all over the world. Also the chat can translate the language, thus it makes it much easier than talking on the phone. Also the teachers use computers to put grades from students in. This makes the teachers job much easier because it averages all of the grades. The computer revolutionise the jobs of people. In conclusion the computer has a positive effect on people because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, allows people to talk online with other people, and many jobs use computers. I urge you to support me by writing a positive article on computer and how the help the society. Please take my idea into consideration.   Computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, providing us with endless opportunities to learn, communicate, and work more efficiently. Embracing technology is crucial for societal advancement and progress."
342	343	1	3	Dear editor, my name is [Name] and I am a [Age] year old girl; yet active in reading the daily newspaper. As I was going through last week's newspapers, I saw an ad to write an article about either the negative or positive factors about computers. I am here to persuade other readers about the negative effects computers have on people.   As an active member of the computer, I take part in all negative factors. People who spend more than one hour on the computer are involved in gaming, social media, or playing computer games. Many of those kids are too involved in their computer games. I saw a segment on [TV Channel] about how a high percentage of all teens play on the computer at least once when they are supposed to be doing homework. Computer games distract kids from learning, as they feel that gaming is more important than doing math homework.   Computers don't benefit kids' learning. Kids or even adults who are too involved in some use of computers don't want to talk. They feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends. To win, people can't talk, they just focus on the game. Kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifelong results like being self-conscious or having no social skills.   Being too involved in computer games affects their social skills. Kids who are too involved in their computer games don't get enough exercise, leading to obesity. They think they are getting exercise by playing, but in reality, they are doing nothing at all. Kids get addicted to playing and don't think going outside is important anymore.   In conclusion, computers have no benefits for people. Computers hinder learning, promote anti-social behavior, and contribute to obesity. All of these results are long-term, affecting the quality of life. Don't you want a happy and successful life? I know I do!
343	345	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about all the interesting things you can do on computers such as call people, order groceries, and read books for school. Today it seems like the world is held together by technology and I think computers are at number one. ""@CAPS1 my older sister moved to @CAPS2 it was hard to keep in touch and see each other, but we found out about @ORGANIZATION1, which is a site where people all over can add people and chat, call, or webcam each other, so we do that every day and it's like she never left home."" @PERSON2 says about the internet site @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS4 sure @PERSON2 and a lot of others love their computers. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people get more done in the day online @PERSON1 says ""every day my day is shortened because my @CAPS3 because while at work I can order my groceries and have them delivered by four o'clock @CAPS1 I arrive home from work I can make doctor apt, school apts and schedule meetings all with one touch/click wherever I go, instead of looking on the calendar or picking up the phone. @PERCENT1 of couples today say they met online via Twitter, Facebook, MySpace or AOL. The internet is great for meeting new people because you @CAPS4 each other and get to know one another or look at their profile pictures and things. You can find people just like you online and after a while the two of you are friends. I have some of my best friends online through a mutual friend's page and it's a successful friendship today. Even schools took education to the web, with all books from a class available at home online. Students can even check grades online now and receive comments from teachers. So now students are pushed to use the web at home and at school. I hope I have opened your mind a little to understand the internet is not all bad, and people spend so much time on them now because everything has moved to the web like school, stores, food, even TV you name it the web has it. Personally I spend about an hour or two on the web chatting, studying, watching TV. After I might go for a walk or play my @CAPS5 but I'll still connected to the web because the @CAPS5 picks up on Wi-Fi connections. So I think computers let you open up and connect with others and get other things done on the web. With the increasing reliance on technology, it's clear that computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, providing convenience, connectivity, and endless possibilities. Embracing the digital world can enhance communication, productivity, and even relationships, demonstrating the transformative power of technology in modern society."
344	346	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, as a teenager growing up in this technological era, I believe that computers are more harmful than helpful. While computers can provide quick access to information, books remain a superior and more reliable resource. The internet is filled with misinformation, making it challenging to discern fact from fiction. Books, on the other hand, offer credible and accurate information that can be trusted. Additionally, excessive computer use can lead to social isolation and neglect of real-life interactions. Spending time with family, playing board games, or enjoying outdoor activities are healthier and more fulfilling alternatives to screen time. Furthermore, the internet poses risks to personal safety, with potential dangers such as online predators and inappropriate content. Protecting one's well-being should take precedence over the convenience of technology. In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is essential to consider the negative impact they can have on our lives. Striking a balance between technological advancement and traditional practices is key to maintaining a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.
345	347	1	3	Dear local community,  I understand that there may be doubts about whether computers are good or not, but I am here to provide some reasons why they can be beneficial. Firstly, computers can help improve hand-eye coordination through gaming, which can be useful in various daily activities. Additionally, computers allow us to learn about faraway places and different cultures, providing us with valuable knowledge and expanding our horizons. Lastly, computers help us stay connected with others, whether it be through social media or communication platforms.  In conclusion, computers have various advantages such as enhancing coordination, increasing cultural awareness, and facilitating communication. Considering these points, it is clear that computers can bring about positive impacts in our lives.
346	348	1	3	Dear newspaper, some people have concerns about the dangers and time-wasting aspects of computers. While it is true that computers can pose risks, they also offer numerous benefits. One such advantage is the convenience of paying bills online. For many individuals, managing multiple bills can be a hassle, especially after a long day of work. By utilizing computer programs, bills can be paid efficiently, allowing for more relaxation and leisure time. Moreover, computers play a crucial role in planning vacations. Online programs make it easy to arrange trips and ensure a smooth travel experience, as demonstrated by a family's successful vacation to a destination like Hawaii. Additionally, online college classes are becoming increasingly popular among working individuals and parents. These classes offer flexibility and accessibility, enabling people to further their education despite their busy schedules. Overall, computers serve as valuable tools for simplifying tasks and enhancing various aspects of life.
347	349	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  I believe you are right in pointing out the negative effects of excessive computer usage. While computers can be helpful in connecting people, they also lead to a lack of exercise, neglect of family, and most importantly, health issues. Prolonged computer use can result in poor vision, unhealthy eating habits, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and even diabetes.   It is concerning how addictive computers can be, causing people to spend hours on end staring at screens. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to poor hygiene and overall well-being. It is crucial for individuals to take a break from their computers and focus on their health and relationships.   I suggest that all computers should be banned for at least a week to encourage people to engage in physical activities, spend time with their loved ones, and prioritize their health. While this may seem extreme, it is necessary to prevent the increasing prevalence of health issues such as diabetes in the population.  It is essential for people to break free from the grip of technology and lead a more balanced and fulfilling life. Let us all make a conscious effort to reduce our screen time and prioritize our well-being.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
348	350	1	3	Dear local newspaper, can you imagine a world without computers? Well, I can't because I think computers are great. First of all, if you have a computer, you can meet new people. Second, you can do projects on them or homework if you need to. Lastly, on a computer, you can basically find out anything you want to know. Who doesn't like meeting new people? If you want to make new friends or find someone who goes to your school, you can look them up on your computer. Additionally, if you ever find yourself with nobody to talk to, you can go online and try to meet new people. Making friends online can be fun and rewarding. Another reason why computers are great is because they can help with printing assignments or projects. For example, if your science teacher requires printed assignments, a computer is essential. Furthermore, if you forget your homework or any assignments, you can always ask a friend online or check your school website. This makes completing and submitting assignments much easier. Lastly, computers are incredibly useful because you can find information on virtually anything. Whether you need directions, help with a problem, or want to make a purchase, the internet has the answer. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in our lives by facilitating social connections, aiding in academic tasks, and providing access to a wealth of information. They truly are indispensable tools that make our lives easier and more efficient.
349	351	1	3	Dear newspaper, Some people say that computers don't benefit society. But I think differently. Computers benefit society more than you would think. They help people learn and make work much easier. They help prevent accidents, and they save lives. Computers help people learn and make work easier; it's a fact. You can type, plan your schedule, make presentations, or check your email. All of these things make work easier. And there are tons of more things you can do. As I said before, they can help people learn. You can learn trillions of things on the internet. You can learn about everything on the internet, and it is quite amazing. You could get a medical degree on the internet. Making work easier or helping people learn aren't the extent of the computer's abilities. Computers can prevent accidents in anything that moves. For example, cars - millions on the road today - and some can practically drive themselves. And that is all done with computers. Also, planes, the only reason the pilot is there is in case something goes wrong. The same thing with trains. Furthermore, trains are completely computerized; all the humans do is tell the computer what they want it to do. Almost everything that moves within its power has been computerized at some point in time. And that makes the world safer for everyone. Finally, computers save lives; it's completely true. In hospitals, without computers, people would be dying every day. They use them to keep records, record vital signs, and assist with surgery. In surgery, computers help by only having to make a tiny incision and can be much more accurate than human surgeons, which saves lives. Also, computers can make sure that an operating room is completely sterile, reducing the risk of infection. As you can see, computers benefit society a lot more than you might think. They help people learn and make work easier. They prevent accidents, which reduces people going to the hospital. And if they do go, they are almost guaranteed survival. So what do you think about them now?
350	352	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Experts agree that people should go outside and exercise for three main reasons. Firstly, many individuals do not engage in enough physical activity, leading to potential weight gain and health issues. Additionally, spending time outdoors allows for social interaction with friends and family, fostering relationships and creating cherished memories. Lastly, immersing oneself in nature can provide a sense of peace and tranquility, offering a much-needed break from the hustle and bustle of daily life. It is crucial for both children and adults to prioritize outdoor activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle and overall well-being.
351	353	1	3	To the computers people technology is a good thing to have. If we do not have technology then we can not call no one. We wiil not have computers to go online. We can not talk to my family or friends. People us technology for they jobs like people that work for cars they need computers to see if the cars if old. That is why will need technology. People need technology for a lot of thin have technology to us. Computers is the big thing because we need to look up a lot of things online we need computers to test on. We call people with technology you us computers to go online on google.com that is why we need technology. so we can call people.  Furthermore, technology has revolutionized communication by enabling us to connect with others instantly through various means such as emails, social media, and video calls. It has made the world a smaller place, allowing us to stay in touch with loved ones regardless of distance. Additionally, technology plays a crucial role in the workplace, increasing efficiency and productivity. For instance, in the automotive industry, computers are used to analyze and diagnose issues with vehicles, ensuring they are safe for the road.  In conclusion, technology is an essential part of our lives, providing us with countless benefits and opportunities. From staying connected with others to improving processes in various industries, the role of technology is undeniable. Embracing and utilizing technology is crucial for personal and professional development in today's digital age.
352	354	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, Over the years, computers have been a great invention. They have helped people learn more information, communicate with others, and invent more technology. This has had a positive impact on our country. Computers are beneficial because they assist us in finding information quickly for school projects and navigating to different locations. They also facilitate communication with friends and family, as well as enable parents to contact teachers to check on their children's progress. Furthermore, computers have played a crucial role in innovation, allowing scientists to develop new technologies. In conclusion, computers have significantly benefited us by enhancing information access, communication, and innovation, ultimately contributing to our country's progress.
353	355	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I understand your concerns about computers being a waste of time, but they do offer significant benefits as well. While it's true that some people spend excessive amounts of time on computers out of boredom or to avoid going outside, computers have become essential tools for various tasks.   Computers have evolved to be faster and more efficient, leading to increased popularity and usage each year. They provide valuable assistance in learning, job searching, and even online shopping. For example, individuals can access a wealth of information online, allowing them to learn new things and expand their knowledge easily. Additionally, job seekers can use computers to search for employment opportunities and submit applications conveniently from their homes.   Moreover, online shopping has revolutionized the way people make purchases, offering a vast array of products that may not be readily available in local stores. While caution is necessary when providing payment information online, the convenience and accessibility of online shopping make it a popular choice for many consumers.   In conclusion, although excessive computer use can be unproductive, computers play a crucial role in modern society by providing educational resources, job opportunities, and convenient shopping options. When used wisely, computers can enhance productivity and efficiency in various aspects of life.
354	356	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1, I am on the computer a lot. But I think it is one of the most addicting, time-consuming inventions in today's society. Yes, computers have benefits such as talking to friends and family you don't see that often, doing school work, and gathering information. But in my opinion, people should reduce their usage of computers. Sure, computers let you interact with friends and family via email, messaging, or social networking websites such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. Guess what? You can easily communicate the old-fashioned way with cell phones, or even writing a letter. See? There are alternatives for communication. Exercise is so important nowadays, and people do not get enough of it. Did you know that obesity has gone up @PERCENT1 since last year? That's a fairly big percentage, and we don't want it to get any bigger. If people are wasting away, staring at their computer screen and not getting any sort of exercise in, the number will get bigger. Also, computers can cause all kinds of medical problems. For example, about a month ago my back was really bothering me. I went to the doctor, and he told me one of the likely causes was leaning forward to go on my laptop. ""Computers can also cause vision problems and headaches,"" says specialist @CAPS5. Oz. We can prevent these issues if we take a stand against computers! We can limit our use to two or three times a week and only use it for important reasons. I hope this really is an eye-opener to the negative effects computers have on us. Let's make a conscious effort to reduce our screen time and prioritize our health and well-being."
355	357	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you because computers are affecting humans in many ways. Some can be terrible, and others not so bad. Many average people are now staying inside all day on the computer playing games, or on Facebook and other interactive websites such as Twitter and Instagram. This crisis is interfering with school, work, or exercise. More and more people each day are not getting enough exercise or work done. We have to stop this devastating pandemic!  People who are staying inside all day aren't as healthy as they were before. Their immune system is weakened, making the risk of getting sick greater. If you stay inside all day every day, the computer will be so addicting it will take over you and become more important than anything else. In order to stay healthy, you have to eat right and exercise, such as riding a bike. If someone is inside on the computer frequently, they aren't getting enough physical activity.  Being addicted to the computer can also interfere with family events and sports. If you're on the computer all the time, you may forget about homework, leading to lower grades and possibly having to attend summer school or repeat a grade. Additionally, not preparing for sports can prevent you from playing up to your potential.  These are just a few ways computers are affecting everyday people. It is important for individuals to strike a balance between screen time and other activities to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. Let's work together to address this issue before it becomes even more widespread.
356	358	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I personally disagree with the experts who are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. The reason why I disagree is because it's not the computer's fault that people don't get out and exercise. Buying a computer and getting on the computer is a free choice, and the computer doesn't force you to get on it; that's our decision, so we can't blame the computer for people not exercising. Another important aspect to consider is that computers are crucial for education. For example, there are online computer classes for individuals pursuing degrees in various fields; with just a click of a button, it can alter their future and career for the rest of their lives. Most significantly, computers help people learn about different cultures and ways of life. I love learning about @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2, even though they endured a terrible storm. I appreciate you taking the time to consider my opinion, and I hope it changes your perspective on living a life without computers.
357	359	1	3	Being active has no limit, but technology does. While the human body can push its boundaries and explore new limits through physical activity, technology is constrained by the limits of its design and capabilities. As individuals, we can constantly challenge ourselves to improve our physical fitness, endurance, and strength. However, technology has a finite capacity for advancement and innovation. It is important for us to recognize the difference between our limitless potential for growth and the constraints of the tools we use to enhance our lives. Embracing this distinction can help us make the most of both our physical abilities and the technological resources available to us. Ultimately, by understanding and respecting these boundaries, we can achieve a harmonious balance between our active lifestyles and the technological world we inhabit.
358	360	1	3	Computers have a significant impact on society, and it is essential to consider the effects they have on individuals. Excessive use of computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, affecting physical health and overall well-being. While others engage in physical activities and social interactions, spending too much time on a computer can result in isolation and missed opportunities for personal growth. It is crucial to strike a balance and prioritize real-life experiences over virtual ones to lead a fulfilling and healthy life. So, next time you are tempted to spend hours on a computer, remember the importance of staying active and engaged in the world around you.
359	361	1	3	Computers have a very positive impact on people's lives. They provide access to a wealth of information on various subjects, allowing individuals to learn about history, different cultures, and new technologies. The internet serves as a vast repository of knowledge that is constantly updated and expanded. With just a few clicks, one can explore different perspectives and opinions on a particular topic, offering a well-rounded understanding.  Furthermore, computers offer entertainment options for those looking to unwind or have fun. From reading books and magazines online to playing a wide range of games, there is something for everyone. Sports enthusiasts can find resources to improve their skills or watch their favorite games and events. Additionally, television programs and movies can be easily accessed and enjoyed on a computer screen.  Communication is another key benefit of computers. Through emails, instant messaging, audio calls, and video calls, individuals can easily connect with friends and family, regardless of their location. Webcams enable face-to-face interactions, adding a personal touch to virtual conversations. The convenience and efficiency of digital communication have revolutionized the way people stay in touch with loved ones.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing education, entertainment, and communication. They empower individuals with knowledge, creativity, and connectivity, ultimately enriching their lives in a multitude of ways. The positive effects of computers are undeniable, making them an indispensable tool in today's modern world.
360	362	1	3	"Newspaper, I feel that the use of computers is no big deal. it is a convienient way to communicate, it teaches young adults and adults social and life skills, and is no different than other addictions. These three reasons are why I feel the @ORGANIZATION1 is under-appreciated. My firsty reason why I feel that the @ORGANIZATION1 is under-appreciated is that some people think that less time is spend with family, but I talk to family, and friends everytime on the @ORGANIZATION1. It is a conveinient, fast, and for the most part safe way of communicating. When I need help with something, I sit at the @ORGANIZATION1 and fb chat someone, or if their not on, I e-mail them. I get my answer within a day. Also you can look up the answer online, the internet is a beautifully smart device. Also if you call someone versus chating on the @ORGANIZATION1 you @MONTH1 have no idea who they are, it is also much easier to trace a call then trace a @ORGANIZATION1 to a certain location. Communication is faster, safer, and more conveinient over the @ORGANIZATION1. My second reason for being @NUM1 is that it can help teach said and life skills. For example, did you know that on average, an adult will make @MONEY1 more if they know how to type good, and fast? The @ORGANIZATION1 serves many functions. Facebook, for example, is a social network, amny young adults can learn basic social skills by having a facebook. Social skills play a very important role when you are finding a job for the first time. If you have good social skills, your boss @MONTH1 like, and apreciate you more. Which can only lead to a promotion! Computers are very nifly to have around! my third, and final reason, for believing, with all respect, that @NUM2 people are blinded, is that people don't easily get addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. It is very hard to become addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. Only about @PERCENT3 of facebook users are addicted. Compared to an alcohol addiction, about @PERCENT1, or drug addiction, @PERCENT2, @ORGANIZATION1 addiction is microscopic, and not to mention, not deadly. The only similarity between the @ORGANIZATION1, and other deadlier addictions is that they are addicted, and @MONTH1 become grumpy if asked to stop. ""@ORGANIZATION1 addiction can be cured with a speedy recovery, and as long as you are on for an hour or less a day, there is nothing to worry about"" says @PERSON1, at the @NUM3.) @CAPS1 there you have it, computers use is not a major problem. It is a conveinent communication device, an effective way to learn social, and life skills, and is no huge major source of addiction. @CAPS1 there is nothing to worry about. Sit back and look it up on the internet if you don't believe me. However, it is important to maintain a balance and not let computer use consume excessive amounts of time in one's daily life."
361	363	1	3	I agree that computers do benefit society because they have become an integral part of our daily lives. Computers make tasks easier, provide entertainment, and facilitate communication with others. They offer a wealth of information at our fingertips and assist in research and learning. However, it is important to strike a balance and not become overly reliant on computers, as spending time outdoors and engaging in physical activities are also essential for our well-being. In conclusion, while computers offer numerous advantages, it is crucial to enjoy the benefits of technology while also making time for other activities that promote a healthy lifestyle.
362	364	1	3	You've got mail! My computer is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends. Without computers, I would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as I can with computers. In the past few decades, technology has been drastically advancing, resulting in incredible computers. With computers, we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and find information like never before. Computers have allowed us to do things that are truly astonishing.  To begin, we have thrown away typewriters and purchased computers. Now, like never before, we can type faster, improve hand-eye coordination, and edit our papers without the help of a peer. With the extreme amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday lists, computers have made this process faster and easier. Additionally, we have gained amazing hand-eye coordination skills. By typing and reading at the same time, we have trained our eyes to do many things similar to playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check, we are able to edit papers without using someone else's help. The typing documents aspect of computers is one reason why we need them around.  Another reason is communication. Thanks to many communication applications such as Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Zoom, we can now communicate with a surplus of distant friends and relatives. Email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas, and even sales and specials offered by stores. Snail mail is no more with this extremely efficient way of communication. The communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives.  Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. We can now find facts and figures faster, easier, and with hundreds more options. Thanks to Google and other search engines, we can find the information we need within seconds. The process is exceedingly simple; type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need. There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is why we need them in our everyday lives.  In conclusion, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened doors for today's society. Without computers, we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate, and find information in a fashion. Because of this invention, computers have allowed us to do incredible things. People all across the country are experiencing the efficiency of using computers, and now we can too. It is evident that computers are effective and are advancing technology in our society.
363	365	1	3	"Can you imagine a world full of lifeless zombies obsessing over technology such as computers, television, and cellular phones? Our world as we know it will come to an abrupt end if we don't stop this nonsense. Computers can cause obesity, a lack of interaction, and they waste their time on these useless items. Our planet can't set aside time for such. Our planet is run by us humans, and if we don't take care of its necessities, we will all die, including our beloved planet. Computers aren't a benefit to our society today. First off, computers can cause major obesity like it has done already. Obesity is one of the most brought up health problems in the world. Many issues cause obesity, but technology (computers) takes a big role in it. Instead of sitting on a computer all day, they can do something a lot more productive, such as taking a walk, starting a club (adults and children), helping out neighbors, etc. So what if they teach hand-eye coordination, they don't teach us how to stay fit! Computers play a big role in the obesity factor. As adults, you should know how much obesity matters. Children are the future; nobody would want the future leaders to be known for widespread obesity. Nevertheless, computers take away ""bonding"" time from family and friends. Adults and children alike are lacking social needs. They don't verbally and physically interact with their ""online friends."" And they wonder why families these days are turning out the way they are; the source of the cause is computers. Anyways, people spend too much time on computers. If people didn't waste so much time on computers, they wouldn't be losing jobs like dropping flies. The unemployment rate is high because they suppose they ""don't have enough time."" When all their time is devoted to computers, if they took out the computers in their lives, they would have plenty of time to do such. No one wants a ""stay-at-home"" unemployed loser as themselves. In the end, computers are not a benefit to our poorly run society. They cause obesity, corrupt social needs, and eat the people's time away. You may think computers allow others to ""chat"" online with their ""online friends,"" but they don't provide our physical and verbal social needs, which results in low self-esteem. If newspapers keep publishing articles about the ""benefits of computers,"" people will soon stop believing that nonsense and eventually stop purchasing these newspapers. Nobody wants to read lies, do they? Our world needs to wake up and realize the negative impact that technology, especially computers, is having on our lives before it's too late. It's time to prioritize real human connection, physical activity, and meaningful interactions over mindlessly staring at screens. Let's take back control of our society and focus on what truly matters for our well-being and the future of our planet."
364	366	1	3	Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering endless possibilities for entertainment, communication, and productivity. However, it is important to remember the importance of balance and moderation when it comes to our reliance on technology. While computers can enhance our lives in many ways, they also come with risks and drawbacks that should not be overlooked.  Spending excessive amounts of time on computers can lead to a disconnect from the real world, impacting our relationships with friends and family. It is easy to get lost in the virtual realm of social media, online games, and endless browsing, neglecting the valuable moments we could be spending with loved ones. Additionally, the internet is a vast and unpredictable place, where privacy and safety can easily be compromised. It is crucial to exercise caution when sharing personal information online, as not everyone may have good intentions.  Furthermore, the convenience of online shopping and virtual interactions may lead to a sedentary lifestyle, as individuals can accomplish tasks without ever leaving their homes. This can have negative effects on both physical and mental health, as human interaction and physical activity are essential for overall well-being.  In conclusion, while computers have revolutionized the way we live, it is important to maintain a healthy balance between the virtual and real world. Limiting screen time, prioritizing face-to-face interactions, and being mindful of online safety are all crucial steps in ensuring that technology enriches our lives without overshadowing the truly important aspects of human existence.
365	367	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, computers offer numerous benefits, especially in terms of communication, education, and convenience. One of the most significant advantages is the ability to connect with people worldwide through the internet, enabling cultural exchange and maintaining relationships across long distances. Additionally, computers provide access to educational resources, allowing students to seek help and teachers to manage grades efficiently. Moreover, online shopping and bill payment streamline daily tasks, saving time and money. Despite concerns about inappropriate content, there are effective measures to block such sites. For individuals with disabilities, computers offer invaluable assistance, enhancing accessibility and independence. In essence, computers play a crucial role in modern society, facilitating various aspects of daily life and opening up new possibilities for communication and learning.
366	368	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1, Computers have indeed revolutionized our society in numerous ways. They have become essential tools for learning, job creation, and law enforcement. While some may argue that people spend too much time on computers, it is undeniable that these machines have greatly benefited us.   In the realm of education, computers have become invaluable resources for both children and adults. They provide access to vast amounts of information and enable individuals to learn about a wide range of topics. Whether it's researching homework assignments or exploring new scientific discoveries, computers play a crucial role in expanding knowledge and fostering curiosity.  Moreover, computers have significantly contributed to job growth in our economy. With a large percentage of the population working with computers, it is clear that these machines have created countless employment opportunities. Without computers, many individuals would be left without jobs, further exacerbating our current economic challenges.  Additionally, computers have greatly assisted law enforcement in their efforts to combat crime. By storing important data such as fingerprints, photographs, and criminal records, computers have enabled authorities to apprehend criminals more effectively. This technological advancement has undoubtedly made our communities safer.  While it is important to be mindful of the time spent on computers, we must also recognize the immense benefits they have brought to our society. From education to job creation to law enforcement, computers have played a crucial role in shaping our modern world. Let us continue to embrace technology and harness its potential for the greater good.
367	369	1	3	"Do you use a computer? Is there one at your house? Well, the average household owns two computers, but this isn't good, computers are taking valuable time away from hobbies, nature, and real-life. First, computers take time away from hobbies and friends. Some of my friends spend hours on the computer a day that they could be playing a sport or hanging out. Also, the computers become the center of their lives. People ask me ""weren't you online?"" and I answer ""I have a life that doesn't revolve around it."" Furthermore, the computer takes time away from nature. People don't acknowledge the beauty of the outdoors. Now that our lives are so orderly, we need the wilderness even more than ever; it helps us appreciate ourselves more and appreciate how special our planet. Computers take all that away! Third, computers take us away from real-life. Some people don't know how to have a face-to-face conversation; they only know how to communicate by email or text. While getting away from real life can be relaxing, some people don't even know which side the stamp goes on a letter. It may sound old-fashioned, but I believe people put their heart into something you can't do by email. In conclusion, computers take time away from real-life, nature, and your hobbies. Plus, you can get arthritis in your hands if you type too much. Let's not let computers dominate our lives and take away from the beauty of the world around us."
368	370	1	3	Computers are becoming a household item in the modern world and are widely used for various purposes. Despite some people believing that computers do not benefit society, I strongly believe that they play a crucial role in our everyday lives. One of the most significant advantages of computers is their ability to connect us with people from all over the world. Through the internet, we can communicate with friends, family, and colleagues, regardless of geographical boundaries. This convenience has made staying in touch with loved ones much easier and more affordable than traditional methods like postal mail.  Additionally, computers offer a range of programs and applications that help us stay organized and up-to-date. For instance, software like Microsoft Office provides tools for creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, which are essential for both personal and professional use. Furthermore, file management systems like document folders enable us to store and retrieve information quickly and efficiently, making it easier to access important data whenever needed.  Moreover, computers are invaluable tools for research and information gathering. When working on projects, reports, or assignments, the internet serves as a vast repository of knowledge that can be accessed instantly. Search engines like Google allow users to find relevant information within seconds, significantly speeding up the research process and ensuring that projects are completed on time.  In conclusion, computers are not just a good thing for society – they are essential for the advancement and development of civilization. Whether it's connecting with others, staying organized, or conducting research, computers have become indispensable in our daily lives. It is clear that the benefits they bring far outweigh any perceived drawbacks, making them a valuable asset for individuals and society as a whole.
369	371	1	3	About 40% of the world today uses computers. Although you may spend a lot of time on the computer, there are still ways to stay connected with family and friends, exercise your brain, and enjoy nature. Have you ever heard of email? It's a great way to communicate with loved ones without using up your phone minutes. Social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter also offer ways to connect with others online. Additionally, the internet provides a wealth of knowledge that can help you learn new things and exercise your brain. Online tutoring is also available for those looking to expand their knowledge. While about 60% of people enjoy nature, it's understandable that some may prefer to stay indoors during inclement weather or changing seasons. Despite this, it's important to remember that nature is a vital part of our world and society. In conclusion, while spending time on the computer has its drawbacks, it also offers numerous benefits such as staying connected, learning new things, and enjoying the beauty of nature.
370	372	1	3	Dear newspaper, I think computers have a positive impact on people. They are valuable tools that provide education, improve hand-eye coordination, and facilitate communication.   Computers play a crucial role in education by helping students learn new things, explore different cultures, and discover interesting places. They enhance students' typing skills and make it easier for them to create presentations and projects.   Moreover, computers enable people to interact with others, whether it's through messaging, online dating sites, or connecting with distant relatives. They offer a cost-effective and convenient way to communicate and build relationships.   In conclusion, computers have a beneficial effect on individuals by offering educational opportunities, enhancing communication, and improving coordination skills. They have become essential in today's society, enriching people's lives in various ways.
371	373	1	3	"To whom it may concern, I have recently heard about your argument on the effects that modern day computers have on society. Some people feel they have a positive effect, such as learning new information, and interacting or chatting with other people. Others feel that society is devoting to much time to computers, they feel that these people are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and with their family. I feel that people are devoting themselves to the computer. People think that all things on the internet are true, they're not, 50% of all teens across the country are addicted to the computer. First, things posted on the internet are not always true. They can be posted by anyone, whether it's true or not. My friend found a website with very detailed information for an essay. She turned it in, and the teacher gave it back the following day. In big red letters it said ""false information"" because she had gotten the information from a book. Second, 50% of teens living in the United States have become addicted to using the computer. My friend was obsessed with Facebook from 2018 until 2020; she was on daily. She began failing classes. She didn't do homework, didn't study for tests! She failed the 9th grade. This all happened because she was addicted to a website. This is why I agree with the statement that experts are concerned with people spending too much time on the computer. If you want to continue a healthy lifestyle and avoid becoming too addicted to the computer, limit yourself. Make the smart choice. In conclusion, it is essential to be mindful of the time spent on computers to maintain a balanced life and prevent addiction."
372	374	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I believe that excessive use of technology, such as computers, can have negative effects on individuals, both adults, and children. Children who spend a lot of time on chatting websites like Facebook may experience a decline in their academic performance. I have come across instances where students have admitted that their grades suffered because they became more focused on social media than on their schoolwork. This shift in attention can lead to a decrease in homework completion and overall academic achievement.  Moreover, the addictive nature of computers can be concerning. People can easily become engrossed in online activities, leading to neglect of responsibilities and relationships. Additionally, the anonymity provided by online platforms can be dangerous, especially for young individuals who may unknowingly engage with potentially harmful individuals.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can also impact family dynamics, as individuals may prioritize screen time over quality time with their loved ones. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and isolation within the family unit.  In conclusion, it is important to be mindful of the impact of excessive computer use on various aspects of our lives. By recognizing the potential drawbacks and making conscious efforts to limit screen time, we can strive for a healthier balance between technology and other aspects of life. Let us remember to prioritize our well-being and relationships over virtual distractions.
373	375	1	3	I not agreed the people should be on the computer a lot and I'm going to explain why. Firstly, for elderly individuals like myself, excessive computer usage can lead to eye problems and hinder quality time spent with family, especially children. Secondly, online interactions can strain relationships, as spouses may feel betrayed if their partner is engaging with others, leading to marital issues. Lastly, for youngsters, constant computer usage can limit social interactions, fun activities, and bonding with family members. Therefore, it is important to balance computer usage with other aspects of life to maintain healthy relationships and overall well-being.

In conclusion, while concerns exist about excessive computer usage, the overall impact of computers on society is undeniably positive, facilitating convenience, knowledge acquisition, and connectivity in an increasingly digital world.
375	377	1	3	Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, can you imagine life without your computer? No? Well, that's what I am trying to change. Millions of people spend countless hours with their eyes glued to their computer screens. Spending that much time sitting in one space isn't healthy. Not only do people not get enough exercise, but they also don't get the chance to appreciate the natural world around them that is ever-changing.  Teens and even small children get lost in the cyberworld and don't use their after-school time wisely to study or do homework. The internet is also a dangerous place, and the growing computer use only maximizes the problem. To begin, the obesity rate in @LOCATION1 is growing rapidly. A recent study done by the government shows that many people are overweight and many others are on the brink of obesity. We could decrease the obesity rate and be healthier and happier by exercising and getting out more. Spending all your time glued to a computer screen will only increase your chances of becoming overweight.  Secondly, the more time you spend cooped up inside, the less time you get to enjoy nature. The natural world is ever-changing, and you will miss out on a lot of amazing opportunities if you hardly ever step foot outside your front door. Excessive computer use will wear them out quicker than normal, and where does your old worn-out computer go when you get the new one? A landfill! The more you use your computer, the faster you will trash it. If everyone threw out one computer a year, there would be an overwhelming amount of discarded electronic devices, polluting our environment.  Excessive computer use ruins the environment and hurts your health! What are you waiting for? Go run outside! Ride a bike! Give your computer a break. Finally, the growing computer use increases the amount of internet predators, and the odds that you or your child could be targeted skyrocket. With more and more kids on the computer each day, internet safety levels drop. Not only could these children be watching inappropriate content online or engaging in cyberbullying, but they could also be unknowingly giving out personal information to strangers on social media platforms.  Do you want anything like that to happen to you or your family? I didn't think so. Get up off your comfortable computer chairs and take a walk. Limit your internet and computer use – all it does is harm you, there's no gain. Thank you for reading and let's not support rapid advances in computer technology. Remember, a balanced life is a healthy life.
376	378	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I have heard that there is a controversy over if computers benefit our society. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they have beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. If we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost. First off, one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact. Any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button. However, if this device was not around, we would have to use postal service or the telephone, both of which cost money. Why wouldn't you want a computer? What happens if a hurricane is abroad, and a family has no idea of its presence? All they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in. Calling somebody is risky because they could not be able to answer for any reason. In a situation like this, computers became essential to everyone. Clearly, the ability to contact is a great reason why computers need to be kept. Secondly, computers help us complete our daily work. Almost everyone works during the week, and if you do not realize it, we get most of our help from computers. Let's say that a man or women is at the office and they need to create a power point in order to share the company's new brand. All he/she needs to do is turn on their computer and begin to work with a blink of an eye. But without this device, what would they be able to do? How would they complete their work? The need for a PC, laptop, or tablet is obviously great when you work. Lastly, computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely. When I go home, usually I go straight to my computer like most teenagers do. I can easily check scores or last night's games, listen to music, and play solitaire by myself. I don't need to turn on the TV and wait through all of those tiresome commercials. I don't need to grab a CD and throw it into a boombox. I don't need to grab all the playing cards and set a game up. All I need is my computer. Without a doubt, the fun and helpful computers such as games help us out. Although some say that computers aren't needed, they help us throughout our lives. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. All of these facts lead to one final solution, which is keeping computers in our society.
377	379	1	3	I believe that computers have a great effect on people. People all around the world use computers to talk online with other people, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places, and also let you explore the internet. Computers are a great influence on our lifestyle. Computers allow people from around the world to interact with friends and family. Some websites that allow you to do so are Myspace, Facebook, and Skype. With Facebook, you can take a picture of yourself and place it on your web page. It is really quite easy. Also, with Skype, you can chat with your best friends and can actually see what they are doing. But if you want to do this you are going to need a webcam. I have Skype and I think that it is a wonderful resource. I have relatives in different countries that I only get to see once a year. But with the help of my computer, I can interact with them all year round.  Computers can make people from faraway places learn about the culture and ways of another person's lifestyle. Have you ever seen the commercial where a little boy is talking to his father on the computer? Well, in this commercial, the boy is laying down and is eating an Oreo cookie. While he is doing this, he is talking on the computer with his dad who is doing the same. At the same time, both father and son dip their cookie into a glass of milk, eat it, and laugh. I felt at that time that it was a wonderful moment because even though they are both in opposite directions, the two are still having a great time. Just to think that it was all because of one computer.  Exploring the internet is what a computer can do. When doing this, you can play some really fun games on a rainy day when you are bored. You can look up what happened during one of your favorite basketball games, such as how many points LeBron James got for your fantasy team. Also, at my school, you can check your grades to see what you got on your last math test or quiz. For example, if I had all A's but one C in math, then I would know that I would need to really study for my next test to get an A on it. With the help of the internet, I can do so. As you can see now, computers are a very important part of our society. Computers allow us to talk online with other people, give people the opportunity to learn about faraway people and places, and computers also allow everyone to explore the internet. Computers are a great influence on our lifestyle.
378	380	1	3	"@CAPS1 that was the sound of a light bulb going off in your head. You learned something new! Yipee, if it internet for computers, you would have to read those boring textbooks.

Its packed with so much to learn, its very useful to, and forces so much info into them. Lila, a technology major said, ""@PERCENT1 of people communicate through computers, @PERCENT2 through phones, and @PERCENT3 through mail."" @NUM4 in @NUM5 people over the age of nine, have an email. Incredible numbers of emails are sent everyday. What would it be like withour computers? Think about those numbers you just read, isnt that incredible? Computers have a good effect on people because they teach so much valuable information, they can answer your question in @NUM1 seconds, and also they give you communication to the entire world. If you just take a step back, you notice how valuable something really is to you."
379	381	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, more and more people are becoming addicted to computers, but I believe that this trend is detrimental to our society. One of the main reasons is that individuals are spending less quality time with their friends and family, opting instead to immerse themselves in the virtual world of screens. This shift in priorities can have negative effects on relationships and personal connections, ultimately leading to a sense of isolation and detachment.  Furthermore, the excessive use of computers is also taking a toll on our physical and mental well-being. Instead of engaging in outdoor activities and enjoying the benefits of nature, many individuals are choosing to remain sedentary in front of their screens. This lack of movement and exposure to natural surroundings can have adverse effects on our bodies and minds, contributing to issues such as obesity and mental health disorders.  In addition, the addictive nature of computers poses a serious concern for society. Many people find themselves unable to disconnect from their devices, constantly seeking the next source of stimulation or validation online. This addiction can lead to a neglect of responsibilities, relationships, and overall well-being, ultimately hindering personal growth and development.  While computers can offer convenience and connectivity, it is important to recognize the negative impact they can have on our society. By prioritizing real-life interactions, outdoor experiences, and mindful technology use, we can strive towards a more balanced and fulfilling way of life. Let us not allow the allure of screens to overshadow the richness and beauty of the world around us.
380	382	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1's benefit society immensely. They help us learn about far away places, assist with our school work, and facilitate communication with others online. Computers play a crucial role in these aspects.   Computers provide us with access to information about different countries, cultures, and people, allowing us to broaden our knowledge and understanding of the world. They enable us to explore potential vacation destinations and make informed decisions about where to visit or avoid. Without computers, many of us would be limited in our exposure to diverse global perspectives.  In terms of education, computers are invaluable tools for research and studying. They make it easier for students to gather information, complete projects, and access online textbooks. This convenience not only saves time but also enhances the learning experience by offering interactive and engaging resources that traditional textbooks may lack.  Furthermore, computers facilitate communication by allowing us to connect with others online. From chatting with friends to collaborating on group projects, computers enable us to stay connected and engaged in a digital age where virtual interaction is increasingly prevalent.   In conclusion, computers have become essential in our daily lives, benefiting us in various ways such as expanding our knowledge, aiding in education, and enhancing communication. Their importance cannot be understated, as they continue to shape the way we learn, work, and interact with the world around us.
381	383	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers are good for providing us with useful information? I @CAPS2. This is only one of the reasons why I agree with the use of computers. The reasons are: They provide us with information for learning, they allow us to communicate with people, and they provide entertainment. However, I @CAPS2 understand why someone would oppose than. Let me explain my point of view. Whenever I need to @CAPS2 or know something that I don't know about, I go to my computer and look it up. Many search engines such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3 and @LOCATION1 allow us to input a question or phrase and gives us links to other websites that hold information about the topic we are trying to learn about. Another way computers help us learn is because we can download and install software that help us with things like learning a foreign language or even just practicing math. For example, my grandfather wanted to learn how to speak @CAPS4 but he didn't have time to go to classes. So he ordered a program that teaches him how to speak @CAPS4 while he is home. Another reason why I think that computers benefit society is because it allows us to communicate with other people. One way is through social sites where you have a profile and you can ""chat"" with your friends by typing in what you want to say. Another way is through video chat. This is when you have a webcam and you can see and talk to other people. I think that this is very important because @PERCENT1 of people that the computers leads people to become ""anti-social"". It also helps you connect with old school friends and relatives that are far away. This @MONTH1 actually improve some people social if they are shy. @CAPS2 you like music, movies, and more? Well you have access to them through your computer. This is yet another reason how computers can benefit us. If you are going somewhere that you think your kids will be bored all you have to do (if you have a laptop) is put a movie in for them to watch. Another way that computers provide entertainment is they let us listen to music. If you have an iPod or @NUM1 player you can download the music from the computer. It also provides us with entertainment if we are interested in playing video games. There is entertainment for everyone. Even though I support the use of computers I understand the negative effect they have on many people. Some of those things are: people stop exercising and become overweight, they @MONTH1 become less interactive with other people, and they @MONTH1 not spend as much time in the fresh air. In conclusion, I think that computers can benefit our society. The reason why I think this are: they provide us with information, allow us to communicate, and provide us with entertainment. Ultimately, computers play a vital role in enhancing our lives and connecting us to a world of knowledge, communication, and enjoyment."
382	384	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you believe that computers have a positive impact on people? I certainly do.

385	387	1	3	Dear editor,  You know, a significant percentage of children who spend excessive time on the computer without engaging in physical activity are at risk of developing weight problems and blood disorders. This is just one of the negative impacts that advancements in computer technology have had on individuals so far. If this trend continues, the number of affected individuals is likely to increase, leading to further health complications. Some other potential issues that could arise from this dependency on technology include a weakened immune system and emotional detachment from family members.  Obesity is a serious concern that can result from excessive computer use. Not only does obesity pose risks to vital organs, but it can also lead to blood disorders like high blood pressure and diabetes, which in turn increase the likelihood of heart attacks. Dealing with obesity is challenging enough, but witnessing the effects of a weakened immune system on individuals can be distressing. Those who spend prolonged periods on the computer may find themselves more susceptible to illnesses, resulting in frequent absences from school or work and subsequently impacting their academic or professional performance.  It is evident that the negative consequences of technology dependency are becoming increasingly apparent, especially in children who are experiencing rising obesity rates and weakened immune systems. It is crucial to address these issues to prevent further health complications and ensure the well-being of individuals in our society. Therefore, raising awareness about the importance of balancing technology use with physical activity and social interaction is essential to combatting the adverse effects of excessive screen time.  Sincerely, [Your Name]

387	389	1	3	Dear newspaper, I've read your article about peoples opinion on the affects of computers. I believe that having computers are a very good thing. With them we can talk to others from far away, and fast. You can learn a lot too. It also teaches hand-eye coordination. My first reason why they are good is because you ran talk to others. Without computers it would be almost impossible to meet people from far away and talk to them so easily. They even have webcams so you can see each other. You can use @CAPS1, @CAPS2, webcams, or even a simple comment on facebook or myspace. @CAPS2 or webcams are the quichest and maybe even coolest way. Secondly you can learn Computers have so many websites that give out alot of information and resent too. It's muchn easier to get on the internet and type something in then look threw a bunch of books.The internet has dictionaries, news stations, weather, history and where you can find things. With all that you dont even need books. They even have maps and you can print out directions. My final reason is because it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you first start using computers your normally pretty young, and sometimes you don't always type the fastest. Computers have become so advanced that there are even touch-screen and wireless mases. So when you first start you normaly look down to see what your writing, later, adults want you to look at the screen when that becames easy you know that your hand-eye coordination has grown alot better then when you stated. In conclusion I think that computers are a good part of everyday life and that there not bad. They are an easy communication between people, help you learn, and teach good and fast hand-eye coordination in kids.  Having computers in our lives not only enables us to communicate with others from far away but also provides us with a wealth of information that is easily accessible. The internet offers a plethora of resources, ranging from dictionaries to news stations, making it a valuable tool for learning. Moreover, using computers can enhance hand-eye coordination, especially in children, as they navigate through various tasks on the screen. In essence, computers play a vital role in modern society by facilitating communication, fostering learning, and improving cognitive skills.
388	390	1	3	I think that computers do benefit us. They allow us to interact with people, talk to family far away, help us with school, gives us easy access to information, and much more people usually have family and friends who live away from each other and the computer allows us to interact with them. The computer lets us email and instant message them, play games against them, be their friend on websites like facebook so you can see recent pictures of them. It's not easy to interact with family and friends who live so far away and the internet allows us to do that. The computer doesn't just let you talk to family and friends but it lets you meet new people and interact with new people from all over the world. It let's you make new friends and play games with them or chat. The computer really helps you to just stay in touch with other people and it's a very easy and convenient way to do so. The next thing the computer helps us with is it entertains us. Children are very hyper and after homework is done, we don't have anything to do so the computer let's us play games on it, chat with friends, watch movies and videos, upload picture, etc. It does a lot for us. Kids could hang out after school but if they can go on the computer it allows them want to go home where their parents know that they're safe and away from drugs, alcohol, and other bad things they can get into. Just because kids like the computer, that doesn't mean that that's the only thing they do. Kids are very athletic, always playing sports and always hyper but the computer helps that go away. They go to school for hours, then go to basketball or football practice, sometimes we just need a break. The computer isn't always fun but it's very useful. The computer helps us with school. It allows us to type essays and projects. It also allows us easy information to help write the essays. Websites like google and bing are easy websites to help us get good and accurate information about whatever the topic is that we are doing. The computer is very useful when it comes to school. As you can see, the computer is very important in our lives and makes life a lot easy and it's your choice how much you want to spend on it. But no matter what, the computer definitely benefits us. Additionally, computers also provide us with access to a vast array of educational resources that can enhance our learning experience. Online libraries, academic databases, and educational websites offer a wealth of information that can supplement our knowledge and help us excel in our studies. Moreover, computers enable us to work more efficiently by allowing us to organize and store information digitally, collaborate with classmates on group projects, and access online tutorials and study materials. In this way, computers play a crucial role in supporting our academic endeavors and helping us achieve success in school and beyond.

Additionally, the lure of the digital world can detract from enjoying the beauty of nature and outdoor activities. When individuals are glued to their computers, they may miss out on the simple pleasures of fresh air and outdoor experiences.   Moreover, excessive screen time can also lead to a lack of meaningful interactions with family and friends. Parents may neglect quality time with their children, and teenagers may isolate themselves from loved ones as they prioritize their online activities. This detachment from real-life relationships can have detrimental effects on mental and emotional well-being.

396	398	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editors,  Advancements in technology have undoubtedly shaped our modern society, but are these changes truly for the better? As we become increasingly reliant on screens and devices, we are neglecting our physical health and missing out on the beauty of nature. The rise in obesity, especially among children, can be attributed to a lack of exercise due to excessive screen time. We are putting our hearts at risk by leading sedentary lifestyles.  Furthermore, our obsession with technology is driving a wedge between us and our loved ones. Constantly checking our phones at the dinner table or isolating ourselves in our rooms with gadgets is distancing us from the people who care about us the most. It's essential to prioritize real-life interactions over virtual connections.  In order to combat the negative impact of technology on our lives, we must take a step back and reevaluate our priorities. Make time for outdoor activities, exercise regularly, and nurture relationships with family and friends. These simple changes can lead to a healthier, happier, and more fulfilling life. It's time to break free from the shackles of technology and embrace the real world around us.  Let's make a conscious effort to disconnect from our devices and reconnect with the people and experiences that truly matter. Only then can we truly appreciate the wonders of life and safeguard our well-being.  Sincerely, [Your Name]

399	401	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 paper editor,  I believe it is time for us to address the issue of excessive computer usage among individuals. In today's society, people are spending a significant amount of time at home in front of their screens, which is not beneficial for their physical health. It is essential to promote a day without computers, encouraging everyone to go outside and engage in physical exercise. By doing so, we can improve our overall well-being and contribute to a healthier lifestyle.  While computers have their advantages, such as connecting with friends and playing games, it is crucial to find a balance between screen time and outdoor activities. I, too, enjoy using the computer, but I realize the importance of getting enough exercise and fresh air. Limiting children's computer usage to a few hours a day can help instill healthy habits and prevent them from becoming overly reliant on technology.  Let's make a conscious effort to reduce our screen time and prioritize outdoor activities. By doing so, we can improve our physical health, strengthen our bodies, and lead a more active lifestyle. It's time to step away from our screens and embrace the benefits of the great outdoors.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
400	402	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have an excellent benefit for people. First, family and friends can communicate from a far distance. Secondly, typing on the computer gives people good hand and eye coordination. Thirdly, they give people the ability to learn about faraway places. Lastly, it gives students a chance to research a topic they are learning about. Research shows that almost 50% of families live far away from each other. Computers provide the ability for families to communicate, whether it's through email or a webcam chat. Additionally, typing on a computer improves hand and eye coordination, which can be useful in various activities. Furthermore, computers allow individuals to explore and learn about distant places, expanding their knowledge and understanding of the world. In educational settings, students can utilize computers to conduct research on various topics, enhancing their learning experience. Overall, computers play a crucial role in facilitating communication, improving skills, and expanding knowledge, making them a valuable tool for individuals in today's digital age. Thank you for considering these points.
401	403	1	3	Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. There are many ways computers can have positive effects on humans. First, computers bring people together and let them interact with each other. They allow people to talk to each other, whether through emails, social media platforms like Facebook, or video calls. This connectivity helps foster relationships and create a sense of community.  Additionally, computers provide a wealth of information through the internet. People can learn about new things, explore different topics, and access a vast array of resources online. This access to knowledge helps individuals expand their horizons and stay informed about various subjects.  Moreover, computers enable individuals to do tasks more efficiently. For instance, typing a paper on a computer is much faster and easier than using a typewriter. Computers also allow for entertainment, such as listening to music or watching videos, which can help people relax and unwind.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on society by promoting communication, facilitating learning, and enhancing productivity. The various benefits of computers contribute to a more connected and informed world, making them a valuable tool for individuals.
402	404	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have on people are predominantly positive. In a world where time is of the essence, computers provide convenience and efficiency in various aspects of our lives. For instance, checking the weather forecast online can save us from unexpected downpours and help us plan our day accordingly.   Moreover, computers are essential for businesses and organizations to operate smoothly. The digitalization of data eliminates the need for cumbersome filing systems, making it easier for offices to manage information effectively. In schools, teachers rely on computers to keep track of students' grades and academic progress, streamlining the educational process.   While some may argue that computers detract from spending time in nature or connecting with loved ones, the reality is that technology can enhance these experiences. Many people enjoy taking their laptops to the park to work or relax under a tree, blending the benefits of technology with the beauty of the outdoors. Additionally, social networking platforms allow us to stay connected with family and friends, even if they are miles away.   In conclusion, computers play a vital role in our modern society, offering convenience, efficiency, and connectivity in various aspects of our lives. Embracing technology allows us to navigate our daily tasks with ease and stay connected with the world around us. So, next time you're in a rush or unsure about the weather, remember that your trusty computer can be a valuable resource.
403	405	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people surveyed in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 agree that the use of computers benefits society. I personally concern with these @NUM1 people, computers have a positive effect on people. There are multiple reasons why I think the use of computers really benefits society, including it can teach good hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Once again I do believe computers can have a positive effect on people. First of all, its's a proven fact that most sports on physical exercise to involve hand-eye coordination to some extent. The computer can help reach people from a very young age good hand-eye coordination. When a person uses a computer they have to keep an eye on the screen but still be able to use the mouse or keyboard. This takes alot of coordination if you think about why don't even love to look at the mouse on keyboard when they are typing, they just know where everything is. People disagree with what I'm saying often use the excuse that when people spend to much time on the computers they aren't getting enough exercise. However, I believe that is not true. The hand-eye coordiantion people learn on the computer help to improve their skill and coordiantion in sports, for example in baseball a person has to be looking at the ball to catch it, but at the samee time they have to move their arm to catch it. That is were the hand-eye coordiantion helps. This proves that computers can benefit society through teaching people hand-eye coordiantion. In addition to this @PERCENT1 of teachers at @ORGANIZATION2 believe that computers can be used as a great tool to help students learn. Computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. They give people acess to information about a foreign place or people be available in or other resources areas. On the computer one can go to a search sight and type in my place in the whole world. Then all they have to do is search and they have dozens of with information of that place and pictures, @CAPS2 are a society that is advencing in technology people are learnings learn and they can wtih great the of a button. In addition is think it's also a tool in schools. Teachers can have students do projects about different countries on people and the student can easily that the information on the computer. Computer benefit society in the way that they can teach about different loaction and people. Computers can help people become interested in these different topics and @MONTH1 be even inspire some people to go to these faraway places or hack different people. Finally, @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people asked had some kind of way to contact with people online, whether it was through email or facebook. Computers allow people to take online with other people. In our modern society it is very important that a person has friends, are great why to keep in with friends, if live very far away from you on it haven't to them in a while connecting them on the computer is a great way to keep i touch. Those who disagree with my opinion believe that spending time on the computer means less time with family and friends. I believe taht is just the opposite. Since @CAPS2 are living in modern ages families understand that kid leaves to college they might be going far away or even across the country. Having computer allows that family to chat an easy way to keep in contact talk with each other. People talking each other on line is just another way how computers benefit society. Its now or never! Computers can have benefit society. They reach people hand-eye coordiantion can be use all through our life. Most importantly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Lastly they allow people to talk online with others. @CAPS2 are living a modern time, society is advancing everyday and computers are a huge part of it! They are having a positive effect on people. Therefore, it is evident that the use of computers truly benefits society in various ways, from improving hand-eye coordination to facilitating communication and learning about distant places and people. Embracing the technological advancements of computers can lead to a more connected and knowledgeable society overall.
404	406	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I disagree with the notion that people should spend all their time on the computer instead of enjoying time with family and friends. It is important to strike a balance and prioritize relationships over screen time.   Firstly, excessive computer use can lead to wasted time and reduced productivity. Many children spend hours playing games or browsing the internet when they could be engaging in more meaningful activities. It is crucial for individuals to manage their time effectively and focus on tasks that contribute to personal growth and development.  Secondly, the internet should be used as a tool for studying and learning, not just for entertainment. Students who spend excessive time on the computer playing games or visiting unauthorized websites may struggle academically. It is essential for young people to use technology responsibly and prioritize their education over mindless screen time.  Thirdly, spending time with family and friends is crucial for emotional well-being and building strong relationships. Neglecting these connections in favor of screen time can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation. It is important to prioritize quality time with loved ones and create lasting memories together.  In conclusion, while technology has its benefits, it is important to remember the value of real-life interactions and experiences. Balancing screen time with meaningful relationships and activities is essential for overall well-being and personal growth. Let us strive to cultivate connections with others and make the most of our time away from the computer.
405	407	1	3	I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with others. Computers have become essential in various aspects of life, such as education, work, communication, and entertainment. Without computers, obtaining information would be limited to books, restricting the breadth and depth of knowledge available. By using computers, individuals can access a wealth of information from various websites, enabling them to explore different topics and expand their understanding. Additionally, computers promote hand-eye coordination through tasks like typing and navigating screens, providing a form of physical exercise for the hands and eyes. Communication has been greatly facilitated by computers, allowing people to stay in touch with friends and family across long distances through email, social media, and messaging platforms. Furthermore, computers offer educational opportunities for students, enabling them to access resources, complete assignments, and engage in interactive learning activities. Overall, computers play a vital role in enhancing learning, communication, and overall quality of life for individuals. They have undoubtedly had a positive impact on society and continue to be a valuable tool for personal and professional development.
406	408	1	3	I believe that computers have a negative effect on people. Using the computer affects a person's time because they sit for hours playing online games, which also affects their health as they are not getting any fresh air or spending time with their family. Lastly, it affects their education because the time that could be spent doing homework is instead used on the computer. First, using the computer affects a person's time by wasting hours that could be spent outside playing or doing chores around the house. This not only hinders productivity but also limits opportunities for social interaction and physical activity. Additionally, the sedentary nature of computer use can have adverse effects on one's overall health, leading to issues like obesity and decreased emotional well-being. Furthermore, excessive computer use can strain relationships with family and friends, as individuals may become isolated and less connected to those around them. This lack of social interaction can further exacerbate the negative impact of computer use on mental health. Lastly, the time spent on the computer could be utilized more effectively for educational purposes, such as completing homework or studying for exams. Neglecting academic responsibilities in favor of computer use can result in poor grades and missed learning opportunities. In conclusion, while computers can be valuable tools for education and entertainment, it is essential to use them in moderation to avoid the negative consequences they can have on one's health, relationships, and overall well-being.
407	409	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years old and I go to a @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 called @ORGANIZATION1. I am a really smart kid. In my opinion, I benefit people using computers. You should keep reading my essay because I am going to tell you three good reasons why I benefit people using computers.  My first reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination and give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, whenever I am using the computer for research, it always allows me to explore new places and learn about different cultures. Additionally, watching educational videos online often exposes me to a wide range of information about distant locations and diverse communities.  Secondly, computers enable people to communicate online with others. Whenever I log onto social media platforms like Facebook, I can easily engage in conversations with friends and acquaintances. Research also shows that a significant percentage of online users interact with others through various online channels.  Lastly, computers provide students with access to vast amounts of information when they are working on projects. For instance, utilizing school computers allows me to gather valuable data about specific topics such as government policies and geographic locations. Magazines and online resources further emphasize that students benefit greatly from the wealth of information available to them during project work.  In conclusion, I benefit people using computers by enhancing hand-eye coordination, facilitating learning about distant places and cultures, enabling online communication, and providing valuable information for academic projects. These reasons collectively highlight the positive impact of computer usage on individuals. Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.
408	410	1	3	Dear editor, Computers are a waste of time. When kids get home from school, they often spend hours glued to their screens, neglecting other important activities. This excessive screen time can hinder their social interactions, physical health, and overall well-being.   Children who spend too much time on computers may struggle to develop essential social skills. Instead of playing outside with friends or engaging in face-to-face conversations, they may isolate themselves in front of a screen. This lack of social interaction can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnect from the real world.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can have negative effects on physical health. Sitting for prolonged periods can contribute to obesity, eye strain, and poor posture. Children need to be active and engage in physical activities to maintain their health and development, which is difficult to achieve when they are constantly on the computer.  Moreover, the content children are exposed to on computers can be harmful. Violent video games can desensitize them to violence and lead to aggressive behavior. It is crucial for parents to monitor and limit their children's screen time to ensure they are not engaging with inappropriate content that can negatively impact their mental health.  In conclusion, while computers can be valuable tools for learning and entertainment, excessive use can have detrimental effects on children's development. It is essential for parents to set limits and encourage a healthy balance between screen time and other activities to promote their children's overall well-being.
409	411	1	3	Dear editor of my local newspaper,  More and more people are using computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. These devices can be harmful to users' eyes, lead to less interaction with real people, and result in a very unhealthy lifestyle. Computers are indeed harmful to our society.  Firstly, computers can be detrimental because they are bad for our eyes. Doctors have reported a significant increase in eye problems that require surgery, glasses, or contacts, which can be directly linked to the overuse of personal computers. Studies have also shown that individuals who spend more than four hours a day on computers tend to have deteriorated vision by a relatively young age. Additionally, experts have highlighted the negative impact of computer overuse on the eyesight of workers, outweighing the benefits of increased productivity.  Secondly, computers lead to less time spent with real people, affecting social interactions. Research indicates that people do not learn as much about their peers when communicating through a screen, leading to fewer conversations at social gatherings. This lack of face-to-face interaction can result in a superficial understanding of others' emotions and hinder genuine connections among individuals.  Lastly, computers contribute to an unhealthy lifestyle by promoting sedentary behavior and limiting exposure to fresh air. The decrease in physical activity and outdoor time due to prolonged computer use has been associated with a rise in obesity rates and breathing problems. While the exact cause of these health issues may vary, it is evident that excessive time spent on computers plays a significant role in fostering an unhealthy lifestyle.  In conclusion, the widespread use of computers has negative repercussions on society. From eye strain to reduced social interactions and unhealthy habits, it is clear that computers can harm individuals and communities. It is essential to raise awareness about the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use and strive for a more balanced and healthy lifestyle for all.
410	412	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that using computers is a good thing. They can help you learn about subjects or places you find interesting but don't know much about. Additionally, computers can play a significant role in helping to save the environment. For example, by reducing the need for paper, we can help preserve trees and prevent deforestation. Moreover, computers have the potential to drive advancements in various fields, from medicine to space exploration. With the aid of computers, we can discover more efficient ways to do things and improve our daily lives. Overall, computers offer a wide range of benefits, from facilitating learning to contributing to environmental conservation and technological progress.
411	413	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In @CAPS2 opinion, computers are fantastic! Therefore, I believe computers have a great effect on people's lives. Three reasons to support @CAPS2 decision are many jobs use computers, instead of using a dictionary or thesaurus, you can just search it and it is a big help at home/around the house.  @CAPS2 first reason is, that many jobs in the state, or nation use a computer. Statistically saying @NUM1 out of @NUM2 jobs in the state use a computer or technology relating to a computer hardware. If you honestly think about it, if you were a teacher, a factory employee, etc, you practically wouldn't even be able to do your job without it. We have learned a lot from the new inventions that came about in the past decade, or two.  @CAPS2 second reason is we have a lot more useful search engines than @NUM3 years ago. In/around the @NUM5's, if you wanted to find information, the only resort was...books. Yes, I mean reading is great, but now having the computer is faster and easier. All you do is go to @ORGANIZATION2 and type in what you want to find. Then it comes up in about @NUM6 seconds with around @NUM7 links to websites to help you out. Just think, now there's no table of contents, just a link and a click!  @CAPS2 third reason is it is a big help around the house/at home. In the state of @LOCATION1, about @PERCENT1 of people have a laptop or a computer in their home. But, this isn't a bad thing, because it can help with so many things. Including, help with the children, help with cooking, with organizing, anything! Let's say you don't know what time ""@CAPS3's"" friend's birthday party starts, no worries just ask his mom on @CAPS4! Or you need a recipe for dinner, find it on cooks.com. This makes life a lot easier and puts an extraordinary effect on your life!  In conclusion, having a computer in your life is great, because so many jobs use computers, there are so many searching things, and it is helpful at home. So, computers have an awesome effect on people's lives!"
412	414	1	3	Dear local newspaper,   I agree that computers have a significant impact on people. One reason for this is that individuals who spend excessive amounts of time on the computer may miss out on opportunities to engage in activities that bring them joy, such as spending time with friends and family. For example, a friend of mine who is always glued to the computer screen often foregoes social outings in favor of staying online. This can lead to feelings of isolation and dissatisfaction.   Furthermore, constantly being on the computer can detract from one's ability to truly enjoy life. Instead of immersing oneself in the present moment, individuals may find themselves constantly distracted by the allure of the digital world. This can prevent them from fully appreciating the beauty of everyday experiences, such as a day at the beach or a leisurely walk in the park.   In addition, health professionals often caution against excessive computer use due to its potential negative effects on physical and mental well-being. Prolonged screen time can strain the eyes and contribute to sedentary habits, which are detrimental to overall health. It is important for individuals to prioritize activities that promote physical activity and social connection in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.   In conclusion, it is clear that computers can impact people in various ways, from hindering social interactions to impeding one's ability to enjoy life fully. It is important for individuals to strike a balance between screen time and real-world experiences in order to cultivate a well-rounded and fulfilling life.
413	415	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, present in almost every aspect of our society. They offer a plethora of benefits, from providing access to information and entertainment to streamlining business operations. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that computers also pose certain risks and drawbacks.   One of the most concerning issues associated with computers is the potential for harm from malicious individuals. The internet can be a breeding ground for predators and cybercriminals who may use personal information obtained online to harm or exploit others. This threat underscores the importance of practicing caution and safeguarding one's privacy when using computers.  Furthermore, the addictive nature of computer usage is a significant concern. With an endless array of games, social media platforms, and other online distractions, it is easy to lose track of time and become consumed by digital content. This addiction can have negative consequences on one's mental health, productivity, and overall well-being.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous advantages and opportunities, it is essential to approach their usage with caution and moderation. By being mindful of the potential risks and pitfalls associated with computer technology, individuals can harness its benefits without falling prey to its drawbacks. Striking a balance between utilizing computers for their advantages and mitigating their negative effects is key to ensuring a healthy and positive relationship with technology.
414	416	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe that we should consider the negative impacts of excessive computer use on our health and well-being. One major concern is the potential harm to our eyes from prolonged screen time. Additionally, spending too much time on computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which may result in weight gain and other health issues. Furthermore, being glued to a screen can prevent us from enjoying the beauty of nature and getting fresh air outdoors. Lastly, excessive computer use may also limit our social interactions with friends and family, affecting our relationships and overall happiness. It is essential to strike a balance and prioritize our physical and mental well-being over excessive screen time.
415	417	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to express my belief in the positive impact that computers have on people. Computers play a crucial role in various aspects of our daily lives, from businesses to schools and hospitals.

In hotels, computers are used to manage guest information and activate room keys, streamlining the check-in process. Restaurants rely on computers to generate bills accurately and efficiently. Hospitals utilize computers to store patient files securely, allowing doctors to access and review them promptly for better patient care.  Schools also benefit greatly from computers, using them to maintain grade records, facilitate online learning, and enable students to submit assignments digitally. Additionally, computers are essential in the workforce, with many professions requiring computer skills for tasks such as programming, data analysis, and website development.  Even large corporations like @MONTH1 rely heavily on computers for their operations, underscoring the widespread impact of technology in the business world. Overall, computers not only enhance productivity and efficiency but also open up new opportunities for individuals to succeed in their careers.

416	418	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I am @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, and I wanted to provide a young teen's perspective on the effects of @ORGANIZATION1 computer usage throughout @LOCATION1. In today's world, where people are heavily reliant on computers, there are numerous benefits that come with their usage.   One significant positive impact of computers is the entertainment they offer. Whether through online games or fantasy sports leagues, individuals, especially young people like myself, find joy and relaxation in these activities. Educational websites also play a crucial role in helping children learn and grow in a digital age. For instance, platforms like @CAPS2 provide a fun and interactive way for kids to acquire knowledge.   Furthermore, computers facilitate communication with friends and family, even when physical distance separates us. Video chatting programs like @ORGANIZATION4 enable us to stay connected with loved ones, fostering relationships despite geographical barriers. A majority of people, as indicated by a recent online poll, prefer using computers for communication over other methods like phone calls or in-person interactions.  Moreover, computers serve as a gateway to global news and information, keeping us updated on current events around the world. Whether it's breaking news updates or in-depth articles, the internet provides a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips. Many individuals, including travelers like the waiter from @LOCATION4, rely on the internet to stay informed about happenings in their hometowns and beyond.  In conclusion, the impact of computers on people is predominantly positive, offering entertainment, communication, and access to information. While there may be some drawbacks, such as potential overreliance or misuse, the benefits of computer usage outweigh the negatives in today's digital age. As a young individual who witnesses these advantages firsthand, I believe that computers play a vital role in enriching our lives and connecting us to the world at large. Thank you for considering the perspective of a teenager in your evaluation of computer effects.
417	419	1	3	The local newspaper wants to know my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers do have an effect on people. People can meet new people, learn about new places, and talk to friends. Read on so you can learn how computers affect people's lives. My first reason is people can meet new people. You can meet new people from all around the world. You can keep in touch with them through social media or email. It's a quicker and new way to meet new people. My second reason is you can learn about new places. You can learn about new places by just clicking on a webpage. Computers are a faster way to learn. It gives you everything you need to know about the new places you want to learn about. My third reason is we can talk to friends. Computers have many different social websites that you can talk to people on. You won't have to wait for school the next day; you can talk to them through the computer. With all this new and quicker stuff, you can talk to friends whenever you want. Finally, you know how computers affect people. We can meet new people, learn new places, and talk to friends. Computers can do all these things. Hope you enjoyed reading all about how they affect people.
418	420	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 people, You have been told that using a @CAPS1 can give no knowledge, but I agree that it gives you hand-eye coordination. A @CAPS1 is the most helpful thing in the world. For my first reason, computers have so many technological advancements inside that help people every day. I want to talk about interacting with family and friends. You can go on Facebook, Myspace, and even Twitter to talk to your friends. It's the most common thing to do on the @CAPS1. About @PERCENT1 teens and adults use Myspace and Facebook. Even little kids, around @PERCENT2, use @CAPS1 to interact with friends. This technology is the best thing you could ever use.   The second reason is that people need to learn how to use a @CAPS1 and improve hand-eye coordination. For learning, you could learn how to type, write stories, use @ORGANIZATION1 Word, and even learn how to navigate the internet. For hand-eye coordination, you can learn all the keys on the keyboard and what they do to improve skills.   My third reason is how to search on Google or the @LOCATION1. Google is the most common search engine that everyone uses. You can look up pictures for projects, labs, basically for anything. The dictionary is for learning and doing homework. You can also find out what words mean and expand your vocabulary.   In conclusion, all these reasons are true, and computers are the greatest sources on the planet. Everyone, do you want education or not? Computers help everyone. You gotta love it!
419	421	1	3	More and more people are spending a significant amount of time on computers, but not everyone sees this as a positive development for society. I, for one, believe that excessive computer use is detrimental. While there are benefits to using computers, such as accessing information and connecting with others online, I think that people should also prioritize physical activity and real-life experiences. Instead of spending hours in front of a screen, individuals could improve their health by engaging in regular exercise.   Furthermore, while computers allow us to see beautiful images and learn about different places, nothing can compare to actually experiencing these things in person. Traveling and exploring nature can be much more fulfilling than simply looking at pictures on a screen. Additionally, spending too much time on computers can lead to a lack of face-to-face interaction with friends and family. It is important to maintain these personal connections and not let technology interfere with our relationships.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is crucial to find a balance and not let them take over our lives. Engaging in physical activity, experiencing the world around us, and nurturing personal relationships are all essential for a fulfilling and healthy life.
420	422	1	3	Some people are too obsessed with computers, spending all night playing games or browsing the internet. This can lead to lack of sleep, missed responsibilities, and unhealthy habits. It's important to strike a balance and not let computers consume your life. It's also crucial to be cautious of the information found online, as not everything may be accurate. Taking breaks, getting exercise, and using reliable sources for research are all important steps in maintaining a healthy relationship with technology. Ultimately, moderation is key to avoiding the negative effects of excessive computer use.
421	423	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editors,  In our community, computers are widely used for positive purposes. They contribute to improving hand-eye coordination, enabling research on distant places, and facilitating communication with loved ones who are far away. These benefits demonstrate the positive impact that computers have on individuals.  Firstly, computers enhance hand-eye coordination, which is crucial for various tasks such as serving in a restaurant or driving. Developing this coordination through computer use can lead to improved performance in physical activities that require precise movements. While some argue that excessive computer use may strain eyes and necessitate wearing glasses, the benefits of enhanced coordination outweigh these concerns.  Secondly, computers provide access to information about distant places, allowing individuals to explore the world without leaving their homes. This ability is particularly valuable for students working on projects that require research on foreign countries. Although there are concerns about children spending too much time on the computer and not getting enough exercise, moderation and balance can address these issues effectively.  Lastly, computers facilitate quick and convenient communication with friends and family who are geographically distant. This real-time connection is especially beneficial for maintaining relationships and staying in touch with loved ones. While there are risks associated with online interactions, such as potential exposure to harmful content or individuals, proper supervision and guidance can mitigate these risks effectively.  In conclusion, the positive impact of computers on individuals is evident through the enhancement of hand-eye coordination, access to information about distant places, and improved communication with loved ones. By recognizing and addressing potential drawbacks, such as eye strain or excessive screen time, individuals can maximize the benefits of computer use in their daily lives.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
422	424	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers are educational, making it easy for people to access information for learning purposes. They also simplify tasks such as shopping and communication, making life more convenient. Additionally, computers provide enjoyment through games and connecting with friends and family online. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing people's lives and improving efficiency in various aspects.
423	425	1	3	To whom it may concern,   Computers are a great source of technology, but many people spend too much time on them, neglecting the outside world. Instead of enjoying nature, exercising, and bonding with family and friends, individuals are often glued to their screens, missing out on valuable experiences. While some may argue that they can explore nature online, nothing compares to the real-life adventure of being outdoors. Fresh air and physical activity are essential for overall well-being, yet excessive computer usage hinders these opportunities. Moreover, quality time with loved ones is irreplaceable, and face-to-face interactions are far more meaningful than digital communication. In conclusion, striking a balance between technology and real-life experiences is crucial for a fulfilling and healthy lifestyle.
424	426	1	3	"Dear, @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 has come to my concern that many people are debating on whether computers benefit our society or not. Some people think computers are the lives of many people, but I have to disagree with those who say that. I think that computers benefits our society in there ways, they bring people together, they offer many websites to research a topic, and they let people shop at home. One way that computers help us is that they bring people together by using the internet. Many families do not live close to other relatives, making hard to see them. But with the internet, people can use social networking sites such as facebook or myspace to keep in touch with one another. Distant relatives can talk and share picture with one another to keep in touch. Also, the internet can help bring couple together and potentially lead to marriages. How @MONTH1 times have you seen those @CAPS3 harmony commercial that claim to have brought two singles together to make a happy couple? Another way that computers help today's society is that they offer many places to conduct research on a certain topic. There are so many search engines on the internet that lead you to numerous websites to help you find out what you need to know. Also, researching a topic on the computer is so much easier compared to going to the library and reading books. When using books, to research a topic, you need to find the right book, read the whole thing or at least most of @CAPS2, and find what you're looking for. But with the internet, you just type in what you're looking for, click, and go. Lastly, computers let you shop online and lead to a better shopping experience. By shopping online, you skip the long lines at retail stores which means less time walking to get your product. For example, many people rush to stores early in the @TIME1 for huge sales on ""@CAPS4 @DATE1."" A person could be left waiting in line for hours to get a product. Why wait outside for so long when you could just buy the product in the comfort of your own home and get the product delivered right to your house? Also, many websites offer special deals for shopping online so you can even money. In conclusion, I think that computers benefit our society in three ways, they bring people together, they offer many websites to research a topic, and they let people shop at home. A world without computers would be so much different than the world we live in today. Additionally, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and learn, making our lives more efficient and connected. With the endless possibilities that computers offer, it's clear that they play a crucial role in shaping our modern society."

First, staring at a computer screen is unhealthy for your body. Secondly, anyone can post information on a website, therefore, it can be inaccurate. Lastly, people tend to rely on computers too much. Computers are negatively impacting our society! The first reason why clearly, computers are not benefiting people is because they can cause unhealthy symptoms. For example, if you are playing games on the computer for hours, it can strain your eyes. This can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer. Also, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers. Could this be the cause of obesity in @LOCATION1? Computers could very well be restricting people from wanting to go outside and exercising to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. Computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways. Have you ever wondered if the information on a website is completely accurate and true? I know I have. Anyone who has access to a computer can post information on a blog, website, or communication site (such as Twitter, Facebook, or Myspace). Not everyone who posts articles is an expert on that topic; the information could very well be false! More and more @CAPS1 use computers to get the information they need, which could, in the long run, be hurting them. Books are much more accurate! They have to be revised by editors, and are written by people who definitely know what they're talking about! Therefore, computers are, without a doubt, hurting our nation because of false facts. Lastly, computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much! For example, let's say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow. You save it, and then close down the computer because you have to go eat dinner. Later, you come back to the laptop to find that your paper isn't there anymore! You look all over your folders, but it's gone. Computers always have technical glitches, but you don't always have time to go to the tech help store to fix it. However, if you had written out the paper, it wouldn't have randomly disappeared! @CAPS4 people depend on computers too much, it can backfire and cause a @CAPS3 problem for you. My sixth-grade teacher once said, ""@CAPS4 I was in college, I had a big French paper due. I worked hard all night to get it done. Then, @CAPS4 I went back to print it, it had been erased. I had to rewrite the whole thing again!"" Computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much. In conclusion, computers are hurting our society; clearly, they are unhealthy for our bodies. Also, the information on the computer's internet might be inaccurate. Lastly, we rely on computers too much, which leads to problems. I strongly believe we should reduce our dependence on computers! In order to maintain a healthy lifestyle and ensure accurate information, it is crucial to be cautious of the negative effects of excessive computer usage."
426	428	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, People spending time on the internet is a popular way for individuals to connect with one another. However, it can also lead to potential risks such as exposure to inappropriate content, interacting with strangers, or encountering online predators. Both children and adults use the internet, whether it's after school or work, for entertainment, socializing, or gaming. Statistics show that a significant number of children are more active online compared to adults due to their curiosity and interest in online content.  Many individuals claim to only spend a few minutes online, but in reality, they end up spending hours glued to their screens, impacting their relationships with family and friends. An expert from a local organization emphasizes the addictive nature of excessive internet use and the need to prioritize real-life interactions over virtual ones. Instead of being consumed by screens, people should engage in outdoor activities, spend time with loved ones, or simply enjoy nature.  Ultimately, nothing can replace the joy of spending quality time with friends and family. It's essential to strike a balance between online and offline activities to maintain healthy relationships and overall well-being. So, rather than succumbing to the allure of endless scrolling, step outside, and savor the moments that truly matter in life.
427	429	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, Computers are great tools and a crucial piece of modern technology that have become ubiquitous in today's society. Nearly @PERCENT1 of my classmates own computers, highlighting the widespread use of these devices. The popularity of computers can be attributed to their immense utility as a valuable learning resource and a means of staying connected with others.  One of the key advantages of computers is their efficiency in tasks such as work and school. They enable quick and easy communication through emails, saving time and effort compared to traditional methods like phone calls. Additionally, computers provide access to a wealth of information, making them indispensable for research and planning, such as finding affordable travel options during economic downturns.  Furthermore, computers serve as an invaluable tool for learning. Online resources offer real-time information and updated content, unlike outdated articles found in printed materials. The availability of online schools also makes education more accessible to those balancing work and study commitments, further emphasizing the educational benefits of computers.  Lastly, computers facilitate social connections by allowing individuals to communicate with friends and family through various platforms like email, social media, and instant messaging. This connectivity is particularly crucial for maintaining relationships with those who may not have access to phones or other communication devices.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in modern society as versatile tools that enhance productivity, facilitate learning, and foster social connections. Their continued integration into everyday life highlights their significance as a cornerstone of contemporary living.
428	430	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers and other technology are truly revolutionary in making our lives easier and more convenient. Despite some concerns about their impact on people, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Here are a few reasons why.  First and foremost, computers and technology have significantly streamlined various aspects of our daily routines. From online banking to shopping for groceries, the convenience they offer is unparalleled. Personally, I have experienced the ease of ordering party supplies online and having them delivered to my doorstep in no time, saving me from the hassle of waiting in long lines at stores. The efficiency and accessibility that technology provides are truly remarkable.  Additionally, staying connected with loved ones has never been easier or more cost-effective thanks to computers and the internet. With platforms like social media, video chat, and email, communicating with family and friends is just a click away, and often free of charge. I have personally found immense joy in being able to video chat with friends and family members, especially those who are far away. The ability to maintain strong relationships without the burden of expensive long-distance calls is truly a gift of modern technology.  Lastly, it all comes down to moderation and self-control when it comes to using computers and technology. By setting limits on screen time and being mindful of how we engage with these devices, we can prevent any potential negative effects on our well-being. My own experience with having a set schedule for computer usage, enforced by my mother, has shown me the importance of balancing technology with other activities.  In conclusion, the advantages of computers and technology in simplifying our lives, enhancing communication with loved ones, and promoting self-regulation are undeniable. With the right approach, we can fully enjoy the benefits that these advancements bring without succumbing to any potential pitfalls. Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
429	431	1	3	"Dear officials at the @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives? Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society. While others argue that they are very helpful. the use of computers has been taken to an extreme level, and is having a negative effect on the community. Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limit computers are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them. My last reason is that computers are the general health of people today. People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring! Firstly, computers are greatly changing the way people communicate. Instead of talking to people face-to-face, teenagers and adults find themselves texting or messaging their friends and colleagues. This is causing many bad habit forming. People are it more to talk to physically, and might even be using terms like ""LOL"" and ""BRB"" instead of words. This problem is causing a huge gap in the social interactions of humans, and is harming them more know! Secondly, the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelievable! If someone logged onto the computer to search a fact or research something, they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computer. This time could have been used for more productive things instead. A recent polls show that the average person from ages 18-65 spends over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite amazing, because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time. The amount of time wasted on computers is a huge problem that needs to change! Lastly, humans' health is being affected drastically by the use of computers. As the obesity rate is rising, these people are just sitting on their computers watching it go up. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors, but find themselves too busy on their computers to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on Facebook or Skype instead of outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep rising if these people don't realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society, rather than helping it. I feel this way because of the social disconnect it is creating among people, and the amount of time wasted on computers. Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are causing. If the average person tried to limit the time they use their computers, they would notice a positive change in their lifestyle!"
430	432	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say, ""@PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 spend @NUM1 hours or more on the computer daily."" The recommended time limit is @NUM2 hours. By spending excessive time on computers, people are neglecting important aspects of life. Firstly, extended computer use leads to a lack of physical activity, contributing to the prevalence of obesity and diabetes, affecting <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of @CAPS4. These health issues can be mitigated by incorporating exercise into daily routines, away from screens. Secondly, the beauty of nature is often overlooked when one is glued to a computer screen. Simple activities like visiting a park or observing wildlife can provide immense joy and tranquility, enhancing overall well-being. Lastly, the overreliance on computers hinders face-to-face interactions with loved ones, weakening social skills and relationships. It is crucial to strike a balance between technology and real-life connections. In conclusion, excessive computer usage poses various challenges to physical health, mental well-being, and interpersonal relationships. Taking breaks from screens and engaging in diverse experiences can lead to a more fulfilling and balanced lifestyle. Thank you for your time."
431	433	1	3	The amount of computer usage has been significantly growing over the years. Adults and children are spending huge amounts of their time on computers. Though these devices seem entertaining and helpful, that is not entirely true. Computers are being used for more than just work; they have become the new way of communication. While communication has always been a vital part of our lives, the rise of online communication through computers has brought about new challenges, especially in terms of safety and language use.  Online chat sites have made communication easier and more convenient for people, but they also pose dangers, especially for children who may not be aware of who they are talking to. The anonymity of the internet allows people to pretend to be someone else, leading to potential risks. Moreover, the informal nature of online communication can negatively impact language skills, as individuals may resort to using slang and shortcuts that are not conducive to proper grammar and spelling.  Furthermore, the excessive use of computers for communication has led to a decline in outdoor activities. Spending less time outside not only affects individual health but also harms the environment. People are less likely to engage in activities that benefit the planet, such as gardening, tree planting, or cleaning up the environment. By neglecting these actions, we are contributing to environmental degradation and a disconnect from nature.  It is essential to strike a balance between computer usage and outdoor activities to promote both personal well-being and environmental sustainability. Taking small steps, such as reducing screen time and engaging in outdoor tasks, can have a positive impact on both individuals and the planet. Let us remember that while computers are a valuable tool, our health and the health of the environment are irreplaceable. It is up to us to make conscious choices that benefit ourselves and the world around us.
432	434	1	3	I think we need our computers. If we don't have computers, we won't be able to connect with family members who live in another state or country. While texting is an option, not everyone has a phone, and calling can be costly. Having a computer allows us to stay in touch through email, especially when family members unexpectedly visit. It's also important for exercise and staying fit, as everyone needs to maintain their health. Additionally, computers are essential for sending holiday wishes or important messages to distant relatives. Despite concerns about spending too much time on computers, they remain a valuable tool for communication and staying connected with loved ones.
433	435	1	3	Most adults believe that computers are a waste of time and can be addictive or bad for health. While there are potential downsides, how you use a computer matters. One amazing aspect of computers is the ability to socialize with friends, family, or even strangers in a safe and harmless manner. This can help broaden your perspective and connect with people beyond your immediate surroundings. Additionally, computers enable us to stay in touch with loved ones who are far away, making distance feel less significant.   Furthermore, computers offer practical benefits such as accessing important information quickly and efficiently. For instance, forgetting homework at school is no longer a major issue as you can easily retrieve it online. Weather updates, breaking news, and even running a business from the comfort of your home are all made possible through computer technology.   Online banking has also revolutionized the way we manage our finances, saving us time and hassle. With just a few clicks, we can check our account details without the need to visit a physical bank. The convenience and efficiency that computers provide can greatly enhance our daily lives.  In conclusion, while there are concerns about the negative effects of excessive computer use, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. From social connections to practical tasks, computers have become an indispensable tool in today's society. Embracing and utilizing this technology wisely can greatly improve our quality of life.
434	436	1	3	"Dear Readers of the Local Newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advance in technology believe that computers have a positive affect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time in their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. I agree with those experts because many people take the computer serious and always want to be on. Though the users think there is nothing, negative about using the computers but there is. Such as increase light bill payment, obesity and like the experts said, "" time interacting with family and friends."" Also, excessive computer use can lead to poor posture and eye strain, as individuals are often hunched over and staring at screens for long periods. It can also contribute to social isolation, as individuals may prefer online interactions over face-to-face communication, leading to a lack of meaningful connections with others. In addition, excessive computer use can impact mental health, with studies showing a correlation between heavy computer use and increased stress, anxiety, and depression. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between utilizing technology for its benefits while also prioritizing physical activity, real-world social interactions, and mental well-being. In conclusion, while computers offer many advantages, it is essential to be mindful of the potential negative consequences of excessive use and strive for a healthy balance in our interactions with technology."
435	437	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects of computers are not good. Many people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising. People are on their computers so much that they don't enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with family and friends that much. I think that computers are becoming an issue. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in my school agree that they hardly exercise anymore because they are always on their computers. For example, @NUM3-year-old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym every day before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exercise. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatoes! I'm sure you don't want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didn't because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends, many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exercising. They are on so much they don't enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family. I think after reading this you can see computers aren't good. Let's all make an effort to balance our computer usage with outdoor activities and real-life social interactions for a healthier lifestyle.
436	438	1	3	Dear newspaper, People are spending too much time on their computers, neglecting exercise, nature, and valuable time with family and friends. This sedentary lifestyle is contributing to a rise in obesity rates, with many individuals missing out on the benefits of physical activity. Additionally, the constant focus on screens is disconnecting people from the beauty of nature and the importance of environmental conservation. By being glued to their devices, individuals are also sacrificing precious moments with loved ones, opting for virtual interactions over real-world connections. It is crucial for society to find a balance and prioritize health, nature, and relationships over excessive screen time. Let's encourage each other to step away from the computer and embrace a more active, nature-filled, and socially connected lifestyle.
437	439	1	3	What I am going to tell you could change the way you think about computers in general. People might say that computers are great to be on - they're fast, convenient, and provide access to a wealth of information. However, I believe that computers have negative implications as well. They can become addicting, leading to higher bills, less time spent with family, and potential dangers for teens and children.  Computers have become a source of addiction for many individuals, with a significant percentage of students spending most of their time online. This addiction can have financial consequences, as increased computer usage can result in higher electricity bills. Furthermore, the allure of instant messaging and online interactions can draw individuals away from spending quality time with their families. Research shows that people often prioritize computer usage over family interactions, leading to strained relationships.  Moreover, computers pose safety risks for teens and children. The anonymity of online interactions can expose them to potential dangers, such as encountering predators or falling victim to cyberbullying. The lack of supervision and monitoring can make children vulnerable to various forms of harm, both emotionally and physically.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential to recognize and address the negative impacts they can have on individuals and families. Striking a balance between technology usage and real-life interactions is crucial to maintain healthy relationships and ensure the safety of children and teens in today's digital age.
438	440	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people because, you could get obsessed with the computer. You could get in trouble, and it could affect your education. One reason I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people is because you could get obsessed with it. For example, if you were playing outside on a nice day and you called a friend and asked them to come over and they said no I can't @CAPS3 on the computer. You said why today's a nice day. Then your friend said @CAPS3 playing games. That's an example of being obsessed with a computer. Another reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because you could get in trouble. Getting in trouble online is bad because you could get sued or the owner of the website could delete it from your computer. Also if your parents found out you would be in even more trouble because then you would get grounded. That means you wouldn't be able to use the computer for a long time. My last reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because it could affect your education. If someone was on the computer too long instead of doing their homework that could affect their grades a lot. If you are in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and this happens you wouldn't be allowed to graduate and go to college. That is not a good thing if you are trying to get into a good college. Even though the computer is important in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 you still shouldn't be on it too long. In conclusion, everything I have said about why being on the computer too long is bad for you proves that too much computer is bad for people.
439	441	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper: Computers have become a major part of people's lives, but their effects are predominantly negative. Using computers can be incredibly time-consuming, with individuals often losing track of hours spent online. A recent poll revealed that a significant number of children reported feeling groggy and experiencing headaches after just two hours of computer use. This demonstrates the draining impact computers can have on one's time and well-being.  Moreover, computers are not always reliable, frequently malfunctioning and causing frustration for users. Dr. Smith from the Technology Institute highlighted that a considerable percentage of people's anger and frustration stems from computer failures. This unreliability can disrupt daily activities and lead to unnecessary stress.  Additionally, excessive computer use has been linked to various health issues, including obesity. Research indicates that a significant percentage of obesity cases are attributed to prolonged computer usage. Dr. Johnson emphasized that individuals who engage in physical activities instead of spending time on computers are generally healthier. Thus, the sedentary nature of computer use can have detrimental effects on one's well-being.  In conclusion, the negative impact of computers on individuals cannot be overlooked. The time-consuming nature, unreliability, and adverse health effects associated with computer usage highlight the need for moderation and balance in incorporating technology into daily life. It is crucial to be mindful of the drawbacks and prioritize overall well-being when utilizing computers.
440	442	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 one day being able to talk to anyone in the world by simple pushing a button. This has became possible with the computer. I support the advances in technology because a computer can help hand-eye coordination, it is easy to learn about faraway places or people, and the computer enables you to talk online. This is why I support the computer.  First, the computer benefits society because it develops hand-eye coordination. Did you know that nine out of ten people who use a computer have improved hand-eye coordination? Bill @CAPS2, creator of @ORGANIZATION1, stated, ""The keyboard is the most important part of the computer because it builds hand-eye coordination."" This reminds me of when I got my first computer and had no hand-eye coordination. Now, I can type with my eyes closed. I understand how you might think that computers cause people to not get enough exercise; however, the computer can improve your hand-eye coordination.   Next, I support the computer because you can learn about faraway places and people. Did you know that nineteen out of twenty students use a computer to learn about a place or a person? @PERSON3 stated, ""The way students study is much different than it used to be, @CAPS3 students use computers."" This reminds me of when I recently had a report to do on @PERSON1 and all I needed was my computer. I see how you @MONTH1 think that enjoying nature is important, intelligence is even more important. This is why the computer supports our society.  Finally, I support the computer because you can talk to the world instantly. Did you know that ninety-nine out of a hundred students talk online to stay in touch? @PERSON2, creator of @CAPS4, an instant messaging website, stated, ""There is no doubt that @CAPS4 is the easiest way to stay in touch with others."" This reminds me of when I went away on vacation and still stayed in touch with my friends through @CAPS4. I understand how exercise is essential for your body; however, talking with friends is important too. This is why I support the computer.  In conclusion, I support the computer because it supports hand-eye coordination, you can learn about faraway places and people, and you can communicate with people around the world. Now that you know why I support the computer, there should be no doubt that you will support it as well."
441	443	1	3	Dear @CAPS1,  I support the idea that computers have a positive effect on people because they provide a wealth of information and learning opportunities. One can explore various subjects such as sports, animals, history, and more with just a few clicks. Personally, I enjoy researching historical figures and pioneers who have made significant contributions to humanity.   Moreover, computers also help improve essential skills like typing speed and navigating through different websites. For instance, if someone needs to find a specific website to purchase furniture, having the ability to efficiently use a computer can be very beneficial.   Furthermore, computers make tasks like completing projects easier by providing access to vast amounts of information. For example, researching a historical event like the @CAPS2 revolution becomes much simpler with the resources available on the internet.  Additionally, computers aid in developing better communication skills through platforms like Facebook and @CAPS5. Social media allows individuals to connect with others and share information effortlessly.   Lastly, computers can also enhance reading skills as there is always something to read online, regardless of the topic. This constant exposure to written material can help individuals improve their reading abilities over time.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in enriching people's lives by offering a multitude of learning opportunities, improving essential skills, facilitating research, enhancing communication, and promoting reading skills.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
442	444	1	3	"Dear Newspaper,   ""Can a computer bring people together?"" It's a continuous subject that has sparked controversies and ideas. Senior scientist, @PERSON2, believes that computers can be used to help people connect with friends and long-distance relatives. According to @PERSON2, computers bring people together, whether it's with friends, families, or relatives from far countries. They also help with everyday needs like homework. People can do various things on a computer, including homework, finding a store, checking out traffic and weather, playing games, connecting with friends, learning recipes, and even keeping up with sports events. By creating a link all around the world, people can find out information about one another and learn what they are all about.   Large corporations find the internet and computer very useful. ""By using the internet, I can find willing participants in charities,"" says @PERSON4, a charity fundraiser in @LOCATION1. People can also share their products on sites like @CAPS6 and @CAPS7. Moreover, individuals like @PERSON1, the co-owner of The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, a duct @CAPS8 wallet company that also raises money for @LOCATION2, use computers to expand their business.   ""When will those who stay in the past realize the door to the future is open?"" questions @PERSON3, the successful owner of @ORGANIZATION1. By using computers, people can gather data from others and create new inventions to help the world. People can create detailed diagrams on a computer, send the data to a company, and potentially create innovations.   Computers are not just mere playthings; they are serious pieces of equipment that can benefit the world. While some may find downsides to computers, they will always be able to think of the positive aspects. Computers have the power to unite people, aid in education and business, and drive innovation. Let us embrace the potential of computers in bringing people together and advancing society.   Sincerely, [Your Name]"
443	445	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, In my opinion, I think we should use computers. The reason why I think we should use computers is that when we need help with something, we can easily find it on the computer. For example, if a student needs help with homework, they can simply search for the information on Google or visit websites like http.historywork.com for assistance.   Additionally, using computers is essential because it is often the only way to get in touch with someone. Through platforms like Gmail, Facebook, Yahoo, or Myspace, we can easily connect with friends and family members. These online communication tools have become crucial in our daily lives for staying connected with others.  Moreover, sometimes we are required to go online to check important messages or updates. For instance, if there is an urgent message on a website that requires our attention, accessing it through a computer is the most convenient way to stay informed and connected.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in our lives by providing access to information, facilitating communication, and enabling us to stay updated on important matters. Therefore, I believe that using computers is essential in our modern world.
444	446	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that people should cut down on using the computer. Just imagine, more people outside and healthy. Less ìcyberspaceî bullying, and less burning of electricity. My first reason why people should spend less time on the computer and more outside is because @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer more than two hours a day are either at risk of being overweight or are overweight. Also, @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says ì@CAPS2 people believe that using the computer gives you benefits, but they donít. They increase your chances of either being overweight or getting diseases such as diabetes. It's imperative that the community takes action to stop this from happening. In addition, my neighbor, @PERSON2 had to do a study to interview overweight adults and teenagers. @CAPS3 told me that @PERCENT2 of the @NUM1 people @CAPS3 interviewed said they donít go outside and use the computer for about @NUM2 hours a day! I implore the citizens of the @LOCATION1 area to cut down on internet time and go outside to enjoy nature. My second reason is the less people on the computer means less cyberspace bullying. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people that use socializing websites have experienced more than @NUM2 encounters of cyberbullying also my sister's friend, @PERSON3, overdosed on Advil so @CAPS3 ran commit suicide because of cyberbullying. Someone had said @CAPS3 was ugly, smelled and should ""go die in a hole."" @CAPS3 didn't tell anyone about this. Luckily her mother brought her to @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1 fast enough to be put on life support for @NUM6 hours. Furthermore, if people cut down on internet socializing websites then fewer people will be in danger of cyberbullying affecting their lives. It's excruciating imperative for people to use the computer for only @NUM7 or @NUM8 hours a day. My final reason is, the less time you use your computer the less money you would be wasting on electricity bills and spending more time on family vacations. Dr. @DR1, from the Peabody Museum in @LOCATION2 begs people to use less electricity and power on the internet so the environment can slowly rebuild itself to be what it was before technology and electricity were invented. In addition, @PERCENT3 of power used in today's homes is used on computers. Also, my grandmother is astounded by what today's technology is doing to the environment and the people behind this madness or electricity. @CAPS3 believes that the less time on the computer means more time on family vacations and with friends. Lastly, it's extremely imperative that people stop using computers as much to help their health, their self-esteem, and the environment. Let's take action to stop using computers @NUM9. Thank you for reading my paper."
445	447	1	3	Dear newspaper, In my opinion, computers definitely have a negative effect on people. People who use computers often spend less time exercising, as they prioritize their time on chatrooms and games rather than physical activity. This lack of exercise can lead to weight gain and health issues. A survey by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) revealed that a significant percentage of young people between ages @NUM3 are overweight due to excessive computer use. Even famous individuals like singer @PERSON2 have acknowledged the impact of computers on their weight, emphasizing the importance of balancing screen time with physical activity.  Moreover, the constant use of computers also distracts individuals from appreciating the beauty of nature. Many people are so engrossed in browsing the web that they fail to notice the wonders of the natural world around them. Research conducted by @ORGANIZATION1 showed that a large number of individuals, especially young ones, have never truly experienced the beauty of blooming flowers or the soothing smell of fresh rain. Renowned physician @PERSON4 has highlighted the detrimental effects of this disconnection from nature, emphasizing the importance of reconnecting with the environment for holistic growth and well-being.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can lead to detachment within families and among friends. Individuals who spend too much time on their screens often neglect meaningful interactions with their loved ones, causing rifts in relationships. Studies have shown that teenagers, in particular, are more likely to rebel and distance themselves from their families when consumed by computer activities. Talk-show host @PERSON3 has cautioned against the negative impact of computers on family dynamics, urging individuals to prioritize real-life connections over virtual ones.  In conclusion, it is evident that computers have a detrimental impact on people by reducing exercise time, disconnecting them from nature, and creating barriers within relationships. It is essential for individuals to strike a balance between screen time and real-world experiences to maintain physical health, appreciate the beauty of nature, and nurture strong relationships with family and friends. Let us all be mindful of the consequences of excessive computer use and strive to find harmony between technology and the world around us.

For the good things people are able to do research talk to people such as friends and family and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way to much time becomming distracted, you ignore your family without even knowing it and if you are just staring at a computer screen which can perminatly damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. Another good thing is that you have the capibility to talk to people such as friends and family. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. Thats what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can perminatly damage them. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem. These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people.  In conclusion, while computers offer immense benefits in terms of research, communication, and learning, it is essential to be mindful of the negative impact excessive screen time can have on our health and relationships. Balancing computer usage with other activities is crucial for maintaining overall well-being in this digital age.
449	451	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that people should be able to go on the computers and still be doing it. For a good reason such as communicating with far away relatives. Another reason is, if you need a @ORGANIZATION1 work-out or healthy eating tips, you can just print them out. And my last reason is if you're going on a far away trip but you don't know the way, you can just print out directions (@ORGANIZATION2). Say if you have a relative that lives all the way in @CAPS1 but you can't call them because you live all the way in the @LOCATION1 And if you call them, it'll cost you about @MONEY1 per minute. What you can do is you can contact them over the computer (webcam). And it's way better than just calling them because you can actually see them. Or if your on a business trip away from home, you can check upon your family. My second reason is, you can stay fit while being on the computer. You can look up @ORGANIZATION1 ""yoga"" poses. Or you can also do fitness lessons while watching them off of your computer. And if you're on a diet, you can look up @ORGANIZATION1 healthy recipes. You can also get @ORGANIZATION1 work-out equipment that'll make (or keep you), nice and slim. My last reason is that if you're going on a long journey away from home you need to now the way. But, what if you don't know the way? You can go on the internet and look up directions. And that is way better because at least you arent wasting money on a @MONEY2 @ORGANIZATION3. And it is more and quicker. And the best part is that you don't have to keep looking at the @ORGANIZATION3 and program stuff. With the maps on the computer, you can print it out and actually keep it. Those are all my reasons to why people should really go on computers. There are many things that a computer can do which is really good. You can communicate with relatives, stay fit/healthy while on the computer and getting maps. I hope that this opens up many peoples eyes. And maybe change a couple scientist's mind. Ultimately, the advantages of using computers for communication, fitness, and navigation are abundant and should not be overlooked."

451	453	1	3	Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. In the past, there have been more negative effects on individuals. According to a survey conducted by @CAPS2 magazine, it was found that a significant percentage of people, @PERCENT1, experience negative effects due to their computer usage.  In my opinion, computers have a detrimental impact on people. Firstly, individuals tend to spend less time interacting with their family and friends when engrossed in their computer activities. This lack of social interaction can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnect from loved ones. A survey from @CAPS3 @CAPS4 revealed that @PERCENT2 of people are often on their computers instead of engaging with those around them, leading to strained relationships and reduced quality time spent with family and friends.  Furthermore, excessive computer usage can result in individuals neglecting the beauty of nature. People who are constantly on their computers may miss out on the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors and appreciate the wonders of the natural world. It is essential for one's well-being to connect with nature, as it provides a sense of peace and tranquility that cannot be replicated through a screen.  Lastly, the sedentary nature of computer usage contributes to a decrease in physical activity among individuals. Many people spend prolonged hours sitting in front of their screens, leading to a lack of exercise and potential health issues. Dr. @DR1, a local doctor, has observed a rise in cases of obesity and a decline in physical fitness due to excessive computer usage. He emphasizes the importance of incorporating exercise into one's routine to maintain a healthy body and mind.  In conclusion, the negative effects of computer usage, such as decreased social interactions, limited exposure to nature, and reduced physical activity, highlight the need for individuals to strike a balance in their use of technology. It is crucial for people to prioritize real-life connections, appreciate the beauty of the natural world, and engage in regular exercise to ensure their overall well-being. The decision to limit computer usage ultimately rests in the hands of each individual, and it is important to consider the potential consequences of excessive screen time on one's health and relationships.
452	454	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, To start off, I would like to emphasize the importance of balancing computer usage with physical activity. While computers are a valuable tool for learning and entertainment, excessive screen time can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and potential health issues. It is crucial to make time for exercise and outdoor activities to maintain overall well-being.  Spending too much time on the computer can result in a lack of physical exercise, which can lead to weight gain and a higher risk of illness. It is essential to prioritize movement and fresh air to keep the body healthy and strong. Additionally, excessive screen time can contribute to social isolation and shyness in face-to-face interactions. It is important to engage in real-life social interactions to develop communication skills and build relationships.  In conclusion, while computers are a valuable tool, it is essential to balance screen time with physical activity and social interactions. Taking care of one's physical and mental health should be a priority, and incorporating exercise and outdoor activities into daily routines is crucial. Remember to prioritize well-being and make time for both screen time and real-world experiences. Thank you and have a great day.

456	458	1	3	Dear editor, I understand that some children and adults love going on the computer, but they donít know what the bad effects are. When your at a young age, anything can happen, while your on the computer, even worse things can happen. You could do bad things over the internet, won't exercise, or have time for your family. First of all, what I mean by bad things I mean, your child can go on bad websites, talk to strangers, or get harassed. When a child first gets, for example, a facebook account, most of the times the people who request them as a friend are unregistered child molesters and or sex offenders. They would probably act friendly to get the kid comfortable then they would end up kidnapping them. Also you could harass people or get harassed yourself. And you can go on inapropriate websites. Secondly, you act enough generation child I go outside basically, it all kids. Lastly, your child won't have family time. Now with more technology coming out like cellphones, and laptops; kids would rather hang out with their friends and not with the families. I could understand the whole cellphone thing but you need to make more time for your family. The reason I think going on the computers all the times not good because you can do bad things by talking to strangers, harrassment, and you can go on inappropriate websites. you won't get enough exercise and you can suffer from diabetes, high and childhood obesity. Lastly, you won't have enough family times mainly because of all of the new technology that has come out such as cellphones and laptops. In conclusion, it is important to be aware of the negative effects of excessive computer use, including the risks of engaging in inappropriate activities online, neglecting physical exercise, and sacrificing family time for screen time.

Plus, it's the start to a new improved future! Whether you use a computer to get the latest gossip or for a job, the computer is now an important part of people's lives. My mother works on the computer every day at her job, though it @MONTH1 not seem important to you, it is to my family, who needs the money for food and bills. Half of @LOCATION1 uses computers for jobs for money just like my family. Recently, @ORGANIZATION3, the computer company, took a survey to see how many people use the company for work. A whopping amount of @PERCENT1 use the computer for work. That @PERCENT1 of people benefit from using the computer.

Everyone says family is the most important thing, right? What can you do if they live far away? Well, you email, @CAPS5, @LOCATION2M, or @CAPS3, of course. Some experts @CAPS4, ""People are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family."" @CAPS5 is and was originally invented to keep in touch with family. So the experts have no reason to @CAPS4 that because people use the computer to keep in touch with families. Even people in the army use the computer to communicate. Using the computer isn't as bad as people think. Look out! The future is coming! New technology greater than my knowledge is coming. Computers were the start, and people haven't stopped since.

460	462	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, Technology has been advancing at a rapid rate for many years now making life much easier for everyday people. It helps out in many ways for example, to keep in touch with relatives, to learn new information and to keep you safe and updated. Computers are vital to everyday life and we need them. A huge purpose of computers is to keep in touch. With new programs like ""@CAPS2"" and ""@CAPS3"" and ""@CAPS4"", it leaves you with all sorts of new opportunities to keep in touch and have fun with your friends that were not previously available. Email as well, is a great tool to keep in touch with family that are far away opposed to the good old letter which might take a while in the mail. Another huge reason why we need computers today is to be able to research foreign places and learn facts that without a computer you would never even have heard of. With computers, it makes it possible to go online, look up the @ORGANIZATION1, research it and plan a flight there a week later. It is also a great tool to learn new things that you did not know previously. It is a huge step up in the education process. Computers also provide us with extreme safety and security as well as breaking news. Imagine how much simpler it would be to be able to be at home and go on the computer to check the best route home opposed not and consequently sitting in traffic. With modern-day technology, all that is possible. They add great safety and protection to average people like you and me. In conclusion, hopefully your mind has been changed on the topic of computers, or if you already were in support, that as well is great. Now you are being asked to spread the word about how great computers are and how vital they are to ensuring a better future. I understand that some people do not enjoy electronics but it is up to you to set them straight! Computers are great tools for moving ahead and we should cheer for them, not trash them."
461	463	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I've heard that some people think that computers do not benefit society. But I believe they do. Computers help us learn information of all types. It's a good source of entertainment. And last but not least, computers do not drastically change the time we use exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Computers are a great resource in our everyday lives so why not use what we were given. Google, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook. What would we do without them? They help us figure out small things like a quick and easy way to get rid of a stomach ache or a funny joke to tell at the office the next day while you are in the staff room drinking coffee. They also help us when we want to know what to do when your newborn has a cough and a small sneeze, you know the tough stuff. These are the kinds of things you need to know and not everyone goes out to the library every time you have a question. The information on the computers is endless, why not use it from learning a new language for the next vacation to finding help for that geometry homework that you just can't understand, the computer can do it all. Entertainment is everlasting on computers from the skateboarding dog on Youtube that you can't stop laughing at to the latest games on addictinggames.com. There will never be a dull moment. There are millions of videos and movies on Youtube. There are tons of games on the internet alone from Pacman to Scrabble, there's no way we'll have nothing to do. I always go on Skype to talk to family living too far to visit. Computers are one of the best sources of entertainment, they definitely benefit society. Computers definitely do not change the way we exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. On the computer, there are videos that show us new yoga moves and other ways to lose those extra pounds you gained over the days. There are sites to find where to go camping and have that family vacation you have always wanted. And we always make time to go see our family and friends. Computers don't keep us hypnotized. Without a doubt, computers benefit everyone's society. They are informational. They definitely entertain us all. And they don't turn us into mindless zombies so that we can't interact with other people. Computers are one of the most helpful things we have, and no one should think they aren't after reading this essay.
462	464	1	3	Dr. @DR1, The effects computers have on people and why people don't agree that this benefits society and some people use it to be online to talk to friends and family. Why people don't agree to use the computer. First, the computer can be used for everything, like visiting other places you want to explore. Additionally, if you need to work or attend a different school, sometimes it is necessary to use a computer. While computers can be costly, they are beneficial to have. Some argue that people are spending too much time on their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. For instance, families and friends who are not in the same location can stay connected by writing to each other online if they do not have cell phones or landlines. Moreover, individuals who wish to explore nature can use the computer to find new places to visit. One reason people should use computers is that they can engage in exercise through online platforms. Despite spending extensive time on computers, individuals can be productive by working on various projects and conducting research. Many find computers enjoyable. Ultimately, those who do not agree with using computers should give it a try to experience the benefits it can offer. In conclusion, the impact of computers on people varies, and while some embrace the advantages, others choose to limit their time spent online.

466	468	1	3	It is true that many people are spending more and more time on their computers, but it is important to remember the value of getting outside and engaging in physical activities. While computers offer a wide range of entertainment and communication options, there are also plenty of ways to enjoy the outdoors and stay active. Whether it's playing sports like football, basketball, or baseball, or finding a job that doesn't involve a computer, there are many opportunities to break away from screen time. Additionally, video games on gaming consoles can provide a different experience from computer usage and offer a fun alternative. Finding a balance between computer use and outdoor activities can lead to a healthier and more well-rounded lifestyle.
467	469	1	3	Computers are becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, offering convenience and efficiency in various tasks. However, alongside the benefits come negative consequences that we must address. One concerning issue is the sedentary lifestyle encouraged by excessive computer usage, leading to a rise in obesity among individuals, particularly children and teenagers. The allure of social media and online activities often keeps individuals indoors, foregoing physical exercise and healthy habits.  Furthermore, the online world presents a myriad of dangers, such as cyberbullying, identity theft, and exposure to online predators. These threats can have serious consequences, impacting mental health and overall well-being. Additionally, the easy access to misinformation on the internet can contribute to ignorance and misguided beliefs, influencing individuals, especially the youth.  It is crucial to acknowledge the downsides of excessive computer usage and take steps to mitigate these risks. Encouraging a balance between online activities and real-world interactions, promoting digital literacy, and fostering critical thinking skills can help individuals navigate the digital landscape more effectively. By addressing these challenges, we can harness the benefits of technology while safeguarding against its potential harms.
468	470	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, This letter I am writing to you is about how computers affect people. I am concerned about computer use in our society because people that spend too much time on the computer spend less time outdoors, exercising, and with family and friends. Let me tell you more about it...  As stated in the paragraph above, one reason I am concerned about computer use is that less time is spent outdoors. ""Everyone, young or old, should get outside for some fresh air for at least 30 minutes everyday,"" says health expert @PERSON2. Using the computer could limit this time, and that probably isn't healthy being in the house all day.  A second reason I worry about over-usage of computers relates to the first reason. Too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get everyday. ""People should exercise an hour a day to stay healthy,"" says health expert @PERSON1, ""however, 70% of people don't because of computers."" This happens often especially if you are playing a fun game with many levels. You plan to play for 30 minutes, but the 30 minutes turns into 60 minutes, which may even turn into an hour.  I know it may be hard to understand why I'm concerned about using computers, but I have one more reason. My final reason in this letter of why I don't like overusing computers is that it limits the time that can be spent with family and friends. How often can you see your family and friends on the computer using a webcam? But it's not the same as spending quality time. ""Friends come and go and you and your family won't live forever,"" says therapist @PERSON3, ""so make the best of what you have."" There won't be many memories if your eyes are glued to the computer screen.  As you can see, there are reasons why I am concerned about people spending time on the computer. There's less time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends. I hope you take this into consideration. Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, [Your Name]"

These skills are essential in today's digital world and can have a positive impact on our cognitive abilities.  Overall, the benefits of computers in society are clear. They streamline tasks, facilitate communication, and enhance learning opportunities for people of all ages. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that computers will play an even greater role in shaping our future.
470	472	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology majors support that the use of computers have a positive effect on people and I agree with them. I believe the use of computers are a necessity for social interaction, homework, research, and are a great source of entertainment on a rainy day. After a long day at school @CAPS1 teens go from the bus, to the front door, to their computer chair. In fact, @PERCENT1 of most teens do so. Odds are they're logging into Facebook, MySpace, Formspring, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, and other socially interactive websites. With good time management, I actually find these websites important. I think Facebook, e-mail, and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 (@CAPS5) are a great way to be socially interactive. It's also a great way to keep in touch with long-distance family or friends. I go to @DATE1 camp and have made friends I call my family. Some of them being across the ocean in @LOCATION2. Seeing as how I can't make long-distance calls which would cost way too much money, Facebook is a great alternative to keep in touch. @CAPS1 of my family also live far away. For example, my aunt, uncle, and cousin in @LOCATION1. My aunt just had a baby, meaning I have a new cousin whom I'm not able to see in person yet so seeing pictures on Facebook instead of spending money on envelopes, stamps, and picture prints is really awesome @CAPS1 homework given out in school requires a computer. Three out of five homework assignments are on the computer. Whether it be taking a twenty-question test or defining a word, the computer is a schoolwork necessity. In school now, many projects are assigned, meaning we need the computer and internet. We use PowerPoint and other Microsoft documents whether it be typing an essay or creating a PowerPoint slideshow. We need the internet for research to get the information we need to succeed. Aside from interacting with other humans and researching and typing, the computer holds many more wonders. Many people believe people are spending way too much time on the computer. While this @MONTH1 be true for some people, it is not true for @CAPS1. Many people are concerned children are becoming lazy but in a recent vote @NUM1 out of @NUM2 mothers said they'd rather see their children playing and interacting on the computer than being a couch potato and watching @CAPS6. On a rainy day, the computer can be a great alternative. You can slide in a @CAPS7 and watch a movie or play a game or even research something new and learn about it. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 @CAPS8 have at least two computers in the house for a reason. They're important to @CAPS1 people's everyday lives. The computer is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends. You also need the computer for school almost all the time and on a rainy day, it's a great alternative than being lazy and watching @CAPS6 while your eyes fall asleep. I do believe computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, the use of computers plays a crucial role in enhancing social interactions, academic pursuits, and providing entertainment, proving to be an essential aspect of modern life.
471	473	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,   I believe that the impact of computers on society can be both positive and negative. On the positive side, computers help educate people about different places and lifestyles, aiding law enforcement in their work, and improving typing skills. They also allow individuals to connect with others online, make friends, and complete tasks more efficiently, such as writing high school papers.  However, there are also negative aspects to consider. For instance, meeting unknown individuals online can be risky, as they may have criminal backgrounds or malicious intentions. Excessive time spent on computers can lead to neglect of physical activities and family obligations, as individuals may become engrossed in online interactions to the detriment of real-life connections and responsibilities.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is crucial for individuals to exercise caution and balance their online activities with real-world interactions and responsibilities to avoid potential negative consequences.
472	474	1	3	Using the computer for extended periods can lead to eye damage, potentially requiring glasses. Despite the risks, many people, including the population of @ORGANIZATION1, rely on computers for various tasks such as communicating with loved ones and playing games. The internet offers a wealth of information, from learning about presidents to exploring family histories. To protect your eyes, it is advisable to limit computer usage to short intervals of @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes. Remember to prioritize your eye health when using computers to prevent potential harm.
473	475	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, as technology continues to advance, the percentage of Americans using computers, particularly children aged from 10 to 18, is on the rise. While many teens use computers for socializing and gaming, there are concerns about cyberbullying and online safety. To address these issues, it is important to set limits on technology usage. Popular social networking sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and Facebook have become a major part of teens' lives, often replacing outdoor activities and exercise. It is essential to strike a balance and prioritize physical activity and face-to-face interactions over screen time.  Online gaming is another area of concern, as it can be addictive and non-educational. Instead of spending hours playing games, teens could be engaging in more productive activities like studying or socializing in person. Additionally, the risks of cyberbullying and interacting with strangers online highlight the need for parental supervision and limited computer use. Safety, health, and education are key considerations when it comes to managing technology usage among teens.  In conclusion, while technology offers many benefits, it is important to be mindful of the potential drawbacks, such as cyberbullying and excessive screen time. By setting limits on computer use, prioritizing physical activity, and promoting face-to-face interactions, we can help teens lead healthier and safer lives in the digital age.
474	476	1	3	I think computer has had a positive impact on people worldwide. It allows for various activities such as academic work, online communication, and research on famous individuals. Computers benefit society by aiding in academic tasks and facilitating online interactions. Personally, I benefit from using the computer by completing school assignments and chatting with friends. The ability to access information about famous people, like @PERSON1, is also a great advantage. Computers have become essential in our daily lives, offering opportunities to learn about different cultures and cuisines. Without computers, many technological advancements, such as cell phones and televisions, would not exist. Overall, computers play a crucial role in modern society, and their absence would lead to a significant loss in convenience and efficiency.
475	477	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, it is evident that the rise of addiction to technology, particularly computers, is a concerning issue in our society. Many individuals are becoming overly reliant on various aspects of the digital world, such as games, websites, and communication platforms. This addiction not only hinders their academic performance but also strains their relationships with family and friends.  Individuals who are addicted to the computer often neglect their physical health, leading to a sedentary lifestyle that can contribute to obesity. With the already alarming rates of obesity in @LOCATION1, this only adds to the existing problem. Furthermore, excessive time spent on the computer can result in social isolation, as individuals prioritize online interactions over real-life connections.  To combat this growing issue, it is crucial for individuals to prioritize spending time with friends and family, engage in regular physical activity, and limit their screen time. By striking a balance between technology use and real-world experiences, individuals can prevent the detrimental effects of computer addiction and lead healthier, more fulfilling lives. It is essential for society to address this issue and encourage a healthier relationship with technology to ensure the well-being of individuals.
476	478	1	3	"Computers are used everywhere, for thousands of different things. Many of us spend hours glued to our computer screen every day. Being very reliant on your computer is not always good for you. Too many people spend countless hours on their computers, rather than doing other activities. Therefore, computers are not the best way to spend your time because you get less exercise, your school grades can lower, and your communication skills will weaken.  First, when spending days on your keyboard you will have less time to run or play with your friends. In the modern world, many more people are becoming obese, creating unhealthy genes to be passed on. Perhaps a reason for this is that too many people can just sit on their laptops to shop, see movies, and even to get a college education. Less and less people go for walks because they would rather be on a computer or the internet. Without the constant use of computers, there would be more free time for people to get outside or play sports.  Secondly, many kids and teens are attached to their laptops, bringing them everywhere. So, rather than studying for their tests, they could be on social media or gaming websites. Many choose to go online rather than opening their books. Plus, spending so many hours on a computer means less time to do homework, resulting in incomplete assignments. Computers take away time that could be used towards getting a college education, which is a wasted opportunity.  Lastly, why talk on the phone or in person when you can just send an e-mail or chat online? Many people nowadays are staying inside on their laptops to communicate rather than doing it face to face. This can cause a lack of communication skills; something that might sound good online could sound absolutely terrible in the ""real"" world. This loss of skill could lead to a generation more inclined towards cyber communication rather than face-to-face interactions.  In conclusion, why spend so many hours on the computer when you could be outside or hanging out with friends? Personally, I'd prefer to go and do something rather than being stuck inside on a computer."
477	479	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some people are debating whether advances in technology, such as computers, are beneficial to our daily life. I think that computers are a good addition to life for a few reasons. For one, information and knowledge are at your fingertips. It takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to. Email, social media, online shopping, etc. can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous. New friends can be made every day. Lastly, there can be limits set so no more worrying about too much time spent on the computers. One of the reasons computers can be beneficial to our daily life is what it can give us. Knowledge is just seconds away. Anything you might be interested in learning is all on the web. Homework, school projects, and even work need information that isn't found anywhere else. The library is a great place to find what you're looking for, but if you're in a hurry and need what you're looking for quick, there is the online encyclopedia, World Book, etc. Technology is becoming a huge part of our life today, many opinions are up in the air about it. If there's one thing everyone can agree on, it's fast and can make daily tasks easier. Ordering clothes, books, movies, tickets for trips and more all can be done online. That's not all the computer has to offer. Friends/family are a necessary part of life, but they're not always living right around the corner. They may live on the other side of the state, country, even world! Social media, email, etc. can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at any time. Email has been around longer than other websites like social media platforms which allow you to keep daily tabs on them. Video calls or instant messaging allows you to instantly talk to anybody that you want. These websites can't replace being together in person, but they can help keep in touch for the meanwhile. Some are worried about spending too much time face to face with the screen, there is even something to prevent that. Time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem. Not enough exercise or time spent outside can be unhealthy. Time limits can fix this problem. A certain amount of time can be plugged in. When there's 10 minutes left, it gives you a warning. That way more time can be spent outside in the open, and less inside staring at the screen all day. Many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared. I believe they're a beneficial part of our life. They allow you information at the touch of your fingers, access to friends/family, plus there's time limits. In this day and age, the computer is something we can't live without.
478	480	1	3	Do you really think computers have a positive impact? Don't you think way too many people are on their computers for too long? I believe that computers have a detrimental effect on individuals. When people spend extended periods on the computer, it can lead to headaches and eye strain, whereas being outside allows for exercise and fresh air. Additionally, addictions to social media platforms like Facebook, Myspace, and Formspring can develop, taking away time that could be spent on more productive activities. Furthermore, staring at a computer screen for extended periods can result in eye damage, as I experienced in sixth grade when I needed glasses due to excessive computer usage. Ultimately, I believe that computers are a waste of time and prevent individuals from engaging in more meaningful activities such as spending time with friends and family or participating in outdoor pursuits. Instead of being glued to the computer, I suggest joining a sports club or engaging in other physical activities. It is essential to address the issue of excessive computer usage by creating more opportunities for people to participate in real-world activities. In conclusion, computers have a negative impact on individuals, and it is crucial to find a balance between screen time and real-life experiences.
479	481	1	3	"Dear newspaper, I have heard you are creating an article on if computers are helpful or non helpful to society. I find computers as a great addition to society because they play a big role in jobs around the country and in addition display accessible information to the public. Imagine how computers have helped shape the world, do you want to give this blessing up? Computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world. Just think of a sales person for instance. Sales people need their computer to store data, like on spreadsheets. By the way a study was put into place by the Department of Labor to find out how many jobs find it necessary to have computers, and the results showed that 80% of jobs in the United States need to use computers. Dr. Smith, a computer programmer at Top Industries, mentioned on the National News Network that ""computers show up sometime in everyone's life whether they like it or not, especially in jobs"". If you think about it, people that work with computers have less trouble calculating or storing data than citizens without computers. Just think of computers this way a helping brain for those who work hard. Students love having access with information around the world. I bet that 90% of people would agree with me, don't you think? Students around the world for example in May need to research information for a topic in class. A teacher at Oakwood High School in California mentioned that, ""I prefer using the internet for research in my class. It's much more fast than looking through books, and people around the earth place opinions online instead of a book with a few authors."" Last day John was in the library with the rest of his class, assigned to researching his topic in a book. He read five books and only got a half of a page of notes for his assignment. The following day he was allowed to work on the school computer and got three pages of notes. ""I was so relieved to log on to the internet"", John reported to me. A survey was set up by the Education foundation to see if students prefer computers over books and 75% said yes. Do you want students of all ages to participate in researching on the machine they favor most? Well I dearly hope your answer benefits the children in America. From young students to adults, computers have become a favorite machine in modern day technology. Computers are a magnificent part of society. In May, I remind you that computers benefit many jobs in the United States and in addition aid students by showing information about everything there is to know. I sincerely hope you share my feelings about this matter. What is your vision on computers today?"
480	482	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of Newspaper, @CAPS2 has been brought up to concern that computers are a menace to society. However, computers are actually very helpful in many ways. For starters, they can assist with finding directions to a place or provide guidance on how to do something. With detailed maps and instructional videos, computers make it easier for people to navigate unfamiliar routes and learn new skills.  Moreover, computers are beneficial for improving reading skills and hand-eye coordination. Many Americans struggle with reading, but computers offer a platform for practicing and honing these skills. Additionally, tasks like typing essays or playing games can enhance hand-eye coordination, making everyday activities smoother and more efficient.  Lastly, computers provide entertainment for people of all ages. From online games to funny videos on platforms like YouTube, computers offer a wide range of enjoyable activities. Overall, it is evident that computers play a crucial role in modern society, offering assistance, skill development, and entertainment.
481	483	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, The effects computers have on society is a mixture of positive use and negative use. Getting tired and lazy is a negative use of the computer. When you are on the computer for more than @NUM1 minutes, you start to get lazy and not wanting to get up. That affects a lot of people @DATE1 because many individuals are using computers for work and end up feeling lethargic. Children may also become lazier, preferring to sit on the computer rather than engage in physical activities after school. Limiting computer time can benefit both kids and adults, preventing fatigue and promoting overall well-being.  Moreover, excessive computer use can lead to decreased social interaction. Adults, engrossed in their screens for work or personal tasks, may neglect spending time with family members. It is important to find a balance and prioritize personal connections over screen time. However, communication tools like email, chat, and social media platforms play a crucial role in connecting individuals who may not have access to phones or face-to-face interactions. These technological advancements facilitate convenient and efficient communication, enhancing relationships and fostering connections.  While computers offer numerous advantages in communication and productivity, it is essential to recognize and address the negative impacts they can have on personal well-being and relationships. By striking a balance between screen time and real-world interactions, individuals can maximize the benefits of technology while maintaining meaningful connections with those around them.
482	484	1	3	Although most people would argue that the invention of computers has been a positive development, I have a different perspective. One of the main drawbacks of computers is the access they provide to the internet, which can be a source of inappropriate content. The internet is filled with images and text that are not suitable for all audiences, posing a risk to users, especially children. Moreover, there is a lack of clear identification online, making it difficult to verify the age or intentions of individuals one may encounter on social media platforms or websites.  In addition, online gaming has become a significant issue, leading to sedentary lifestyles and contributing to the rising rates of obesity among children and adults. Furthermore, excessive gaming can lead to addiction, causing individuals to neglect their responsibilities and relationships. The strain on the eyes from prolonged screen time is another health concern associated with computer use.  Furthermore, the internet is a breeding ground for illegal activities, such as bomb-making instructions and music piracy. These platforms enable individuals to engage in criminal behavior without facing repercussions, posing a threat to society as a whole.  In conclusion, while computers have revolutionized the way we access information, their negative impacts cannot be overlooked. From inappropriate content to health concerns and illegal activities, the dark side of computer usage raises significant concerns about the safety and well-being of individuals in the digital age.
483	485	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people. Computers have caused problems where kids do not engage in physical activity, depriving them of the exercise they need. Additionally, children spend excessive time on computers, missing out on the joys of outdoor activities. Another downside of computers is that they can hinder quality time spent with family and friends. It is important to strike a balance between screen time and real-life interactions. Regular exercise, outdoor play, and socializing are essential for overall well-being. So, it's crucial for individuals to limit computer use and prioritize activities that promote physical health and strengthen relationships. By finding a healthy balance, we can enjoy the best of both worlds and lead a fulfilling life.
484	486	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2,  Computers have undoubtedly revolutionized the way we live our lives, providing us with convenience and efficiency like never before. However, it is essential to consider the potential drawbacks of excessive reliance on technology. One significant concern is the impact on our physical health. The sedentary lifestyle that often accompanies computer use can lead to obesity and other health issues. Lack of exercise and outdoor activities can have detrimental effects on our overall well-being.  Moreover, the excessive time spent on computers can also affect our relationships with friends and family. While technology allows us to connect with others virtually, it is crucial not to neglect the importance of face-to-face interactions and quality time spent with loved ones. Building strong relationships and creating lasting memories require genuine human connection, which cannot be fully replaced by digital communication.  It is essential to strike a balance between the benefits of technology and the need for a healthy and fulfilling life outside of the virtual world. By prioritizing physical activity, spending quality time with family and friends, and being mindful of the impact of excessive computer use, we can ensure a more balanced and meaningful existence.  In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly changed the way we live, it is crucial to remember the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, nurturing relationships, and engaging with the world around us. Let us embrace technology as a tool to enhance our lives, rather than allowing it to dominate and detract from the richness of human experience.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
485	487	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think some people are overreacting when it comes to the use of computers. It's not as harmful as some make it out to be. While it's important not to spend excessive amounts of time on the computer, it's also not the end of the world. People can still interact with family and friends, even if it's done through typing rather than speaking face-to-face. The warnings about the dangers of excessive computer use are similar to warnings about global warming - often given, but not always heeded.  Furthermore, it's important to note that a computer itself cannot physically harm you. While spending too much time on it may lead to issues like obesity and boredom, it's unlikely to be life-threatening. Personally, I find that extended computer use gives me headaches, so I naturally limit my time on it.   Lastly, it's worth mentioning that computers are now a ubiquitous part of everyday life. Almost everyone has access to a computer, whether for social media, gaming, or other purposes. Platforms like Facebook are especially popular, with a wide range of users, including older generations like my mom.  In conclusion, while it's essential to be mindful of the time spent on computers and the potential health risks, it's also important not to overreact. Computers are simply tools that can be used responsibly for various purposes.
486	488	1	3	Computers have little to no effect on people. In fact, computers help us out a lot. They assist us in finding information, conducting medical research, and predicting weather patterns. While some may use computers for entertainment purposes, there are more advanced machines that scientists utilize for their research. Overall, computers have a positive impact on our lives by simplifying tasks and providing easy access to information. Despite concerns about excessive computer use, as long as individuals maintain a balance between screen time and other activities like exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with friends and family, there is no need to worry about the effects of computers on our daily lives. In conclusion, computers play a valuable role in making our lives easier and more efficient without significantly impacting our overall well-being.
487	489	1	3	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 I can see both sides of your argument, on whether computers are important. However, computers have revolutionized the way we live our lives. Just for a moment, think what would the world be like without computers. I feel that computers are an important aspect of our lives. Computers are especially important to students and teachers. For instance, if a student needed to do a report on @LOCATION1, he could look up facts and other things on @LOCATION1, then condense the facts into a paragraph on a word document, and if he had a question he could email his teachers. Finally, he could print out the finished report. All that, without having to get up and bother his parents to go to the bookstore and pay @NUM1 on a book that he will probably read one time. Also, if he had a question there would be no communication outside of school. Another example of students using computers is online textbooks, which spares them of lugging heavy textbooks home. Because I know computers have helped me in school and made work much easier.   Secondly, @PERCENT1 of businesses say that they use computers daily, and some agree that without computers, their businesses would fail. Computers make business much easier, especially with the business managing and file-keeping programs that are available. On a computer, businesses can store customer information, compare income, and keep stock of inventory without having a cluttered pile or file cabinet. Computers can also save businesses money because they can cut out jobs such as record-keeping. Also, businesses can save time by having meetings via webcams instead of having people drive from state to state for one meeting then do it the next month and the month after; they could email important things such as sales projections and other information as well.   Computers are also important and helpful in the home. People can do grocery shopping from home, order pizza online, and go shopping online. Also, people can pay their bills online which saves paper. Let's say a mother has a sick child and she wants to know how to heal him, what to feed him, and what medicine to give him. She can look all this up on the computer and bookmark the websites for next time. Then her other child comes home, and she wants to find a healthy snack. She can find which she can do online. Next, she wants to make chicken fried rice, but she doesn't know how, she can look up the recipe online. Finally, after dinner, she needs to clean a stain on the carpet but it won't come out so she buys a carpet cleaner from the web. Computers have just made her day so much easier. Without computers, our lives would be much harder. If we didn't have computers, the person who needed a report on @LOCATION1 would have failed, the sick child would not, the hungry child would have been fed unhealthy food, and @MONTH1 would fail. Computers are an important aspect of our lives and have greatly enhanced our daily routines.
488	490	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you know someone who lives far away from you? Or have you ever used @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3? These are just a few of the techniques that computers offer. Computers have greatly benefited society by making various tasks easier for people. For instance, computers enable us to communicate with others, play games that enhance skills, and provide visual content that is both informative and entertaining.  Communication has been made more convenient through computers, allowing people to interact without the need for face-to-face contact. Whether through emails or online chats, staying connected with friends and family, regardless of distance, has become effortless. Personally, I have found it convenient to communicate with a friend in @LOCATION1 and recently sent an email to my aunt thanks to the ease of using computers.  Moreover, computer games are not just sources of entertainment but also valuable tools for developing skills. For example, typing games can improve typing speed and accuracy, while strategy games enhance critical thinking and decision-making abilities. These games can simulate real-life scenarios, preparing individuals to react quickly and think ahead in various situations.  Additionally, computers offer visual content through platforms like @ORGANIZATION2, making information more accessible and engaging. Whether it is for educational purposes or entertainment, the use of images and multimedia on computers enhances the overall user experience, simplifying complex concepts and making learning more enjoyable.  In conclusion, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate, learn, and entertain ourselves. Through their various functions and capabilities, computers have become indispensable tools in our daily lives, bringing people closer together and enhancing our skills and knowledge in diverse ways.
489	491	1	3	Dear @CAPS1,  It is evident that the increasing use of computers is a trend that cannot be ignored. However, the question arises whether this trend is ultimately beneficial or detrimental to individuals. In my opinion, I agree with the notion that excessive computer usage can have negative impacts on one's health and well-being.  One of the primary concerns associated with spending excessive time on computers is the detrimental effect it has on physical activity. People are spending more time in front of screens and less time engaging in activities that promote physical fitness, such as exercising or enjoying the outdoors. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to a host of health issues, including obesity and diabetes, as exemplified by the unfortunate experience of a family member who neglected his health in favor of prolonged computer usage.  Moreover, excessive computer use can also hinder social interactions and personal relationships. By isolating oneself behind a screen, individuals may miss out on valuable opportunities to connect with family and friends, as well as appreciate the beauty of nature. This was exemplified by a friend who preferred the virtual world over the real one, to the extent that even stepping outside became a daunting task.  In conclusion, while computers undoubtedly offer numerous benefits, it is essential to strike a balance and not let their usage overshadow other aspects of life. Prioritizing physical activity, social interactions, and time spent in nature is crucial for maintaining overall well-being. It is imperative to be mindful of the potential negative consequences of excessive computer usage and make conscious efforts to incorporate a diverse range of activities into one's routine for a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle.  Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
490	492	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I heard your discussion about whether computers are a good or bad thing, and I have to say that I believe they are more of a negative influence. One significant reason for my perspective is that computers contribute to a lack of physical activity among children. Instead of playing outside and staying active, many kids spend hours sitting in front of a screen, which can lead to health issues like obesity. Additionally, there is a concerning issue of inappropriate content being accessed on computers. Despite efforts to block such material, some individuals still manage to engage in harmful and inappropriate online activities. This poses a threat to the safety and well-being of users, especially young children who may be exposed to harmful content. Lastly, there is a risk of sharing too much personal information online, which can result in dangerous situations such as identity theft or online predators. In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is important to consider the negative impacts they can have on individuals and society. It is crucial to be mindful of how we use technology and to prioritize safety and well-being when engaging with it.
491	493	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers benefit society in various ways. One of the main advantages is the speed and ease of communication, such as through email, which allows for quick exchanges of information without the need for lengthy phone calls. Additionally, computers provide a vast amount of information at our fingertips, making tasks like research for trips or school projects much more efficient. They also play a crucial role in various professional fields, from architecture to healthcare, by enabling tasks like creating digital designs or storing important data. Without computers, many aspects of modern life would be much more challenging and limited. Overall, computers are essential for enhancing communication, productivity, and access to information, ultimately contributing to the advancement of society.
492	494	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 generation has grown up with the complex technology called computers. I have learned over the years of using them, that they aren't as helpful as they seem. They can cause an addiction, and create numerous distractions. First of all, many doctors say that computers cause ""the new depression."" The internet is where most of this takes place though. For most teenagers, having a Facebook, MySpace, or Formspring is not unusual. I know from personal experiences, that some people abuse these social networks and use them as another way to bully people. So therefore, not only do you get made fun of in school, but now, people can make fun of you in cyberspace. This is the main reason that people become socially depressed. There is almost no way to escape it and all of their anxiety really starts to get to them. Addiction to computers is also a very negative impact. Many people go on the internet and are so fascinated that, that is how they spend their free time. About @PERCENT1 of people say that they are addicted. From @CAPS1 experience with using the internet, I know that there is always something that pulls you back in. You know that you are an addict when you spend more than an hour a day on the computer. Parents always say that it is a self-control issue but many adults have the same problem. They have just started to be able to use the computers, so many times they go through a phase of addiction. Furthermore, this addiction problem would be totally gotten rid of if we stopped using computers. Finally, computers also create many distractions for students. When students sit down to type their papers they also, many times, have another tab open at the same time. Therefore, they are getting barely any work done. Social networks only make this even worse. Constantly chatting with someone can cause you to lose track of time. Also, when you try to multitask with the internet, it causes grades to go down or not complete homework on time. All in all, this is an issue that can be easily avoided by eliminating computers. In conclusion, computers do not help us. They cause social depression, which causes people to have anxiety problems. They cause addiction, which ends up taking over people's lives. They create distractions that make concentrating hard. I feel that computers have negative effects and they should be gotten rid of completely!"
493	495	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, did you know that every 1 out of 3 obese children spend 3 or more hours a day on a computer? Computers may be fast and convenient, but they are contributing to our country being one of the most obese countries in the world. Computers keep people from enjoying nature, spending quality time with their families, and getting enough exercise.  Firstly, spending too much time on a computer prevents people from enjoying the beauty of nature. With forests being destroyed and pollution on the rise, it is essential for people to connect with the natural world to understand the importance of conservation.  Secondly, excessive computer use leads to isolation as people tend to stay indoors for extended periods. This lack of social interaction can result in individuals becoming antisocial and forgetting how to engage with others, ultimately leading to a decline in societal bonds.  Lastly, excessive computer use takes away time that could be spent with family and friends, potentially leading to strained relationships or even abandonment. Furthermore, it can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle as individuals neglect physical activity, increasing the risk of obesity and related health issues.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between screen time and real-world experiences. Prioritizing time spent outdoors, with loved ones, and engaging in physical activity is vital for overall well-being and a healthier society.
494	496	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you want your children to spend all their time on the computer? I believe that this can have detrimental effects on their well-being and relationships.   Firstly, excessive computer use can lead to a lack of family time. When individuals are glued to their screens, they may neglect spending quality time with their loved ones. This can result in feelings of isolation and disconnection within the family unit.   Moreover, prolonged periods of computer use can contribute to poor physical health. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of individuals who spend a lot of time online do not engage in regular exercise. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to health issues such as obesity, as seen in cases where individuals have gained excess weight due to their computer habits.   Additionally, the obsession with computers and internet usage can impact children's academic performance. Many students are using computer language in their schoolwork, which may hinder their ability to communicate effectively in traditional settings. Furthermore, the constant access to social media platforms on smartphones can be distracting and detrimental to their academic focus.   In conclusion, it is important to strike a balance between computer usage and other activities to ensure the well-being of individuals, especially children. Excessive screen time can lead to a lack of family bonding, health issues, and academic challenges. Parents and guardians should monitor and limit their children's computer use to promote a healthier and more balanced lifestyle.
495	497	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers are having a significant impact on people's lives. More and more individuals are becoming engrossed in the capabilities of computers, often neglecting essential aspects of life. Instead of prioritizing activities like exercise and spending time with loved ones, many are spending excessive amounts of time on their computers. This sedentary behavior is contributing to rising rates of obesity and other health issues, particularly among young people.  In addition to the physical health implications, excessive computer use is also affecting individuals' mental and social well-being. People are becoming increasingly disconnected from the world around them, as they spend hours in front of screens rather than engaging in meaningful interactions with friends and family. While computers can provide access to information, the reliability of online sources is often questionable, leading to misinformation and potential academic setbacks.  It is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between utilizing computers for information and entertainment and engaging in real-world experiences. Prioritizing physical activity, face-to-face social interactions, and quality time with loved ones is essential for overall well-being. By taking a step back from screens and embracing all that life has to offer, individuals can cultivate a more fulfilling and enriching existence.  In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, it is important for individuals to be mindful of their usage and prioritize activities that promote physical, mental, and social health. Finding a balance between technology and real-world experiences is key to leading a balanced and fulfilling life.
496	498	1	3	To whom it may concern at the school board, parents, and community members, computers play a crucial role in our society. Imagine a world without computers where drivers struggle to focus on the road, communication is limited, and students lack access to educational resources. Computers are essential for teaching hand-eye coordination, enabling communication with others worldwide, and facilitating learning from the comfort of one's home.   Firstly, computers are vital for teaching hand-eye coordination, especially in young children. Studies have shown that activities like video games and using computer mice help develop the brain's ability to work in sync with the body, improving motor skills. This coordination is not only beneficial for driving but also for various professions that require precision and dexterity. Without computer-based activities, many job opportunities could be out of reach for individuals lacking these essential skills.  Additionally, computers are indispensable for communication, offering various platforms like email, social networking sites, and instant messaging. These tools allow people to connect with others globally, fostering relationships and collaboration. In today's digital age, parents even prefer their teens to communicate online as it reduces phone bills and provides a convenient way to stay in touch. The ability to communicate effectively through computers is a valuable skill in a connected world.  Furthermore, computers are essential for education, providing access to online resources, e-books, and research materials. Students rely on computers for completing homework, accessing study materials, and conducting research. The internet serves as a valuable learning tool, enhancing the educational experience and expanding opportunities for students to explore new topics and ideas. Embracing technology in education is crucial for preparing students for success in a digital society.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing coordination, communication, and education in our society. Their impact is overwhelmingly positive, benefiting individuals and society as a whole. Embracing technology and integrating computers into various aspects of our lives is essential for progress and development in the modern world.
497	499	1	3	A lot of people use computers in present day. It allows family and friends to interact with each other, research places and ideas, and lets you type a document to look neat. On the other hand, computer technology prevents people from being active, exploring nature, and talking to family and friends in person. Personally, I love computers. I spend a lot of time on @CAPS3, because it lets me talk to friends I sometimes don't get to see. I can even see how my cousin in @LOCATION1 is doing. Computers also help me out with homework. For projects on a subject that I don't totally understand, I can just hop on my laptop, search what I need, and @CAPS1!, I have my information. Then after that I can type up my report and even pick out a couple of pictures to print out, see? Computers are bangin! But I can understand the other side of the issue. Computers can be time-consuming. I can admit that I've spent hours at a time on the computer. This has become a problem. Experts say that people are starting to spend too much time on the computer and less time in the real world. A perfect example is my brother. He loves the @CAPS2. My mom will call him down for dinner and he'll be too engrossed in what he's doing that he will skip the meal. His friends will call him and he'll blow them off until he finishes his game. I agree that people should not spend so much time on the computer. You have probably read this and thought to yourself. Well? How does she feel about it? I can honestly say, I was supposed to choose one. But here's the thing. I like my laptop. I'm addicted to @CAPS3, But, I still play sports, I talk to my family, and I even like to take walks through the words or on the beach. I am neutral, like @CAPS4 from @CAPS5. Scientists say computers have a positive effect on people. Some experts say they're concerned computers have a negative effect on people. @PERSON1 says they are both right. Computers are wonderful. They are one of the most growing technologies in our world. But we don't need to spend @CAPS6 of our time on them. I hope you understand my point on this issue. Remember, finding a balance between technology and real-world experiences is key to a fulfilling life.
498	500	1	3	Dear local newspaper,  I agree that technology has a positive effect on people. Just like other electronic devices, computers can help improve hand-eye coordination. Additionally, teachers can utilize computers to access information for educational purposes, such as history and geography. Moreover, computers provide a means for people to connect with family and friends who may be far away. Overall, computers play a significant role in enhancing various aspects of society.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
499	501	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that the increasing use of computers is detrimental to individuals in several ways. Firstly, despite the growing reliance on computers, it is essential to question the benefits they provide. Instead of enhancing productivity, computers often lead to laziness and a decrease in overall efficiency. This addiction to technology can also strain family relationships, as seen in my own experience with my mother's excessive use of social media platforms.   Moreover, the excessive time spent on computers is directly impacting physical health. People are prioritizing screen time over exercise, leading to a rise in obesity rates. This sedentary lifestyle, combined with unhealthy eating habits often associated with computer use, results in detrimental effects on one's appearance and well-being.   Lastly, excessive computer use can lead to a disconnect within families. As individuals spend more time online, they neglect quality time with their loved ones, resulting in strained relationships and negative influences on younger family members.   In conclusion, the pervasive use of computers is not as beneficial as it may seem. It promotes laziness, hinders physical health, and strains family bonds. It is crucial for individuals to reevaluate their priorities and find a balance between technology use and personal well-being.
500	502	1	3	Dear local newspaper,  Some people are starting to believe that computers are having a negative impact on individuals, leading to addiction and a lack of productivity. One reason for this is that some individuals spend excessive amounts of time studying or working on the computer. They may come home from school or work and immediately immerse themselves in the digital world, staying online until late at night and continuing the same pattern the next day.  Furthermore, computers can become addictive, causing individuals to prioritize online activities over real-life interactions with friends and family. The constant stimulation and instant gratification that computers provide can make it difficult for individuals to tear themselves away from the screen.  Another issue is that people may become sedentary while using computers for extended periods, leading to a lack of physical activity. This can have negative effects on both physical and mental health, contributing to a sedentary lifestyle that can lead to various health problems.  In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly revolutionized the way we live and work, it is essential for individuals to maintain a healthy balance and not let technology consume their lives. It is crucial to take breaks, engage in physical activity, and prioritize real-life relationships to prevent the negative effects of excessive computer use.
501	503	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that there is nothing wrong with being on the computer. The computer, in my opinion, serves as a valuable tool for learning about new technology, such as games that can be educational and websites that offer valuable information. Additionally, using the computer allows for communication with people you may have lost touch with, making it easier to reconnect without needing their contact information.  I think that utilizing a computer can enhance intelligence because it provides access to a wealth of knowledge. It is important to note that individuals who use computers are not constantly glued to the screen; they engage in various activities like spending time with loved ones, exercising, eating, or completing tasks like homework. The computer can be considered a healthy choice as it complements one's daily routine rather than detracting from it.  Moreover, using a computer can have physical benefits, such as strengthening the muscles in the hands and lower arms through constant movement. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers contribute positively to one's overall well-being as long as they are used in moderation and balanced with other activities. It is essential to integrate computer usage into a well-rounded lifestyle to maximize its benefits without compromising other aspects of daily life.
502	504	1	3	"Click, click, click, ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2 no, your computer froe, what are you going to do now? Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches you information, you can socialize, and you can improve your skills. Without a computer, you'd be hopeless. Have you ever needed to do a research project, but don't have access to go to your local town library? No problem, @CAPS3 you have a computer at home. You could just sit down type in a few things, and get all the information you need, and more! You can research just about anything on everything, because the computer will have it. Maybe you want to learn something new, but there aren't many books on it, well there you go, the computer is your friend. Many people assume that computers are just for entertainment, to play games and have fun on your free time. What they don't know is all the research engines like google, netrekker, @LOCATION1,etc. All loaded with knowledgable information. Some people sit at home and read to become smarter, right? You can do this with computer, which would probably even be more entertaining than a boring ad book from the library. Have you ever thought to yourself ""the computer is just a way for people to get away from everyone else, and just have time to yourself?"" @CAPS3 you thought that way, you thought wrong! There are many ways to socialize with others through the computer such as e-mail, instant messaging, video chatting, etc. There are various ways to communicate with people through the computer. It is amazing technology because even @CAPS3 someone is in a different country, you can communicate with them in the click of a button. Ever heard of social networking? The name is self-explanitory. You socialize with people all across the world through a network. For example, these is myspace, facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc. That is a fun way to connect with others like relatives you have never met or that live far away, friends, friends of friends, etc. You can even be really social and meet new people, as long as your safe. You @MONTH1 be thinking at this point, that a computer is nothing more than research and socializing. Again, you thought wrong. Computers are a good way to help with your skills. For example, your hand-eye coordination. You look at the screen, type your words, look at the screen again, while clicking your mouse. That really improves your coordination. Also, your hand movement will get better. When you type, your fingers are moving all around the keyboard, creating hand muscles. Not just physical skills, but computers help with research skills. There are certain ways to research information effectively. This can help for future researching, and school purposes. Without all this, wouldn't a person be missing something? Computers play a big part in everyones lives, no matter what age they are. Computers definitly have a positive effect on people. Additionally, they can also improve time management skills by providing tools for scheduling and organizing tasks efficiently. With the aid of digital calendars, reminders, and to-do lists, individuals can prioritize their activities and meet deadlines effectively. This aspect of computer usage enhances productivity and ensures that individuals can accomplish more in less time. In conclusion, computers have become indispensable in modern society, offering numerous benefits that contribute to personal growth and development."
503	505	1	3	Do you have a computer? I'll bet most of you do! You may spend hours on the computer, which can have various downsides. Being too engrossed in the computer can lead to a lack of physical activity and time spent outdoors. Additionally, sitting too close to the screen can be harmful to your eyes. The internet also presents the risk of exposure to inappropriate content, especially for children. It's important to limit the time spent on the computer and prioritize other activities. Computers can have negative effects on your physical health, particularly your eyesight. It's crucial to be mindful of how much time you spend in front of a screen.

504	506	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I'm writing to express my opinion on the debate surrounding the use of computers. Some argue that computers are incredibly useful, while others believe they are detrimental because people spend too much time on them. Personally, I believe that computers are valuable tools to have.  One of the main reasons why I support the use of computers is their ability to help us stay connected with friends. Through emails, social media, or instant messaging, we can easily keep in touch with our loved ones, especially those who are far away. Additionally, computers are essential for research purposes. Instead of going to the library and searching for specific books, we can quickly find information online, saving time and effort.  Moreover, computers provide access to online resources and services that may not be available locally. Whether it's shopping for items that are not found in stores or accessing educational materials from around the world, the internet opens up a whole new world of possibilities. For students, computers are indispensable for completing homework assignments and projects efficiently.  Furthermore, computers can be a cost-effective solution for communication. If making long-distance calls is expensive, using instant messaging or video calls can be a more affordable alternative to stay connected with family members or friends who are far away. Additionally, online shopping allows us to compare prices and find deals that may not be available in physical stores.  In conclusion, while it's essential to use computers in moderation and not become overly reliant on them, I believe that they offer numerous benefits in terms of communication, research, and access to resources. Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives and play a crucial role in enhancing productivity and connectivity.
505	507	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe that many people are not benefiting from excessive computer use. By spending too much time on computers, individuals are missing out on crucial aspects of life such as physical exercise, appreciation of nature, and quality time with family and friends.   Firstly, prolonged computer use leads to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to health issues such as obesity. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of individuals who spend excessive time on computers are overweight, highlighting the negative impact on physical health.  Furthermore, immersing oneself in the virtual world of computers results in a disconnect from the beauty of nature. Taking time to enjoy fresh air and surroundings is essential for overall well-being, and individuals who are glued to their screens are depriving themselves of the benefits that nature provides.  Lastly, excessive computer use can lead to a lack of interaction with family and friends. Parents who prioritize screen time over quality time with their loved ones miss out on important moments and opportunities to support and bond with their family members. Additionally, being engrossed in the digital world during social gatherings can be seen as disrespectful and can strain relationships.  In conclusion, it is essential for individuals to limit their time on computers to ensure a balanced and fulfilling life. By prioritizing physical activity, embracing nature, and nurturing relationships with family and friends, individuals can lead healthier and happier lives. Thank you for considering these important points.
506	508	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, since the invention of electricity, technology has advanced rapidly. Computers have evolved from room-sized machines to sleek twelve-inch flat screen monitors. In our modern society, computers play a crucial role in organizing files, conducting research, and facilitating online networking. They not only teach hand-eye coordination but also provide a means for learning about distant places and socializing online.  While we often take for granted the convenience of computers, it is worth noting that typing on a computer is less taxing on the hands compared to writing, which can lead to conditions like tendonitis or arthritis. According to @PERSON1, the chief orthopedic surgeon at @ORGANIZATION1, hand-eye coordination, improved through computer use, can also enhance balance and athleticism.  Some may argue that excessive computer use leads to a sedentary lifestyle, but portable devices like @CAPS3 allow for computer use while engaging in physical activity, such as walking. Personally, I have used the internet to take virtual tours of places like @LOCATION1, which I dreamt of visiting since I was a child. This virtual experience has allowed me to explore the country's landscapes and historical sites from afar.  Furthermore, @PERSON2, the creator of the online platform @ORGANIZATION2, has developed a system that enables global connectivity through video communication. This platform has enabled me to stay connected with my sister while she is away at college, providing a means for us to socialize as if she were still at home.  In conclusion, computers have revolutionized the way we work, learn, and communicate. While there are concerns about excessive computer use, the benefits of these devices in terms of efficiency, connectivity, and access to information cannot be overlooked. Technology, particularly computers, has become an integral part of our daily lives, shaping the way we interact with the world around us.
507	509	1	3	Dear editor of the local newspaper, did you know that the average person spends three or more hours each day on the computer? This excessive screen time not only takes away from valuable activities like helping the community, exercising, or spending time with loved ones, but it also poses risks to our health and well-being.  One of the major drawbacks of spending too much time on the computer is the impact it has on our relationships with family and friends. Instead of engaging in meaningful interactions with our loved ones, we often find ourselves glued to our screens, missing out on important moments and opportunities to connect. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, ultimately affecting our mental and emotional well-being.  In addition to the social implications, excessive computer use can also have adverse effects on our physical health. Straining our eyes by staring at screens for extended periods of time can result in vision problems and headaches. Moreover, sitting in front of a computer for hours on end can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, increasing the risk of obesity and other health issues.  Furthermore, the addictive nature of computer technology can be detrimental to our overall well-being. Whether it's constantly checking social media, playing online games, or browsing the internet, the allure of the digital world can be hard to resist. This addiction can consume our time and energy, leaving us feeling disconnected from reality and unable to engage in meaningful activities outside of the virtual realm.  In conclusion, it is crucial that we take a step back and reevaluate our relationship with technology. By reducing our screen time and prioritizing real-life interactions and experiences, we can improve our relationships, safeguard our health, and prevent the negative consequences of computer addiction. Let's strive to find a balance between the benefits of technology and the importance of living a fulfilling and well-rounded life.
508	510	1	3	Dear @CAPS1,  Computers indeed have positive effects, but the negative impacts they bring are far more significant. One of the most alarming consequences is the prevalence of bullying, which occurs on a daily basis and has devastating effects on victims. This form of harassment has driven many individuals to tragic outcomes, with some even resorting to suicide. The statistics reveal that 1 out of every 2 children falls victim to bullying, making it a pervasive and destructive issue that must be addressed promptly.  Moreover, the sedentary nature of using computers contributes to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Instead of engaging in physical activities outdoors, children spend hours glued to screens, which not only hampers their health but also their social development. The addictive nature of computers further exacerbates this problem, as individuals struggle to detach themselves from these electronic devices.  In addition to the social and health concerns, prolonged exposure to computer screens poses a serious risk to eyesight. The detrimental effects on vision are a significant concern, given the importance of sight in our daily lives. Furthermore, the online realm has become a breeding ground for harassment and abuse, with individuals facing extreme forms of mistreatment.  It is evident that the negative consequences of computer use outweigh any potential benefits they may offer. By disconnecting from these devices, individuals can reclaim their physical and mental well-being, fostering a healthier and more balanced lifestyle. It is imperative for both children and adults to limit their screen time and prioritize activities that promote overall wellness and human connection.  In conclusion, the detrimental effects of computers, such as bullying, sedentary behavior, health risks, and online harassment, highlight the urgent need to reassess our reliance on these devices. By recognizing the negative impacts and taking proactive steps to mitigate them, we can strive towards a society that prioritizes human well-being over digital distractions.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
509	511	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers are not detrimental to one's well-being.

In terms of education, computers can be a valuable tool, particularly in fields like computer engineering which offer lucrative career opportunities. While using a computer may initially pose challenges, resources are readily available online to assist in overcoming obstacles. Communication is another key aspect of computer usage, allowing individuals of all ages to connect with others without incurring high phone bills. However, it is important to be mindful of screen time to prevent eye strain. Moreover, computers offer a vast array of entertainment options through various websites and games, catering to different interests and age groups.

In conclusion, computers are not inherently harmful; when used responsibly, they can enhance learning, communication, and leisure activities.
510	512	1	3	Dear People,  Computers can be a double-edged sword in our lives. While they offer convenience and connectivity, excessive use can lead to neglecting important aspects of life such as spending time with family, taking care of household responsibilities, and engaging in physical activities. It is crucial to strike a balance between utilizing the benefits of technology and engaging in real-life experiences.  When individuals, especially parents, prioritize their screen time over quality time with their children, it can result in negative consequences such as children feeling neglected or developing unhealthy habits. It is essential to set boundaries and prioritize meaningful interactions with loved ones over endless hours spent online.  Moreover, excessive computer use can also impact productivity at work and hinder social interactions with friends. It is important to disconnect from the virtual world and engage in activities that promote personal growth, well-being, and social connections.  While computers offer numerous benefits such as access to information and communication with distant relatives, it is crucial to use them mindfully and in moderation. Instead of being glued to screens for hours on end, individuals should explore outdoor activities, spend time with loved ones, and focus on self-care to lead a balanced and fulfilling life.  In conclusion, while computers can be a valuable tool, excessive use can lead to a loss of precious moments and experiences in real life. It is important to strike a balance between technology and living in the moment to ensure a fulfilling and well-rounded lifestyle.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
511	513	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,   I am writing to express the importance of computers in the lives of busy individuals in our society. Computers have become a necessity rather than a luxury for several reasons.  First and foremost, computers are essential for communication. In today's fast-paced world, staying connected with friends and family members who may be far away is crucial. Video chatting through computers allows individuals to maintain relationships with loved ones without the need for costly and time-consuming travel.  Secondly, computers play a vital role in research for both school and work. With the vast amount of information available on the internet, computers make it easy to access and gather data quickly and efficiently. This is especially beneficial for students who have numerous assignments and projects that require thorough research.  Lastly, computers are indispensable for typing up essays, papers, and other written assignments. Whether it's for school or work, typing on a computer is much faster and more convenient than writing by hand. This is a skill that is essential for academic success and professional development in today's digital age.  In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, providing essential tools for communication, research, and productivity. They have revolutionized the way we interact with others, access information, and create written content. Therefore, it is clear that computers are not just a want, but a need for individuals in our modern society.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]

In this game you make a character in a miderth planet while you battle m onster with other players. Some people think that game is funner than life (personaly I think it is) but is not their life. His just a fantasy for people to escape thier meaningless lives. I write this for suport that some day people will understand that this is life. So, live it.  People should take a step back from the digital world and appreciate the beauty and wonder of the real world around them. Life is meant to be lived, not just observed through a screen. Let's reconnect with nature, with each other, and with ourselves. Let's embrace the gift of life and make the most of every moment. Let's not let technology consume us, but rather enhance our experiences in the real world. It's time to log off and log into life.
513	515	1	3	Dear local newspaper, it's true that technology is consuming people's attention more and more, leading to a disconnection from the world around us. With so many distractions, important issues like the environment are being overlooked. Some claim that spending excessive time on computers could lead to groundbreaking discoveries, but this is just an excuse for laziness. We must not forget about the beauty of the world and the potential dangers we face if we neglect it.  The future of sports is also at risk if younger generations do not step up to take the place of retiring athletes. As a football fan, the thought of losing these beloved games is disheartening. It is crucial for individuals to break free from their computer addiction and focus on building a fulfilling life for themselves.  Finding cures for diseases cannot be solely reliant on technology; true understanding comes from in-depth research and critical thinking. We must not underestimate the power of traditional methods like reading books and engaging in meaningful discussions.  It is imperative that we reevaluate our way of life and prioritize the well-being of our planet. By making positive changes now, we can ensure a brighter future for generations to come. Let's work together to create a better world for all.
514	516	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often. Computers can be unhealthy, I think that generally they're helpful. They give us many opportunities that wouldn't exist without them. I'll describe more of what I mean in the following letter. First, I'll explain one of the advantages of computers. Studying and school work. Computers can provide people with ways to research things. For students, it @MONTH1 be something like research for a project of essay. For adults it could be information on starting a business. In both of those cases, computers were used to get information in a simpler way then perhaps visiting a library, I, personally, know of a website called @LOCATION1, where teachers can set up online tests for students. This would not be possible without computers. Computer online courses can even be taken, where a student can be taught through the internet, rather than in person. This can be an advantage to someone that can't always get to classes. I would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication. E-mail and I @CAPS3. These methods of communication have become extremely popular recently, and I myself use both. I think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world. But in general I think it's helpful. It also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate. These are just some of the many ways computers are helpful. Lastly, I'd just like to talk about how computers can benefit adults specifically. I know that many people pay their bills online. This is because if you think about it, isn't it a hassle to have to mail your bills every month? Computers greatly reduce that hassle. They can also make it easier to buy things you need, look for jobs, and many other things. Without computers, things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them. These, again, are only some of the hundreds, if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful. In conclusion, I think I've made my point very clear. Any thing in moderation is okay. People that argue that computers are unhealthy speak of those who use computers too much. Generally this is not the case. Usually computers can do much more good than bad, and can make a person's life much easier. They help very much with education, and even that alone I think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful. But as I said, I hope I made my point clear, and I hope you agree with me. In today's digital age, computers have become an essential tool in our daily lives, offering convenience, efficiency, and endless possibilities. While some may argue that excessive use of computers can have negative effects, the benefits they bring in terms of education, communication, and productivity cannot be overlooked. From online research and learning opportunities to streamlined communication and simplified tasks, computers play a vital role in enhancing our lives. It is important to recognize the positive impact of computers and embrace their potential to improve our daily routines and overall well-being.
515	517	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Computers are undoubtedly a valuable tool in today's society, offering countless benefits and convenience. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of excessive computer usage, especially among students and teenagers like myself. While computers can be used for work, research, and communication with distant friends and family, it is essential to strike a balance and not let them consume all our time.  It is easy to get lost in the endless possibilities that computers offer, from social media to entertainment websites. However, spending too much time in front of a screen can have negative effects on physical health and social interactions. It is important to prioritize real-life activities like outdoor games, exercise, and face-to-face conversations with local friends.  Experts warn against the dangers of excessive computer use, emphasizing the importance of moderation. Allocating a limited amount of time each day for computer use, especially for productive tasks like homework or research, can help maintain a healthy balance. Remember, the goal is to utilize the computer as a tool for personal and professional growth, not as a means of escaping boredom.  In conclusion, while computers are undoubtedly valuable in today's world, it is essential to use them mindfully and in moderation. By setting boundaries and prioritizing real-life interactions and activities, we can enjoy the benefits of technology without sacrificing our physical and social well-being. Let's remember to step away from the screen, go outside, and stay fit.
516	518	1	3	Dear local newspaper, More and more people are using computers these days. Some people think computers are an improvement to society, while others are concerned that people spend too much time on computers and not enough time exercising and spending time with friends and family. I believe that computers can be a bad thing. Some people spend too much time on them, leading to obesity, and interfering with their social lives.  According to recent studies, about half of people spend most of their time on computers. Many of these individuals spend their time on online games and socializing websites like Facebook and Myspace. This excessive screen time can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which is one of the leading causes of obesity. Experts have linked the rise in obesity rates to the increase in computer usage over the past few years.  Moreover, spending excessive time on computers can also lead to a lack of interaction with friends and family. People who prioritize their computer over personal relationships risk damaging these connections, leading to loneliness and even depression. It is crucial to find a balance between using computers for work or leisure and maintaining real-life social connections.  In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly brought many benefits to society, it is essential to be mindful of the negative impacts of excessive computer use. Finding a balance between screen time and real-life interactions is crucial for maintaining physical health and emotional well-being.
517	519	1	3	"Dear Readers, Computers have a large presence in the world today. Most people in the United States have at least one and the number continues to grow. These computers are bad for people. They cost a lot of money, cause people to stop exercising and become unhealthy, and teach children that things come easy in life. Computers cost a lot of money. Between buying one, purchasing hardware and protection, and paying for maintenance, they are very expensive. Dr. Smith, a computer science expert, claims, ""The average computer costs around $1000. There is then hardware that needs to be bought and replaced, along with antivirus programs and other protection. Now we could be talking about at least $1500. With yearly maintenance costing about $200 per year, you can see how expensive these machines really are."" Four out of every ten computer owners in a recent survey stated that they had to service their computers within the last three months. That's a lot of money going toward fixing computers. But computers don't just cause money problems, there are health issues too. Computers take a lot of time away from people. When a computer is used, the user doesn't move around or exercise. Computers are making people unhealthy. The obesity number in the United States has skyrocketed, but it's not just food, Some experts are now contributing computer use to lack of exercise, and therefore, obesity. Dr. Johnson says, ""No matter what you're doing on a computer, be it games or education, you would be better off outside, moving around, getting exercise. A recent study shows that half of families who purchased a computer in the last year have halved their exercise and play time. There are health problems created by computers, but they also teach the next generation that things come very easily. Computers are an excellent source of knowledge, but that could be a problem. It is quite easy to find something out, or research a topic using a computer. Before computers became popular, people had to work and look for information. Now that it is so easy, children may begin to think things come easily in life. Dr. Williams, a pediatric psychologist, says, ""The mind of a child works in such a way that most things they encounter are absorbed and become normal. If a child becomes used to the ease of searching an item on a computer, he will expect all things to be equally simple. If they are not, he may become frustrated and not be able to do what is needed."" Three out of four poll takers agree that finding information on the computer is quite easy. What are the children of the world being taught? Life is easy, a false statement. Computer use is a growing problem. It costs ridiculous amounts of money, causes health problems, and poisons the minds of children to believe that life is an easy thing. Computers are bad for the people of the world; they take our money, our health, and the minds of our children."
518	520	1	3	Dear newspaper, I think computers are good for you because they allow you to communicate online, improve hand-eye coordination, and provide convenient access to information. One reason computers are beneficial is that they help enhance hand-eye coordination, such as when typing or using a mouse. Without developing this skill, individuals may struggle with various tasks that require coordination. Additionally, having a webcam on a computer enables users to connect with family members who live far away, allowing for face-to-face communication despite the distance. This feature can help maintain relationships and bridge the gap between loved ones. Furthermore, the ability to search the web for information, such as booking plane tickets for a trip, offers convenience and efficiency. Research shows that many people prefer online booking for its ease of access and ability to provide real-time updates on flight schedules. In conclusion, computers offer various advantages, from improving coordination to facilitating communication and information retrieval. Consider the benefits of incorporating computer use into daily life for a more connected and informed experience.
519	521	1	3	I believe that people should enjoy nature more than computers. Computers can be addicting, leading people to spend excessive amounts of time in front of screens. This sedentary lifestyle can result in a lack of exercise, leading to feelings of weakness and fatigue. Additionally, those who are constantly on computers may struggle academically as they prioritize screen time over completing homework. Furthermore, relying solely on the internet for information can limit one's knowledge and awareness of the world around them. To maintain a healthy lifestyle and stay informed about the world, it is important for people to prioritize spending time in nature and engaging in physical activity rather than constantly being glued to a screen. By balancing screen time with outdoor activities, individuals can improve their overall well-being and expand their horizons beyond the digital realm.
520	522	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I have heard that you are debating the impact of computers on society, and I believe they have a predominantly negative influence, particularly on students. Computers can be highly distracting, pose dangers such as online predators, and lead to a lack of physical activity.  One significant issue with computers is their ability to distract individuals, especially students, from important tasks like homework and studying. Social networking sites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 can easily divert attention away from academic responsibilities, hindering academic success.  Moreover, the internet can be a breeding ground for online predators who target unsuspecting individuals, particularly on platforms like MySpace. These predators can manipulate and harm individuals, emphasizing the risks associated with unrestricted computer use.  Additionally, excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, reducing opportunities for physical exercise and contributing to health problems like obesity. The allure of screen time can often outweigh the benefits of engaging in physical activities, leading to detrimental consequences for overall well-being.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is crucial to recognize and address the negative impact they can have on individuals, particularly students. From distractions to dangers and health concerns, it is essential to approach computer use mindfully to mitigate these adverse effects on society.
521	523	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I - like many other people my age - love to sit in front of a computer and explore its wonders. But that does not mean that I spend my whole life on it like others. So I can see what too much computer time can do. It has made kids my age more aggressive, have health problems, and care even less about the environment. More and more kids are falling into those traps.  Too much computer time can make even the nicest person extremely aggressive. I know from past experience that when you bother people when they are on their obsession, they will snap at you, yell, or even start swearing at you, or maybe get violent. If someone stays up too late on the computer, the next day could mean that they're cranky from the lack of sleep. This aggression could cause others to get aggressive in response, which could lead to a verbal or physical fight, which (hopefully) nobody wants.  Another issue too much computer time can cause, @CAPS1, are even more health issues. Staying inside all day will keep people from getting the necessary amount of vitamin D they need, which is a vital nutritious vitamin that comes from the sun itself. Not getting enough vitamin D throughout a person's childhood can result in getting an illness called rickets later in life, which never truly goes away and hinders people from doing the things they love. Too much computer time also means people aren't getting enough exercise, and with the way we eat now, those two things can add up to making a person obese. Others who do not want to get the proper amount of exercise or eat right and at the same time do not want to become obese, turn to anorexia. Neither of these weight problems are very good for you, proving my point about the health issues of too much computer time.  The issue I will have you read @CAPS1, is how people will become even less caring of the environment. Some of the big technology companies side-step around environmental protection laws to find cheaper ways to make their products and the thing is, no one cares! No one cares so long as they get their newer and better piece of technology. Everyone will just keep protecting these companies to get what they want to satisfy the craving for more computers.  Now, I'm not saying that having any computer time is bad. I'm just trying to prove that too much is bad for you. That with too much computer time, people can become more aggressive, have health issues, and become even less caring of the environment. Therefore I urge you @CAPS1 to write an article in the newspaper about the effects of too much computer time, to make it known to everyone in the city. It might help us make a better future.
522	524	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, people are using computers more often. Some people do not agree that computers are good. I think computers are good though. They help you learn more, they are like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and when you bored you can go on the internet. People nowadays are becoming smarter and smarter. One of the causes is the internet. The internet is like a big book. It holds tons of great information. There's probly information on the internet that probly no one knows, until they read it. Plus the fact that the internet is quick & easy. Also, the internet keeps you up to date on things going on in the world. Without the internet. We would be nowhere. Surveys show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students use the internet for information or projects for school. Also, on the internet you can buy things you can't but in stores. Going to the library is a pain. You have to pay for the gas plus you have to drag yourself out of the house to get in the car to go to the library. What if you don't have a library near you? then what will you do? you could go on the internet. Plus, with @CAPS2, people could look for a book all day, not find it and find out that someone else has it. What a pain. There are some people like collage people, Who don't have cars. So how the sapposed to get to the library? Studies show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 don't have cars. When you get bored, what do you do? eat? sleep? Lay on the floor staring at the celing? No. You go on the computer. The internet has all sorts of fun games and websites. It also helps you make new friends. The internet is also a good way to stay in contact with close friend or relative. Also, if you are a photographer, then you can sell & share you photographs online you can also advertise you company or buisness. @NUM3 out @NUM4 @CAPS3 either have no backyard or have nothing better to do. I think that the internet is great. You can learn all sorts of information you don't have to go to a library and you can play games when you get bored. Isn't the internet great?   In conclusion, the internet is a valuable tool that offers a wide range of benefits, from access to information and educational resources to entertainment and social connectivity. Its convenience and versatility make it an indispensable part of modern life, enhancing learning, communication, and productivity for individuals across the globe.
523	525	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I feel that computers are very beneficial to our society. They are very helpful when it comes to homework, you can talk to people online and you can make plans without even leaving your house.  First of all, computers help us a great deal with homework. Many kids are adamant about it, but with the help of a computer, they will be more willing to get it done. For example, when I have a difficult science/social studies assignment, I can research it on the computer. Also, if I have a test coming up and I left my textbook at school, I can just study on my computer. So, as a result, computers are very helpful with homework and studying.  Secondly, computers make it very easy to communicate with others. For example, talking on the phone costs money, and why would you spend money when you could text, chat, or video call for free? Also, many people use e-mail because it's very easy and you can send documents to others. Let's say that I had a work document on yearly company profits and I needed to get it to my boss. No problem, I just email it to him and I don't have to drive.  Finally, computers make it very easy to make plans or connections. I know that many people love to travel, but you need plane tickets. Just go to the website and do it online. It's fast, easy, and safe. Also, if you needed to make reservations for something, like a hotel, you just have to go online, pick a date and when you arrive your room will be ready. I can see how this would be very beneficial to traveling business men who might need a room for the night.  In conclusion, computers play a huge roll in the world because they can help with homework, it's easy to communicate, and you can make reservations without even leaving your house. And the best part about them is that they are fun and easy to use!
524	526	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, in response to this article, it is true that more and more people are using computers, and there are those who believe that computers have a positive impact on people. However, I hold a different opinion. I believe that computers can have detrimental effects on one's life, potentially leading to negative consequences. Firstly, excessive use of computers can have a harmful impact on individuals. The allure of computers lies in their versatility and the endless possibilities they offer. Unfortunately, this can also lead to individuals spending prolonged periods of time in front of a screen, neglecting other aspects of their lives. I vividly recall a news report where a young child fainted after playing a computer game for an extended period. This serves as a stark reminder of how computers can disrupt one's life with just a few hours of usage. Additionally, the physical strain caused by computers can result in serious health issues, such as vision problems. The close proximity of the computer screen can put immense strain on the eyes, leading to discomfort and potential long-term damage. I witnessed this firsthand when my father, engrossed in his new computer, developed bloodshot eyes and eventually required glasses. It is evident that prolonged exposure to computer screens can have detrimental effects on one's eyesight. In conclusion, computers have the potential to negatively impact individuals' lives and health. It is crucial to be mindful of the consequences of excessive computer usage and to prioritize one's well-being. Consider the points raised in this letter before succumbing to the allure of technology.
525	527	1	3	@DATE1 @CAPS1 The @CAPS2, I believe that computers have a positive impact on society. Using computers for educational purposes, such as research or educational games, can greatly benefit individuals. For example, helping siblings with math using interactive games or learning essential skills like typing through educational software can enhance knowledge and abilities. Moreover, utilizing computers for tasks like typing projects or creating presentations can improve productivity and efficiency.  Additionally, social networking platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter offer opportunities for people to connect, communicate, and build relationships. These platforms enable individuals to meet new friends, reconnect with old acquaintances, and stay in touch with current ones. Furthermore, email services like @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION1, or @ORGANIZATION3 provide a convenient way to communicate important information effectively.  In conclusion, the use of computers for educational and social purposes can have a positive impact on society by enhancing learning, communication, and productivity.Overall, computers play a significant role in improving various aspects of people's lives in today's society.
526	528	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, I believe that computers are truly beneficial for everyone. One reason is the ease with which we can access information. With just a few clicks, we can research any topic, no matter how far away it may be. The internet is a vast source of knowledge that covers a wide range of subjects. Another advantage is the ability to connect with distant relatives through webcams and social media platforms like Facebook. This enables us to stay in touch and see loved ones even when they are miles away. Lastly, computers provide us with a wide array of tools for various tasks such as writing, project management, and business operations. They have become essential in modern society for organizing information and running businesses efficiently. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits that enhance our lives in many ways.
527	529	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I agree that the effects computers have on people can be very negative. People spend more time on computers than on phones, neglecting their homes and responsibilities. Parents and children often use websites like webcam and AIM to communicate, rather than meeting in person or using the phone. Teenagers and some adults are active on social media sites like MySpace, Facebook, and Formspring, leading to rumors and potential dangers. It is crucial for individuals to be aware of the risks associated with excessive computer use and to log off to avoid negative situations. It is essential for people to prioritize their well-being and safety in the digital age.
528	530	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have a very strong belief that children and adults are spending far too much time on the computer. Please consider the following that computers have a negative effect on people. Furthermore, @PERCENT1 of parents agree with experts that @CAPS3 spend way too much time on the computer but less time with friends. @CAPS11 I was little, I rarely ever went on the computer. But now, my parents have to constantly remind me to leave the computer. Ever since teens have joined @CAPS7, MySpace, and Twitter, they are addicted to it and can't stop checking what their friends are posting. Psychologist @PERSON2 states, ""@CAPS3 who are on the internet for multiple hours a day can't concentrate in school because their minds are constantly thinking about what they're going to do on the computer when they get home."" Wake up, eat, go to school, get home, go on the computer. This is the daily routine of a teenager in the @DATE1.  Secondly, spending excessive time on the computer can cause health problems. @NUM1 percent of teens who non-stop use the computer have to wear glasses or contacts due to overuse. I've personally experienced terrible headaches after prolonged computer use. ""@CAPS3 who stay up late on the computer are fatigued the next morning,"" says pediatrician @PERSON1. Middle schoolers are the most common users of the internet, often tired and struggling at school. People who stay up late develop dark circles under their eyes, indicating overuse of the internet. Most children who spend excessive time online also neglect outdoor activities, missing out on fresh air and exercise.  Lastly, children are missing out on the beauty of nature. Those who lack exercise struggle to think clearly due to insufficient oxygen to their brains. Obesity is becoming prevalent among children who remain indoors and consume junk food. @PERCENT2 of children in Stratford almost never venture outside to exercise. In elementary school, recess provided a chance to play outdoors, but now in middle school, it's a rarity. The limited opportunities for outdoor activities during warm weather further restrict children's exposure to nature.  In conclusion, the excessive use of computers not only affects social interactions and academic performance but also leads to health issues and a disconnection from the outdoors. It is crucial for parents and individuals to monitor screen time and encourage a balanced lifestyle for the well-being of children and adults alike."
529	531	1	3	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on computers @MONTH1 be the same as others or different. I believe that computers help our society. They give us more knowledge on whatever subject we want, it helps us connect to family far away places and they even give us a better understanding of any place we can't see for ourselves. Some people feel that computers distract kids so they're never spending time with family. But what if one of your family members is on the other side of the world? @CAPS1 cousin lives in @LOCATION2 and the only way I can ever talk to him is through a computer. What if your a little kid and your mom or did go on business trips faraway for a very long time? You would use a computer to talk to them wouldn't you? Not everyone in your is always around you and when someone is faraway a computer is the way to connect. Because of computers kids don't exercise. What if your exercise happened to be hiking? In you get exercise and can expose the scenery. With a computer you can explore anywhere without even leaving your doorstep. Say your just a young kid and you're always located to see @LOCATION1 but you can never go there. What would you do? You would hop on a computer and check it out. You can explore any place you want with the click of a button. In school you learn about very historic people who have been dead for thousands of years. How would you learn more about them if they're gone? A computer has information about anyone you chance. You @MONTH1 not be exercising but you're expanding your knowledge aren't you. Yes you could go down to a library and take out a book on the person. However, what if the book doesn't have the information you are looking for? You could end up reading for hours when the certain information you want wasn't even there. A computer gives you anything you need in a matter of seconds. Why waste your time? Now is the time where our technology advances. Why waste your time on something when you've got what you need right at your fingertips? So what are you waiting for? Go learn what you want right now! Haven't seen your cousin in a long time? Start up your computer and get talking. The time is now!
530	532	1	3	Dear Local newspaper editor, I believe that computers have brought numerous benefits to our lives. Whether it is assisting children with research for their schoolwork or helping businesses thrive through online platforms, computers have become an integral part of our daily routine. They enable us to access information from all around the world and continue learning new things every day.   While some argue that computers discourage physical exercise as people spend more time indoors, I believe it ultimately comes down to personal choice. Computers also serve as a valuable tool for staying connected with friends and family through online communication and sharing photos. The notion that computers control individuals or limit their interactions is unfounded and overlooks the positive impact they have had on society.  As technology continues to advance, it is clear that computers play a crucial role in our nation's progress. They have revolutionized various aspects of our lives, making tasks more efficient and accessible. Looking ahead, I am confident that computers will further enhance our daily experiences and contribute to the development of our country.  In conclusion, computers have significantly impacted our lives in a positive way, and their influence will only continue to grow in the future. Embracing the benefits of technology is essential for our advancement as a society. Let us appreciate the opportunities that computers provide and acknowledge their valuable contribution to our everyday lives.
531	533	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers are indeed a crucial component of our modern technology, offering numerous benefits to individuals. They play a pivotal role in simplifying various tasks, providing educational resources, and offering entertainment options. The constant evolution of computers has led to a widespread dependence on them, but this addiction comes with positive outcomes. Computers facilitate everyday activities by streamlining processes that would otherwise be time-consuming. For instance, tasks like writing books, creating clothing, and producing music have been revolutionized by the use of computers. Moreover, educational platforms and software like Microsoft have enhanced learning experiences for students, enabling them to excel academically. In addition to education, computers cater to entertainment needs through gaming and information research. They prevent boredom and offer a plethora of engaging activities. Despite concerns about excessive screen time, computers can have a constructive impact on individuals, fostering learning, productivity, and creativity. In essence, the positive effects of computers on people's lives are undeniable, making them an indispensable tool in the modern world.
532	534	1	3	"Dear Readers of the Local Newspaper, I am almost certain you interact daily with computers. You use computers to write, play games, look at pictures, and print work out. There are many practical uses for computers, but nowadays, many people, especially children, are using computers excessively. This unnecessary usage of computers can cause obesity, expose children to inappropriate things, and destroy family time. Readers, hear my argument, and by the end of the paper, you will surely agree with me that computers are detrimental to society.  Have you ever made a New Year's resolution to lose weight? It's not uncommon for one to make such a goal. According to the statistics, many adults make their New Year's resolutions to get in shape, exercise more, or just lose weight. We've all seen the commercials on TV that encourage you to ""get fit!"" so you too can ""lose weight in just one week""! There are also plenty of entrepreneurs out there who want to convince you to buy their exercise products so you can develop outrageously large muscles in ""no time at all"". But do all these diets and exercise plans really work?  According to a study done by the experts, the largest cause of obesity is actually computers! The students at a prestigious university had one group of people try a regular commercial diet plan and another group of people do exactly what they've been doing... except for their computers. They found that the group who refrained from computer use lost nearly 20% more weight on average than the group on the commercial diet! Nothing is causing obesity in them other than computer use.  A familiar day for an average child goes like this: go to school, home on the bus, use the computer, eat dinner, do homework, and go to bed. Unfortunately, this happens five days a week, and the computer time is eating up none other than exercise time. Readers, please try avoiding your computers for just one week, and you can forget those fad diets.  Another negative aspect of computers is that it not only affects an individual but possibly an entire family! Many children can go an entire day without sitting down and talking to their parents. Computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers. Many teens say they use computers daily and have trouble communicating with their parents. There is a direct connection between the lack of communication at home for teens and computer usage. Teens become engrossed in their social lives and attached to their computers. What they don't realize is that they're totally forgetting about their families!  Computers have the ability to destroy parent-child relationships; don't let that happen to you. Your children are, without a doubt, the ones affected by this technological revolution the most. From the time they were young, your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips. Do parents ever realize what they're getting their children into when they teach them how to use a computer though? Children as young as five or six years old are exposed to inappropriate and vulgar pictures on the web on supposed ""safe sites"". Do you even realize who your child is talking to on the computer?  With all the chats and emails flying around, you could be talking to a complete stranger without even knowing. An enormous part of who your child becomes and the values they hold is a product of what they were exposed to at a young age. Bringing a computer to your kindergartener and you can probably guess what they'll grow up with. No matter how much you think or believe in the safety of computers, you cannot argue with the fact that computers expose children to adult content very early in their lives.  So, do you look at your computer differently now? Faced with the concerns of lack of exercise, separation of families, and inappropriate content children are exposed to, do you really want your children, or even yourself for that matter, using a computer daily? Think ahead five years from now. Will you say ""I wish I used my computer"" or ""I wish I spent more time""? In the end, the choice is really up to you."
533	535	1	3	In my opinion, having a computer is a beneficial tool to have in today's world. Computers serve a variety of purposes, making them essential for many individuals and businesses. One primary advantage of owning a computer is the ability to quickly access information. By using the internet, you can easily search for and retrieve data in a fraction of the time it would take to find it in a book. This efficiency is particularly useful for tasks such as research and completing assignments. Additionally, computers enable communication with friends and family members, especially those who may live far away. Through online platforms, individuals can stay connected and engage in conversations without incurring high phone bills. Lastly, computers offer convenience for completing homework assignments. Students can access online resources, such as e-books, to study and complete tasks without the need to carry heavy textbooks. Overall, the versatility and practicality of computers make them a valuable tool in various aspects of life.
534	536	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects. Some of the major bad effects of computers on people are no exercise, you can talk to strangers, and no interaction with family and friends. One of the effects of computers on people is no exercise. One of the most important effect of computers on people is no exercise. Right now many people in the @LOCATION1 are obese because of bad eating and no exercise. One of the problems is that these people don't get off their computers and couches to go outside. These people choose to stay indoors and just do nothing except watch TV and go on the computer. So computers have a big effect on how these people live their lives. Another problem caused by computers is kids talking to strangers. Most kids in the @LOCATION1 are a member of a social network like Facebook or Twitter. There are people out there that go on these websites on their computers and pretend to be a teen. This can get many kids in trouble if they are not careful on these websites. Since most people access these websites from their computers its another bad effect of computers on people. Another bad effect is no interaction with family or friends. When people are on computers, they focus on what's on the computer and not about their surroundings. Being on the computer stops many people from interacting with their family and friends. Not interacting with anyone causes their social skills to weaken since they are always on the computer. This can become a serious problem if a person becomes too addicted to the computer. This can cause many problems between communication throughout the family making the family weaken. In conclusion even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects which can cause serious problems. Computers can cause tragedies in families and/or in that person's life.
535	537	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I hear that you think computers have an effect on people. Well, I disagree with what you say. I believe computers are incredibly beneficial and have a positive impact on our lives.   Firstly, computers are essential for developing hand-eye coordination, which is crucial for various jobs in today's digital age. Proficiency in typing, for example, is necessary for positions that require constant use of computers, such as data entry jobs at places like the city office. Without this skill, individuals may struggle to secure top-tier employment opportunities.   Secondly, computers play a vital role in enhancing children's academic performance. Learning how to type effectively at a young age can significantly benefit students as they progress through school, improving their proficiency in subjects like math, science, social studies, and language arts. Additionally, educational programs and games on computers make learning enjoyable and engaging for children, encouraging them to excel in their studies.  Lastly, computers facilitate global communication and connectivity. They enable individuals to send information and messages across the world instantly, eliminating the need for traditional methods of communication. Whether it's staying in touch with distant family members or reconnecting with old friends, computers make it easier to maintain relationships regardless of geographical barriers. Furthermore, online shopping has become more convenient and accessible, allowing people to purchase goods and services with just a few clicks.  In conclusion, computers are essential tools that contribute positively to our lives. They enhance learning, improve job prospects, and facilitate global connections. Embracing technology and incorporating it into our daily lives can lead to a more efficient and interconnected community.
536	538	1	3	I agree that computers benefit us in many ways. They make tasks easier and more efficient, such as using online textbooks for school, researching companies before choosing to work with them, finding directions to places, and looking up information about home decorators. Computers save time, effort, and resources, making our lives more convenient and productive. Overall, the advantages of computers outweigh any potential drawbacks, making them essential tools in today's modern world.
537	539	1	3	Dear newstimes, I really think that computers are a good thing because they let you talk to people online, they have ways of doing things for other people, and people have to manage a lot of their money and bills on the computer. First, they let you communicate with other people through video chat and messaging, which is especially important for those who have family in different states and countries. It helps people stay connected and maintain relationships despite physical distance.   Secondly, computers provide assistance in emergencies by allowing quick communication via email or instant messaging. In critical situations, being able to reach out to others promptly can make a significant difference. Additionally, there are features like automated emergency calls that can be invaluable during times of need.   Lastly, computers are essential for financial management, with many people in the United States relying on them to pay bills and keep track of their finances. Without this technology, it would be challenging for individuals to handle their monetary responsibilities efficiently. Overall, computers play a crucial role in modern society by facilitating communication, aiding in emergencies, and simplifying financial tasks. Everyone can benefit from having access to a computer for these reasons.
538	540	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, According to @PERCENT1 of the world, computers are a valuable tool for interacting with people from different countries, learning about foreign cultures, and discovering one's family history. The internet provides numerous opportunities to connect with individuals worldwide through social media, online pen-pal platforms, and instant messaging services. Moreover, computers facilitate research and education by offering access to a vast amount of information on various subjects, including geography, history, and genealogy. Websites like @LOCATION1 can help individuals trace their family roots and uncover details about their ancestors' lives. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing global communication, expanding knowledge, and preserving personal heritage.
539	541	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a crucial aspect of modern society, with almost everyone utilizing them for various purposes. Despite this, some individuals believe that computers are detrimental to our society. However, this notion is unfounded as computers play a vital role in education, work, and everyday life.  Education is a fundamental aspect of society, and computers have become essential tools for learning. Whether it is researching information for a project, typing essays, or participating in online classes, computers are integral to the educational process. Without access to computers, individuals would struggle to acquire knowledge and skills necessary for personal and professional growth.  Moreover, the argument that people spend excessive amounts of time on computers is flawed. While individuals may use computers for leisure activities such as playing games or browsing social media, they also engage in outdoor activities and social interactions. It is up to each individual to manage their screen time responsibly, and the presence of computers does not prevent people from leading balanced lives.  In the professional world, computers are indispensable for carrying out various tasks efficiently. From communicating with colleagues via email to accessing important information for decision-making, computers are integral to the functioning of businesses and organizations. Without computers, many industries would struggle to operate effectively and meet the demands of a fast-paced world.  In conclusion, computers are not harmful to society but rather serve as valuable tools that enhance education, facilitate work, and enable communication. It is essential to recognize the numerous benefits that computers bring to our lives and to embrace technology as a means of progress and advancement. Let us not overlook the positive impact that computers have on society and instead, harness their potential for the betterment of our communities.
540	542	1	3	Let's go back around 20 years ago. Those were days when it could take weeks to communicate with out-of-state family. Days when knowledge was only found in books, and often found slowly. Those were days where everything was done with a lack of speed and precision. Computers changed all that. With nothing but the tap of a finger, we can communicate with people worldwide or search the web for new information. Fifty percent of people's relatives live out of their state. I can relate, with 10 cousins in Mexico and 5 in Canada. Without these instant messages and emails, we would more than likely talk to them once, maybe twice a year! Some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends. For me personally, and I know many others, interaction would be impossible without these modern marvels. With all the latest technology out there, nothing has me as amazed as the webcam. You, with this tool, can talk face to face with someone on the other side of the world! The world is a better place when we can have a true connection to other cultures, and what better way than to talk to them. What people 50 years ago would never think possible, we can use at a moment's notice, and yet still, many people don't appreciate it. My parents and my grandparents have both used the internet to reunite with old college buddies or see how far away friends are. These are grown-ups using the tools available to improve their lives. The internet goes beyond teenagers on social media. What you can find online still amazes me. The information you could get out of 20 non-fiction books, you could find in minutes on the internet. Any question, including personal, anything, can be answered. Years ago, people would have killed for this power, for the common man to be able to access all he ever needed. I see the point people make about needing exercise, and they're right. But in five minutes on the web, you could have an exercise routine planned out, with modern techniques and styles. The computer has something for everyone. Looking for a place to enjoy nature and hike? In seconds, there will be thousands of results. Missing a dictionary? There are literally hundreds of sites to find a definition online. People take these machines for granted and assume we could live without them, but I doubt they ever realize how much we really need them. The technology is there. Why not use it? I could never turn down an opportunity to talk to a distant cousin or another kid from a different country. I couldn't pass up a chance to check up on some old buddies that moved away. Thanks to computers, I have that opportunity. I have that chance. I've been shown an open door to find out everything I could want. Man can't know everything. But these days, he can find out anything. I'm not sure if the computer has changed the direction of advancing technology, but I can tell you, it has definitely offered the course. In conclusion, the advent of computers and the internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and connect with others around the world. It has opened up endless possibilities and opportunities that were once unimaginable, making our lives more efficient, connected, and enriched.
541	543	1	3	@CITY1 @CAPS1: Computers play a crucial role in our society, offering a multitude of benefits. They provide access to various places and facilitate tasks like searching for a new home or planning a vacation. With the help of websites like Google, finding information about selling homes or booking flights becomes effortless. Additionally, computers come equipped with a range of accessories that enhance user experience, such as games that stimulate the mind and improve hand-eye coordination. For individuals in long-distance relationships, computers enable communication through online platforms like email, Myspace, and Facebook, fostering connections with friends and loved ones. Overall, computers serve as valuable tools in our daily lives, offering convenience, entertainment, and connectivity.
542	544	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is that they are used for the wrong reasons. Teens should be outside playing sports or hanging out with friends and family instead of being addicted to the world wide web and various online activities. The overuse of computers can lead to neglect of academic responsibilities, as students may prioritize online activities over schoolwork. Additionally, the easy access to information on the internet can sometimes result in the dissemination of false information, which can be detrimental to educational pursuits. @DATE1's saw the emergence of laptops and desktop computers, which have contributed to an increase in screen time for individuals of all ages. This excessive use of technology can lead to a lack of focus on important tasks and can impact overall well-being. In conclusion, @CAPS1 believes that the negative effects of computers on people include a decrease in physical activity, overreliance on the internet, and the potential for misinformation. It is important for individuals and families to monitor their computer usage and prioritize real-world interactions and academic responsibilities.
543	545	1	3	I think that computers are amazing. Computers are an amazing way to meet new people online. They provide a platform for connecting with individuals from all over the world, allowing for the sharing of ideas, experiences, and knowledge. The internet has made it easier than ever to communicate with others, fostering a sense of community and collaboration.

Overall, the advancements in computer technology have opened up a world of possibilities and opportunities for people to connect and engage with one another in ways that were once unimaginable.
544	546	1	3	Dear newspaper,  I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. On the positive side, they allow us to learn about different places and gather information on various topics without physically being there. However, on the negative side, excessive use of computers, especially among children, can lead to a lack of physical activity and social interaction. Moreover, there are risks associated with online interactions, as not everyone online may be who they claim to be.  Therefore, if I had to take a stance on whether computers are helpful or not, I would lean towards the latter. The potential dangers and negative consequences of using computers, such as sharing personal information or encountering harmful individuals online, outweigh the benefits they offer. It is crucial for individuals to be cautious and mindful of their online activities to ensure their safety and well-being.  In conclusion, while computers can provide valuable information and resources, it is essential to be aware of the potential risks and drawbacks associated with their use. Finding a balance between utilizing technology for its advantages and safeguarding oneself from its pitfalls is key in navigating the digital world responsibly.

546	548	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Computers are not something to be afraid of. They help many people in different ways, like the elderly, teachers, students, scientists, and locals dealing with their jobs and daily life. Hasn't a computer already helped you today? Because of that, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future. Who has said that by using computers you don't interact with your family as much? Well, I can tell you that I'm staying in contact with my grandma, cousins, and aunts through my e-mail. With e-mail, you can check up on news or simply write to friends and family! Also, if you are planning a trip to visit your loving family members, don't bother with a map that gets in your face all the time and you just ""happen"" to get lost, try going on Google Maps and plan the shortest route to your destination without getting lost along the way. Computers can do more than creating a simple map; they can give you precious information! Many schools across the country use computers to help teach kids. The kids can look up information and in seconds have all the information they need! In most school papers, you have to type and provide what websites you used to finish the paper. What is also nice is that you don't need to go through huge books for one small piece of information. It is much easier, looking it up on the computer. Speaking of not using big books for information, computers don't use paper and will lead us to a healthier tomorrow! Millions of tons of paper land in landfills each day! By using computers we could read online and conserve paper! Another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future. People have already created touch-screen computers and computers will grow even more! Many people think that using computers is a bad thing, but look at the facts! Doesn't the newspaper write the newspaper on computers? If they didn't, they would be having hand cramps all the time! And what about doctors, don't they have your medical history on the computer, if not all these papers would get lost! Like in the beginning, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future. So, let's embrace technology and make the most out of the opportunities it offers us."
547	549	1	3	Typing and surfing the web can be exciting; however, is it worth the potential risks that come with it? Before the advent of computers, people were generally healthier than they are now. While computers have their uses and benefits, they can also be harmful and should not be overused. They provide access to unprofessional websites, discourage physical exercise, and compromise individuals' privacy. Children are particularly vulnerable, as they are often allowed unrestricted access to the internet and can stumble upon inappropriate content. Studies show that a significant percentage of children visit unprofessional websites without parental supervision, leading to behavioral issues at home and in school. Moreover, computers are susceptible to hacking and viruses from unsavory websites, resulting in data loss and system crashes. The sedentary nature of computer use has contributed to a rise in obesity and a decline in physical activity levels. As a result, individuals are losing muscle mass and gaining excess weight, affecting their overall health and well-being. While computers may offer conveniences like online shopping and hand-eye coordination exercises, the potential risks to one's health and safety should not be overlooked. Trust issues also arise when making online transactions, as concerns about identity theft and financial scams persist. In conclusion, while computers have their advantages, it is essential to use them in moderation and be cautious of the potential dangers they present to both physical and mental health.
548	550	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are becoming increasingly harmful to children and are likely to have a negative impact on future generations. While some may argue that computers have positive effects such as improving hand-eye coordination and providing access to information from around the world, I believe that the drawbacks far outweigh the benefits.  Engaging in sports like tennis, baseball, basketball, and hockey are excellent ways to improve hand-eye coordination, promote physical health, and encourage social interaction. Spending excessive amounts of time on the computer, on the other hand, can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and dependency on technology.  Furthermore, relying too heavily on computers for research and communication can be risky. Internet sources may not always be reliable, and there is a constant threat of viruses and online predators. Visiting the library and reading books can provide more trustworthy information and protect individuals from potential dangers lurking online.  In addition, social media platforms like Facebook, AIM, and Twitter can be unsafe, as users may not always know who they are interacting with. Building relationships with friends in person is a much safer and more fulfilling way to connect with others.  In conclusion, it is important to limit children's screen time and encourage more physical activity, face-to-face interactions, and reliance on trusted sources of information. By prioritizing real-world experiences over virtual ones, we can promote healthier lifestyles and stronger relationships in our communities.
549	551	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive impact on society for several reasons. Firstly, computers help to improve hand-eye coordination and provide people with the opportunity to learn about distant places. Research shows that a significant number of students use computers for their homework, demonstrating the educational benefits they offer. In addition, computers enable individuals to communicate with others online, bridging the gap between long distances. For instance, I was able to reconnect with my family in a different city after years of separation, thanks to online communication through computers. Lastly, computers play a crucial role in advancing technology, leading to innovations in various fields such as transportation and healthcare. Without computers, many advancements that benefit society today would not have been possible. In conclusion, computers have a positive influence on people by enhancing learning, facilitating communication, and driving technological progress. The benefits they bring to society are undeniable, making them an essential tool in today's world.

Having computers would facilitate meeting new people through email and chat programs. Additionally, it would enable us to explore different locations by accessing the internet and researching various places. Furthermore, interacting with others online can provide us with valuable insights and ideas for learning about new topics.   In conclusion, introducing computers to our newspaper office would not only benefit us individually by expanding our knowledge and connections, but it would also enhance the overall learning and collaborative environment for everyone involved. Thank you for considering this proposal.
551	553	1	3	I think computers are bad because people use them all the time to go on Facebook and other websites that are sometimes a waste of time. People should not spend so much time on the computer and should instead explore outside, go for walks, and exercise more. Many individuals do not get enough exercise because they spend too much time on computers. It is important to stay healthy and active to prevent diseases like diabetes. By reducing computer usage, people can focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle through physical activity. Exploring nature, going for walks, and spending time outdoors with family and friends can be more enjoyable and beneficial than being glued to a screen. It is essential to prioritize physical activity and limit computer use for better overall health and well-being. So, get off the computer, explore the outdoors, and engage in activities that promote a healthier lifestyle.
552	554	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is that computers have a good effect. It's good for education, mind exercise, and communication all over the world. It could @CAPS2 be bad because it would keep you from getting exercise, being with your family, and being healthy. But I still think that there are ways to use computers without the bad cause.  Some ways computers are good for you are that you can get a better education when you have websites with so much information. Sometimes this information is false, but if you find the right websites, you can get the right information. With all of this information, you can exercise your mind to do better in life. You can @CAPS2 talk to people on the other side of the earth and get more information from them.  If I were to say computers are bad for you, I would say that it keeps you from getting enough or maybe any exercise. Computers @MONTH1 be the reason why there are so many obese people in the @LOCATION1. @CAPS2 When computers are used too much, people part from their family and go into different fantasy worlds that sometimes get you addicted to them. And staying for too long on the computer causes problems. You can get hurt by just sitting for a long amount of time at once. Being on the computer for too long can @CAPS2 cause eye problems where you will begin to lose your sight and will need glasses, which will get thicker as you keep looking at the computer screen for hours and days.  But even though computers cause so many problems, we can prevent them by using the computer to help us. People don't get enough exercise, but with the help of computers, they can @CAPS2 find times and ways to exercise so that they can stay healthy. They can @CAPS2 find information about how much time should be spent on the computer to not have sight decrease or worse. Some people live far away from their family so computers really help them stay in touch and to be able to see each other.  In conclusion, I think that computers are more beneficial than harmful because they give you a lot of information for everything, and you can communicate with people all over the world. And computers can help you prevent those things that are bad for you by showing you ways to use the computer that won't harm you.
553	555	1	3	"Dear newspaper, I heard you were discussing if more and more people using computers was a benefit to society. I believe that it has a negative affect on people. They get to interact with people who aren't safe, they spend less time exercising and they get into more trouble than before. Spending more time online in chat rooms causes people to meet predators. Take my friend, she was online one day when a man started to talk to her. She thought he seemed acceptable when he said he was a model. She flirted with him on and on, day after day until one day her friend logged on and found out the man was really a pervert. She isn't the only one that this has happened to. Website designer say, ""More and more people everyday are falling for lies over the internet and getting in sticky situations like getting asked to meet the person."" Isn't the saying ""Don't talk to strangers?""   Spending all your time sitting down on the computer means less time outside exercising. At tryouts, this girl wasn't in shape enough to stay up with the players. Instead of being out practicing like the rest of us, she was in her house talking on facebook. She wasn't prepared when it came time to show what you had so she didn't make the team. The next year she made captain because she was out training everyday before the big day. She's not the only one with a laziness problem. Many Americans are couch potatoes and choose to go online than to stay in shape. A nutritionist says, ""This generation is worse than the last. They complain when they can't do something but that's because instead of going outside, they're on their butts watching TV or online.""   Kids seem to get in a lot more trouble online than they ever have on the streets. They're out posting threats, dissing each other, sending personal messages or pictures, and worst of all, sometimes hurting someone so bad they commit suicide. The neighbor was more popular than this lady's daughter so she created this person online that the neighbor fell for. The online ""guy"" began trashing the teenage girl so bad she ended up hanging herself. People, including singer, have been caught in sexting. It's embarrassing, inappropriate, and against the law, yet it still happens. These people are not alone. Many people have gotten in big trouble through the internet. Governor says, ""Internet and phones are destroying this society. There's too much real life drama already."" Can't you see something wrong with all of this?   My opinion on it all is that we should use the computers less before we all start interacting with people that will scare us, become couch potatoes, and get into huge trouble. It's really not worth the damage of getting scared, hurt, lazy, or taking your own life. Let's be cautious and mindful of how we use technology in our lives."
554	556	1	3	Dear newspaper, Computers are an integral part of our daily lives, providing us with numerous benefits that enhance our well-being and connectivity. Despite some concerns about the impact of computers on our health and relationships, I believe that they play a crucial role in improving hand-eye coordination, expanding our knowledge of the world, and facilitating communication with loved ones.  Hand-eye coordination is a skill that is essential for various tasks, and computers can help to enhance this ability through interactive games and activities. Many experts have noted a significant improvement in hand-eye coordination among individuals who regularly use computers. This positive impact was also observed by a teacher at a local school, who witnessed remarkable progress in students' coordination skills after incorporating computer activities into their curriculum.  Moreover, computers serve as powerful tools for learning about different cultures and destinations around the globe. By accessing the internet, individuals can explore a wealth of information about faraway places, enabling them to prepare for travels and broaden their understanding of the world. This ease of access to knowledge has proven invaluable for students, professionals, and curious minds alike.  Additionally, computers facilitate communication with friends and family members, especially those who are geographically distant. Through various online platforms, individuals can stay connected, share experiences, and maintain relationships despite physical barriers. The ability to engage in conversations, video calls, and instant messaging has become essential in today's interconnected world.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in improving hand-eye coordination, expanding our knowledge of the world, and fostering connections with others. Rather than being detrimental to our health or relationships, computers offer a multitude of benefits that enhance our lives in countless ways. Embracing technology responsibly can lead to a more enriched and interconnected society.
555	557	1	3	Dear editor of the @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers are essential for the future. The advancements in technology have brought about significant changes in our world. While it is important to prioritize physical exercise, the benefits of learning and exploring new things through technology cannot be overlooked. Without computers, many essential resources such as heat and clean water would be inaccessible to a large portion of the population.   Computers play a crucial role in our daily lives, from enabling communication with distant friends to assisting individuals with disabilities in expressing themselves. Organizations like @ORGANIZATION2 utilize computers to save lives by facilitating quick diagnoses and treatments in medical settings. The impact of computers in healthcare is immense, as they aid in research, diagnosis, and treatment processes, ultimately leading to better outcomes for patients.  Moreover, computers have revolutionized industries like the military, airforce, and @ORGANIZATION3. Military operations now heavily rely on computerized systems for surveillance, communication, and defense strategies. From thermal sights on weapons to remote-controlled aircraft, computers have significantly enhanced the effectiveness and safety of military personnel in various combat situations.

Embracing technology and harnessing its power is crucial for the advancement and well-being of society as a whole. It is clear that computers not only save lives but also play a vital role in shaping a better future for all.
556	558	1	3	"Some ""experts"" warn that spending too much time on computers can be harmful, but the advantages they offer to society cannot be overlooked. Computers help develop essential skills such as hand-eye coordination and provide opportunities for online education and work. Additionally, they enable people to connect with friends and family around the world, learn about different cultures, and stay in touch with loved ones regardless of geographical distances. Overall, computers have a positive impact on society by enhancing learning, communication, and global connectivity."
557	559	1	3	"Dear Local newspaper, in a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a monitor, their eyes staring at it blankly. Outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirrels running along fence posts. This is what will happen if people spend too much time on the computers. People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. This is why computers have a drastic negative effect on people.  First of all, people spend huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising. In a recent poll done by a magazine, it stated that 70% of people between the ages of 10 and 30 prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also states that since last year, child obesity has increased by 15%! A representative at a health organization states that the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years?  Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. Bird watchers monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions last year because people are not interested in nature anymore. In a study done by a researcher and his colleagues, 85% of individuals spend almost 30% more time indoors in front of electronic devices, most frequently computers, than they do outdoors. The researcher says, ""Due to the new advancements in technology, people are likely to spend more time indoors than outdoors, and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds.""  Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. In 2019, more than 80% of families ate dinner together, now, only 60% eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a monitor. This also leads to a higher crime rate. Because young children and adolescents don't have the personal support and guidance they need as a result of spending time in front of computers, there is a 25% chance that a child will commit a crime compared to the 10% chance a child would in 2015. Do you want that for our youth?  Now envision a world where people jog together in the park, as they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree. As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the birthday of a family member. This happy thought won't become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. So, local newspaper, I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time in front of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in your real lives. But the question is, will you?"
558	560	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 while computers undoubtedly offer many advantages, it is important to acknowledge that they also come with several drawbacks. In my opinion, the negative aspects of technology outweigh the positive ones. One significant issue is the strain that excessive computer use can put on our eyes. It is alarming to see an increasing number of children and adults needing glasses or contacts due to prolonged screen time. This not only affects our vision but also our overall health and well-being.  Moreover, the excessive use of computers can lead to a decrease in quality family time. Instead of engaging in activities together, family members often find themselves glued to their screens, missing out on valuable moments and connections. The impact of technology on family dynamics is undeniable, as it can create distance and hinder meaningful interactions.  Furthermore, the pervasive nature of technology has led to a lack of outdoor activities and physical exercise. Children and adults alike are spending more time indoors, isolated from the benefits of fresh air and physical activity. This sedentary lifestyle can have detrimental effects on our physical and mental health, contributing to a range of issues such as obesity and decreased social skills.  In essence, while computers have revolutionized the way we access information and communicate, it is crucial to strike a balance and not let technology consume our lives. By being mindful of our screen time and prioritizing real-life interactions, we can reclaim valuable time with our loved ones and prioritize our well-being. It is time to reevaluate our relationship with technology and ensure that it enhances, rather than detracts from, our overall quality of life.
559	561	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,   I believe that computers are beneficial to society because they play a crucial role in education. Students nowadays rely heavily on computers for their studies, as they store notes, research information, and complete projects online. Instead of spending hours in the library, students can access a vast amount of information with just a few clicks on the internet.   Furthermore, computers help students organize their work and present it neatly, which is essential for academic success. In today's digital age, having computer skills is crucial for students to excel in their academic endeavors.   Moreover, computers are not just limited to students; they serve as a valuable resource for people of all ages. Whether it is connecting with others, exploring new topics, or staying updated with current events, computers offer a wealth of information at our fingertips.   In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of our society, providing numerous benefits for education and personal growth. Embracing the technological advancements of the digital age can only enhance our learning experiences and overall quality of life.   Sincerely, [Your Name]

They enhance hand-eye coordination, provide access to information about distant places and people, and facilitate online communication. By using computers, individuals can improve their coordination skills through activities that require simultaneous hand and eye movements. Moreover, computers offer a cost-effective means to explore faraway destinations without physically traveling there.

563	565	1	3	Dear Newspaper, The world we live in today is heavily reliant on technology, with computers being one of the most common devices. While technology has its benefits, there are also significant drawbacks. Computers, in particular, have become a breeding ground for bullying, leading to negative impacts on individuals. Social media platforms like Facebook and MySpace, which are meant to connect people, often serve as platforms for harassment and cyberbullying. In a survey of eighth-grade students, a concerning number admitted to either being bullied or engaging in bullying online. Despite the harmful effects, many individuals continue to spend excessive amounts of time on their computers, affecting their physical health and social skills. The obsession with computers has led to a lack of exercise, weight gain, and a decline in face-to-face social interactions. Moreover, the reliance on online communication has resulted in poor grammar and spelling skills among children and teenagers, potentially impacting their academic and professional success in the future. While computers have their uses for research and communication, it is crucial to recognize the detrimental effects of excessive screen time. By reducing our dependence on computers, we can safeguard our well-being and interpersonal skills. It is essential to reconsider our relationship with technology and prioritize real-world connections over virtual ones.
564	566	1	3	Computers have a positive impact on society by helping build relationships through online communication. When people interact online, it strengthens their bond and connection. Additionally, computers can improve hand-eye coordination, especially through activities like typing on a keyboard. Education is another valuable aspect of computer usage, as individuals can learn about different cultures and historical events through various websites.

Overall, computers offer numerous benefits and opportunities for personal and educational growth.
565	567	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that computers can be a good thing and a bad thing for many reasons. First, I believe they are beneficial because they can assist with school work, such as conducting research and completing assignments. Additionally, computers help improve hand-eye coordination and enable communication with family members in other countries through webcams.  However, it is important to acknowledge that excessive computer use can have negative consequences. It can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, reducing the time available for physical exercise and outdoor activities. Furthermore, spending too much time on the computer can hinder face-to-face interactions with family and friends, impacting relationships and social skills.  Despite these drawbacks, I believe that computers are ultimately valuable tools that have revolutionized various aspects of our lives. It is crucial to find a balance in using computers, ensuring that they enhance our lives without overshadowing important aspects such as health and relationships. Computers can be powerful tools for learning, communication, and productivity, as long as they are used mindfully and in moderation.
566	568	1	3	Computers provide us with the ability to access information and research from distant locations, offering a plethora of advantages. They can enhance hand-eye coordination, particularly through typing skills development. Moreover, computers have become essential in modern society for tasks such as completing typed assignments and presentations. While it is crucial to utilize computers for necessary activities like research and booking vacations, it is important to avoid becoming addicted to non-essential websites that could potentially harm your computer. Overall, computers have a positive impact on individuals, but moderation and balance in usage are key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle that includes physical activity and social interactions.
567	569	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  I believe that the computer is not a good technology for our generation. While it has its benefits, such as providing access to information and communication, there are several negative impacts that should be considered.  One major concern is the lack of physical activity that occurs when individuals spend excessive time on the computer. This sedentary lifestyle contributes to the rising rates of obesity in children and adults. It is essential for people to prioritize physical activity and outdoor experiences over screen time.  Furthermore, the internet is filled with inappropriate content that is easily accessible to children. This poses a significant risk to their well-being and development. Parents and caregivers must monitor and restrict children's online activities to ensure their safety.  Lastly, cyberbullying has become a prevalent issue on the internet. The anonymity of the online world allows individuals to harass and harm others without facing consequences. It is crucial for society to address and combat cyberbullying to protect vulnerable individuals.  In conclusion, while the computer has its advantages, it is essential for individuals to be mindful of its negative impacts on health, safety, and social interactions. Balancing screen time with other activities is key to maintaining a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
568	570	1	3	"Your spending too much time on the computer your mom and dad well out. You realize it's time to get off and go outside. You spend about 10% more or less on the computer each day, but for good reasons. You can multi-task on it, talk to friends and family you haven't seen or talked to forever, and you can spend time outside as well as inside. If you were smart, you would not listen to those experts. Have you ever heard of the word multitasking? It's where you can do more than one thing at a time, for example, you can read and talk, or text and talk, or walk and be reading something. You have all these things you can do. Another example is when you're on the computer, you can listen to music and talk to friends or read. What you can even do is talk to your friends, listen to music, and do homework. By multitasking, about 90% of us can multitask. One of my friends told me that they just bought a laptop with a built-in camera, now they can talk to people they haven't seen in a long time. ""I haven't seen my sister since she moved to California two years ago, so I thought I would use the camera on my laptop to see her,"" said a mother of three. A computer or laptop can be good for talking to friends or family you haven't seen in a long time. Another student says, ""If you were smart and understanding, you would know why everyone's on the computer so much."" When you're on the computer and your friends start to talk to you about things, you understand why. You usually don't see your friends unless it's lunch or before class. Computers help talking to friends move easier than writing letters or waiting for class to get out. You get off the bus and realize that it's pure sunshine outside. You decide to do some or all of your homework now so you can go out and play. You're outside for about a few hours. When you come in, it's around 2:00 pm. You eat dinner and just want to unwind from the day's gigantic adventure, so you go on the computer. You can go on the computer around like wild animals outside too. Only responsible kids plan their time accordingly. In conclusion, it is important to know that computers are good for multitasking, talking to friends and family you haven't seen in a long time, and that you can go outside as well as stay inside. Now is the time to call, if you were smart, you wouldn't listen to these experts."
569	571	1	3	Computers today are much different from computers back then. They help you with projects or homework but many experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I think that computers help people in many ways, like teaching a hand-eye coordination. They're useful because people can talk to friends and family members that they haven't seen in a long time and computer skills are required in the real world.  Hand-eye coordination is very important and using a computer can help people build up the coordination. This helps because if one has to type a one-page report, then one who has good hand-eye coordination, or typing skills, can finish a report in a few minutes or so. If one has poor hand-eye coordination, well that few minute report will take about a few hours. No one likes to be sitting in front of a computer for a few hours.  Everyone has friends and best friends that they talk to every day, But what happens if that friend moves out-of-town, out-of-state or possibly out-of-country? They might be forgotten or never seen from again. Well, thanks to technology and the advancement of computers, people can chat online on social media platforms. They can catch up on things, check out what's new, even see posted pictures of them. The same thing can be applied to family members who have moved away. Who wouldn't want to talk to friends or family that haven't been heard from?  Lastly, having computer skills is very, very, very important in the real world. Skilled people who have a good knowledge of the computer world can get great jobs like a computer programmer for the state, or they can create websites for their own jobs. Other jobs people with computer experience can have would be an editor of movies or TV shows. That's big money there. No wonder schools have computer classes. It's to get students to have a good background of the computer.  Computers are not that bad. They teach hand-eye coordination, let people talk to other people online and can get people great jobs. Many educated people would agree that computers don't have a negative effect on people.
570	572	1	3	Dear leader of the local newspaper, I have heard the strange misconception that computers are ruining our society. I for one, think that this is a terribly made thought. To begin, the internet (provided with most home desktop computers) can teach us a lot about the world around us. Additionally, the whole fact of contacting others around the globe, as well as having a whole fun world to explore, makes computers more enjoyable. Finally, thousands of jobs around the world are either based on or work with computers. Due to this, computers are, without a doubt, beneficial to society. The first reason I need to clearly point out is that the computer holds tons of information that can't be found anywhere else. While books have to be republished as updates occur in the world, anything on the internet can be updated almost instantly, beneficial to students with school projects for subjects like math. Subsequently, people could actually go to school via online schools and colleges. Whilst regular colleges could cost around thousands of dollars in order to get in, online colleges are much rather cheap, affordable to anyone. Also, due to the high amounts of information online, schools seem to be growing obsolete as computers typically hold all information obtained in a regular school year. Because of this, computers are definitely beneficial to society. To build up, the internet provided with computers can bring loads of pleasure to those who use it wisely. Because of the growing population of those who use computers, companies tend to make computer shoes, which usually attracts viewers by the thousands each day. This makes television seem obsolete as well. Another major thing is that software comes out for the computer almost every day, allowing many things to be done by users. Software typically includes games, movies, and music. Finally, since staying in touch with others is a good thing, chatting with others across the globe is very easy and durable, allowing distant relatives to come in contact with you via various chat programs. Due to this, computers can bring loads of fun to users, and are thus beneficial to society. Lastly, due to the rising demand for computers, companies typically rely on computers for jobs. Since the internet population is growing, companies allow people to fill out applications and send in resumes in order to apply for a job in said company. Also, some jobs can only be done while online or using a computer. Many jobs these days, typically banks, rely on using the internet most of the time, and some actually are based on the internet. Because of this, workers can finish the job easily in one place, instead of having to go around and going to a boring looking building to do a boring job. With this reason, why doesn't anyone else see why computers are beneficial to society? With all of these reasons, I hope you see why computers are beneficial to society. Education just becomes a whole lot easier thanks to the internet. If education is not what you seek, you can then use the internet to have fun when you are bored. Finally, jobs can be completed even easier, and make workers more responsible. So, leader of the paper, do you really, along with everyone else, think that computers are a waste of time in life? In conclusion, computers are an integral part of our society and bring numerous benefits that enhance education, entertainment, and job opportunities. It is clear that the misconceptions about computers ruining society are unfounded, as they play a crucial role in advancing our daily lives.
571	573	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, the debate on whether modern computer activities are beneficial or detrimental to society continues to be a hot topic. While some argue that computers offer advantages such as teaching hand-eye coordination, providing access to information about distant places, and enabling social interactions, it is essential to acknowledge the negative impacts they can have on individuals.  One of the most pressing issues related to excessive computer use is the rise in obesity rates. People are spending more time in front of screens and less time engaging in physical activities, leading to weight gain and associated health problems. Furthermore, prolonged screen time can strain the eyes, causing discomfort and potential long-term damage to vision.  In addition to physical health concerns, computers have also facilitated a new form of bullying known as cyberbullying. The anonymity and reach of online platforms make it easier for individuals to harass and intimidate others, often with devastating consequences. Cases of cyberbullying have led to serious mental health issues and, in extreme situations, even suicide.  It is evident that while computers offer numerous benefits, they also pose significant risks to the well-being of individuals. Addressing the negative impacts of excessive computer use, such as obesity, eye strain, and cyberbullying, is crucial in promoting a healthier and safer society. Awareness and measures to mitigate these risks are essential to ensure that the benefits of technology are not overshadowed by its harmful effects.
572	574	1	3	You must be insane! Computers are very important to society. My first reason is, computers can be used for research. Secondly, purchases can be made. Lastly, you can talk and video chat. These are my three reasons why computers are important to society. If you want to know more send on. Firstly, computers can be used for research. For example, what if your boss wants to find the sales data of products? All you have to do is go to www.google.com, and look it up! Is is that easy. Also, what if you need to do research on a famous organization for school? Instead of reading books about them, you can type in their name, and there's your information. In today's world, almost everyone uses the computer for research. This is my first reason. Secondly, purchases can be made. What if you would like to buy a plane ticket to a remote location to help? You can go on the computer and buy a ticket at your convenience. You can order supplies that are needed in that location or send a gift that a relative/friend can have within days. How much simpler than going out and doing it yourself. This is my second reason. Lastly, you can talk and video chat. Imagine you own a business, and you need to have a meeting with other people, and you are all in different countries. What if you have relatives that live far away that you miss a lot? You can have a video call or family chat to stay connected. This is my last reason. I hope you consider my reasons why computers are very important to society.
573	575	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,   Computers have a positive impact on individuals as they help improve hand-eye coordination, provide opportunities to learn about different people and places, and offer entertainment options.   Firstly, computers play a crucial role in enhancing hand-eye coordination through various activities such as online sports games and typing exercises. These activities help individuals develop their motor skills and dexterity, leading to improvements in sports performance and typing speed. Additionally, the internet serves as a valuable resource for research, enabling individuals to gather information about diverse cultures, societies, and geographical locations. This access to knowledge broadens people's perspectives and enhances their understanding of the world around them.   Furthermore, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options, including online games and movies, allowing individuals to relax and unwind in their free time. This entertainment aspect not only provides enjoyment but also serves as a form of self-care and stress relief.   In conclusion, computers have become an essential tool in modern society, contributing to the development of hand-eye coordination, facilitating learning about different cultures, and providing entertainment options. It is evident that computers play a significant role in enhancing various aspects of our lives, making them an indispensable resource for individuals of all ages.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
574	576	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe computers have had a significant impact on society, offering numerous benefits to individuals in various aspects of their lives. One key advantage of computers is their ability to enhance knowledge and learning. With a simple search, one can access a wealth of information on any topic, making it easier to acquire new skills and expand one's understanding of the world. Moreover, computers can provide detailed instructions on various tasks, such as building projects or creating art, allowing individuals to explore their creativity and learn new skills.  Additionally, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options, from playing games to streaming movies and TV shows. This not only provides a source of enjoyment and relaxation but also helps individuals stay connected with popular culture. Furthermore, computers enable socialization through platforms like social media websites, where people can connect with friends and family, as well as make new acquaintances. This social interaction can help combat feelings of loneliness and contribute to overall mental well-being.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in modern society, offering numerous benefits that enhance learning, entertainment, and socialization. As technology continues to advance, it is clear that computers will become even more integrated into our daily lives, shaping the way we communicate, learn, and connect with others. Thank you for considering these points.
575	577	1	3	You argue that computers are detrimental and do not offer any benefits in physical life. However, it is important to acknowledge that computers can also be a valuable tool for improving physical and mental well-being. Many individuals utilize computers to access information on yoga poses, diet tips, and other health-related resources. This enables them to enhance their physical health and mental clarity through practices such as yoga and proper nutrition.  While it is true that excessive time spent on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter can lead to distractions and potential dangers, such as interacting with unknown individuals, it is essential to recognize that computers also provide numerous positive opportunities. For example, individuals can use computers to research travel sites, plan vacations, and explore the world from the comfort of their own homes. This can lead to personal growth, cultural enrichment, and a broader perspective on life.  In conclusion, it is crucial to consider the multifaceted nature of computers and not dismiss them entirely as detrimental. While it is important to be mindful of the potential risks associated with excessive computer use, it is equally important to recognize the numerous ways in which computers can enhance our lives physically, mentally, and emotionally. By utilizing computers responsibly and purposefully, individuals can harness their power to improve their overall well-being and quality of life.
576	578	1	3	Computers play a significant role in our daily lives, offering benefits such as improving hand-eye coordination, facilitating communication with loved ones, and providing access to information from around the world. However, excessive computer usage can have negative effects on our health and well-being. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and overall physical weakness. It is essential to strike a balance between computer use and physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  Regular exercise is crucial for staying in shape and preventing health issues related to a sedentary lifestyle. Unfortunately, many people spend hours on end sitting in front of a computer screen, neglecting opportunities to engage in physical activities. This behavior can lead to a decline in overall fitness and an increase in obesity rates. Implementing limits on computer usage can help individuals prioritize exercise and outdoor activities, promoting better health and well-being.  Moreover, excessive computer use can also have a negative impact on social interactions and quality of life. When individuals spend too much time on their computers, they may overlook opportunities to connect with friends and family, enjoy nature, and engage in recreational activities. It is important to find a healthy balance between screen time and real-life experiences to maintain strong relationships and fully appreciate the world around us.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous advantages, it is crucial to be mindful of the potential negative consequences of excessive usage. By limiting screen time, prioritizing physical activity, and fostering real-life interactions, individuals can maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Finding the right balance between technology and real-world experiences is key to overall well-being and fulfillment.
577	579	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  The detrimental effects of excessive computer usage on individuals and society are increasingly evident. Not only does prolonged screen time lead to a lack of physical activity, but it also hinders personal interactions with friends and family. This sedentary lifestyle can result in health issues, such as obesity and a reduced life expectancy. Children, in particular, are at risk of developing unhealthy habits by spending excessive time on computers instead of engaging in outdoor activities.  Experts warn that the current trend of children being overweight is a growing concern. Many children are foregoing outdoor play in favor of screen time, which not only affects their physical health but also deprives them of essential sunlight and vitamin D. Furthermore, the lack of face-to-face interaction with family members can lead to emotional disconnect and missed opportunities to create lasting memories.  It is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between technology use and real-life experiences. Prioritizing outdoor activities, exercise, and quality time with loved ones can significantly improve overall well-being and foster healthier relationships. By recognizing the negative impact of excessive computer use, we can take proactive steps to lead more fulfilling and wholesome lives.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
578	580	1	3	If your family primarily communicates online, it may not necessarily be a bad thing. In fact, I am in favor of kids and parents spending time online for various reasons. Firstly, many kids have friends that they communicate with online, which can be a convenient and effective way to stay connected. Secondly, with the increasing reliance on technology for schoolwork and research, having internet access at home can be essential for children to complete their homework and projects successfully. Lastly, online communication can also be crucial for staying in touch with family members who may live far away or have busy schedules.  It is a common scenario nowadays for kids to interact with their friends online, as most children are accustomed to using digital platforms for communication. Having access to the internet can enable them to maintain these friendships and social connections, even when they are unable to meet in person. Additionally, the internet serves as a valuable resource for educational purposes, allowing students to access information and resources that can aid them in their academic pursuits.  Furthermore, for families with members who are geographically separated, online communication can bridge the gap and facilitate regular interactions. Whether it is through email, social media, or video calls, the internet provides a convenient means for families to stay connected and engaged with each other's lives. This can foster stronger relationships and a sense of unity within the family unit.  While it is important to balance online activities with other aspects of life, such as physical exercise and face-to-face interactions, the internet can be a beneficial tool when used responsibly. By leveraging the opportunities provided by online communication, families can overcome barriers of distance and time to stay connected and engaged with each other. Ultimately, the internet can be a valuable asset in enhancing communication and relationships within families in today's digital age.
579	581	1	3	Computers are not benefiting society as they lead to less physical exercise, reduced time with family and friends, and limited opportunities to enjoy nature. The increasing reliance on computers has contributed to a rise in obesity levels due to decreased physical activity. Additionally, spending excessive time on computers can hinder face-to-face interactions with loved ones, impacting the quality of relationships. Furthermore, the allure of technology often keeps individuals indoors, depriving them of the rejuvenating experiences that nature offers. It is essential for individuals to strike a balance and prioritize activities that promote physical health, social connections, and appreciation for the natural world. In conclusion, while computers have their advantages, it is crucial for society to recognize the negative implications associated with excessive screen time and strive to maintain a healthy equilibrium between technology use and essential life experiences.
580	582	1	3	With the click of a mouse, you can access the internet. Computers and the internet are recent innovations that have become common in households. They have significantly improved and gained popularity in the last twenty years, benefiting society in various ways. Computers provide an easy way to learn and communicate, revolutionizing the way we access information and stay connected.  Without computers, life would be vastly different, especially in terms of research and communication. The internet offers a wealth of resources such as databases, encyclopedias, and articles, making it easier to find information on any topic. Searching for keywords online is faster and more efficient than skimming through numerous books. The ability to copy and paste information into a document further streamlines the process.  Additionally, computers have transformed communication by enabling people to stay in touch with loved ones around the world. Whether through email, instant messaging, or social media platforms like Facebook, individuals can easily connect with others regardless of geographical barriers. This convenience has become essential, especially in situations where families are separated due to job opportunities or other circumstances.  Moreover, the impact of computers extends beyond personal lives to the medical field, where they play a crucial role in research, diagnosis, and surgical procedures. Scientists and doctors rely on computers to make new discoveries, plan surgeries, and improve medical practices. The use of technology in healthcare has led to significant advancements, ultimately saving lives and enhancing patient care.  In conclusion, the technological advancements brought about by computers have reshaped our society in profound ways. They have facilitated learning, communication, and medical breakthroughs, ultimately making the world a more connected and knowledgeable place. The importance of computers in today's world cannot be overstated, and their continued development will undoubtedly bring about even greater benefits in the future.
581	583	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the experts who warn about the dangers of spending too much time on the computer. Being glued to the screen can lead to a sense of distance from family and friends, mood swings, weight gain, and a preoccupation with what the computer can offer. When someone spends excessive time on the computer, their loved ones may start to worry about them. Family members may feel neglected, and friendships can suffer as a result. I have personally experienced how excessive computer use can strain relationships and lead to misunderstandings. Additionally, prolonged screen time can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, leading to weight gain and health issues. I have seen how a friend's behavior changed drastically after becoming addicted to the computer, neglecting physical activity and social interactions. Furthermore, the vast capabilities of computers today can be overwhelming and addictive. Games, social media, and online chatting platforms can easily consume a person's time and attention, drawing them away from real-life experiences. It is essential to recognize the negative impacts of excessive computer use and strive for a balanced lifestyle that includes meaningful interactions with others and physical activity. We must be mindful of how technology influences our behavior and make conscious efforts to prioritize real connections over virtual ones. In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, it is crucial to set boundaries and prioritize personal well-being to avoid the negative consequences of excessive screen time.
582	584	1	3	Dear newspaper, I respectfully disagree with your views on computers. I believe that computers are incredibly valuable tools that can assist with various tasks such as projects, homework, and letter writing.   Computers are particularly helpful for projects, as they provide easy access to a wealth of information without the need to physically visit a library. They also eliminate the need for hand-drawn illustrations, as printers can produce high-quality images for presentations. Additionally, computers can expedite the homework process by allowing quick research and typing up assignments efficiently, saving time and effort.   Furthermore, writing essays on a computer offers numerous advantages, such as the ability to easily edit and format text, resulting in a polished final product. This is especially beneficial in avoiding the frustration of losing handwritten work and the potential for plagiarism if papers are misplaced and copied.   In terms of letter writing, computers enable swift communication through emails, reports, and personal correspondence. Whether sending love letters, updates to friends and family, or important documents, computers streamline the process and ensure timely delivery.  Overall, the versatility and efficiency of computers make them indispensable tools in modern life. While it is important to use them wisely and not solely rely on them, the numerous benefits they offer in various aspects of daily tasks cannot be overlooked. I urge you to consider the valuable role that computers play in enhancing productivity and communication.
583	585	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers! Computers! Computers! Computers seem to be the talk of the year. Many people believe that computers are needed for everyday life, but I would have to disagree. In my opinion we do not need computers. The effects computers have on kids and adults are astonishing. Humans today are not spending as much time in nature and exercising for a healthy body and a healthy planet. Also, as us kids are growing up, we have too many advantages because of computers. Thirdly, so much money is being used towards computers and not what's truly important! As you can see these three reasons alone should persuade anyone to believe that computers are harmful to all areas of life. First off, as we continue to use computers, our natural environment is going to waste. The effects on nature and people are horrible. Pollution is being spread all over the planet! People are becoming addicted to computers. I know it will surprise you when I tell you that the average person spends about ten hours on a computer a day! This is about half the day! This is a terrifying effect on people because now these computers are brainwashing us! Instead of going on the computer all day, we should be going outside to enjoy fresh air and the sun. Therefore, banning computers would have a positive effect. Today, many are losing their ability to write or forgetting about the simple things life has to offer. Would writing an essay with a pencil and paper be so bad? This may be old-fashioned, but there are an enormous amount of great effects for using pen and paper. Maybe, the future states would become smarter and contain more knowledge. By writing everything out, it is proven to help remember important facts easier and for a longer amount of time. Writing on paper is like writing it in your brain. Therefore, students, children, and adults would benefit by having better handwriting. Since most information is typed on the computer, people are forgetting how to write neatly, clearly, and responsibly. Lastly, but most definitely not least, is my third reason as to why computers are affecting humans negatively. Humans are spending huge amounts of money on getting the latest computer technology. Most people's paychecks are being used for their computers. These fancy computers are very expensive but also very useless. In my opinion, many people are just following a trend. Instead, the money can be spent on schools and especially the wars! Do you hear the humming of the computer, the clicking of the buttons? Realize that these sounds are not what you should be spending! To wrap it up, computers affect people. There are many reasons to support this, but here are three. One is that people are not spending any time in nature! Another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic and not spending the time to learn things in quality. Thirdly, people are using all their money on those computers! I know some people think computers are very useful, but I know now, after you have read this article, you know how unuseful computers really are.
584	586	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people. The internet allows people to communicate, learn about various topics, and even improve their health.

Furthermore, the internet can also be beneficial for one's physical well-being. By utilizing online resources, individuals can find healthy recipes, exercise routines, and medical advice to maintain a balanced lifestyle. Despite concerns about excessive screen time leading to health issues, the internet can actually support overall wellness when used in moderation. In conclusion, the internet, when used responsibly, can have a positive impact on people by enhancing communication, learning opportunities, and health awareness.
585	587	1	3	More and more people are using computers nowadays, with approximately 81% of the population in the United States owning one.

They are used for tasks such as managing registers, operating ATMs, and even controlling cars. Having a computer at work can streamline processes, like sending documents or accessing important information swiftly. It's no wonder that most jobs nowadays require employees to be proficient with computer usage.  Additionally, computers are invaluable tools for education.

587	589	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that going on the computer has a positive effect on people. It is also true that some people are not getting enough exercise. To prevent not getting enough exercise we should play sports or have family activities to atleast get out of our house. Everybody needs to stop being lazy and get active. I think that an exercise day should be made and turned into a tradition. It could be twice a year or more a month or whatever is picked as long as there is one day @LOCATION2 or even more than @LOCATION2 can exercise on. This will help promote a healthier lifestyle and encourage people to prioritize their physical well-being. Let's make exercising a regular part of our lives to stay healthy and active.
588	590	1	3	I use computers all the time and maintain my health. Using a computer more often than exercising does not necessarily mean one is unhealthy. Computers play a significant role in various aspects of life. They help with accessing weather information, scheduling appointments, and entertainment through games and communication with others. Despite these benefits, excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, highlighting the importance of incorporating exercise into daily routines. It is essential for individuals to strike a balance between computer use and physical activity to ensure overall well-being.
589	591	1	3	Dear people in the world,   Computers are widely used for various purposes such as internet browsing, gaming, work, and school. While some believe that computers are beneficial for activities like improving hand-eye coordination, learning about different cultures, and socializing online, I, a student at Mystic Middle School, hold a different perspective.  One significant issue with computers is the potential for addiction, as seen in computer camps where children are separated from their devices and engaged in outdoor activities. Moreover, the internet poses risks due to the possibility of interacting with strangers who may have malicious intentions. Additionally, the performance of computers tends to degrade over time, often requiring costly repairs or replacements every few years.  The uncertainty surrounding computer malfunctions and data loss is a constant concern, highlighting the drawbacks of relying heavily on technology. Rather than enhancing our lives, computers can sometimes lead to more trouble and complications. Ultimately, it is essential to exercise caution and moderation when using computers to avoid potential pitfalls and negative consequences.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]
590	592	1	3	Computers play a crucial role in benefiting society by facilitating re-connection with people, offering a powerful search engine for research purposes, and providing a platform to watch videos. Social networking sites like Facebook enable individuals to reconnect with long-lost friends and family members, fostering meaningful relationships. Additionally, search engines like Google provide easy access to a vast amount of information, making research more efficient and productive. Furthermore, platforms like YouTube offer a diverse range of videos for entertainment, education, and self-expression. Overall, computers have become an essential tool in modern society, enhancing communication, knowledge acquisition, and entertainment.
591	593	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers take away from our lives in a negative way. New advancements in technology in general take away from our lives negatively. It can contribute to obesity, turn you into a couch potato, and can take away from your social life. It's not that computers arent useful, it's that people are using them too frequently. As a country, @LOCATION1 has more obese people each decade. A good way to lessen the obese population, is to get them out of that comouter chair. @CAPS5 all you do is sit on a chair and play flash games and watch youtube videos all day, your sure to put on a few pounds, Those few pounds do accumulate. @CAPS6 fast food companies like @ORGANIZATION1 contribute to obesity, so do computers. When someone eats a big mac burger, should they go upstairs to play a flash game, or go work out at the gym? Trust me, you arent going to burn any calories by clicking a mouse. People who often use the computer, rarely see the true beuty of nature. They are too busy shooting animated rabbits to go see real rabits. Would you rather take a walkin the park, or stare at a computer screen for @DATE1 and a half hours? The world is a beutiful place, and the more you @CAPS2 @CAPS3, the less you realize it. Being on the computer can even effect your social life. The more you socialize to people you don'@CAPS4 know on the computer, the less you know how to communicate to real people I know that I would want a real girlfriend, not a virtual one. You @MONTH1 be too into a @CAPS4.V. show that your watching on the computer, to even spend time with loved ones. Your family is much more important than a silly computer game. In conclusion, I'd like to say that (in my opinion) computers should be used a little less. Who wouldn'@CAPS4 want to be a fit, nature love, popular kid @CAPS5 people would just spend a little less time on the computer, and a little more time in reality, You could be a kid like that. (@CAPS6 I'm sure the @CAPS1 is an adult.) In a world filled with technological distractions, it's essential to find balance and prioritize real-life experiences over virtual ones. Remember, the true beauty of life lies beyond the confines of a screen.
592	594	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that spending too much time on a computer can have negative effects on individuals. One key reason is the importance of exercise. It is crucial for people to engage in physical activities such as jogging or working out in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle and enjoy the benefits of being outdoors. Additionally, socializing with friends and family is essential for personal well-being. Spending quality time with loved ones can create lasting memories and strengthen relationships. Lastly, being active through sports or other physical activities is vital for overall health and fitness. By staying active, individuals can improve their physical strength and endurance, leading to a healthier lifestyle. In conclusion, it is important to strike a balance between screen time and real-world interactions in order to lead a fulfilling and healthy life.
593	595	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @MONTH1,  It is true that computers can sometimes lead to less exercise, decreased time spent in nature, and reduced quality time with family and friends. However, the benefits of computers in our society cannot be overlooked. Computers play a crucial role in helping students with their homework and projects, facilitating communication with others, and providing access to a wealth of information.  For students, computers are indispensable tools that aid in research, organization, and presentation of their work. They can improve academic performance and set students up for success in the future. Additionally, computers enable families to stay connected with long-distance relatives, friends, and colleagues. They foster communication and help maintain relationships even when physical distance separates individuals.  Despite these advantages, it is essential to recognize that computers also pose risks, such as exposure to inappropriate content and the threat of viruses. Implementing robust virus protection software and parental controls can help mitigate these risks and create a safer online environment for users of all ages.  In conclusion, while computers have their drawbacks, the benefits they offer to students, families, and society as a whole are undeniable. By leveraging the positive aspects of computers while addressing their potential pitfalls, we can maximize the value of these technological tools in our daily lives.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
594	596	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,   I believe it is crucial for people to strike a balance between spending time on the computer and engaging in real-world activities. The excessive use of computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, causing health issues such as weight gain and lack of physical exercise. Additionally, spending too much time online can result in neglecting relationships with family members and missing out on important moments in their lives. While it is important to stay connected through technology, it is equally essential to prioritize real-life interactions and activities. Ultimately, finding a healthy balance between screen time and real-world experiences is key to leading a fulfilling and well-rounded life.   Sincerely,   [Your Name]
595	597	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Technology truly is a remarkable thing in our lives. Computers, for example, offer a multitude of benefits to society. They provide easy access to information, making it convenient for people to learn about different places and individuals, as well as enabling seamless communication. Forgetting homework assignments or event schedules is no longer a problem with the internet at our fingertips. We can quickly look up details online, ensuring we stay organized and prepared. Planning trips becomes effortless as we can research destinations and compare prices online. Additionally, staying in touch with loved ones, even those far away, is made simple through video calls and messaging. The impact of computers on our lives is truly invaluable, offering us the ability to access information, learn about the world, and connect with others effortlessly.
596	598	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 do you ever find yourself yearning to step outside and engage in a spirited game of football with your loved ones? I certainly do. I am convinced that nearly @PERCENT1 of children are glued to their computer screens either out of sheer boredom or due to the addictive nature of technology. This trend raises concerns about the amount of time spent online rather than with family. It is alarming how dangerous the internet can be for young individuals. I recall a chilling incident involving my cousin who innocently arranged to meet someone from MySpace at the movies, only to discover that the person was a predator with malicious intentions. This experience serves as a stark reminder of the importance of online safety. Would you prefer your children to be safe by your side or in the company of a stranger? While computers can be beneficial for educational or professional purposes, idly spending hours online for leisure is not conducive to forming meaningful connections with loved ones, especially children. Don't you wish to cherish quality time with your children before they embark on their own paths in life? Simple activities like playing football can foster a stronger bond between you and your child. Encouraging them to step away from the computer by temporarily restricting access and engaging in outdoor activities can lead to memorable experiences and deeper connections. It's time to prioritize genuine interactions over digital distractions. Let's make a conscious choice to step away from the screens and create lasting memories with our loved ones.
597	599	1	3	There has been a debate over whether computers benefit society or harm it. Personally, I believe that computers are beneficial to society. One way in which computers benefit society is by improving hand-eye coordination. Typing fast and accurately on a computer keyboard can help enhance hand-eye coordination. With practice, individuals can become more skilled and agile in using computers, similar to how my grandmother became very coordinated through years of typing. Research has shown that people who type for at least four years can improve their hand-eye coordination significantly.  Another advantage of computers is that they enable individuals to learn about distant places without physically traveling there. Through computers, students can research and complete projects on different countries without leaving their classrooms. Additionally, people can satisfy their curiosity about various locations by simply browsing the internet. For example, my mother learned about a specific place by looking it up online. Furthermore, computers allow individuals to explore different schools and colleges without visiting them in person, making the education process more accessible.  Moreover, computers facilitate communication through email, instant messaging, and video chat. Email provides a convenient way to correspond with others over the internet, as my baseball coach informed my parents about team selection through email. Instant messaging allows for immediate communication with friends, enhancing social interactions. Video chat, on the other hand, enables face-to-face conversations with individuals who are not physically present, making communication more personal and engaging.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in improving hand-eye coordination, facilitating learning about distant places, and enhancing communication through various online platforms. These benefits demonstrate how computers are valuable tools that contribute to the advancement of society.
598	600	1	3	Dear People of the Newspaper,  Computers have both positive and negative effects on individuals. They can be beneficial for schoolwork and research, providing up-to-date information on various subjects. However, excessive use of computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, where individuals spend too much time indoors and neglect physical activity. This can result in health issues such as weight gain and lack of fresh air.  While some people use computers responsibly for work purposes, others spend excessive amounts of time on social media or gaming. This can lead to a lack of real-life social interactions and a disconnect from the world around them. It is important for individuals to find a balance between using computers for necessary tasks and engaging in outdoor activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  In conclusion, computers have the potential to be valuable tools for education and work, but it is essential for individuals to use them in moderation and prioritize physical activity and real-world interactions. Finding a balance between screen time and outdoor activities is key to maintaining overall well-being.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
599	601	1	3	Technology is advancing every day with computers becoming a popular device. While some may argue that computers do not benefit society, I believe they do. One key advantage is the ability to explore information from home. In the past, one would have to visit a library, search for a specific book, and spend hours finding the necessary information. With computers, a simple search on the internet can provide instant results, saving time and gas money. Additionally, computers allow for free online communication through email, social media, and messaging platforms. This eliminates the need for costly phone calls or visits. Furthermore, computers offer various entertainment options such as viewing pictures, taking quizzes, playing games, and chatting with others. In conclusion, computers bring convenience, efficiency, and connectivity to society, making them a valuable technological tool.
600	602	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, you @MONTH1 know that computers are not only helpful machines but also essential tools for education and creativity. Computers provide access to online education, allowing individuals like my cousin @PERSON2 to earn a degree in accounting and secure a successful job in the field. Additionally, computers facilitate research and learning, as demonstrated by my history paper on @LOCATION2 that received top marks after just an hour of online research.  Moreover, computers enhance creativity and hand-eye coordination through various activities and games. Studies have shown that using computers can boost creativity and improve hand-eye coordination, making them valuable tools for individuals in various professions, including editors, writers, and readers. Furthermore, computers serve as a primary means of communication, connecting people worldwide without physical contact.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in education, creativity, and communication, benefiting individuals in numerous ways. Those who do not utilize computers may be missing out on valuable opportunities for growth and development.
601	603	1	3	Dear Parents,  High-tech devices like computers have become an integral part of our lives, allowing us to connect with others, research information, and play games. However, the excessive use of computers has led to negative consequences for our children.   Children are spending countless hours in front of screens, leading to a lack of physical activity. This sedentary lifestyle contributes to the rising rates of obesity among children today. Additionally, the dangers of online chatting cannot be ignored, as it puts children at risk of being targeted by predators.   Furthermore, the financial burden of purchasing expensive computers can strain a household budget. Money that could be used for more essential needs is being wasted on devices that harm our children's well-being.   It's essential for parents to prioritize their children's health and safety by limiting screen time, encouraging physical activity, and monitoring online activities. Let's not allow computers to dictate our children's lives and instead focus on providing them with a healthy and balanced upbringing.  In conclusion, the negative impacts of excessive computer use on children's health, safety, and family finances cannot be ignored. It's time for parents to take a stand and make responsible choices for the well-being of their children. Let's ensure that our children are active, safe, and not consumed by the harmful effects of technology.
602	604	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 are many reasons why computer technology benefits society. One reason is how computers help with education. According to a poll at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of students believe that computers assist them in their academic careers. Additionally, many adults use computers for education, with @PERCENT2 of students at @CAPS2 high school completing their studies through online classes.

Thus, the benefits of computer technology should be recognized and preserved for the advancement and connectivity of society."
603	605	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editor, I believe that limiting your screen time to just a few minutes a day can have a positive impact on your overall health. While using technology is important, excessive screen time can lead to various health issues such as eye strain and other physical ailments. It is crucial to prioritize activities such as exercise and outdoor time to maintain a healthy balance.  Many people spend hours on end in front of screens, leading to deteriorating eye health and other physical problems. It is alarming to see the rise of individuals who are addicted to screens, with a significant percentage of the population being affected. Scientists predict that this number will only continue to increase in the coming years if we do not address this issue.  While technology is a valuable tool for communication and productivity, it is essential to limit screen time and focus on engaging in other activities that promote physical and mental well-being. Reading a book, going for a walk, or spending time with loved ones are all beneficial alternatives to excessive screen time. By making small changes to our daily routine, we can improve our overall health and well-being.  In conclusion, it is important to be mindful of the amount of time we spend in front of screens and prioritize activities that promote a healthy lifestyle. By finding a balance between technology use and other activities, we can ensure that we maintain our physical and mental health in the long run.
604	606	1	3	Dear newspaper, I believe that spending excessive time on computers can have negative impacts on both children and adults. While computers can offer some benefits, such as developing hand-eye coordination and stimulating the economy through sales, it is important to also prioritize outdoor activities and exercise. Excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can have adverse effects on physical health. Moreover, relying heavily on online sources can expose individuals to fake information and increase the risk of plagiarism. Instead of solely relying on computers for information, it is crucial to engage in real-life experiences by visiting places and enjoying the outdoors. By striking a balance between computer use and outdoor activities, individuals can develop a well-rounded set of skills and lead a healthier lifestyle. In conclusion, while computers have their advantages, it is essential to not neglect the benefits of spending time outdoors and engaging in physical activities.
605	607	1	3	Dear newspaper, I read an article in the newspaper that discussed the benefits and potential drawbacks of people using computers. I believe that utilizing computers can be advantageous for various reasons. One of the primary benefits is the ease of accessing information online. Whether it is for students conducting research for a project or individuals seeking information on a specific topic, the internet provides a wealth of resources that can be beneficial. Additionally, typing assignments on a computer allows for quick and efficient completion, saving time and effort.   Moreover, the internet often contains more extensive information than traditional sources, making it a valuable tool for learning. However, it is essential to be cautious of misinformation and ensure that the information obtained is accurate. Beyond academic purposes, computers also serve as a platform for online shopping, communication with friends, and entertainment. Talking to friends online can be a convenient way to stay in touch, especially when face-to-face interactions are limited.   Furthermore, for young students, learning to type on a computer can be a valuable skill that will benefit them in the future. It not only enhances typing speed but also aids in improving reading and vocabulary skills. In conclusion, while spending excessive time on computers can have drawbacks, the benefits of using them for research, communication, and learning far outweigh the disadvantages. As long as individuals use computers responsibly and in moderation, they can be a valuable tool in various aspects of life.

Additionally, computers are essential in various industries such as the navy, healthcare, and logistics, facilitating operations and improving efficiency.  While some may criticize the addictive nature of technology, it is undeniable that computers have become indispensable in our modern world.

607	609	1	3	Dear Newspaper,   I believe that computers have a positive impact on our lives for several reasons. Firstly, they are invaluable tools for research, whether it be for school assignments or work projects. With a computer, information is readily accessible at our fingertips, making the research process much more efficient. Additionally, computers offer a wide range of fun games and activities that can provide entertainment for individuals of all ages. On a rainy day, for example, a computer can be a source of endless amusement for the whole family.   Moreover, computers enable us to stay connected with long-distance relatives through video calls and messaging apps. This technology has made it easier than ever to maintain relationships with loved ones who may be far away. Personally, I have found great joy in using a webcam to communicate with my grandmother who lives in another city.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in our daily lives by facilitating research, providing entertainment, and fostering communication with distant family members. The versatility and convenience of computers make them an essential tool for modern living. I hope that this perspective sheds light on the numerous benefits that computers bring to our lives.  Sincerely,   [Your Name]
608	610	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 people often argue that computers bring numerous benefits to society. However, I hold a different perspective. In my view, the risks associated with computers far outweigh the advantages they offer.  For instance, consider my father, who has successfully run his business without ever using a computer. Instead of relying on digital records, he keeps all important documents safely stored in a physical safe. This approach proved to be a wise decision when one of his friends lost all their files to a computer virus. My father prefers to handwrite all his papers and notes, believing in the security and reliability of this traditional method. He even suggests using a typewriter for typing, rather than risking digital vulnerabilities.  Moreover, the internet poses a significant threat to personal safety and privacy. Social media platforms like Facebook can easily become breeding grounds for impersonation and deceit. This can lead to dangerous situations, such as kidnappings or worse. Additionally, the wealth of personal information stored on computers makes individuals susceptible to cyber attacks. A simple virus can expose all the details that one has shared online, leaving them vulnerable to various forms of exploitation.  I come from a family that values hard work and practicality over the distractions of the digital world. We spend our days on the farm or in the barn, focusing on manual labor rather than being consumed by online activities. For us, the internet is merely a tool for educational purposes, with no place in our daily lives beyond that.  In conclusion, while computers may offer convenience and efficiency, the potential dangers they bring cannot be ignored. My family's reliance on traditional methods has proven to be a secure and dependable choice, keeping us safe from the risks associated with the digital age. Sometimes, the old-fashioned way truly is the best way.
609	611	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have @NUM1 reasons why computers have effects on people. First, prolonged computer use can have negative effects on one's eyesight. Staring at screens for extended periods can strain the eyes and potentially lead to vision problems. Secondly, the convenience of computers often leads people to spend excessive amounts of time on them, neglecting other activities and social interactions. This can result in a sedentary lifestyle and isolation from real-world experiences. Finally, the vast array of online activities, such as social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter, can consume a significant amount of time and attention, diverting individuals from more meaningful pursuits. In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, it is important to use them in moderation and prioritize physical health and real-life relationships.
610	612	1	3	In our society, computers play a significant role, with some believing that they enhance our community and benefit its citizens, while others argue that computers are detrimental to the people in our society. I believe that computers have the potential to propel our society forward and can greatly benefit its people. Computers can enhance individuals by improving hand-eye coordination, providing opportunities to learn about the world, and enabling communication with others.  One of the ways computers benefit people is by improving hand-eye coordination, which is essential for various activities that involve physical dexterity. While some may argue that computers replace physical exercise, they actually enhance a person's ability to perform tasks that require hand-eye coordination. For example, in sports, having good hand-eye coordination is crucial for success, and using computer programs can help individuals develop and refine this skill. Additionally, good hand-eye coordination can be a life-saving attribute in certain situations, such as being able to react quickly to avoid harm.  Furthermore, computers offer a gateway to learning about different cultures and lifestyles around the world without the need to physically travel. This is particularly beneficial for those who may not have the means to travel or explore the world in person. By accessing information online, individuals can broaden their knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of diverse perspectives and experiences. For students, this can be a valuable tool for research and expanding their worldview.  Moreover, computers have revolutionized communication by enabling people to connect with others globally through various platforms such as video chats, emails, and instant messaging. This ease of communication has made it possible for individuals to stay in touch with family, friends, colleagues, and business partners regardless of geographical barriers. This interconnectedness has strengthened relationships and facilitated collaboration on a global scale.  In conclusion, computers have undoubtedly propelled our society into the digital age, offering countless benefits to its citizens. Through enhancing hand-eye coordination, facilitating global learning experiences, and enabling seamless communication, computers have significantly enriched the lives of people in our community. Embracing the advancements in technology can undoubtedly lead to a more connected and informed society.
611	613	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, technology has become an integral part of our lives, with many people using computers for various purposes. While some believe that technology enhances learning, others argue that it hinders it. Personally, I see both advantages and disadvantages to using computers. On one hand, they offer opportunities for expanded learning experiences. On the other hand, excessive computer use can lead to a lack of physical activity, which is a major concern.  The rise of technology has made computers more accessible, leading to increased screen time for many individuals. Unfortunately, this often comes at the expense of exercise and outdoor activities. As a result, children and teenagers are spending more time indoors, which can contribute to health issues such as obesity. Furthermore, excessive computer use can also impact social relationships, as it may lead to neglecting time spent with friends and family.  Moreover, constant computer use can potentially develop into an addiction, causing individuals to prioritize screen time over other important aspects of their lives. This addiction can be challenging to overcome without external support. It is crucial to recognize the negative effects of excessive computer use and take steps to maintain a healthy balance between technology and other activities.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits for learning and entertainment, it is essential to be mindful of the potential drawbacks associated with excessive use. Striking a balance between screen time and other activities is key to maintaining overall well-being and healthy relationships. It is important to be aware of the impact of technology on our lives and make conscious choices to ensure a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
612	614	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to express my agreement with the points raised in the writing prompt. People indeed spend excessive amounts of time on their computers, engaging in activities such as browsing social media platforms like MySpace, playing online games, and chatting with others online. This constant online presence can lead to various negative consequences, such as the risk of identity theft, lack of physical activity, and potential conflicts with friends or family members. It is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between their online activities and real-life interactions. Getting active outside and enjoying other offline activities is essential for overall well-being and social engagement. By reducing screen time and participating in outdoor activities, individuals can lead a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle. Thank you for considering these perspectives on the importance of limiting computer usage and embracing a more active lifestyle.
613	615	1	3	Computers should be for everyone! Dont you think?, I do. And here's how @CAPS1 gonna convince you. Computers can basically be called a gateway to learning. Positive effects that computers have on peole is that, it teaches hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and even allow people to talk online with other people. These great qualities computers have for people are fantastic. Also the fact that computers just keep upgrading as time goes by. So, by you reading this introduction, I hope you are satisfied with what I am going to in order to show you that computers are positive devices and can be helpful to everyone. Firstly, as I started in my introduction paragraph, computers help teach people hand-eye coordinates. This i believe is a good thing to know because without it, there arent many things you could do. For example fly a plane. You wouldn't be able to do that without both hand and eye coordinates because you would have to manually move the plane, and check to see if everythings in order by multi-tasking. Furthermore, this is just one given reason on why computers are positive towards everyone's benefit. Secondly, computers give people the ability tolearn about faraway places and people. This is also good for people's benefits because, theres knowledge in every bit of it. Your learning about others cultures, heritage, family history, and so forth and so on. This could also help you in the long run with any job you want to do because knowledge can get you anywere. It can get you very far in life so learn as much as you can, and I beleive computers can do so. This is another reason why computers can be positive. As for the last reason, I say that peolple can also talk to other people online on the computer.This is also beneficial because again, like I stated in my @NUM1 paragraph, you can learn many things that way and meet new people. Now dont you think computers can benefit anyone! I do and will always have the same opinion that is positive towards computers. For my conclusion, I would like to say that I hoped you enjoyed every bit of what I had to say, and you can also agree with the positive affects computers have on people. I truly beleive that computers are beneficial to all people and should continue to be around. it benefits society, and I enjoy every bit of using it. Thank you.   Computers have become an essential tool in modern society, providing countless benefits to individuals of all ages and backgrounds. The ability to learn hand-eye coordination, explore faraway places, and connect with others online are just a few of the advantages that computers offer. These technological advancements continue to evolve, offering even more opportunities for growth and learning. Embracing the positive impact of computers can truly enhance the lives of everyone, making them an invaluable resource for education and communication. Let's continue to appreciate and utilize the power of computers for the betterment of society as a whole.
614	616	1	3	Dear Newspaper, People often argue that technology, particularly computers, is making individuals lazier and less inclined to engage with the real world. They claim that spending excessive time on computers can lead to neglect of family, decreased physical activity, and exposure to potential dangers online.   Firstly, the importance of spending time with family cannot be overstated. While computers offer endless information and entertainment, nothing can replace the bond formed through quality time spent with loved ones. Family outings, gatherings, and conversations are crucial for building relationships and creating lasting memories. Prioritizing screen time over family interactions can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnect.  Secondly, the sedentary nature of computer use can contribute to physical inactivity and poor health. Instead of enjoying outdoor activities or exercise, individuals may find themselves glued to their screens for extended periods. This lack of movement can result in various health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular problems, and musculoskeletal disorders. It is essential to balance screen time with physical activities to maintain overall well-being.  Lastly, the internet poses risks, especially when interacting with strangers online. People can easily misrepresent themselves, leading to potential dangers such as fraud, harassment, or even physical harm. Moreover, the prevalence of inappropriate content online, including explicit images and videos, underscores the need for caution and vigilance while navigating the digital world.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is crucial to strike a balance between technology use and real-world experiences. Prioritizing family time, engaging in physical activities, and practicing online safety measures are essential for maintaining a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. Remember, the virtual world should never take precedence over the real connections and experiences that enrich our lives.
615	617	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,  I do not believe that computers benefit society. I have heard experts express concerns about people spending excessive time on their computers, neglecting important aspects of life. The addiction to computers can lead to neglect of family and friends, as individuals prioritize screen time over personal relationships. This behavior is concerning as it can have long-lasting effects on social bonds.  Furthermore, the excessive time spent on computers can be detrimental to individuals' overall well-being. Statistics indicate that both teenagers and adults spend a significant amount of time on the internet, which can be counterproductive and prevent them from engaging in more meaningful activities. Time is a valuable resource, and it should be used wisely to foster personal growth and development.  Moreover, the lack of physical activity due to excessive computer usage is a growing concern. Children, in particular, are at risk of obesity and other health issues if they do not engage in regular exercise. It is essential to strike a balance between screen time and physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  In conclusion, the negative impact of excessive computer usage on personal relationships, time management, and physical health outweighs the perceived benefits. It is crucial for individuals to prioritize real-life interactions, manage their time effectively, and engage in regular exercise to lead a fulfilling and healthy life.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
616	618	1	3	Dear @CAPS1: People are spending far too much time on computers, both children and adults alike. However, it is important to consider that anything you can do on a computer can also be done without one. It is essential for individuals to spend more time outside experiencing nature, as the real world offers unparalleled beauty and benefits.  One challenge posed is to name one thing that can be done on a computer that cannot be accomplished without it. The truth is, research can be conducted using books and magazines, social interactions can be carried out in person or through phone calls and letters, and information about current events can be obtained from newspapers or news broadcasts. Even design work can be done traditionally with pen and paper instead of relying solely on computer programs.   Furthermore, activities such as downloading music can be replaced by purchasing CDs or attending live performances. The outdoor environment provides a wealth of sensory experiences, from the gentle breezes to the fresh scents of nature, enhancing overall well-being. Engaging in outdoor activities also promotes physical exercise and vitamin D absorption, in contrast to the sedentary nature of computer use, which can lead to health issues.  It is crucial to acknowledge that computers can have negative consequences, as they can expose individuals to inappropriate content and facilitate illegal activities. Children may misuse the internet, jeopardizing their friendships and safety. The ease of online communication has also made it simpler for predators to target vulnerable individuals, posing a significant risk.  In conclusion, while computers have their uses, they should not replace the invaluable experiences that nature offers. It is essential to strike a balance and prioritize real-world interactions and outdoor activities for a healthier and safer society. Let us not overlook the detrimental effects of excessive computer use and strive to appreciate the beauty and benefits of the natural world.

In @DATE1, @PERCENT1 of the population was classified as obese or overweight, a significant increase from @PERCENT2 in the previous year. This trend is alarming and highlights the importance of engaging in physical activities outdoors.   Furthermore, spending time in nature allows for quality bonding time with family and friends.

While there are concerns about excessive screen time and its impact on health, the benefits of computers in communication, exercise, and healthcare cannot be overlooked. It is important to recognize the value of computers and utilize them responsibly to improve our well-being and overall quality of life.
623	625	1	3	"Wouldn't you agree that spending time on the computer takes away half of your life? Going on the computer can have a negative effect on you! Personally, I think not going on the computer benefits you, as it allows more time for your family, going outside, and staying healthy! Certainly, going on the computer will mean less time for exercising. For example, let's say you went on the computer for an hour; that hour could have been used to go outside and stay fit! Think about the choices here; you could either sit on a chair and play on the computer or take a nice run and burn a ton of calories! Statistics show that 70% of people that go on the computer instead of getting exercise are at risk for health problems, including obesity. As you can clearly see, going on the computer really isn't the healthiest choice to make.  Most definitely, going on a walk or enjoying nature is better than being on a computer. A girl named Sarah, from California, says, ""I love to enjoy the beauty of the outdoors that God gave to me. I wish I knew that years ago while I was a lazy woman on the computer. If you just even look out your window to see this beautiful world God created for us, you would want to go out there and enjoy it! Everyone wants to live like they're dying or, in other words, live life to the fullest! In order to do that, you have to see life and go out there and experience it, not sit on a computer! Without a doubt, this world is gorgeous, and it is worthwhile to see the beauty of nature!  Everyone knows that family comes before everything! For example, you might love the computer, but that love should not overpower the time you spend with your family! One day, on a Friday night, Sarah was on the computer, and her mother called saying, ""Sarah, it's time for dinner."" Sarah ignored her mom and chose to stay on the computer! You really cannot give up time with your friends and family since they are so important! I know with all my heart and soul that my family means the world to me, and everyone should make more time for each family member, not the computer!  It's now or never to decide if computers benefit society or not! Without computers, you could have so much free time for your friends and family if you could only imagine! Most importantly, this will not only benefit you but it will mean a lot to your family. So, what are you waiting for? Get off the computer and spend some quality time with your family! Remember, life is all about experiences and connections, not just staring at a screen."
624	626	1	3	Computers have a significant impact on people, and overall, their effects can be viewed as positive.

They are versatile tools that enhance productivity and connectivity, making tasks easier and faster to accomplish. In conclusion, computers have a positive influence on individuals, providing convenience and accessibility to a variety of resources and activities.
625	627	1	3	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, I do agree that exercising is important. I think that people should spend more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. The issue at hand is whether people should spend more time on their computers or allocate more time to activities like exercising and socializing.   One reason why I believe people should prioritize exercising over computer use is that it is crucial for individuals to watch what they eat and maintain their fitness levels. By being responsible for their health, they can set a good example for their children and instill healthy habits in them.   Furthermore, spending time in nature is essential as it allows individuals to disconnect from the digital world and appreciate the beauty of the environment. It is important to engage with the outdoors and explore new things rather than being glued to a screen all day.  Lastly, interacting with friends and family should take precedence over computer use as it provides valuable opportunities to learn and grow. By spending quality time with loved ones, individuals can create lasting memories and deepen their relationships.   In conclusion, it is vital for people to prioritize activities such as exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends over excessive computer use. These experiences can enrich our lives and contribute to our overall well-being. Let's focus on living in the present and making meaningful connections rather than being consumed by technology.
626	628	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, can you imagine where the world would be without computers? Our daily lives would be dull and boring without new technology. Computers help society do various activities that would be impossible if we didn't have computers. They give us the ability to learn at home, connect with other people, and provide a source of entertainment. From these reasons, our lives become easy and convenient, which is what most people strive to accomplish. The ability for an average person to learn has greatly increased. It has gone from just being able to go to school to the various ways to increase your intelligence on the computer. Programs such as language learning software, which teaches people how to speak a new language, are available on the computer. These programs are like going to school, but more accessible to the public. To further help the public, there are ways to gain college degrees online. Even if you attend a physical school, a computer can still help you excel in your work. Various sources of research are available on the computer, and if you like to surf the web, a computer is a great place for fun. However, some people still think computers have negative impacts. They claim that people are becoming too reliant on technology and losing touch with nature. However, there are also ways to appreciate nature through technology. Despite some concerns, computers greatly benefit us and are a good thing. New technology is a positive force that should keep expanding because of the benefits it brings such as gaining the ability to learn, connecting with people, and having fun.

With the click of a button, we can connect with people from around the globe through video calls, emails, and social media. This instant connectivity has bridged geographical gaps, allowing families to stay in touch and fostering relationships across continents. The ability to communicate globally has transformed how we interact and collaborate, bringing us closer together despite physical distances.  Lastly, computers play a crucial role in ensuring safety and security, particularly in times of crisis. During natural disasters like the recent earthquake in @LOCATION3, computers have been instrumental in locating missing individuals and reuniting families. Online platforms with person locators have been set up to help people find their loved ones, providing a sense of reassurance and support during challenging times.

628	630	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I am writing to express my concerns about the impact of computers on our society. While computers have undoubtedly revolutionized the way we live and work, I believe that they also have negative consequences that cannot be ignored.  One major issue is the negative impact on our physical health. With the increasing amount of time people spend on computers, there is a noticeable decrease in physical activity. Instead of going outside and enjoying nature, many individuals are glued to their screens, leading to a sedentary lifestyle that contributes to the rise in obesity rates.  Furthermore, the excessive use of computers can also have detrimental effects on our emotional well-being. People are spending more time interacting with screens than with real-life human connections, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. The virtual world created by computers can never replace the beauty and tranquility of nature.  Most importantly, computers pose significant risks to our safety and security. From online predators targeting vulnerable individuals to the threat of cyber attacks on personal information, the dangers of the digital world are very real. It is crucial that we remain vigilant and cautious when using computers to protect ourselves and our loved ones.  In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, we must also acknowledge the negative consequences they bring. It is essential that we find a balance between technology and the real world to ensure a healthy and secure future for all. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.
629	631	1	3	Dear Newspaper People, I believe that the positive effects of computers on society are undeniable.

They can assist in finding job opportunities, learning new skills, and enhancing communication with loved ones. Additionally, computers can aid in academic tasks, cooking, and discovering new recipes with just a click of a mouse. Overall, computers offer a multitude of benefits that contribute to both personal and professional growth.
633	635	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, of late there has been controversy over how computers affect people's lives. I believe that the effects on people are negative. My main reasons for this argument are the impact on a person's health and well-being. Did you know that over @PERCENT1 of kids and teens are obese, and computers can contribute to this statistic? If a person spends excessive time on the computer instead of engaging in physical activity, they can become overweight, which poses serious health risks and can prevent them from exercising.  Furthermore, excessive computer usage can lead to social isolation and affect family relationships. For example, my cousin used to be outgoing, but now he spends all his time on the computer, neglecting interaction with his family. This has caused a strain on their relationships, as he is unable to engage with them beyond online communication.  In addition to health and social implications, excessive computer usage can also have a negative impact on academic performance. Many teens, including myself, use the internet for homework but can easily get distracted by social media platforms like Facebook. This distraction can lead to poor grades and further problems down the line.  Overall, it is evident that computers can have detrimental effects on individuals, ranging from health issues to social isolation and academic performance. It is important to raise awareness about these negative consequences and encourage a balanced approach to computer usage for the well-being of everyone involved. Thank you for considering these points.
634	636	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I feel that computers are very useful to society. For example, millions of people and companies and small businesses require the use of computers in order to optimally run their business. Everyone who uses computers on a daily basis can confirm that they are very useful. In fact, computers are so useful, some schools are starting to notice. I highly recommend that you get acquainted with such a useful and very recognized piece of technology. Did you know that many billion-dollar companies and small businesses require the uses that a computer has to offer? For example, my mother is a former district manager of the fast-food company, @ORGANIZATION1. When she worked at the company, they gave her a laptop that she could use only for her work. This proves my point that companies and small businesses require the features of a computer to smoothly run the business of which they run or one employed at. The technology of computers has brought education to new levels. Some teachers (including my own, @PERSON1) have taken the initiative to incorporate the modern technology of computers into their teachings. Classes have even been created in schools because of the popularity of computers. For example, at my school, a computer education (or, comp, for short) class has been created for kids to understand the knowledge and skills using a computer can give to them in the real world. In my opinion, it is great that computers are incorporated in so many places. Computers are used by millions of people every day. Such businesses are corporate like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are starting to see the brilliance in using computers in their company. In fact, computers are so useful and helpful, teachers have taken up using computers in their classrooms. I hope it is not just me that sees the good that a computer brings, but anyone else that @MONTH1 have taken a glare at this letter. As society continues to advance, the importance of computers in various aspects of life becomes more evident. Whether in business, education, or personal use, computers play a crucial role in facilitating efficiency and enhancing productivity. It is clear that the integration of computers into daily operations has become essential, and their impact will only continue to grow in the future.

Additionally, computers provide a wealth of information that can be used for research and learning. They offer access to educational websites that can help individuals expand their knowledge and skills.  While it is true that some people may become addicted to using computers, leading to excessive usage, it is important to recognize the positive aspects of technology.

636	638	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 times, I am writing in regards to the article recently written in your newspaper on computers. I believe that they are a vital part of the world today because you can find information for projects or articles in far less time than searching through books, you can get important news updates, and entertainment is only a click away.  My first reason is the availability of information on the internet. Say you were writing a paper on ancient Egyptians, and you need to know how to spell hieroglyphics. In a dictionary, that would take a few minutes, online it would take about 1 second. Or if you wanted to know when a historical figure died, it would take hours scouring textbooks until you finally found it. Online, it might take you just over a minute.  The second reason I like computers is for news updates. You can figure out what happened in recent natural disasters or how your stock is doing. Also, computers helped us in the recent election, and will continue to do so for a long time. Weather updates can always be found online for anywhere in the world. This is beneficial when planning a trip, which you can also do with a computer.  My third and final reason is that it's hard to get bored on a computer. Everywhere on the web are cool games or funny videos. There are about 2 gaming sites and 3 sites with funny/weird/cool videos and pictures. Many other places like Facebook let you share pictures with your friends, family, and relatives. Or you can chat with complete strangers from around the world. So next time you need information, news, or you are just bored, go on your computer and have fun.
637	639	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, it has come to my attention that people are spending too much time on computers, and I agree. People spend so much time on computers that it becomes addicting, leading to neglect of family and friends. This addiction also results in a lack of exercise, as individuals opt to sit at the computer instead of being active. Furthermore, excessive computer use can lead to deteriorating eyesight, causing headaches and strain on the eyes.  It is concerning to see individuals, especially children, prioritize screen time over engaging in physical activities or spending quality time with loved ones. The sedentary lifestyle that often accompanies excessive computer use can have detrimental effects on one's health, leading to weight gain and a lack of fitness.  Moreover, the strain on the eyes from prolonged computer use can have lasting effects on vision and overall eye health. It is essential to strike a balance between using technology for communication and entertainment purposes and engaging in physical activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  In conclusion, while computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, it is crucial to be mindful of the amount of time spent on them. Finding a balance between screen time and physical activity is key to promoting overall well-being and maintaining healthy relationships with those around us. Thank you for considering these points.
638	640	1	3	Dear, I strongly believe that computers are great. There are a lot of great things you can do on computers. While some people argue that computers have negative effects, such as limiting exercise and family time, I disagree. For instance, computers can actually help people stay connected with family and friends who live far away through video calls and messaging apps. This allows for regular communication and maintaining relationships despite physical distance.  Moreover, computers provide the opportunity to explore places one has never been to through virtual tours and online reviews. This can be particularly helpful when planning vacations or simply learning about different cultures and environments. By having access to a wealth of information and visual resources online, individuals can broaden their horizons and expand their knowledge effortlessly.  Furthermore, computers are valuable tools for studying and education. Students can easily access study materials, research information, and educational resources online to enhance their learning experience. Additionally, digital platforms offer interactive learning opportunities, such as quizzes and tutorials, which can help students grasp difficult concepts more effectively.  In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits that can contribute positively to personal growth and well-being. From staying connected with loved ones to expanding knowledge and facilitating learning, computers play a vital role in modern life. Embracing technology and utilizing it wisely can lead to a more enriched and fulfilling existence.
639	641	1	3	My opinion is that people spend too much time on computers and neglect their families. This can lead to a lack of communication and bonding within the family unit. In addition, excessive computer use can result in neglecting school work, which may lead to poor academic performance. Lastly, spending too much time on the computer can prevent individuals from enjoying social interactions with their friends. It is important to find a balance between technology use and real-life experiences to maintain healthy relationships and overall well-being.
640	642	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to address the concern raised by some experts regarding the increasing use of computers leading to a decrease in exercise and social interaction. While these experts may have valid points, I believe that their concerns are somewhat misguided.  Firstly, it is important to note that many individuals who spend a significant amount of time on computers still find ways to incorporate exercise into their daily routines. For example, professional athletes like Ocho Cinco use social media platforms such as Twitter regularly, yet they maintain their physical fitness through dedicated training regimens. Similarly, many students who use computers for research and school assignments still engage in physical activities outside of their screen time.  Secondly, the role of computers in education cannot be overlooked. With schools increasingly relying on technology for learning, students are required to use computers for various academic tasks. This shift towards digital learning has become essential in today's world, leading to an increase in computer usage among students.  Lastly, the argument that excessive computer use leads to a decline in social interaction may not hold true for everyone. Platforms like Facebook have enabled individuals to stay connected with family and friends, even if they are physically distant. Additionally, computers play a vital role in facilitating communication in professional settings, allowing individuals to collaborate and interact with colleagues effectively.  In conclusion, while it is important to balance computer use with physical activity and social interactions, it is possible to enjoy the benefits of technology while still maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The key lies in moderation and mindful use of computers to ensure that they complement, rather than hinder, our overall well-being. Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.
641	643	1	3	Today, more than half of our population spends a significant amount of time each day on the computer. While having a computer at home can be beneficial, the drawbacks of excessive computer usage outweigh the advantages. Issues such as cyberbullying, exposure to illegal websites, online predators targeting children, and the negative impact on academic performance are major concerns associated with excessive computer use.  Children, in particular, are greatly affected by spending too much time on the computer. Instead of focusing on homework after school, many kids immediately turn to their computers or smartphones, leading to unfinished assignments and a decline in academic performance. The internet also poses a threat in the form of cyberbullying, with hurtful messages causing emotional distress and damaging self-esteem.  Furthermore, criminals target individuals, especially children, through the internet by obtaining personal information and using it for malicious purposes. Adults are not immune to these dangers, as they may fall prey to fake websites offering fraudulent deals, leading to financial loss and identity theft.  In conclusion, it is clear that the disadvantages of excessive computer usage are numerous and serious. It is essential for individuals to limit their screen time, prioritize academic responsibilities, and stay vigilant against online threats.

642	644	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers can be a very good thing to implement in society. First of all, if people never used computers they would miss out on an immense opportunity to learn about the world around them. Also, with computers, people can communicate with people from across the world. If people use computers more often they'll probably develop the skills to pursue job opportunities on a much wider market. Because of this computers can greatly help any community. Computers can give many chances for exploring education. People can pursue a large amount of information with a relatively small space as opposed to using a large area of books. People can find alsmot anything they want to know about on the internet relatively easily. If not for solely learning but for reference. If someone is making a project at a school. Computers can expand on many peoples opportunities for education. Secondly, the internet can be used as a widespread communication tool. Any document or piece of information can be transmitted from say, @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C in a matter of seconds. Simialarly if two people are seperated by a large distance, they can easily communicate since the invention of social networking, people that @MONTH1 have lost touch can easily meet again and discuss things. With computers communication is becoming faster and faster. Finally, because of an over-expanding job market, use of computers is becoming a common requirement of many professions. Most jobs that pertain to engineering require use of different programs for modeling and drafting. Also now most governments are networked with files on computers. Also, most any job that has to do with any sort of business has a requirement for the person needed to be able to type quickly. Because many jobs require experience with computers they shouls be a part of any community. In conclusion experience with computers can benefit any one person and entire society all together. Additionally, computers have revolutionized the healthcare industry, allowing for faster and more accurate diagnoses, as well as improved patient care through electronic health records.

652	654	1	3	Dear to whom it may concern, my name is [Name], and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have become a significant difference between the 20th and 21st centuries. People have become overly reliant on computers, spending hours on them instead of engaging in physical activities. Communication globally has not necessarily improved, and the excessive use of computers has led to various issues.   Before the turn of the millennium, there was widespread fear of the Y2K bug, where computers were predicted to fail and cause chaos. However, when the year 2000 arrived, everything continued as usual, highlighting society's dependence on technology. Even today, people rely heavily on computers, as seen during my recent visit to [Location], where laptops were a common sight everywhere.   Communication is often cited as a reason for the necessity of computers, but we have other means such as telephones and traditional mail. The instant nature of communication through computers can lead to misinformation and conflicts, impacting society negatively.   Moreover, the younger generation's obsession with computers contributes to a sedentary lifestyle, leading to health issues like obesity. Encouraging outdoor activities and limiting computer use could improve the overall well-being of children.   In conclusion, society would benefit from less reliance on computers. Communication can still be achieved through various other means, and reducing screen time could improve both physical and mental health. Society should reconsider its dependence on computers and explore alternative ways to connect and engage.
653	655	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that society is becoming overly reliant on computers. People are spending more time in front of screens than engaging in physical activities, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. The allure of computers has drawn people away from exercising and spending quality time with their families. While computers offer convenience and endless information through the internet, it is essential to strike a balance in their usage. Instead of solely focusing on social media and chatting, we should utilize the internet for more productive purposes, such as education and research. The internet is a valuable tool that should be used wisely to benefit society as a whole. Let's reconsider our relationship with computers and prioritize activities that promote a healthier and more connected community.
654	656	1	3	I believe that computers are a great help to society. When you don't know something, you can easily go online to look it up. Additionally, if you are too sick or busy to go out and buy things from stores, you can purchase them online and have them delivered to your door. Computers can also contribute to saving paper by storing documents digitally. These reasons showcase the valuable role that computers play in enhancing convenience and efficiency in our daily lives. Ultimately, computers have become an essential tool that significantly benefits society in various ways.
655	657	1	3	The use of computers is great for everyone. Using a computer can help you learn about different people from around the world. Also, you can have the ability to talk to people. With a computer, you can also learn about places all over the world. If you were going on a vacation to somewhere new, you could learn about what those people do. Additionally, you can see what people your age do for a living. If you had to do a project for school about a place outside of your location, the computer would be a valuable tool. You can search for information on what they wear and what holidays those people celebrate. Learning about different cultures can help you make friends with people from diverse backgrounds. If a foreign exchange student comes to your school, you can use the computer to research their culture and start conversations with them.  Furthermore, using a computer allows you to easily communicate with others. Through platforms like social media or instant messaging, you can keep in touch with friends and family. You can ask about homework, share updates, or simply chat with them. Emailing is also a convenient way to stay connected with people you meet while traveling. Moreover, you can visit websites that connect you with individuals from other countries, enabling you to learn about their lives and interests. Video chatting with friends or new acquaintances adds a personal touch to your interactions, allowing for more meaningful conversations.  Lastly, computers provide access to information about different places worldwide. Whether you are planning a trip or working on a school project, you can find details on restaurants, attractions, and local customs. In times of need, such as natural disasters in other countries, you can use the computer to learn how to offer assistance and support. The ability to learn about diverse cultures, communicate with others, and explore various destinations makes computers an essential tool for everyone.
656	658	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, The dilemma surrounding computer usage is becoming increasingly evident. While computers are undeniably one of the most significant inventions of our time, many individuals tend to misuse them for activities that do not align with their intended purpose. Instead of utilizing computers for educational or professional pursuits, people often engage in recreational activities such as gaming, instant messaging, and browsing social media platforms like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. This misuse of technology raises concerns about the impact on productivity and overall well-being.  It is essential to recognize that computers are primarily designed for learning and work-related tasks, such as using software like @ORGANIZATION2, Word, and PowerPoint. By focusing on these purposes, individuals can maximize the potential benefits of technology and enhance their knowledge and skills. In contrast, excessive use of computers for entertainment purposes can lead to a lack of productivity, social isolation, and physical health issues.  In the context of @LOCATION1, where computer usage is prevalent, there is a noticeable correlation between excessive screen time and negative behavioral and health outcomes. Individuals who prioritize computer-based activities over essential responsibilities like homework and physical exercise may experience feelings of loneliness, unhappiness, and poor physical fitness. In contrast, those who use computers responsibly for educational and professional purposes tend to be more content, knowledgeable, and successful in their endeavors.  Ultimately, the key to harnessing the full potential of computers lies in using them purposefully and responsibly. By prioritizing educational and work-related tasks over recreational activities, individuals can leverage technology to enhance their learning, productivity, and overall well-being. Striking a balance between entertainment and productivity is crucial for achieving success and fulfillment in the digital age.
657	659	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are truly invaluable tools for learning, communication, and problem-solving. They provide access to a wealth of information and resources that can enhance education and broaden horizons.

In times of need or confusion, computers offer quick solutions, whether it's checking the weather forecast, finding directions, or shopping online. Overall, computers play a crucial role in advancing society by promoting education, connectivity, and access to information. Embracing the benefits of computers can lead to a better-informed, more interconnected world.
658	660	1	3	"The topic that is on many minds in our country is, ""Are computers beneficial, or harmful to our students?"" Computers have evolved from desktop computers, and before that, typewriters, but have they gone too far? While the blank screen of a computer may distract some, the benefits definitely outweigh the negatives in a situation like this. Being able to have faster research, easier communication, and computers in wartime are great capabilities of the modern computer. Also, due to advancements in technology, computers are very helpful because they help individuals with their daily lives. Many doubts about the computer exist, but the computer can surpass all of them.  In a time crunch situation like college or high school, speed is everything. Computers allow students to research faster and with more accuracy by being able to search for keywords. Before, students would have to do the painstaking process of searching in books. More times than not, they wouldn't find what they were looking for, but with the modern age, students can get the information they need fast. Also, having computers in the classroom helps so that teachers can get the information they need for an upcoming class. If speed is what you need, then you will look for a computer.  Besides speed, computers also provide another great thing, communication. With emails, chats, social media, and blogs, knowing what your friends are doing later is just a click away! This is much easier than calling the person. Also, having this access to friends can help when one moves away. If you miss a long-lost friend or cousin, just search their name, and you can talk to them! Having friends so close by you can really make every life great.  Out in the military or in war zones, soldiers rely on computers for valuable information; such as radar or robots. Having computers do the ""dirty work"" can help in times of war and can save valuable lives. Not having these computers would mean certain death for some people in the armed forces. Computers sometimes take the place of humans in things such as drones or unmanned aerial vehicles and save many lives too. Whether it be Facebook or bombings, computers help in a vital way.  It was in 1989 and Tiananmen Square when a man stood in front of a tank, resisting to move, showing courage and wanting democracy. Fortunately, this was all caught on film. How was it broadcasted to the world? Using the computer and internet. Today, many people are able to learn about that due to computers. In many ways, computers help individuals with their daily lives, and for most of us, without them, we would be lost.  In conclusion, while some may argue that computers have their downsides, the benefits they bring in terms of speed, communication, and assistance in various aspects of life far outweigh any negatives. Computers have become an indispensable tool in our modern world, enhancing our lives in numerous ways and contributing to progress and efficiency on many levels."
659	661	1	3	In present day, most people live on the computer. Whether for work or pleasure, everyone uses a computer. In a recent study, researchers determined that an average person spends 10 years of his or her life on the computer. That's a total of 10 years of life wasted. Most kids spend all day on the computer on games, social media, and video platforms. They could be using that time to be around family and friends making memories. Kids don't realize how short life is; they should be hiking, camping, spending time with friends and family.   Years from now when kids grow into adults, they will be looking back and regretting not spending more time with their family or not taking opportunities to explore the world we live in. Instead, they will be looking back and thinking about the hilarious video on YouTube that got over one million hits. Additionally, as you may know, child obesity is on the rise; there are more overweight kids than healthy ones. If you look back to the times before computers, you will notice that you rarely see an overweight child. The computer is to blame for this new epidemic. Kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air.   I bet that if computers were taken away for just one year, the changes in health would be drastic. Kids would be a lot healthier and have lost the weight. I hope that everyone can see the harms of the computer by reading this and will get rid of this poisonous object. Let's prioritize real-life experiences and human connections over screen time to live a fulfilling and healthy life.

667	669	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to inform you about the use of computers. Computers can be fun and interesting, but people are spending too much time on them. In my opinion, it is important to spend time interacting with people in your society, your family, and friends. I believe that it is easy to get addicted to the computer, as I have experienced it myself in the past. Spending excessive time on the computer can have negative consequences.  It is crucial to be safe while using the computer, as there are many dangers online. People should prioritize spending time with their family and friends rather than getting lost in the digital world. Unfortunately, many individuals are choosing to spend more time on the computer than with their loved ones, which is concerning. It is essential to strike a balance and not let the computer consume all of your time.  Addiction to the computer is a prevalent issue, with a significant percentage of people in schools and communities admitting to being addicted. This trend is alarming and should be addressed. Just like a drug, the computer can be addictive, and it is easy to fall into unhealthy habits. It is crucial to be cautious and not let the computer take over your life.  Remember to be safe while using the computer, as anything you do online can be saved and accessed by others. It is essential to be mindful of the information you share and to avoid meeting strangers online. The virtual world can be deceptive, and it is crucial to protect yourself from potential risks.  In conclusion, while the computer can offer entertainment and information, it is vital to prioritize real-life interactions with people. By being mindful of your computer usage, avoiding addiction, and staying safe online, you can maintain a healthy balance between the virtual world and the real world. Let's make sure to value our relationships and not let the computer control our lives. Thank you for considering these important points.
668	670	1	3	Some people believe that computers are a positive influence on people, but others argue that excessive computer use can have negative effects. While computers can be helpful for tasks like finding information and staying connected with others, spending too much time on them can lead to a lack of family interaction and time spent outdoors. This can result in negative consequences such as decreased social skills, lack of physical activity, and even potential harm to mental health.  Excessive computer use, especially among teenagers, can lead to a decrease in academic performance as well. When individuals spend too much time on social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook, they may not be engaging in activities that stimulate their minds or promote learning.

When family members prioritize computer time over spending quality time together, it can lead to feelings of neglect and disconnect. This can result in anger issues and strained relationships within the family unit.  While computers can be a valuable tool for communication and information, it is important to strike a balance and not let them replace essential aspects of life such as spending time with loved ones and enjoying the outdoors. It is crucial to prioritize family time and outdoor activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle and foster strong relationships. In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is essential to use them in moderation to avoid negative consequences on mental, emotional, and physical well-being.
669	671	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I was shocked to hear that some people believe computers do not benefit society. I strongly disagree with this viewpoint. Computers play a crucial role in our daily lives by helping us communicate, accomplish important tasks, and have fun.  One of the most significant ways computers benefit society is through communication. In today's fast-paced world, we rely on computers to connect with our friends and family, especially when we are unable to meet in person. Social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace provide us with a platform to stay in touch and make new friends.  Additionally, computers offer us numerous ways to have fun. From playing video games to watching online videos, computers provide endless entertainment options. Video game consoles connected to the internet allow us to play with friends, no matter where they are located.  Moreover, computers are essential for transferring important information, such as homework assignments or after-school activities. They also store vital government data, ranging from local renovation plans to national security information. Without computers, managing and accessing this crucial data would be nearly impossible.  In conclusion, computers are indispensable in our modern society. They facilitate communication, provide entertainment, and enable the efficient transfer of essential information. As we continue to rely on technology in our daily lives, the role of computers will only become more significant.
670	672	1	3	Dear whomever it may concern, my name is [Name] and I believe that the impact of computers on people is negative. This is evident in several ways. Firstly, computers discourage individuals from going outside as they can easily complete tasks and make purchases online. This lack of physical activity can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Additionally, the use of computers in education has resulted in a decline in penmanship skills among students. With the ability to type assignments, students are not practicing their handwriting as much, leading to poor penmanship. Moreover, the reliance on the internet for information has made some students unfamiliar with traditional research methods, such as using a dictionary or reference book. This can create a disconnect between their academic learning and real-world skills. Lastly, the convenience of computers has diminished people's motivation to engage in everyday activities. Why go out when you can socialize or order food online? This trend is leading to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and experiences. In conclusion, computers are shaping a world where physical interaction and traditional skills are becoming less important, ultimately impacting individuals in a negative way.
671	673	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my opinion on this is that people do use computers a lot! Some people don't care about exercising or enjoying nature, maybe people don't even have friends so they spend a lot of their time on the computer because they have no life or maybe they just go on websites that are addictive. For example, social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram can consume a significant amount of time as people chat with friends or engage in virtual relationships.   On the other hand, I believe that individuals should not spend most of their time on the computer. Instead, they should focus on having fun, socializing with people face-to-face, and living their lives to the fullest. It is important to strike a balance between screen time and real-life experiences to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.  In conclusion, while computers have become an integral part of modern life, it is essential for individuals to prioritize real-world interactions and activities over excessive screen time. Finding a healthy balance between digital and offline experiences is crucial for overall well-being and happiness.
672	674	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 you think our exercising and being in nature is becoming less and less? I don't think so in my opinion. I think computers have a positive effect because they can help you connect with people from different parts of the world, learn new things, and stay in touch with distant relatives.   Firstly, computers allow you to connect with individuals from various cultures around the globe. This interaction can lead to discussions about traditions, lifestyles, and even educational opportunities. It opens up a world of knowledge and understanding that was not easily accessible before.   Secondly, computers provide a platform for learning new skills and gaining knowledge that can improve your daily life. From tutorials on how to cook a new dish to understanding complex concepts, the internet is a treasure trove of information waiting to be explored. This can enhance your personal growth and development in numerous ways.   Lastly, computers enable you to stay connected with relatives who are far away. Whether it's through video calls, messaging apps, or social media, technology bridges the gap between loved ones separated by distance. It fosters relationships and allows you to share precious moments with those who are physically distant.  In conclusion, technology, particularly computers, has revolutionized the way we communicate, learn, and stay connected with others. Embracing these advancements can greatly enrich our lives and keep us engaged with the world around us. So, let's continue to embrace technology and all the benefits it brings for a brighter future ahead!
673	675	1	3	Would you ever think that a computer can take too much time or keep you from doing lots of things? Does using a computer mess up your life in some ways? I would say no. The computer is a common part of life; everybody needs it or uses it in some form. People need it because they can catch up on news they missed on TV by going online, using the amazing technology we have such as laptops or phones with internet access. This is a natural part of our lifestyle now. The computer does not stop you from going outside and doing other things; it's your choice if you decide to spend too much time on it. The beautiful thing is that a computer can do so much for you. It can help you with homework, projects, listening to music, and improving your typing skills for future job opportunities. It keeps you in touch with the world and allows you to research and learn new things. While some people may spend long periods on computers, it's essential to balance screen time with other activities like spending time with family. Computers have been around for a long time and have made us smarter and more connected. They are a vital tool that everyone needs in today's world. So, the next time you think a computer is taking up too much of your time, remember the many benefits it brings to your life.
674	676	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I feel like computers are beneficial in many ways. They can keep children occupied and away from potential trouble on the streets, offering a variety of games to engage with. Additionally, programs like Microsoft can assist with writing projects and other academic tasks, making them valuable tools for learning. Computers also provide educational games that cover subjects like science, math, reading, and social studies, making learning more interactive and enjoyable.  However, there are also risks associated with computers, particularly for teenagers. Platforms like Myspace can expose individuals to potential dangers, such as interacting with strangers who may have harmful intentions. This can put young users at risk of exploitation and harm. Furthermore, older students may introduce younger ones to inappropriate websites, leading them to engage in activities that are not suitable for their age.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits and educational opportunities, it is essential to be cautious and mindful of the potential risks they pose, especially for young users. It is crucial to educate individuals about online safety and responsible internet usage to ensure a positive and safe experience with technology.
675	677	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1 press, I believe that computers have a terrible impact on society, as they can lead to detrimental health effects in children. One major concern is the sedentary lifestyle that often accompanies excessive computer use, leading to obesity among children. This is a growing issue that needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further health complications in the younger generation.  Moreover, studies have shown that prolonged computer usage can lead to cognitive decline in children, with a significant percentage at risk of going ""braindead."" This poses a serious threat to the intellectual development of our future generation, as their cognitive abilities may be compromised due to excessive screen time.  Additionally, another adverse effect of excessive computer use is the development of poor eyesight in children. The strain caused by staring at screens for extended periods can result in long-term vision problems, potentially affecting the overall eye health of children and leading to a widespread need for glasses in the future.  In conclusion, it is evident that computers have a negative impact on society, particularly in terms of children's health and well-being. It is crucial to address these issues effectively to ensure a healthier and more prosperous future for the upcoming generations."
676	678	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think people are spending too much time on the computer and these are my reasons. First, individuals are neglecting exercise and physical activity by being glued to their screens. Instead of engaging in outdoor activities like running or playing sports, they opt to stay indoors and play games or chat online. It is essential to allocate at least an hour for exercise to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, people are missing out on the beauty of nature by confining themselves to a virtual world. Spending time outdoors, exploring the surroundings, and appreciating the environment can be far more fulfilling than staring at a screen all day. Lastly, the excessive use of computers hinders social interactions with friends and family. Building and maintaining relationships require genuine communication and quality time spent together, which cannot be replaced by virtual interactions. It is crucial for individuals to prioritize real-life connections over virtual ones. In conclusion, it is important for people to strike a balance between screen time and real-life experiences. Exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with loved ones are crucial aspects of a fulfilling life that should not be overshadowed by excessive computer use. Thank you for considering my perspective.
677	679	1	3	Living without a computer for a day would pose a significant challenge for me. My computer is not just a tool for entertainment, but a vital means of communication with my friends. Even when the weather makes it difficult to meet in person, I can still connect with them online. This virtual interaction allows me to stay in touch with all my friends, regardless of physical distance. Additionally, my computer serves as a gateway to current events, providing me with important information such as sports scores and updates on legislative matters like the healthcare bill. Without access to this technology, I would be deprived of crucial knowledge that impacts my daily life. From checking emails and weather forecasts to completing school assignments and staying informed, my computer plays an integral role in my routine. Overall, I believe that computers have become an indispensable part of modern life, enhancing communication, knowledge, and productivity in ways that would be sorely missed if they were suddenly unavailable.
678	680	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 man, @CAPS2, would you want people to be on a computer all day doing nothing? How would you feel if no one was out getting exercise, and no one was using the playgrounds, parks, and beaches? Everyone would be sitting at home on their nice new fancy computers. When you really think about how much time people spend doing nothing, just sitting around, would a computer solve that problem? It really wouldn't. People spend too much time on computers; exercise is needed every day, and it makes your body and eyes strained. When it comes to computers, everyone wants to get one, but when we talk about exercise, it seems like people's minds click off. This happens because people are starting to spend lots of time on computers. If they work on computers for a long period of the day, then head home to spend more time on the computer, what is that doing to your body? Not helping it. Exercise is really important for your body and doesn't even have to be too strenuous, but don't spend your time wasted on computers.  This happens to families when they come home from work or school and jump right on the computers; families are not getting enough exercise or spending time together because computers get in the way of that. Exercise would help keep you healthy instead of electronics. Computers are like little robots that control your mind and body; it sucks the life out of you. It strains your eyes, makes you irritable, and you really don't want to do much. Maybe if people spent less time on computers and more time being focused on families and nature, they wouldn't be weak and tired. I know a lot of people who don't want computers to be banned, but I think it would help for a lot of reasons and make families closer and bodies healthier. From my experience, computers do help in some ways, but when it comes to real life, they don't help much. If you care about health and activities, you would agree that computers are not of much help.
679	681	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I am going to inform you that more and more people are using computers than spending time with their family. I agree with the effects computers have on people because, firstly, it allows us to access information. Computers provide us with essential information such as weather reports, school updates, and news about natural disasters like earthquakes. They also enable us to explore various websites for research, entertainment, and educational purposes. Additionally, computers help us stay connected with friends and family, especially during times when physical interaction is limited.  Secondly, computers allow us to interact with people from all around the world. Through social media platforms, emails, and online forums, we can communicate with individuals we have never met before. This fosters cultural exchange, promotes understanding, and can even aid law enforcement in tracking down criminals. The speed and convenience of online communication make it a valuable tool for staying connected and informed.  Lastly, computers keep us updated on current events, especially in the realm of sports. Sports enthusiasts can follow live games, access player interviews, and engage with fellow fans through online platforms. This constant stream of information and entertainment adds to the overall experience of being a sports fan.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in our daily lives by providing information, enabling communication, and keeping us connected to the world around us. While it is important to maintain a balance between screen time and personal interactions, the benefits of using computers for information, interaction, and entertainment are undeniable.
680	682	1	3	With the increasing use of computers in society, there are several negative consequences that impact individuals and the environment. Online bullying has become more prevalent, leading to a significant number of suicides among teenagers. The anonymity provided by the internet allows bullies to torment their victims without facing any consequences. This has a severe impact on mental health and well-being.  Moreover, excessive computer use has led to a decrease in physical activity, contributing to the rise in obesity rates. Many people spend hours sitting in front of a screen, neglecting their health and fitness. Lack of exercise can lead to various health issues, including heart problems and obesity-related complications.  Furthermore, the environmental impact of computer usage cannot be ignored. Computers consume energy and contribute to toxic waste that harms the environment. Deforestation for paper production, driven by the demand for printing, further exacerbates environmental degradation. The depletion of resources and destruction of ecosystems pose a threat to wildlife and future generations.  In conclusion, while computers offer convenience and accessibility to information, their widespread use has negative implications for society. It is essential to address the issues of online bullying, sedentary lifestyles, and environmental degradation associated with computer usage to ensure the well-being of individuals and the planet. Finding a balance between technology use and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is crucial for a sustainable future.
681	683	1	3	Spending excessive time on the computer can have negative effects on our lives, such as limiting time for reading, spending time with family, and going outside. While computers can be useful for research and communication, it is important to balance screen time with other activities. Reading a book from the library can provide accurate information and enhance our knowledge. Spending quality time with family members through gatherings or reunions can strengthen relationships and create lasting memories. Going outside for activities like playing in the park or engaging in physical exercise can improve our health and overall well-being. It is essential to prioritize real-life interactions and experiences over excessive screen time to lead a fulfilling and balanced life.
682	684	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there is an ongoing debate about the issue stating that not everyone agrees that computers benefit society. I can't understand why. Computers present many opportunities for people. They allow for people to communicate with each other, they allow people to research topics in a simpler way, and they teach hand-eye coordination. This is why I agree that computers do benefit society.   In the modern world, nearly all businesses rely on communication. Many people in those businesses use not only phones to communicate, but computers as well. Online communication is a fast, simple, and effective way for people to communicate whether at home or at work. This is one way computers benefit all of society.   Nobody knows everything; we are always trying to find out about new things that we never knew. Sometimes we use books, but the way most people use is online researching. This is because not only is it quicker, but simpler as well. When you research online, the information literally comes to you. All you do is type a subject into the search bar. This is another reason why computers benefit society.   The final reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. This shows because as time progresses while you are on the computer, you realize that typing becomes easier. It might take a while, but over time, people get the hang. It's as if the computer is letting you teach yourself.   Some people would say that people spend too much time on computers. This isn't a problem though because people have to spend long periods of time on computers in order to do the beneficial things that computers have to offer. In conclusion, you can see that I have clearly stated the benefits of computers. They allow us to communicate, research, and improve our hand-eye coordination. This is why computers do benefit society.
683	685	1	3	In this modernized world computers are key. They offer many benefits that include communication, entertainment, and education. These benefits have positive effects on people throughout the world and are why I support the advances in technology. Communication is a large benefit with computers. Whether you are keeping in touch with friends or organizing business meetings, computers offer a significant aid. With the modern technology provided by computers, people can instantly send messages to co-workers or friends in a matter of seconds. In some cases, businesses completely rely on computers to function, such as having conversations with people across the globe to discuss international expansion. Computers are greatly necessary for people to communicate and enable them to make plans simply and effectively.  The computer also supplies an endless source of entertainment. With the internet, computers provide users with websites that enable them to talk to friends, watch videos, play games, and more. Computers provide a relaxing way to enjoy oneself when it is late at night or a rainy day. They enable people to stay entertained and relaxed when needed.  The most important function of the computer is education. Computers supply users or students with a wide variety of information. They aid users with vast information on every subject or topic that may be brought up in a classroom. Computers are very useful for research projects or even learning another language. They are beneficial when it comes to education.  The computer is a technology that has come to make daily life simple. It has been incorporated into almost any daily task that may occur during the day. It would be unjust to stop advancing in this technological wonder. The computer greatly benefits our communication, entertainment, and education, making it an indispensable tool in today's world.
684	686	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I would like to address the impact of computers on individuals. In my view, computers do have a significant effect on people. Many individuals lose track of time while browsing the internet, becoming engrossed in various online activities. This distraction can lead to a lack of awareness of the passing time, ultimately affecting their productivity and daily routine. Additionally, excessive computer use often keeps individuals indoors for extended periods, leading to a decrease in physical activity. This sedentary lifestyle can result in weight gain, unhealthy eating habits, and a higher risk of developing health issues such as obesity and clogged arteries. It is essential for individuals to prioritize physical activity and outdoor experiences over excessive screen time. Engaging in sports and outdoor activities not only promotes physical health but also contributes to overall well-being and social interaction. Ultimately, the choice between a healthy, active lifestyle and the potential consequences of prolonged computer use lies in the hands of each individual. It is crucial to consider the long-term effects of one's lifestyle choices and strive for a balance that promotes both physical and mental well-being. Live healthy, stay active, and enjoy all that life has to offer.
685	687	1	3	Computers are indeed a valuable asset to society as they offer various benefits. They enable communication with people from all around the world, allowing for constant interaction with friends and family members regardless of geographical distances. Additionally, computers provide a platform for sharing ideas, opinions, and experiences, which can help individuals make informed decisions about products or services. Furthermore, computers are essential for staying updated with the latest news, events, and developments in one's community. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in facilitating communication, promoting creativity, and keeping individuals informed about the world around them.
686	688	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, With all due respect to anyone that thinks the computer doesn't benefit society, I strongly disagree. Yes, there are many people that neglect other activities to be on the computer, and yes, the computer is an invention that a lot of people depend on, but the computer is also an invention that we can benefit from in many positive ways. For example, Jay-Z, a hip-hop artist with millions of fans, wasn't able to finish high school or go to college because of his career. He decided to get a college degree, so he started to attend a college. He had difficulty being in college, however, because he was constantly being harassed by his fans, so he started going to college online. That way, he was able to focus on his studies and get his degree without the harassment. The computer also has websites on the internet that are used in schools. They help teach students in a way that they will have fun and enjoy what they're doing, giving them a better learning experience. Aside from the positive uses of the internet, the computer also contains programs that can benefit us just as well. Microsoft Word, for example is a program on the computer that is used to create various documents such as poems, essays, song lyrics, and even letters. You can print out these documents to have a copy of your own to keep and show people wherever you go, but if you're not finished, it can be saved on your computer. People use the computer for many things, books, movies, and so on. Over the years of its existence, it has benefited us a lot. The computer has truly revolutionized the way we learn, work, and communicate, making it an invaluable tool in our modern society.
687	689	1	3	"Suppose you have a family member that you have not seen in a long time and you don't have enough money to visit them because they live too far away. Or you are injured or sick and have nothing to do, so you decide to browse the internet and end up learning some interesting things such as new organisms discovered by scientists or unknown facts from history. The computer is a treasure trove of knowledge waiting to be explored. Through online platforms like social media, you can reconnect with long-lost family members or friends, even engaging in webcam chats to see them face-to-face virtually.  Moreover, the internet offers a vast array of information on various topics. In just a few minutes of random searching, you can uncover stories like the ""@CAPS1 massacre"" or tragic events like the explosion of the spaceship carrying a teacher. The wealth of knowledge available online extends to nature, history, and ancient civilizations, providing insights that may not be easily accessible through traditional means. The computer serves as a gateway to expanding your understanding of the world around you.  In essence, the computer enables you to bridge gaps with loved ones and broaden your knowledge horizon with just a few clicks. Whether it's sharing memories with family members or delving into the depths of history and nature, the internet opens up a world of possibilities for learning and connection. Embracing the digital age can lead to enriching experiences and valuable insights that may have otherwise remained undiscovered."
688	690	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I believe that computers do benefit society. People are able to read, shop, and play online, making life easier for many.

Computers also enable easy communication with family members, even across great distances, allowing individuals to stay connected and informed about their loved ones. Additionally, computers provide access to information about different states and countries, offering insights into diverse cultures and demographics. Furthermore, they offer opportunities for socializing and entertainment through online gaming with friends. Overall, computers have numerous positive effects on people, enhancing various aspects of their lives.
690	692	1	3	I don't believe that computers have the most positive effect, as they are not always the smartest tools. However, they can be useful for tasks like projects, searching for images, and using calculators for math. Computers may not assist with all subjects, but they can be handy for specific needs. Many people use computers to search for jobs, cars, or houses, as they provide access to helpful websites. While some may view using computers as cheating, they can simplify tasks and provide valuable resources. In conclusion, computers offer various benefits for different purposes, making them a valuable tool in today's digital age.
691	693	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In one's opinion, computers play a crucial role in benefiting society in various ways.

Although sometimes people spend too much time on computers, it doesn't mean computers are bad for society; it just means people need to learn to spend their time wisely. Overall, I think computers have a positive effect on society.  One reason I am for computers is because they are a huge advancement in technology. They make everyday life easier by allowing you to store information, learn about many places, and communicate with friends and family. For one device to do all that is amazing! Also, if we can make something like computers, imagine all the other possibilities of technological advancements. Computers are only the start of it all!  Another reason why I believe computers greatly benefit society is that they provide entertainment. You can watch movies on your computer and download fun games. There is hardly anything you can't do on a computer. If it is cold outside or raining, you can still entertain yourself with just a computer. Computers are great to have around.  Now, anyone who thinks people spend too much time on their computers and that computers are bad for society is just wrong. I think those people are wrong because a computer can't force you to spend more time on it. It's your own fault if you choose to use your computer too much. You always have the choice to go outside and take a walk. Computers are only wrong if you choose to use them wrong, like the expression ""guns don't kill people, people do.""  In conclusion, I believe computers are a great thing to have, especially in this modern society. Computers are one of the greatest advancements in technology, and they benefit society as well. So, if you are ever wondering whether or not to buy a computer, I suggest you get one!"

694	696	1	3	Dear editor of The @CAPS1, I believe that computers are a valuable asset to our community for various reasons. In today's digital age, computers provide easy access to information, communication with others, and staying updated on current events.   Firstly, computers are incredibly useful for research purposes. Instead of rushing to the library before it closes or wasting gas driving there, individuals can simply search for information online from the comfort of their homes. This not only saves time and energy but also allows for efficient and effective research on any topic.   Additionally, computers facilitate communication with friends and family, even those located in different parts of the world. By utilizing messaging or video chat applications, individuals can stay connected without worrying about long-distance charges or limited phone minutes.

695	697	1	3	Fairfield County computers have a detrimental effect on individuals. The easy access to distractions on computers leads to wasted time and increased stress levels. Many students find it challenging to focus on their homework when using computers, as they can easily be drawn into games and social media platforms like Facebook. This diversion from academic tasks can result in poor grades and academic performance, as illustrated by the personal experience of being engrossed in online games instead of completing math assignments. Moreover, excessive time spent on computers can lead to stress and irritability, as observed by parents noticing changes in mood and behavior in their children. The potential consequences of prolonged computer use, such as neglecting basic needs like food and water, highlight the serious impact it can have on individuals. It is essential for people to recognize the negative effects of excessive computer usage and prioritize healthier activities to maintain overall well-being. Ultimately, limiting computer time and engaging in outdoor activities can contribute to a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.
696	698	1	3	Dear to whom it may concern,   I believe that computers can be both beneficial and detrimental to children. While they can be addictive and harmful to physical health, they also provide a safe alternative to risky behaviors like smoking or loitering in the streets. Some children may find excessive computer use boring and straining on their eyes, leading them to limit their screen time voluntarily. Social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook offer a way for kids to connect with friends and family, which can be a positive aspect of computer usage. Additionally, electronic devices like gaming consoles may discourage physical activity, but they also keep children entertained and engaged in a controlled environment. Overall, while computers can have negative effects on children, they can also serve as a valuable tool for communication and entertainment, diverting them from potentially harmful activities.   Thank you for considering these points.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]
697	699	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 Society: Computers are perhaps one of the greatest improvements to our society's advancement in knowledge in the past few decades. These gems of the future, like human beings, have their own minds and can figure out answers to all problems. People all around the world use them, from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4, to @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. People of all ages, from school kids to adults with highly esteemed professions like chemists, use computers. Do you wish to be the one standing on the sidelines, stuck in the past, not advancing with technology? From the creation of rockets, engines, and planes, computers have never let us down. Still, the question remains: will computerized technology benefit our society or bring it crashing down?   Since the @DATE1, computers have been used as an ad for new information. The speed at which they can receive new information is astonishing! @CAPS2 @PERSON2, a computer engineer, says, ""With the technology that we receive from computers, we are able to be in the game."" This highlights one of the best benefits of computers: their ability to display the most current information. While books are an excellent resource in society, providing valuable information, it takes years to publish them. With computers, information that occurred as recently as @NUM1 hours ago can be accessed on the internet. This not only allows for faster information retrieval but also enables our society to stay current and ""be in the game.""   Hand-eye coordination is a crucial skill that everyone needs, and using a computer can help improve this. When typing on a computer, you train your eyes to track the screen and your hands to move across the keys independently. This coordination can translate to other activities like sports, where tracking a moving object becomes easier with practice. Investing in a computer is an investment in your overall coordination and skill development.   While money may be tight in our society, investing in computers can actually save us money in the long run. Computers last much longer than paperbacks and provide constantly updated information, reducing the need to purchase new books frequently. A neighboring society recently invested in computers and recouped their expenses within a few months by saving on book purchases. Imagine the financial benefits our society could gain over a year by making a similar investment.   In conclusion, computers are essential for our society's progress. They not only improve hand-eye coordination but also save money and provide instant access to crucial information. Without computers, we would fall behind in various aspects of life and miss out on incredible advancements in technology. It is imperative that we embrace this technology for the betterment of our society. The choice is yours, but remember, the fate of our society rests in your hands."
698	700	1	3	Dear Newspaper; I believe that computers are good for our society for various reasons. One reason is that they make life easier by allowing us to communicate more efficiently. For example, sending emails to doctors for permissions or talking to loved ones who are far away. Additionally, computers help us stay informed about current events and advancements in technology. They provide access to news websites and allow us to research and learn about the world around us. Furthermore, computers enable us to connect with people globally, such as in the case of my uncle in the air force, where email is the only means of communication. Overall, computers play a vital role in enhancing our daily lives and facilitating connections with others.
699	701	1	3	@ORGANIZATION2, Technology has indeed advanced significantly in recent decades, offering numerous benefits to mankind across various fields. However, there is a growing concern regarding whether these technological advancements are truly advantageous or not. Some argue that technology, particularly computers, has made people lazier due to the convenience it provides. Despite this concern, I believe that technology, particularly computers, has brought about numerous advantages for us. Computers showcase the capabilities of mankind and allow us to learn about different cultures, enhance education through projects and presentations, and even contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing paper usage.   I spoke with @PERSON3 from @ORGANIZATION1, who emphasized that technology can expand our knowledge and provide valuable resources. Although there is a concern about the amount of paper being used, computers offer eco-friendly alternatives like digital presentations and online tests. The future seems to be heavily reliant on computers, enabling tasks like communication through emails and video calls with family members, as observed in @LOCATION1. Many individuals, as revealed in a survey, prefer using computers over phones to connect with their loved ones.   However, it is essential to acknowledge the downside of excessive computer usage, such as addiction to games. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION3 highlighted the negative impact of gaming, leading to prolonged periods of inactivity. While computers offer numerous benefits, the addictive nature of some games can result in harmful consequences.   In conclusion, despite the drawbacks associated with technology, especially in terms of gaming addiction, computers remain a valuable tool that benefits us in various aspects of life. As we continue to embrace technological advancements, it is crucial to strike a balance between utilizing the benefits of computers and avoiding their potential pitfalls.
700	702	1	3	My opinion about the effects of computers is that while they can be helpful, it is important not to rely on them too heavily. People should prioritize activities like exercising, spending time with family, and enjoying nature over excessive computer use. Regular exercise is crucial for maintaining good health and preventing illness. Building strong relationships with family members is more fulfilling than online interactions, as family provides genuine support and companionship. Furthermore, spending time in nature can be rejuvenating and enjoyable, offering a break from screen time. In conclusion, computers should be used in moderation for practical purposes, with a focus on maintaining physical health, nurturing relationships, and appreciating the natural world.
701	703	1	3	Dear local Newspaper,   I believe that computers play a crucial role in our society for a variety of reasons. Firstly, they greatly enhance communication by allowing us to connect with people both near and far through various means such as texting, video calls, and emails. The plethora of communication platforms available online ensures that there is always a way to stay in touch with others.  Moreover, computers are invaluable tools for creation, as they enable us to design presentations, documents, drawings, and more with ease. The vast amount of information accessible online also allows users to gather resources and expand their knowledge on a wide range of topics.  Additionally, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options, from watching videos and movies to playing games and engaging in social media. These platforms provide users with endless opportunities for enjoyment and relaxation.  In conclusion, computers have significantly impacted society in a positive way by enhancing communication, facilitating creation, and providing entertainment options. Their versatility and functionality make them an indispensable part of our daily lives.
702	704	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think this is a good idea because you can play games, talk to family or friends, and listen to music on the computer. Playing games can help pass the time and provide entertainment, whether it's car games, shooting games, or arcade games. Additionally, connecting with family and friends who may be far away is easier through platforms like MySpace or Facebook. You can stay in touch and communicate as much as you want. Lastly, listening to music on the computer is simple with platforms like @CAPS3 or downloading music through services like Frostwire. You can enjoy a variety of music genres like hip-hop, rap, rock, or heavy rock. Overall, having access to these activities on the computer can provide entertainment, connection, and enjoyment.
703	705	1	3	What is more fun, staring at a blank computer screen all day, or spending the day out in beautiful nature with your friends and family? Well, if you don't know, I do. I took a survey at my school with the same exact question and 80% of the kids said that hanging out with friends and family is much more fun than spending all of your time on the computer, and there are three reasons why they said that. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, they can do so in person. Next, sitting in front of a computer all day is unhealthy, as it does not provide any physical exercise. Lastly, there are risks of encountering internet predators, which can lead to dangerous situations. It is important to consider these factors and prioritize spending time with loved ones in nature over excessive screen time. Remember, it is crucial to maintain a balance between technology use and real-life interactions for a healthier and more enjoyable lifestyle.
704	706	1	3	Computers have a positive impact on people by enabling them to access information, communicate with others, and improve hand-eye coordination. Through computers, individuals can learn about news from around the world, explore different places, and discover information about historical figures. Communication is made easier with the use of computers, allowing people to connect with others through video calls, emails, and instant messaging. Additionally, using computers can enhance hand-eye coordination, which is beneficial for activities such as sports. Overall, computers play a crucial role in society by providing valuable learning opportunities, facilitating communication, and improving physical skills.
705	707	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writing to you because I believe that people in the community are spending too much time on computers these days. Instead of being glued to screens playing games like Farmville and Pet Society on Facebook, I suggest that individuals should get out more and engage in physical activities.   Rather than being sedentary at home, I recommend going to the gym to work out, visiting the park for some fresh air, or having a family fun night with loved ones. It's essential to break the cycle of excessive screen time and prioritize physical and social interactions.   Furthermore, taking some ""me"" time is crucial for self-care. Whether it's treating yourself to a nice meal, going shopping, or simply relaxing, it's important to disconnect from the virtual world and focus on personal well-being.   In conclusion, it's time to step away from the screens and embrace real-life experiences. Finding a balance between technology and offline activities is key to leading a healthy and fulfilling life. Let's all make an effort to prioritize our physical and mental well-being by reducing screen time and engaging in more meaningful activities."

708	710	1	3	Dear local newspaper,   Computers are definitely not a bad thing; in fact, they bring numerous benefits to our lives. One of the key advantages of having a computer is the access to vast amounts of knowledge. With just a few clicks, you can find information on any topic you desire, expanding your understanding and intellect. This wealth of knowledge can be incredibly enriching for the brain. Furthermore, computers can also be a tool for exercise, contrary to popular belief. Online platforms offer countless workout routines and health tips, enabling individuals to stay active without leaving their homes.   Moreover, computers facilitate social connections and communication with loved ones. Through social media platforms and messaging apps, people can stay in touch with friends and family, even if they are miles apart. This online interaction fosters relationships and strengthens bonds, enhancing our social lives in a digital age.   In conclusion, computers are far from being a negative influence. They offer a plethora of benefits such as access to knowledge, opportunities for exercise, and avenues for social interaction. Embracing technology can enhance our lives in various ways, making computers an invaluable tool in today's society.
709	711	1	3	Dear editor, Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important? Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be in front of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting in front of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involved with school too! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, your not only walking and getting well needed exercise, your bonding with your loyal friend. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, its probably because you're spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreciate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1, while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, relaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze, brushing your face with every of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences. You lose out on having good lifetime relationships, and how could you turn down the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computers are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right decision to take responsible charge of their life, and the same question, which is more important?
710	712	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, do you think computers have good or bad effects on people? It has been brought to my mind that people argue about the impact of computers, but without a doubt, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. One argument is that computers give us the ability to learn about faraway places. This is really helpful if you want to learn about a specific topic; you can simply go on the computer and search for information. By doing this, you can find a lot of information quickly and easily. Second, computers allow people to communicate with others around the world. This is beneficial if you want to learn about different cultures and connect with people from diverse backgrounds. Lastly, computers can assist with school work. They provide students with a convenient way to research and complete assignments efficiently. In my experience, using the internet for a school project on the nine planets helped me gather all the necessary information and achieve a high grade. Overall, computers have a positive impact on society by enhancing learning, facilitating communication, and aiding in academic tasks.
711	713	1	3	"Dear local news editor, using a computer daily has a positive effect on people, wouldn't you agree? People should use computers more often. I think everyone should have at least one or two computers in their house; they were invented for a reason. Computers allow you to interact with friends and family, help you with school work, and I guarantee that you will have a good time using a computer by playing games and meeting new people. If you have school work to finish, computers will work. If you need to do some research, you can just go to a website like Google and what you need to know will be right in front of your eyes in a matter of seconds. Computers can help you with work as well. I read an article on computers about users are most likely to succeed in school. Interacting with friends and family is always a plus. Maybe you do not understand something if you have been assigned in a certain class. You can add a friend and they will tell you what has happened. Talking to family members can do good for you in many ways. You can be having some trouble in your social life, you can always talk to a family member or friend secretly through the computer. I remember having some difficulties with a few friends and one of my cousins gave me very good advice through an instant messaging program named ""Skype"". I guarantee you will have a good time using a computer. There are many games out there that you can enjoy. Playing these games will teach hand-eye coordination, says experts. You can meet new people who can also give you good advice. As computers have a lot of positive effects on people, you can interact with family and friends, receive a lot of help for school work, and meet a lot of new people. Take my advice and buy a computer."
712	714	1	3	How much of your free time daily do you spend on the computer? It is proven that people aged ten to fifteen years old spend an average of 3-5 hours of their free time on a computer. People aged sixteen to forty-eight spend 4-7 hours of free time daily on their computer. Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and health issues. Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. In this past decade, the percentage of exercise has gone down and computer bills have gone up. Americans now spend most of their time web surfing, playing online games, and interacting with online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and lack of physical exercise. Many local sports have lost teammates due to a lack of desire for physical activities because of computers. Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to spending time on the computer. The thought that runs through many minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk to them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the house and go see my friends. I don't even go online every day. I check online for homework and do online shopping for twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives, like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are rising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on TV about people with weight and health problems can be related back to the negative effects of spending too much time on the computer. People like the overweight and the obese have shown how people can gain weight. I think at least 50% of these people spend too much time on the computer and not exercising. Eating fast food and then going home to play online games will definitely increase health issues like weight gain, unhealthy organs, improperly functioning muscles, and eye and brain damage from staring at a screen nonstop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and prevent the negative effects of computers.
713	715	1	3	Dear local newspaper,   I support the advances in technology for various reasons. One significant benefit is the convenience it provides, especially on rainy days when outdoor activities may not be feasible. Instead of going outside, individuals can use computers to play games, connect with friends, or work on school assignments. For instance, if someone needs information for a project but cannot reach the library, having a computer at home allows easy access to resources. Technology also serves as a valuable tool for learning new skills, such as cooking or DIY projects. Additionally, after school, computers enable social interactions with friends online when meeting in person is not possible. Moreover, using technology to communicate with friends about homework assignments helps ensure that important tasks are not overlooked. These examples illustrate how advancements in technology enhance daily life and support productivity and connectivity.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
714	716	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Everyone loves computers, right? They are incredibly helpful in various aspects of our lives.

From providing access to pictures and videos to checking the weather forecast or flight status, computers make our lives easier and more convenient. They offer a wealth of information at our fingertips, making it easier to stay informed and organized.  Additionally, computers allow us to explore and learn about faraway places. Whether it's through virtual tours, maps, or videos, computers can transport us to distant lands and cultures. This not only broadens our horizons but also enhances our understanding of the world around us.  Moreover, computers enable us to stay connected with friends and family, no matter where they are. Online communication platforms like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 make it easy to chat, video call, and share moments with loved ones, regardless of geographical distance.

715	717	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I understand that there has been some controversy surrounding computers and their impact on society. While some people view them as beneficial tools, others see them as potential threats. However, it is important to recognize that computers have both advantages and disadvantages.  One of the key advantages of computers is their ability to provide fast access to information. With just a few clicks, one can find a wealth of knowledge on any topic. Additionally, computers enable communication with people all around the world, breaking down barriers and fostering global connections. For children and teenagers, computers offer entertainment through games and other online activities.  On the other hand, there are also disadvantages to consider. Computers can be expensive to purchase and maintain, making them inaccessible to some individuals. Technical issues can also arise, causing frustration and inconvenience. Furthermore, the prevalence of questionable websites like Facebook and MySpace raises concerns about the quality of content available online.  Despite these drawbacks, it is clear that computers play a crucial role in modern society. They streamline tasks, facilitate research, and enhance communication. As such, it is important to embrace the benefits of technology while also being mindful of its limitations. By understanding the advantages and disadvantages of computers, we can navigate this digital age with greater awareness and responsibility.
716	718	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A regular day for a person, with a computer, includes at least three hours using the computer per day. Today, people, especially teens, spend their precious hours wasting time on sites like facebook, myspace @CAPS1 and more! Just think about it, just sitting in a chair with your eyes glued to the computer when you could be exercising, spending time with family and friends or enjoying nature? After all, do we really need a computer?  Obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today. However, we can prevent it! We are certainly not helping this issue when we have children and adults sitting in a chair for a large part of their day doing absolutely nothing! We are so fortunate, our town has at least two physical fitness buildings for anyone can attend instead of using the computer. And even if you can't attend a gym you could easily walk around your neighborhood. There are running programs held at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where you can exercise or even run a small competition! Please, exercising is key to everybody's health and there are numerous ways to exercise, but using the computer is not one of them!  Teachers, parents, children writers everyone let's stay away from the computers and stay fit! Family and friends are those who make us truly happy but if we're on the computer how are we going to see them? More and more people are making less effort to see people in person. Instead, many people video chat through cameras on the computer. We need to change this habit. Everybody needs to socialize face to face. If we socialize through computers our socializing skills could worsen because you are not practicing the socializing skills like eye contact. Instead of talking to people online we could be enjoying with those same people at an amusement park, a restaurant, at a park or simply in our backyard/house.  The world is so beautiful with so many places to see but society is too busy to see it because we're on the computer for a long time. Our computers use up so much energy and are a threat to the world, @CAPS2 @CAPS3! Instead of entertaining ourselves on the computer we could be taking hikes, walks on the beach even our street or playing outside in our yard. On a computer, you can see majestic places like beaches but you can't interact with them. If we get off our computer we could be swimming at a beach or a pool! Nature is so beautiful, why ever it? @PERCENT1 of residents in @LOCATION1 own computers and spend a lot of their day on it. We could be improving obesity, spending more time with family and friends, and exploring Nature! Let's make a change so we can do all of these things! Remember, life is about experiences, not just screens.
717	719	1	3	Dear local newspaper,   I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand-eye coordination. Having good hand-eye coordination is essential for daily tasks and interactions. It enables individuals to efficiently interact with their surroundings and handle objects with precision. By using computers, individuals can enhance their hand-eye coordination through various activities such as typing, gaming, and navigating digital interfaces.  Furthermore, computers provide a wealth of information about different people and places. The internet serves as a vast repository of knowledge, allowing users to explore diverse cultures, landscapes, and historical events. This exposure to new information broadens one's perspective and fosters a greater understanding of the world beyond their immediate surroundings.  Additionally, computers facilitate communication with others online. In today's interconnected world, the ability to connect with people across geographical boundaries is invaluable. Whether for personal or professional purposes, the internet enables individuals to stay in touch, collaborate, and share ideas with others seamlessly.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in enhancing hand-eye coordination, expanding knowledge about the world, and facilitating online communication. The positive impact of computers on people's lives is undeniable, as they empower individuals to learn, connect, and thrive in the digital age.  Sincerely,   [Your Name]
718	720	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you about the use of computers and how they are bad for society. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature, and having fewer interactions, computers are doing more harm than good. Almost everyone has a computer nowadays, and its usage is increasing, taking away valuable opportunities for physical activity and outdoor experiences.  Firstly, the widespread use of computers contributes to a decline in physical exercise. Many individuals, especially children, spend hours sitting in front of screens instead of engaging in active pursuits. This sedentary lifestyle is a significant factor in the rising rates of obesity and related health issues in our society. The convenience of accessing entertainment and information online has led to a decrease in physical activity and outdoor play, resulting in a less healthy population.  Secondly, the immersion in the virtual world provided by computers has led to a disconnect from nature. People can now view images and videos of natural landscapes without actually stepping outside, diminishing the value of firsthand experiences in the great outdoors. The lack of direct interaction with nature can have adverse effects on mental health and overall well-being. Additionally, the increased energy consumption associated with computer usage contributes to environmental degradation, as individuals prioritize convenience over conservation.  Lastly, the excessive reliance on computers for communication has led to a decline in personal interactions. People now prefer to communicate through text messages, emails, and social media platforms rather than engaging in face-to-face conversations. This shift has resulted in a loss of essential social skills and emotional connections. The lack of direct contact with others hinders the development of meaningful relationships and can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, their overuse can have detrimental effects on individuals and society as a whole. It is crucial for people to strike a balance between digital technology and real-world experiences to maintain physical health, appreciate nature, and foster genuine human connections. By being mindful of the impact of excessive computer usage, we can strive towards a healthier and more balanced way of life.
719	721	1	3	Dear local newspaper, it has come to our attention that the impact of computers on individuals is a topic of debate. Many argue that computers have negative effects on people, and I am inclined to agree.   First and foremost, the use of computers often leads to a sedentary lifestyle, reducing the time people have for exercise. In today's society, where nearly one in every three young adults is obese, this lack of physical activity can have serious health implications. Spending hours in front of a screen instead of engaging in outdoor activities can contribute to weight problems and other health issues in the long run.  Moreover, the accessibility of inappropriate websites on computers poses a significant risk, especially for teenagers. Parents are constantly concerned about what their children are exposed to online, and the presence of harmful content can be a source of stress and worry. Limiting the time spent on computers can alleviate some of these concerns and protect young users from potentially dangerous online interactions.  Additionally, the excessive use of computers can lead to a decline in real-life social interactions. People may prioritize screen time over spending quality time with family and friends, missing out on valuable moments and connections. This detachment from personal relationships can have detrimental effects on mental and emotional well-being.  In conclusion, while computers can be valuable tools for education and communication, it is essential to acknowledge their potential negative impacts. By encouraging moderation and balance in computer usage, we can mitigate the risks associated with excessive screen time and promote a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle for individuals.

For example, they help businesses keep track of important files and assist people in the music industry by creating beats and recording music. Computers benefit individuals of all ages, aiding younger students with schoolwork and assisting elderly individuals in their professional endeavors. Additionally, computers provide valuable insights into current events, such as news updates and weather forecasts. The continuous advancements in technology demonstrate how computers are essential for various tasks and have significantly influenced our daily lives. Without the convenience of computers, many of us would not have reached our current level of success and efficiency.
724	726	1	3	Dear the @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 studied that @PERCENT1 of people believe computers have a positive effect on people. You can stay in touch with relatives. Also, you can entertain yourself over long trips. Computers have positive effects on people. Computers let you stay in touch with relatives, keep up with friends, and are a good source of entertainment. If you have distant relatives, you can keep in touch. Video chatting lets you see someone and talk to them practically face to face from thousands of miles away. If you are sad and need to talk to somebody, you are a few clicks away from being cheered up. Also, if you are in the army and have a @ORGANIZATION1 baby, you can watch as they take their first steps or say their first words. Video chatting is not the only way to stay in touch but also allows you to talk even without a computer. AIM and @CAPS1 let you see what's going on with your friends that you might see every day or once a year at @DATE2 camp. @CAPS1 lets you keep in touch with everything that's going on with things like status updates. AIM lets you talk with just your keyboard where you type messages to people. Maybe you want to go into town with a friend; just send them a message by @CAPS1 or AIM. Computers are not only for staying in touch, though; you can stay entertained while you travel around. Computers let you do so much to stay entertained over long rides or even rides. If you want to watch a movie, just put in a disc or even rent one off iTunes or Netflix. If you want to listen to a song, download it in seconds and listen to it. Also, you can even play video games on your computer. Just buy the game, install it, and then play. Computers are a great thing during downtime and have positive effects on people. Computers let you keep in touch with family, stay up to date with friends, and are an excellent source of entertainment during long trips or downtime. Computers are the lightbulb of the @DATE1.
725	727	1	3	Dear Newspaper,   I believe that the effects of using computers are acceptable as long as we balance our screen time with outdoor activities, socializing with friends, and getting regular exercise. Computers offer numerous benefits such as facilitating communication, allowing for virtual challenges and games that are both entertaining and non-harmful, and providing access to valuable information on various topics.   Additionally, computers make tasks like managing finances, finding insurance options, researching historical facts, locating services like plumbers and technicians, and even finding romantic partners much more convenient. They also have the potential to simulate scenarios like war games without putting real lives at risk. In essence, while there are concerns about the impact of excessive computer use on our lives, when utilized in a balanced and responsible manner, they can greatly enhance our daily activities and overall quality of life.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
726	728	1	3	Dear local newspaper, did you know that the average person spends 6 hours and 42 minutes a day on the computer? This excessive screen time is concerning as it leads to a sedentary lifestyle, less time spent outdoors, and decreased social interactions with family and friends.   Studies have shown that reducing computer usage can encourage more physical activity. With obesity rates on the rise, especially in our community where 25% of the population is obese, cutting back on computer time could make a significant impact on improving overall health.  Furthermore, limiting computer use would also promote spending more time outdoors. Research conducted at a local school revealed that 30% of individuals would choose to go outside if they couldn't use their computers. This shift towards outdoor activities not only benefits personal health but also helps in fostering a greater appreciation for nature and reducing electricity consumption.  Moreover, reducing computer dependence encourages more face-to-face interactions with loved ones. While social media platforms offer convenient ways to connect, nothing can replace the value of in-person conversations and quality time spent with family and friends. By stepping away from screens, individuals can strengthen relationships and create lasting memories.  In conclusion, it is evident that excessive computer usage hinders physical activity, limits time spent outdoors, and reduces opportunities for meaningful social interactions. By being mindful of our screen time and prioritizing real-world experiences, we can lead healthier, more fulfilling lives. Let's strive to strike a balance between technology and personal well-being for a brighter and more connected future.
727	729	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a great thing to have. For instance they are entertaining, they have communication, and they help make designs. My first reason is that computers are entertaining. I hate to go look at nature. But I love to play video games on my computer. I still get my exercise though, because I go out and play basketball then play on my computer. The computers are still a good thing though because after I'm done with basketball, hanging out with friends, or if it's raining I like to play some good old gun blasting computer games. My second reason is that you can communicate with computers. I love to talk to my friends on Facebook. You can just log in and talk to anyone in the world. There is also video chat you can actually see someone who is talking to you from anywhere. Plus email is great for work. You can send information from one computer to the other. My last reason is for designs every modern car that you drive, is originally from a computer. People get on these computers and make blue print designs to make cars. These are my reasons that computers are good.  In conclusion, computers serve as a source of entertainment, facilitate communication with others globally, and play a crucial role in creating designs such as modern cars. The versatility and functionality of computers make them an indispensable tool in various aspects of daily life.
728	730	1	3	Dear Newspaper,   The invention of the computer has had a profound impact on society, despite some negative perceptions. Computers offer essential applications that streamline daily tasks. For example, calculators save time by quickly solving simple or complex math problems, aiding in financial calculations and academic work. Note-taking applications allow for efficient typing, facilitating organized study notes for exams.   Moreover, the internet, a pivotal tool on computers, provides access to a vast array of information for various purposes. From checking movie times to planning family trips, the internet serves as a valuable resource. Additionally, computers are invaluable for learning, enabling research on diverse topics and aiding in project completion. Communication is also greatly enhanced through email, blogging, and instant messaging, which facilitate easy interaction and information sharing.  In essence, computers play a crucial role in modern life, enhancing productivity, learning, and communication. Without them, our society would face significant challenges in functioning efficiently.
729	731	1	3	Dear Readers, I believe that Computers do good in our country and have a positive affect too people. This is because it saves paper sending emails and you save money too, also you can learn new things about different countries like @LOCATION1, and lastly you can interact with people you know and talk to them and use technology to your advantage. These are a few reasons why computers have a positive affect on society and the way we live. First off, computers help save the environment by letting us not cut down trees and make paper out of them. Do you know how many trees are cut down a day around @NUM1 trees and they are all not immediately taken to the mills to be turned into paper? They stop in piles at logging sites and are left rotting there not being put to good use. I feel that trees have feelings like us but can't talk without a mouth. So when you cut down a tree, it's like robbing. Using computers, we save trees and stop all that from happening. This is one reason why I think computers have a positive impact on society. Secondly, learning - you can learn a lot on a computer; all you have to do is look for it. I learn many things each day at school because of the help of computers, and I feel that if computers are used, it can excel our learning and we can learn a lot more in a lot shorter time than if we were to find a book on the subject we're looking for. Computers have made things a lot easier for children to learn new things when we use computers. So computers are a good thing and a bad thing. Finally, you can talk and interact with friends. Technology has advanced so much that we don't see the world in perspective. Like take a cell phone for example, what do you see mostly likely? A phone. But if you open it up, what do you find? You will find a micro computer that's capable of surfing the internet, playing music, just a smaller size than before. Computers have revolutionized the way we look at the world and technology; we can talk and play games using this technology most of what we see every day is used with technology like a game station or even a car radio, and all of it is used to help us interact with one another. So I view technology as a good thing. In conclusion, technology has a positive and negative impact, but more positive than negative influence. Technology helps us in our everyday lives and helps save the environment by letting us talk and save paper just by a button. Technology has revolutionized the way mankind lives and how they view society, but it's all a good thing in the end. So, I conclude that technology/computers have a positive and negative impact on society.
730	732	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I do not think people use the computer too much. I think this because some use them for work, some use them for school, and some use it to talk to family or friends that are not so close to them. Firstly, most businesses need computers to keep the businesses up and running. Like where my mom works, she needs the computer for payroll, inventory, emailing the workers about jobs, and to look up companies to supply concrete, stone, trucks, etc. Business people have excuses to have to use computers all the time. Most business people also use computers to plan business trips. Secondly, kids in school use computers to do homework, classwork, research for projects, or to go and study island and education. Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting. Like how cells divide into smaller cells, how body systems work, or how a girl or boy is made from embryo to birth. In addition, most people use computers. Like @CAPS2 people use @CAPS2 to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use AIM. I have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away. I use AIM to talk to all my friends, I use to face with. So, don't say all people are on the computer too much and for the wrong reasons, because that is not true at all. Finally, although all people are always on the computer, it is most likely to talk to friends you haven't seen in a while or for work issues, and for school-related work. In my opinion, all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life nowadays. So, I don't think there are any effects on anyone because we all use it to our benefits.
731	733	1	3	Honestly, I totally and absolutely believe that child internet use should be cut down in the @LOCATION2, because of many reasons. First of all, the internet can make people very obese, for example, if your friend was going to a walk to your house, but then decided to @CAPS1 you instead, he is probably not getting a lot of exercise. As a matter of fact, the leading @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 is no longer cigarettes. It's obesity. Actually @NUM1 @CAPS3 are obese, with that number still rising. Another reason why internet use should be cut down because bullies, hackers, and terrorists can exploit children online. It is essential to protect our children from potential harm and ensure their safety in the digital world. In conclusion, limiting child internet use in @LOCATION2 is crucial for promoting physical health and safeguarding children from online threats.
732	734	1	3	Dear newspaper, This year my school and a cop come into my school and tell me and my peers about the dangers of online. This has made me believe that computers are not beneficial. Computers are not beneficial because they enforce bad habits. Plus, websites and some applications are dangerous. Also, they are very addictive. Computers have a bad effect on people. To begin, computers enforce bad habits. For example, some websites are bad websites that say mean things about other people. Some kids join in on the cyberbullying because other kids give in to peer pressure because they want to get accepted by their peers so badly. Furthermore, someone may agree to meet someone they don't know. That can be scary because you do not know if this person is really someone you thought they were. Recently, I read a magazine and it had an article in it about people going to meet other people they met online. Most people found out that it was not the person they thought they were. Finally, the computer enforces bad habits because people may send someone some questionable pictures to someone else. As I mentioned before, when the police officer came to our school, he talked about this. He said that people were sending pictures of them that were inappropriate to other people. Those other people would send it around, and in the end, it was a horrible mess. Computers do not only cause bad habits, but they are also dangerous. If you listen to the news, you will hear stories about child predators. I think that is one huge problem. If computers did not have such an impact on people, this would not be a problem. In addition, computers are dangerous because kids may choose to make bad decisions because they do not know. For example, many kids who are on Myspace or Facebook have not talked to their parent or guardian about internet safety. Or maybe even their parent or guardian isn't monitoring them to make sure they are safe online. In conclusion, the computer is dangerous because feelings could be hurt because of Myspace, Facebook, a blog, a video, or maybe even more. As an illustration, one time on the news, I heard a story about a girl who was teased on the internet. She felt so bad that she committed suicide. I found that horrible. A person should never commit suicide, especially because some other person could not be nice. To sum up, computers are very dangerous. Computers are also addictive. To start off, it makes you spend less time with your family. Also, it can affect your schoolwork because you may be spending more time on the computer than studying. In addition, it can lead to health problems because you are constantly looking at a screen. Overall, computers are not beneficial because they enforce bad habits, are dangerous, and are addictive. We should be cautious and mindful of the impact they have on our lives.
733	735	1	3	As you can see, technology these days is always getting more and more advanced. It seems as if there is a new invention that attracts many people to buy all the time. One electronic that has been useful in so many ways to people are the computers. Many think too much time is spent on this, but then I think about how much it's benefiting. Computers can tell you pretty much anything you need to know, whether it's about the same country, or how to solve a problem. Also, computers are so advanced where you can talk to friends who are far away. Lastly, computers are helping us by giving very specific directions, rather than figuring out a map. Say you're doing a school project about a country. By typing in exactly what you need to know, you can find your information in a heartbeat - whether it's population, density, languages, foods, or holidays. Or maybe you just want to know about this country because it interested you. Maybe even you plan on visiting this country, you're going to want to know about the place you'll be spending your time. If you do plan on traveling to somewhere you've been researching, you can order your plane tickets right there online. You can figure out the routes you plan on taking, and this can help organize your trip. Another reason computers are benefiting so many people is the feature of communicating with others, whether it's talking to a faraway friend or family, or your best friend a couple streets over; you probably still want to keep in touch with them. Computers are so advanced now that they have webcams, where you can visually see the person you're contacting right on the computer. This is a more exciting way to talk to someone, especially if it's someone you don't see often that may even live in another country. Most teenagers like to keep in touch pretty much every day. Usually, kids like chatting on instant message just for the pleasure of talking to your friends. Finally, computers are benefiting us with knowing directions and routes. Like mentioned before, computers can give straightforward directions. This is easier to handle rather than using a map while on the road. There are websites where all you have to do is type in your exact location and your exact destination, and it will tell you specific roads and turns you need to take. In conclusion, those who are worried about spending too much time on the computer should learn to expand their time doing outdoor activities and shorten time online, using the computer only when necessary.
734	736	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I understand your concerns about whether computers are bad for people. I believe that computers are having negative effects on our society, making us more antisocial, contributing to obesity, and enabling cyberbullying.   Firstly, computers are leading us to become more isolated and less social. With a large percentage of the population spending hours each week on the computer, engaging in activities like watching videos or chatting online, we are losing valuable face-to-face interactions. This can hinder our social skills and impact our ability to communicate effectively in the real world.   Additionally, excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, increasing the risk of obesity. Many people spend more time in front of a screen than engaging in physical activity, which can have detrimental effects on our overall health.   Lastly, cyberbullying has become a prevalent issue, with a significant percentage of teenagers experiencing some form of online harassment. This can have serious consequences on mental health, leading to depression and even risky behaviors.   In conclusion, I believe that the negative impact of computers on our society is significant. It is crucial that we monitor and limit our screen time to prioritize our physical and mental well-being. By addressing these issues, we can work towards creating a healthier and more balanced society.
735	737	1	3	Dear (Newspaper), This is a very controversial topic. I am discussing. But on this one, I must say I agree with the experts when they say computers have a negative effect on people. It ruins their social lives, and other bad things. If you spend all your time on the computer, you get no exercise, no fresh air, and you will not get to experience the rest of the world. Not receiving your daily exercise is a big problem. Obesity has already been an issue for millions people in the @LOCATION1 And it is mostly because they eat unhealthy snacks while sitting at the computer the whole day! If you want to live a long and healthy life, don't spend all your time having your eyes give to a screen. In addition, everyone needs fresh air, right? Going on the computer inside a room is not going to help at all. You need your daily intake of oxygen. Lastly, if you are on long enough, it will become an obsession. Computers already have a bad effect on people all around, and just think about what has just been mentioned. Another problem computers have is that they keep you away from your family and friends. As mentioned before, the social life you had will be gone. With that in mind, people will always see you on the computer, and eventually get sick of you. Computers bring no adventures, just pictures of them. Going out into the real world might be hard, but it is something that should be done. A real life cannot be lived in a dark room with no people or no nature. Haven't you always wanted to travel around the world, see different types of cultures, lifestyles, etc? It gets to the point where computer use should be limited, and living your life should be in place of your free time. Using a computer all day will not let you meet new people, and see new places. You will be getting nowhere with a computer screen in your face, so put it away! In conclusion, using computers all the time restricts you from exercising, getting fresh air, meeting new people, and seeing different places all over. At the end of the day, life is short, so you can't afford to waste it. Computers have a negative effect on everybody, and hopefully someday these problems will be changed.
736	738	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people by enabling communication, providing information, and enhancing knowledge. Despite some concerns about lack of interaction with family members, computers actually offer various platforms for communication such as chat rooms and video calls, allowing individuals to connect with loved ones. Additionally, computers serve as valuable sources of information on a wide range of topics, from animals to different locations, all easily accessible from the comfort of one's home. Moreover, computers contribute to cognitive development by improving hand-eye coordination and offering educational resources on various careers and subjects. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in facilitating communication, expanding knowledge, and enhancing intellectual capabilities, ultimately benefiting individuals in numerous ways.
737	739	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I'm writing to you today about computers. I believe that computers can teach you things such as hand-eye coordination and open job opportunities for you. Additionally, you can socialize and study effectively with this device.   Firstly, computers are a great tool for socialization. Websites like Facebook allow people to connect and interact with others, helping them to stay in touch with friends and family. A recent poll showed that a majority of people believe that computers have made them more social, highlighting the positive impact of technology on relationships. Moreover, computers enable communication across long distances, bridging gaps and bringing people together instantly.  Secondly, computers are invaluable for academic purposes. They provide easy access to a wealth of information on various topics, from academic articles to online resources like Wikipedia and Google. This accessibility enhances the learning experience and allows individuals to explore diverse perspectives and sources. With a computer, one can conduct research, write papers, and collaborate with others more efficiently.  Lastly, computers can improve hand-eye coordination, a skill that is essential in many professions. For example, accountants and real estate agents benefit from precise hand-eye coordination to perform tasks accurately and swiftly. By honing this skill through computer use, individuals can increase their productivity and competitiveness in the job market, leading to potential career advancement and financial gains.  In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits in terms of socialization, education, and career development. They are versatile tools that can enhance various aspects of life and open up new opportunities for individuals. With the right skills and knowledge, one can harness the power of computers to achieve personal and professional success.
738	740	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that children are spending too much time on the computer for the wrong reasons. I say this because all young children and teenagers want to do is get on to @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 all day instead of researching and things like that. I have three reasons why I think going on the computer for the wrong reasons instead of exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends is a concern.  Firstly, spending excessive time on the internet can be dangerous, especially when entering chat rooms where there may be potential risks such as encountering kidnappers who deceive individuals with false information to lure them into dangerous situations. It is important for children to prioritize their safety and engage in activities that do not pose such risks.  Secondly, excessive computer use can take away valuable time from learning and educational activities. Instead of utilizing the internet for educational purposes or completing homework, children may be tempted to spend hours on non-educational content, hindering their academic progress and intellectual growth.  Lastly, the internet can expose individuals, especially young teens, to violent content that may influence their behavior and perception of violence. Constant exposure to violence through online games and websites can desensitize individuals and normalize aggression, leading to potential negative consequences in real life.  In conclusion, while the internet can be a valuable tool for learning and entertainment, it is essential for children to strike a balance and prioritize activities that promote their well-being and development. Excessive time spent on the computer for non-educational purposes can have detrimental effects on children's safety, academic performance, and behavior. It is crucial for parents and guardians to monitor and guide children in their internet usage to ensure a healthy and productive balance in their lives.
739	741	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Technology such as computers have been proven to have a positive impact on society. Computers not only teach hand-eye coordination but also provide access to information about faraway places with just a few clicks. Additionally, they facilitate communication with others through various online platforms, helping people stay connected with friends and family. Overall, the continuous growth of technology is enhancing our lives in numerous ways, making it an invaluable asset for society.
740	742	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are not bad for society. They actually can be quite good for people. Computers allow us to talk with people online. They can help us in school and give information we need to do things in life. People think they are bad, but all you have to do is look a little deeper and you will find the good in @CAPS7. @CAPS5 people use a @CAPS2, <@PERCENT2@NUM1> of the time @CAPS7 is to talk with people on the @CAPS3, whether @CAPS7 is using video chat or e-mail. People who don't like to use @CAPS2 and e-mail @CAPS10 ""@CAPS4 not use a phone or even talk to them in person."" With e-mail, you can send a message to some one miles away. If you are sending someone a list, a recipe for example. you don't want to @CAPS10 to them over the phone. @CAPS7 would be easier to type @CAPS7 out and then send @CAPS7 to them over the e-mail. ""@CAPS5 my son said. he was going to tech me how to use e-mail, I thought @CAPS7 was going to be a waste of time,"" @CAPS6 @PERSON1, senior citizen. ""@CAPS7 tursns out, @CAPS7 wasn't. Now i use e-mail e-mail every day. Many people think email is a waste of time, but @CAPS7 can help you in your everyday life. The @CAPS3 can helps in @MONTH1 ways also. @CAPS7 can help us get information about various topics. If you are trying to cook a stir fry but you don't know what to put in @CAPS7. You try to call you mother but she isn't there. Your next choise is to look look @CAPS7 up on the @CAPS2. @CAPS7 turns out theres a website that gives a recipe for a stir fry and you follow a do make the best one even. I know for an experience that you can find maps to places on line, since i have to go some is here almost everyweek. Google map is the most used place on the @CAPS3, besides e-mail. Some newspaper have websites @CAPS11 you can read the paper without actually paying for the paper This saves you money and @CAPS7 was less paper @CAPS11 we can save trees. The huge world of the @CAPS3 can change our lives. @PERCENT1 of people that use the @CAPS2 almost everyday are students. Students use the @CAPS2 for many reasons. The biggest one is typing. Students use typing to type reports and e-mail. ""I have messy handwriting"", @CAPS10 student, @PERSON2. ""@CAPS11 if if weren't for the @CAPS2, no one would be able to read my homework and reports. Not even me"" @PERSON2 is the one of many people who are lucking that they harmy typing on the @CAPS2. Another reason students use @CAPS2 is to look up information for reports. If a student puts a bibliography in his report, you will see that he/she used the @CAPS3 @PERCENT2 of the time. There @MONTH1 not be a book in a local library for a student to use, but the @CAPS3 will have many website and blogs for him/her to use. The third reason is for help. There are many website that can help a student to use for help in any subject. The @CAPS3 can help a student pass school. A @CAPS2 can help anyone from talking to someone to helping a student with science. That is how computers are good. Additionally, computers can also assist in creating art and music, organizing schedules and tasks, and even improving mental health through online therapy sessions. In conclusion, while some may view computers negatively, they actually provide numerous benefits and opportunities for individuals in various aspects of life."
741	743	1	3	"To use computers, or not to. That is the question. Hundreds of millions of people use computers in their daily life today, but some believe that using computers does not benefit society. It is my firm belief that they do. Computers provide entertainment, a way to interact with people, and a nearly endless expanse of knowledge. Without them, we would quickly find life to be much harder and less fun to navigate.  Have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on TV? Well, I have on many occasions. When that happens, all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips. You can go on game sites and play thousands of different games. This can also help improve your hand-eye coordination. You can also watch movies or TV shows that you missed or want to watch again. You can even go on sites such as fanfiction.net and read or write your own stories.  Another reason why computers benefit society is that they help you interact with people. You can keep in touch with far-away family members and friends using webcams, email, and chat sites without the bill that would come with talking on the phone. You can also meet new people from different countries and become friends. That way, you learn about different ways of life and cultures. You can also quickly contact people in an emergency, get updates on events, and communicate with your teacher if you have a question about your homework.  Lastly, and maybe even most importantly, computers are an enormous source of knowledge. Say you wanted to learn how to start a campfire, you could just search, ""how to make fire"" on Google and countless matches would be found within seconds. Also, if you were assigned a project for school, you could do all of your research easily from your computer, then type the whole thing up on a word document. You can even get a college degree online if you wished. And if you want to find a restaurant that specializes in Italian cooking, you can find one close to you, get directions to it, look at the menu, see the prices, get the restaurant's history, and find reviews for it all on one magnificent little device: your computer.  So you see, computers benefit society greatly. In fact, I don't think we could live without them. They provide us with entertainment, an easy way to interact with people, and a huge source of information. Now, to all of you people who still think computers are bad, I'd like to see you last a week without using one."
742	744	1	3	Dear residents of @LOCATION1, I firmly believe that utilizing computers brings significant benefits to our community. Computers play a vital role in facilitating research, accessing job opportunities, and enhancing communication among individuals.   Firstly, the use of computers greatly aids in conducting research efficiently. With easy access to the internet, individuals can quickly find information on various topics, enabling them to complete tasks such as homework assignments or projects in a timely manner. This instant access to a wealth of knowledge is invaluable in today's fast-paced world.  Moreover, the prevalence of computer-based work in modern society means that possessing computer skills is essential for securing employment. Many jobs now require individuals to be proficient in using computers for tasks such as data entry, research, and communication. By familiarizing themselves with computer technology, individuals can significantly expand their job prospects and increase their chances of landing well-paying positions.  Additionally, computers facilitate communication and connection with others. Through social media platforms, email, and messaging apps, individuals can stay in touch with friends and family members, regardless of physical distance. This ability to communicate easily and quickly fosters relationships and strengthens community bonds.  In conclusion, the use of computers offers numerous advantages to our community, including improved research capabilities, access to job opportunities, and enhanced communication. Embracing computer technology is crucial in today's digital age, and I urge all residents of @LOCATION1 to recognize the benefits it brings to our lives. Let us continue to embrace and utilize computers for the betterment of our community.
743	745	1	3	Dear @STATE1's newspaper editors, I recently read an article discussing experts' concerns about excessive computer usage. I agree that spending too much time on computers can take away from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. This issue is particularly evident among teenagers, with an increasing number becoming overweight or obese due to sedentary lifestyles.  Regular exercise is crucial for maintaining good health, especially for overweight or obese teens. Neglecting physical activity can lead to long-term health problems such as diabetes, which can be costly to manage. Additionally, excessive screen time can detract from experiencing the beauty of nature firsthand. While some may argue that the internet allows people to learn about various places, nothing compares to actually exploring and immersing oneself in different environments.  Furthermore, spending too much time on computers can hinder social interactions with family and friends. Studies show that teens who communicate well with their parents tend to perform better in school and exhibit more respect towards others. In contrast, those who struggle to engage with their families may experience difficulties concentrating and achieving academic success.  As a busy newspaper editor, I urge you to consider the importance of balancing computer usage with physical activity, nature exploration, and quality time with loved ones. These aspects play a significant role in maintaining overall well-being and fostering healthy relationships. Let us remember the value of exercise, outdoor adventures, and meaningful connections with family and friends in our increasingly digital world.
744	746	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, I'm sending you this letter on the behalf of the people that spend way too much time on computers. Some people @MONTH1 say that you learn different cultures and interact with new people everyday. The truth is that a computer doesn't help you; in fact it hurts you. By spending all day on the computer you will get fat, lose great experiences on the outside and miss out on life. As a whole @LOCATION1 is known as an obese country. This is due to the fact that most people eat and then dont exercise. Most of these obese people don't exercise because they are glued to thier computer. While interacting with others they just keep on eating, most dont even know why they're eating. If we want to erase @LOCATION1 as being an obese country, then we must get people away from their computer screens. It is actually our fault, because we aren't making a stand. We must show people just how bad the computer really is. Also, while people are on the computer they're missing out on the world. They won't go outside, they wont know what the real world is actually like. Imagine cthat being an adult and having no clue about the outside world. Also, the could miss out on life changing exercises the kind of experiments that people @CAPS1, they would miss out on life as a whole. We only have one life, so you better enjoy it. It would be so sad for someone to just pass through life being stuck on your computer screen. I truly feel bad for that person, then again it could be fixed. All that we have to do is take away the computer. If we do this then all the problems will be solved. Finally, if we get rid of computers we will be known as a new nation. Free from temptation and independent human beings. We will rewrite ourself in history as the that made a chane and got rid of computers. Let's make this change together for a healthier and more fulfilling life for all.
745	747	1	3	Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, but are they really beneficial for us? According to some people, the answer is no. They argue that computers have a negative impact on individuals, leading to various health issues and security concerns.  One of the main concerns raised is the sedentary lifestyle that comes with using computers. Many people spend hours sitting in front of a computer at work and then continue this habit at home. Instead of engaging in physical activities like going for a walk or a bike ride, they choose to spend their time online. This lack of physical movement can contribute to health problems, including obesity, which is a growing issue in many societies.  Moreover, the safety of personal information on computers is another major worry. With the rise of cyber threats, there is a constant risk of hackers gaining access to sensitive data stored on computers. Viruses can easily infiltrate a computer system, allowing unauthorized individuals to monitor activities and potentially steal personal information such as passwords or financial details. This poses a serious threat to individuals who conduct online transactions, as their bank account information could be compromised.  In conclusion, while computers offer convenience and efficiency, they also bring about significant risks to our health and security. It is important for individuals to be mindful of the negative effects of excessive computer usage and take steps to protect themselves from potential threats. Balancing computer use with physical activity and implementing robust security measures are essential to maintain a healthy and secure lifestyle in the digital age.
746	748	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, computers play a crucial role in our society today by providing easy access to information and facilitating various activities. In today's world, when we need to know something important, we often turn to computers for quick and reliable answers. Whether it's researching a topic for a school project or finding out about current events, computers are essential tools that help us stay informed and connected with the world around us.  One of the key benefits of computers is their ability to help us learn and expand our knowledge. By searching the internet, we can access a wealth of information on a wide range of topics, allowing us to deepen our understanding and enhance our education. For example, in a classroom setting, computers can provide students with the resources they need to complete assignments and projects efficiently, without the limitations of traditional resources like books.  Moreover, computers are valuable for organizing and signing up for activities such as sports teams, clubs, or gym memberships. By utilizing online platforms, individuals can easily register for events or programs, saving time and streamlining the process. This convenience is especially helpful for busy individuals who may not have the time to physically visit locations to sign up.  In conclusion, computers are indispensable tools that have revolutionized the way we access information, learn, and participate in activities. Their impact on our society is undeniable, as they enable us to navigate our daily lives more efficiently and effectively. As technology continues to advance, the role of computers in shaping our society will only become more significant.
747	749	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  Computers have become an essential tool in our daily lives, providing us with easy access to a wealth of information, simplifying school projects, and offering instant entertainment. Gone are the days of tedious trips to the library and hours spent searching through books and encyclopedias. With just a few clicks on the computer, we can find all the information we need for school reports, projects, or simply to satisfy our curiosity.  When it comes to school projects, computers make the process much more efficient. Instead of spending time drawing pictures or writing out long essays by hand, we can easily find images online and type out our work in a fraction of the time. The convenience of being able to save our work on a thumb drive and access it from any computer is a huge advantage.  Furthermore, computers provide us with instant pleasure through a wide range of games and websites where we can interact with friends. Whether we want to catch up on missed TV shows or watch music videos, the computer offers endless entertainment options at our fingertips. With the fast-paced nature of our lives today, having access to these forms of entertainment whenever we want is a great convenience.

748	750	1	3	Yes, I agree with the concern that experts have about the excessive use of computers. People often become addicted to the computer, neglecting their family relationships. This can lead to conflicts and distance within the family. Additionally, there are various dangers online, such as encountering individuals who may not be who they claim to be, posing serious risks. It is important to be cautious and aware of these potential threats. Moreover, spending too much time on the computer can hinder brain activity and development. Engaging in activities that challenge the mind, such as reading or solving puzzles, is crucial for mental stimulation. Research has shown that individuals who prioritize mental exercises perform better on tests compared to those who spend excessive time on the computer. Therefore, it is essential to find a balance and limit computer usage to ensure overall well-being and healthy brain function.
749	751	1	3	I would like to state on my behalf that I do not agree that computers are good for society. There are three reasons why I do not agree. Many people will not enjoy the outdoors, as they will spend their time on the computer, and a lot of people will gain weight due to inactivity. When you sit on a computer for a while, you may not get off because you are having fun. This can lead to getting hooked and choosing to play on the computer rather than going outside to have fun with friends. This can take up all of your time. When you are bored, instead of staying on the computer, it is important to find something else to do to avoid boredom escalating. Inactivity caused by spending too much time on the computer can also lead to weight gain, as burning fewer calories can result in unhealthy weight gain. It is crucial to find a balance and not spend excessive time on the computer. Remember, enjoying the outdoors, finding alternative activities when bored, and avoiding excessive inactivity are all important factors to consider. It is essential to prioritize physical activity and engagement with the world outside of the digital realm for a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
750	752	1	3	In my opinion, computers are not to blame for people lacking exercise or sleep. It ultimately comes down to the individual's choices and priorities. Those who spend excessive time on the computer may neglect their physical health, leading to weight gain and sleep deprivation. However, it is up to them to set limits and prioritize healthy habits. Spending too much time on the computer can also lead to a lack of social interaction with family and friends, potentially causing strained relationships. It is essential to find a balance between screen time and other activities, such as exercising, spending time outdoors, and fulfilling responsibilities. Ultimately, individuals must take responsibility for their choices and make conscious efforts to maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
751	753	1	3	Dear local newspaper,  I agree with @CAPS1 that computers can have negative effects on people for various reasons. One of the main concerns is the impact on a person's health. Spending too much time on a computer can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, where individuals are not getting enough exercise. This lack of physical activity can result in health issues such as obesity, cardiovascular problems, and even musculoskeletal disorders. Additionally, excessive screen time can strain the eyes and lead to vision problems, which may require wearing glasses.  Moreover, excessive computer use can also have detrimental effects on relationships. When individuals prioritize their screen time over interacting with family and friends, it can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnect. Maintaining strong relationships with loved ones is essential for overall well-being, and neglecting these connections can have long-lasting consequences.  Furthermore, spending too much time on the computer can alter a person's behavior and attitudes. It can lead to changes in communication style, social skills, and overall personality. This shift in behavior may impact how individuals interact with others and can potentially lead to misunderstandings and conflicts.  In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly brought about numerous benefits and advancements, it is essential to be mindful of the potential negative effects of excessive use. It is crucial for individuals to find a balance between technology and real-life interactions to maintain their health, relationships, and overall well-being.  Thank you for considering these perspectives.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
752	754	1	3	You need to gather information for a project you're presenting in school, but how are you going to find out about your topic quickly and easily? Most people will turn to one of the most commonly used pieces of technology in the world, the computer. The computer is used for quick and easy research, interacting, and communicating with friends, as well as for personal entertainment. Some argue that the computer may take away from enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends, and exercising. However, the computer plays a crucial role in making research, communication, and entertainment more accessible and convenient.  Computers help us learn about almost anything quickly and easily, making schoolwork and job tasks less stressful. Without a computer, research would be much more challenging and might require extensive travel. Additionally, computers have programs that aid in preparing articles, essays, slide shows, and brochures for presentations. This functionality simplifies the process of creating and sharing information effectively.  Communication is another essential aspect of computers, allowing people to stay connected with friends and family worldwide. Through websites and email, individuals can communicate instantly without incurring any costs. Live chat and webcam features further enhance the communication experience, offering real-time interaction and the feeling of being in the same room. These communication tools provided by computers facilitate staying in touch with loved ones, regardless of physical distance.  Furthermore, computers offer personal entertainment through various games that help alleviate boredom. Engaging in computer games can also improve hand-eye coordination and cognitive skills. Additionally, computers aid in organization by allowing users to store and access files, photos, videos, and other content easily. This organizational feature simplifies information management and retrieval, contributing to increased efficiency in daily tasks.  In conclusion, while some may argue that computers detract from certain activities, the benefits they provide in terms of research, communication, and entertainment cannot be overlooked. The computer serves as a valuable tool that enhances productivity, connectivity, and personal enjoyment. Embracing the advancements in technology, particularly the computer, can significantly improve various aspects of our lives.
753	755	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a great and beneficial impact on society. They have many features, options, and abilities to use! Would you really try to prevent your child, friends, and families from using such an amazing invention that helps us every day? The computer can help others communicate, help educate you, and even prepare you for the future. One great option that computers have is the option to communicate with others. You can set up an email or a chatting account to talk with friends and family. Now some people might think, ""Why not use a phone to talk to others."" But there are many reasons why talking online can be better than using a phone. I remember one time a few years ago. Me and my cousin were alone at her house when the phone wasn't working. My cousin went downstairs to get us some sodas when I heard a crashing sound, she had fallen down the stairs. Because the phones weren't operating, I hopped to the computers in her room to quickly ""chat"" with my dad and tell him what happened. From there on, my dad called an ambulance and she was alright. So, not only are computers a great way to communicate, but they can also save someone's life! Another feature computers have is that they can actually educate. For example, if a student has to write a paper for school about the rainforest, then they would need to do some research. The internet explorer on your computer can open your eyes to a world of knowledge. All you have to do is go to a search engine such as Google or Bing and type in the subject you wish to learn more about. Before you know it, there's millions upon millions of websites that can educate you on the subject you want to gain more knowledge on. A high school teacher states that 90% of students in the school use the computer to help them with homework and research. So, there you have it, the computer is a great resource for information. One last reason computers are beneficial for our society is because they can actually help you prepare for future jobs. Perhaps someday your child will get a job working in an office where they must use computers all day long. The head of the company is not going to hire you if you are not experienced with computers. However, if you know how to use a computer, then you have a great chance of getting a job that can support you and your family. Studies say now that 80% of businesses involve using a computer. Computers are becoming a bigger part of society by the second, it's important to start learning more about them as soon as possible! I think now it's very clear how important computers are in our society. They help increase communication, are a great source for knowledge, and help prepare you for jobs. With each passing day, computers help advance the future and help make the world a better place."
754	756	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I am writing this to express my concern about the excessive amount of time people are spending on computers, which is leading to a disconnection from nature and loved ones. While technology has its benefits, it is important to remember the value of spending time outdoors, exercising, and interacting with family and friends. Experts warn that prolonged use of computers can have negative effects on both physical and mental health. It is crucial for individuals to set limits on their screen time and prioritize activities that promote well-being, such as enjoying nature and building relationships with others. Let us all make a conscious effort to strike a balance between technology and the natural world, for the betterment of our health and relationships.
755	757	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 experts have expressed concerns about the impact of excessive computer usage on today's population, particularly in relation to the rise in obesity rates. It is evident that the convenience of technology has led to a sedentary lifestyle for many individuals, with people spending more time indoors staring at screens rather than engaging in physical activities outdoors. This shift towards a more inactive lifestyle has detrimental effects on both physical and mental well-being.  The increasing reliance on computers for social interactions through online platforms has also contributed to feelings of isolation and detachment from real-life social interactions. While technology allows for virtual connections, it cannot replace the richness of face-to-face interactions and the joy of spending time with loved ones in person. This isolation can further exacerbate feelings of loneliness and lead to a decline in overall mental health.  Furthermore, the allure of the digital world has led to a disconnection from the natural world. People are missing out on the beauty and benefits of spending time outdoors, such as the opportunity to exercise, breathe fresh air, and appreciate the wonders of nature. This disconnect not only hinders physical health but also diminishes the potential for personal growth and reflection that can be gained from immersing oneself in the natural environment.  In conclusion, while computers have their place in modern society, it is crucial to recognize the negative impact of excessive usage on physical health, social interactions, and connection to nature. Finding a balance between technology and real-life experiences is essential for overall well-being. It is time to prioritize activities that promote physical activity, social engagement, and appreciation for the natural world to foster a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle.
756	758	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that people are spending too much time on computers. I have several reasons to support this belief. One reason is that people waste a significant amount of money on their computer usage. The cost of electricity to run computers and the internet bills add up to a substantial amount each month. Additionally, everything that one can access on the computer can also be found in books, which are often a more reliable and beneficial source of information. Furthermore, the increasing reliance on computers is contributing to a global crisis of physical inactivity. This sedentary lifestyle is negatively impacting individuals' health and well-being, as well as society as a whole. In conclusion, it is evident that excessive computer usage is not only a financial burden but also a threat to our physical health and overall societal well-being.
757	759	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have heard the concern of many scientists about computers. Computers have brought us into the @DATE1 and have improved our society but they are harming our children's health and education. Because of computers, children and adults around the world are spending less time with family and friends, they are not enjoying athletic activities and they are having health problems.  Because of an increase in technology, children and adults are not spending time with their families. The computers are ruining family connections. For example, a study at @ORGANIZATION1 showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated less. The children are talking to their friends online or are going on social networking sites instead of talking in person to their family members. Also, computers are making it very hard for families to have meals together. When the children are on the computer, they do not want to leave. This obsession with technology is making it harder for families to grow and be more successful in school.  The computers are deterring children from better education. Athletic activities are also suffering because of computers. They spend more time indoors on websites instead of being active. This lack of physical activity can lead to various health issues such as obesity. The electricity that runs computers emits radiation, which can be harmful to health. Being exposed to this radiation could potentially lead to brain damage or even death.   When my aunt bought a computer for the first time, she experienced massive headaches that were caused by the radiation emitted from the computer. Another health risk associated with excessive computer use is obesity. Children who spend long hours in front of a computer tend to have an increased appetite and lack of exercise, leading to weight gain and potential health problems like diabetes.  In conclusion, the consequences of misusing computer technology are severe and could be life-threatening. It is essential to limit computer usage, especially among children, to avoid the negative impacts on health, education, and family relationships. We must find a balance between the benefits of technology and the potential harm it can cause.
758	760	1	3	Computers are undoubtedly useful tools in today's world, assisting with various tasks such as shopping, bill payments, and travel bookings. However, excessive screen time can have detrimental effects on individuals. Many people find themselves spending hours on end in front of a computer, whether for work or leisure activities. This prolonged sedentary behavior can take a toll on one's physical health, leading to issues like insomnia and weight gain. Lack of movement coupled with constant snacking can result in an unhealthy lifestyle and potential health risks.  Moreover, excessive computer use often means missing out on the beauty of nature and outdoor activities. People glued to their screens may overlook the joy of basking in the sun, playing in the snow, or simply taking a leisurely walk. The immersive nature of digital devices can disconnect individuals from the natural world, depriving them of essential fresh air and physical activity. It is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between computer use and outdoor engagement to maintain overall well-being.  In conclusion, while computers offer countless benefits, moderation is key when it comes to screen time. Balancing computer use with outdoor activities and exercise is vital for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding potential health issues. Prioritizing time spent away from screens can contribute to improved physical and mental well-being in the long run.
759	761	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Computers are undeniably useful tools for school projects, but the reliance on them can bring about various challenges. One common issue is the computer freezing, which can significantly impede progress and waste time. Additionally, pop-ups can lead to viruses that slow down the computer, further hindering productivity. These technical problems pose a significant downside to using computers for academic work.  Moreover, excessive computer usage can have negative health implications. It can promote a sedentary lifestyle, leading to physical inactivity and potential obesity. Furthermore, spending too much time on the computer can result in social isolation and reduced face-to-face interactions, contributing to mental health issues.  Despite the convenience computers offer, it is crucial to consider alternative methods for research and studying. Utilizing resources such as libraries for books or requesting textbooks from teachers can provide valuable information without the risks and downsides associated with excessive computer use. Embracing traditional methods like reading physical books can offer a healthier balance between technology and real-world engagement.  In conclusion, while computers have their advantages, it is essential to acknowledge the drawbacks and risks associated with their use. Exploring alternative approaches to research and learning can help mitigate these challenges and promote a more balanced and healthy academic experience. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to decide whether the benefits of computers outweigh the potential pitfalls they bring.
760	762	1	3	Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering a wide range of benefits as well as potential drawbacks. On one hand, they have revolutionized the way we work, study, and communicate. Websites like Google and Wikipedia provide us with instant access to a wealth of information, making research easier than ever before. Online textbooks have also made studying more convenient and portable. However, the constant use of computers can be distracting and addictive. Social media platforms and online games can easily consume our time and attention, leading to procrastination and neglect of real-life interactions. It is crucial to exercise self-control and set limits on computer usage to maintain a healthy balance between the virtual world and the real world. While computers offer numerous advantages, it is important to be mindful of their potential negative impacts and make conscious choices about how we use them in our daily lives.
761	763	1	3	To the Local Newspaper, Computers have a heavy impact on, today's society. People depend on them a lot but some people disagree. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are very entertaining. They can help find long-lost friends and keep in contact with them. Plus, they can be helpful with homework. Please proceed to read to see why I chose these reasons. Firstly, computers can entertain. There are thousands of games to choose from, from dress-up to educational ones, which are good for young children of age five through six. As it states in the writing prompt, it teaches hand-eye coordination. In addition to my first reason, computers help find long-lost friends. There are websites that help you find people, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Yahoo. These websites help keep in touch with family. If there's no phone, then there's always the computer. Lastly, computers can be helpful with homework. Sometimes you don't even need the internet as there's a calculator built right in! But a nationwide website that's used and children improve from it is edhelper.com. This website provides worksheets and helps with the level the child is on. In conclusion, I think that computers do have a good impact on people. They are entertaining, keep in contact, and helpful with homework. Please take my reasons into consideration.
762	764	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, To my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages. In my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. Also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? You will become less active. In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing. Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports. For example, 70% of Americans play soccer. In the beautiful fall when the leaves are beautifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beauty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. Another breathtaking adventure that you may miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see all the houses that have people like you (couch potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. The computer is like a cause and effect. You may think you are just playing farm town or chatting on Facebook, but in the future you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become overweight. A recent study showed that 30% of children are obese because of computer games. You may be thinking how, but I have a friend named, John, and he used to love to play outside and play sports until he came across the computer. Now he weighs 200 pounds and he is only 12. Honestly, sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. Lastly, playing on the computer or chatting with friends on social media can cause you to procrastinate. For example, if you are talking to your girlfriend in Spain who is there for college, I guarantee you are going to put off school work, homework, and other tasks that need to be done. In the end, it will end up being time for bed and you got nothing done whether it was because you were trying to get to level 10 or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished. If you are not yet aware, a recent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day for one week can damage your vision from a 20/20 to 20/40. If you keep it up, it may not seem bad now, but 8 hours looking at the computer can harm your eyes. Would you rather be blind or not use the computer because of what could happen? All in all, the computer is a bad thing, as such a useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. It also leads to being overweight since you are not getting active. Finally, the computer is bad for your eyes and can cause you to procrastinate. Help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused by the computer.
763	765	1	3	Dear editor, I believe that people should have computers. The reasons are it doesn't take days to email, you can learn about faraway places, and you can talk to people around the world. After looking at these details, most people are likely to agree.  Firstly, it doesn't take days to email. You can email someone, and it takes five seconds to get to the other person, while regular mail takes a day to a week to reach another person. Email is much faster than traditional mail, saving time and money for both individuals and the government.  Another reason is that you would be able to learn about different countries, both far away and nearby. Without computers, it would be challenging to learn about places like France or Japan from the comfort of your living room. Keeping up to date with global events, such as the earthquake in Chile, is made accessible through online resources.  Lastly, computers enable you to communicate with people worldwide through platforms like Facebook, MySpace, AIM, and video chat. Instead of making phone calls, you can connect with friends and family through video calls, enhancing communication and relationships.  In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits. They provide fast and efficient communication through email, offer a window to the world for learning about different countries, and facilitate global connections through various online platforms. Overall, computers have become an essential tool in our modern lives.
764	766	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Have you ever used a computer for anything besides business? If not, you should consider exploring the fun and helpful aspects of technology in your free time. Computers offer a wide range of entertainment options, assistance in various tasks, and easy access to information through websites. There are three compelling reasons why you should embrace this digital world.  Firstly, individuals have the right to choose how they spend their leisure time. The government cannot dictate our personal activities, and it is essential to exercise our freedom in selecting activities that bring us joy and relaxation. Additionally, the Constitution upholds our right to make decisions for ourselves, including how we utilize technology for entertainment and communication.  Moreover, during cold weather when outdoor activities may not be as appealing, computers provide a convenient alternative for entertainment and social interaction. By engaging in online activities, individuals can stay connected with friends and family members, even when physical gatherings may not be possible due to weather conditions or other factors.  Furthermore, the technological advancements of today offer numerous benefits that were not available in the past. From essential tools like generators to the vast resources available on the internet, technology enhances our lives in various ways. Embracing these advancements can enrich our experiences and make daily tasks more efficient.  In conclusion, exploring the world of computers beyond business can open up a world of entertainment, connection, and convenience. By embracing technology in our leisure time, we can enjoy its many benefits and enhance our overall quality of life. Thank you for considering these reasons, and I hope you give non-business computer use a chance.

766	768	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I strongly suggest that people should spend more time away from the computer.

Additionally, outdoor activities offer a fun and refreshing way to spend time away from screens. Connecting with nature and enjoying the outdoors can be a rejuvenating experience for both the body and mind.  Furthermore, spending time with family and friends is essential for building strong relationships and creating lasting memories. By prioritizing quality time with loved ones, individuals can strengthen bonds and create a sense of connection that is invaluable.   In conclusion, it is important to prioritize activities that promote physical well-being, mental rejuvenation, and meaningful relationships. By spending less time on the computer and more time engaging in exercise, outdoor activities, and quality time with loved ones, individuals can lead healthier and happier lives.

The ease of online shopping has also transformed the way people purchase goods and services, providing convenience and accessibility.  Overall, computers have become an essential tool in modern society, facilitating learning, communication, and information dissemination. While it is important to balance screen time with outdoor activities, the positive impact of computers on society cannot be ignored.

768	770	1	3	Dear Readers, I understand some people are concerned that people spend too much time on the computer and that it is bad. I disagree, computers can help keep family members that live far away in touch. You can also see pictures of things that you cant see everyday. Finally, it helps your school work. I know a family that has a son fighting in the @LOCATION1. He brought his laptop with him so he was ask to video chat with his family. It seemed as though he never left. Without it, his family would wonder how he was and be worried. You don't have to have a family member at war to talk to them on the computer. Have you ever wanted to see what @LOCATION2 looks like? You don't have to travel there to find out. All you have to do is search it on your computer! If you live in a city with not a lot of nature in it, you can see what its like outside it with the computer. Seeing those sights @MONTH1 make you to travel, travelling with your family brings you closer. A study shows @PERCENT1 of families that go on vacations have strong relationships. Having a computer is mandatory for school. It is the best thing to research with. @PERCENT2 of students that are failing don't use a computer for homework. There are also websites that you can use for studying. There is a student in my school that failed most of his classes. He never used a computer. His friend suggested using one at home if he was having trouble, which he tries. He used a computer to help study for a test he had the next day. He ended up getting a @PERCENT1 on the test because he used a computer. It doesn't matter you using a computer for homework, talking with friends and familym or it is one of the most important inventions ever made. Additionally, computers can provide access to a vast amount of information, helping individuals learn and grow intellectually. With the ability to access online courses, tutorials, and educational resources, students can enhance their knowledge and skills beyond the traditional classroom setting. Moreover, computers offer opportunities for creativity and innovation through various software programs that allow users to express themselves artistically and develop new ideas. Overall, the benefits of using a computer extend beyond mere communication and school work, making it an essential tool in today's digital age.
769	771	1	3	Computers play a crucial role in our daily lives, and it is hard to imagine a world without them. While some argue that computers can be a distraction from physical activities, nature, and personal interactions, I disagree. In fact, computers are essential for staying connected with family and friends, especially those who are far away. Platforms like Facebook and MySpace allow us to communicate and share moments with loved ones regardless of distance.  Moreover, computers are indispensable tools in the professional world, enabling people to work efficiently and effectively. Businesses rely heavily on computers for various tasks, from scheduling to communication. Without computers, many industries would struggle to operate smoothly. Additionally, computers are invaluable for research purposes, providing access to a vast amount of information with just a few clicks.  While it is important to strike a balance and not spend excessive time on computers, it is undeniable that they have become an integral part of modern life. So, instead of viewing computers as a distraction, we should appreciate their benefits and use them wisely to enhance our lives. Remember to take breaks, go outside, and enjoy the beauty of nature, but also recognize the value that computers bring to our daily routines.
770	772	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers hold exclusive information, and I believe they have a negative impact on people. Many students today spend a significant amount of time on computers instead of taking care of their physical health by exercising or enjoying the outdoors. This sedentary behavior can contribute to the rising rates of obesity in @LOCATION1. Furthermore, excessive computer use can lead to decreased interaction with family and friends, affecting social relationships and overall well-being.  Not only do computers have physical effects on individuals, but they also have psychological impacts. Excessive computer use can lead to isolation and detachment from real-life interactions. For instance, individuals may become so engrossed in their virtual world that they neglect spending time with loved ones. This lack of personal connection can harm relationships and hinder social development.  Moreover, the potential risks associated with sharing personal information online are a cause for concern. Websites like @CAPS4, MySpace, and Twitter can expose individuals to privacy breaches and cyber threats. Once personal information is shared online, it can be difficult to control its dissemination and may have detrimental consequences on one's reputation and future opportunities.  In conclusion, computers have a detrimental effect on both physical and social health. It is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between technology use and real-life interactions to maintain overall well-being. Limiting screen time and prioritizing physical activity and face-to-face communication can help mitigate the negative impacts of excessive computer use.
771	773	1	3	"The effects of computers on people are significant, with many individuals, both adults, and children, becoming excessively engrossed in their digital activities. One of the primary concerns is the amount of time spent on social networking, online shopping, and gaming, which can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and decreased physical activity. It is essential for individuals to balance their screen time with other beneficial activities such as exercise, learning, or engaging in productive tasks.  While computers have become an integral part of modern life, it is crucial to avoid excessive use that can negatively impact physical and mental well-being. Implementing measures such as designated ""screen-free"" days or disconnecting the internet periodically can help promote a healthier lifestyle and reduce dependency on digital devices. Additionally, enforcing laws or penalties for non-compliance with regulations aimed at encouraging physical activity can be a necessary step in addressing this issue.  Ultimately, finding a balance between using computers for necessary tasks and engaging in other activities that promote fitness and mental health is essential for overall well-being. By taking proactive steps to limit screen time and prioritize activities that benefit health, individuals can mitigate the adverse effects of excessive computer use and lead a more balanced and fulfilling life."
772	774	1	3	Did you know that computers are the number one selling electronic device in the world? I think that computers are only making our society a smarter and more intelligent place. Also, computers help old friends and family keep in touch. Finally, I think they are helping our society because computers teach great hand-eye coordination. Studies have shown that a high percentage of people growing up with computers at home have high-paying jobs. Computers are very intelligent pieces of equipment, and if you know how to use a computer, you will most likely have a high-paying career. Also, almost every job, from a doctor to a police officer to a cashier at a store, involves computers, and to do those jobs, you must know how to work a computer. This is only one of the many reasons I think computers will benefit our society.   Secondly, I think that this piece of technology benefits society because it keeps family, friends, and workers in touch. Have you ever had a time where you think back and wish you could see your old high school friends or even family living far away? Computers are one of the most popular ways to do so with all the new websites like Facebook, Twitter, or even your old email website. People are keeping in touch all over the world. Another way computers help old friends keep in touch is with the new video camera in the computer, allowing family, friends, and workers to actually see each other from different parts of the world. A simple message through one of these websites will make someone's day and could even make yours.   Finally, I think that computers benefit our society because they teach hand-eye coordination and other life skills. How do you think people can shoot a gun quickly or how a baseball player can swing at such a perfect time? All these things revolve around hand-eye coordination, which is best learned by using computers. Also, people can save lives by just typing about a hurricane, tornado, or anything, but if they do not know how to work a computer, many people can get injured or die. These are only three of the many reasons I think computers benefit our society. So, think twice about the negative comments people say about computers.
773	775	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, embracing the use of computers among teens is undeniably beneficial. The internet offers a plethora of activities and opportunities for adolescents. Social networking platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace facilitate communication, friendship-building, and self-expression. These sites serve as avenues for teens to connect, share thoughts, and engage with others, thereby alleviating stress and fostering social interactions. Video-sharing platforms such as YouTube provide entertainment and educational content, promoting socialization and learning among teenagers. Moreover, developing fast typing skills not only enhances efficiency but also parallels the texting culture prevalent among youth. In essence, computers play a crucial role in enhancing the lives of teens through social networking, video consumption, and improved typing abilities. Overall, integrating computers into the lives of teenagers contributes positively to their overall well-being and development.
774	776	1	3	Yes, I do think that we should continue using computers because they help us stay connected with other countries around the world, maintain a balance in our lives, and simplify daily tasks. Computers enable us to communicate with individuals globally through emails and video calls, fostering international relationships and collaborations. Moreover, by incorporating a balance between screen time and physical activities, we can ensure a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, computers streamline various tasks, such as writing emails instead of letters and enhancing projects with multimedia elements. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in modern society by facilitating global communication, supporting balance in daily activities, and simplifying tasks, making them an essential tool for everyday life.
775	777	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, Computers are indeed a necessity in today's world, benefiting not only individuals but entire communities and societies. They play a crucial role in education, providing access to information and resources through the internet. Without computers, tasks like research, online courses, and communication with teachers and classmates would be much more challenging.   In terms of communication, computers have revolutionized the way we interact with others. Whether it's through email, social media, or messaging apps, online communication programs have become a vital part of everyday life. They not only connect us with friends and family but also enable individuals with disabilities, such as deaf people, to communicate effectively.  Moreover, computers offer entertainment and enjoyment through various activities like playing games and creating presentations. They provide a platform for creativity and relaxation, making them a source of pleasure for many individuals.   In conclusion, computers are indispensable tools that enhance education, communication, and entertainment in our modern society. Their impact is far-reaching, benefiting individuals of all ages and backgrounds. It's clear that computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, enriching our experiences and connecting us to the world in ways that were unimaginable before.
776	778	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I don't know if I am understanding correctly but are you honestly thinking about not advancing technology? Quickly rethink that because that could be the worst mistake you could ever make. Computers can teach hand-eye coordination, provide valuable knowledge, and help us stay connected with our family and friends.  Firstly, about 90% of people say that they use the computer every day to increase their knowledge. This could be as simple as browsing the internet for the latest news or researching a specific topic. It is much easier and quicker than waiting for the news on TV or going to the library. Many students use their computers every night to delve deeper into their studies, which shows how essential computers are in education.  Secondly, children's doctors state that computers help improve hand-eye coordination, which is crucial for excelling in sports like baseball, soccer, and basketball. Without this coordination, children may struggle in sports and potentially give up, leading to health issues like obesity. Encouraging the use of computers can actually support physical health by keeping children active in sports.  Lastly, advancing in computer technology does not mean disconnecting from family and friends. Social media platforms and communication tools like Facebook, Skype, and FaceTime allow us to stay in touch with loved ones, especially those who are far away. Setting time limits on computer use can help balance online interactions with in-person connections, ensuring that we maintain strong relationships with family and friends.  In conclusion, computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, offering numerous benefits in education, sports, and social connections. Embracing technological advancements can enhance our knowledge, skills, and relationships, ultimately enriching our lives. Let's not overlook the importance of advancing technology and continue to leverage its potential for personal growth and connectivity.
777	779	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Too much technology! Computers have a negative effect on people. First, our country needs to exercise more, and not just sit around, second, we aren't spending enough time caring for our environment. And third, we are losing the ability to communicate with the people around us. Our country has problems with being overweight. Most people blame it on fast food, but it's also because people sit around using computers, and dont think about staying in proper shape. Before computers were made, people were much more fit, and healthy, we need to help our country get back in shape, and take our attention away from the computer, for even just a short while, and we need to exercise! The next reason is that computers don't just have a bay effect on people, but our enveironment too. We spend too much time indoors with technology, and we don't even care about the world around us. Before much technology, people used to plant gardens, and trees, but now that thought hardly crosses our minds. All the electronics these days are making people forget about nature, and that needs to change. The last reason computers have a negative effect is that people dont communicate as well anymore with the people around them. If we communicate so much with people through technology, we are losing the ability to speak and communicate in person, and it ruins relationships and connections between people, like family and friends, so we need to start caring about the people around us, and not always rely on technology. In conclusion, you can see the negative effect computers have on people. We need to excercise more. Also, we need to help our environment. And lastly, we need to communcate better with friends and family. We shouldn't get rid of computers, but just step away and care about the world around you.
778	780	1	3	More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this benefits our society. People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and staying healthy. As people use computers more, they are spending less time exercising, leading to unhealthy lifestyles. Professor @PERSON1's study revealed that individuals who spend more than @NUM1 hours a day on the computer are overweight and do not exercise regularly. This sedentary lifestyle could result in obesity and an increased risk of heart attacks at a young age.  In addition to the negative impact on physical health, excessive computer use also hinders social interactions. Studies have shown that @PERCENT1 of children who spend a lot of time on computers have limited family time and more screen time. This lack of connection with family and friends can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression. I have personally witnessed the isolating effects of excessive computer use on individuals in my community. A friend of mine gained a significant amount of weight and became less active after getting a computer, ultimately withdrawing from social activities and relationships.  Overall, the growing reliance on computers is not benefiting our society. It is important for individuals to find a balance between technology use and real-life interactions to maintain both physical and mental well-being. Prioritizing time for exercise, socializing with loved ones, and engaging in offline activities is crucial for a healthy and fulfilling life.
779	781	1	3	"Dear @PERSON1 the editor of the @LOCATION1 citizen, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention from some people around @LOCATION1 that computers and technology are bad for us. I have also heard that people believe in the technology. So, the reason why I'm writing today is about this issue is to put my beliefs out there. I believe that this new technology is affecting our daily exercising, playing outside to enjoy nature and interacting with friends and family. Now that there is new technology with computers and such, people are distracted and do not want to exercise. This will affect our youth because we will be fat, unhealthy, and sluggish all the time. @PERSON1 we don't want this to happen to our youth because we are the future and if this keeps up the state and country will suffer. Another reason is that it's good to exercise and not be on the computer or watching @CAPS2 all the time is because it has been proven you have more energy and will feel happier most of the time. Computers do not do that for us at all. A poll even says that @PERCENT1 of people get headaches and feel tired after being on the computer. Exercise won't do that at all. Since all of our new technology with @CAPS2 and other gadgets, people really don't go outside to play around and enjoy nature anymore. I was asking my mother about this topic and she said, ""@CAPS4 these days just don't go outside anymore. I remember when I was your age and my mother would kick me outside at @NUM1 am, and I wouldn't be back home until around @NUM2 pm."" I believe that this should still happen. Maybe parents should still do this with their @CAPS4 and have them run around the neighborhood with other @CAPS4. If we did this more often, maybe @CAPS4 and adults too will just do this naturally and will not have to rely on computers or @CAPS5 for entertainment. Don't you think this is a good idea @PERSON1? My last topic is with computers and cellphones and how we really don't interact with friends and family anymore. Nowadays, friends aim, video chat, or text each other instead of going and doing something with them. This isn't really healthy for us because we might not know how to talk to people in real life. Also, if someone aims or texts you, you really don't know how their tone is because you are not talking to them face to face. Lastly, I know families that get hurt by technology because that is all they do. They don't put down their phones, get off their emails, and they feel like they don't see each other. This is also not a healthy relationship with family members. @PERSON1 I really hope I have persuaded you that technology is only okay to use sometimes and not every day. Remember, technology is bad because we don't exercise, play outside, enjoy nature, and really don't interact with friends and family members. Thank you for your time."
780	782	1	3	I think computers greatly benefit society, and advance technology. They provide knowledge in a click, and entertainment after a long day out work or school. Not only that, but people have found long-lasting careers because of the invention of the computer. So obviously, computers are a great influence on society. Do you want to find out when major legue baseball first came to be? Or maybe you have a history report due the next day, and your parents can'@CAPS3 drive you to the library? This isn'@CAPS3 a problem anymore. Computers have evolved a long way since they were invented in the @NUM1's. You can check up on your local news, by having @NUM2's of electronic newspapers right at your fingertips. Or maybe you want to venture outside your neighborhood, and check out what's happening in @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. News isn'@CAPS3 the only thing the internet is useful for though. You can also go onto one of the @DATE1's of websites for school help, or check how the stock market is doing. Or, you can just use the handy calculator found right on your desktop. What could be better? Of course not all users have a computer for information. Many have it for entertainment purposes. In fact @PERCENT1 of people use the computer for entertainment everyday. What, with all the fun stuff you can do, who can blame them? Social networking is placed at the top of the list. A whopping @PERCENT2 of internet users use sites like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. These sites are useful for catching up with friends you might not have seen in years or continue a conversation from @NUM3 minutes ago. You can also use computers to watch live-streaming @CAPS3.V, or that new @CAPS4 you got yesterday. That's right, @CAPS3.V's might not be needed soon! And what would a compter be without games? There are @NUM2's of @DATE1's of them scattered all across the web. How great is that? And finally, many people have found their careers through the internet. Did you know that @PERSON1, @NUM5, was found through you tube when his mom posted videos for the family to see when they couldn'@CAPS3 attend proformances? Of couse, you tube isn'@CAPS3 the only way to make money. Tons of jobs are listed by employers only for the curious person to find. No more wondering city streets, now you can just submit on aplication or have an interview without ever leaving your. Artists have also discovered talents, by playing around with @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. Not to mention the career paths involving computers directly, such as repairing or movie special effects. So no matter what you use a computer for have it be job hunting, entertainment, or information, they are a good idea to have them in your home. There's a erason that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS8 use them, and it's not just an excuse to sit around all stay.
781	783	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,   First of all, I would like to express my appreciation for the engaging stories and puzzles that you provide in your paper. I believe I have a story idea that might interest you. It revolves around the topic of computer addiction and its impact on individuals.   Computer addiction can have detrimental effects on personal relationships, as individuals may spend excessive amounts of time on their devices, neglecting quality time with their families. This can lead to misunderstandings and arguments, as responsibilities are overlooked in favor of online activities. For instance, a simple task like cooking a meal can be forgotten when one is engrossed in the virtual world, potentially leading to dangerous situations such as a fire.   Furthermore, the allure of online chat rooms can draw individuals into a dangerous web of unknown interactions. People can become addicted to these platforms, risking their safety by engaging with strangers whose true intentions are unclear. The anonymity of the internet can make it easy for predators to exploit vulnerable individuals, posing a serious threat to their well-being.   Lastly, some individuals may simply lack the self-awareness or motivation to break free from their computer addiction. They may spend hours on end engaging in unproductive activities online, neglecting important tasks or opportunities for personal growth. As someone who has struggled with computer addiction in the past, I understand the negative impact it can have on one's life, leading to academic struggles and missed opportunities.   In conclusion, computer addiction is a pressing issue that warrants attention and discussion. By shedding light on the consequences of excessive screen time, we can encourage individuals to find a healthier balance in their digital lives. Thank you for considering this story idea for your publication.   Sincerely, [Your Name]

Second of all, computers and the internet support many businesses in advertising and making a profit.

It clearly helps the workplace get attention. Along with advertising products, businesses can even sell their products online without doing a thing. This can also aid the consumer because they would not have to drive all the way down to the store and pick up what they need. All they need to do is select the items they wish to purchase and await its arrival a few days later. Clearly, the computer and internet can help support the welfare of businesses.

Computers are a good source of knowledge, an aid to business, and a great way of communication. Everyone has agreed to this without hesitation, so you should too.

783	785	1	3	Dear local newspaper, 80% of the population owns a computer. This high percentage indicates that computers must have a positive impact on people. I firmly believe that computers have a beneficial effect on individuals because they facilitate online communication, enable learning about new subjects, and enhance hand-eye coordination. One significant advantage of computers is the ability to communicate with others online. For individuals without access to phones, computers serve as a vital tool for staying in touch with friends and family. Moreover, for those with loved ones living far away, computers offer a cost-effective and efficient way to maintain connections across the globe. This aspect of computer usage is crucial as it fosters important relationships. Another positive aspect of computers is the opportunity they provide for learning about various topics. With just a few clicks, individuals can access a wealth of information without the need to travel or visit libraries. This convenience enables people to expand their knowledge base and acquire new skills easily. Such easy access to information is beneficial as it encourages continuous learning and personal development. Furthermore, computers play a crucial role in enhancing hand-eye coordination. This skill is essential for various daily activities, including driving, writing, and engaging in physical exercises. By engaging with computers regularly, individuals can improve their coordination, which is essential for overall well-being. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by facilitating online communication, enabling learning, and enhancing hand-eye coordination. The widespread use of computers in today's society underscores their importance and benefits for individuals.
784	786	1	3	Can you imagine how difficult life would be without a computer? I can. I believe computers are helpful. Computers help us do research, they keep us connected with friends and family, and they are required to be used at some places. The internet is an easy way to do research. All you have to do is search what you want information on, and millions of articles will be at the click of a mouse. Using the internet on a computer is much easier than going through books looking for something. That could waste a lot of time. The internet can quickly and directly answer your questions. Computers are a great way to keep connected. Almost everyone has an email now. All you have to do is type a few letters, and you'll be reacquainted with old friends. When you call someone, you can't be sure if they are busy or not. When using email, the person receiving the email can reply when they have free time. Computers are used at many places. Sometimes you're even required to use them. Computers organize data by keeping documents in different files. Computers also have valuable programs that could help you in your career, such as Microsoft Word. Using a computer would aid you financially. Some of you might think computers have misleading information. The internet isn't always a honest place. By spending a few minutes double-checking your information on other websites, you're still spending less time than it would take to find the fact in a book. The computer is one of the greatest inventions created. It makes research, connecting with friends, and your work easy! Use a computer today, and your life will be changed for the better.
785	787	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, spending too much time online has negative effects on society. People are missing out on full social experiences when they rely heavily on email, Facebook, and Twitter for communication. This can lead to a lack of meaningful connections with family and friends, as well as a decrease in face-to-face interactions. While online activity can be convenient, it should not replace real-life interactions that are essential for building strong relationships and maintaining a healthy social life.  Additionally, spending excessive time online can have detrimental effects on our physical health. Many individuals are sacrificing time that could be spent exercising or enjoying the outdoors for endless scrolling through social media feeds. This sedentary lifestyle can contribute to the rising rates of obesity and other health issues in @LOCATION1. It is important to find a balance between online activities and physical activities to ensure overall well-being.  Furthermore, excessive internet usage can strain relationships with family members who may feel neglected or disconnected when their loved ones prioritize screen time over quality time together. While online communication can be beneficial for staying in touch with distant relatives, it should not come at the expense of neglecting those who are physically present in our lives.  In conclusion, while the internet offers many advantages, it is important to be mindful of the negative impact of spending too much time online. Finding a healthy balance between digital interactions and real-life experiences is crucial for maintaining strong social connections, physical health, and overall well-being. Let us not let the virtual world hinder our ability to fully engage with the world around us.
786	788	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I disagree with the notion that computers have negative effects on kids. Computers provide children with the opportunity to explore and learn without the need to physically travel to different places. For instance, if a child is interested in the @LOCATION1's @CAPS1, they can easily access pictures and information online within minutes, saving the time and cost associated with travel. Additionally, computers offer a plethora of fun activities such as social media platforms like Myspace, @CAPS2, and various games, making learning and entertainment easily accessible. While it is true that excessive use of computers can be addictive, it is essential for kids to learn to balance their screen time with other activities.   Moreover, computers serve as valuable tools for education and research, providing access to a wealth of information about our world. With search engines like Google and Bing, children can learn about a wide range of topics at their fingertips. Computers have become ubiquitous in modern society, integrated into various devices such as phones, iPods, and even police cars. They are essential in numerous settings including hospitals, fire stations, police stations, and electronic stores like Radioshack.   In conclusion, I believe that computers are indispensable for learning and exploration. They offer a gateway to knowledge and facilitate easy access to information that can enrich children's understanding of the world. Rather than being detrimental, computers have the potential to enhance education and broaden horizons. Therefore, I stand by my belief that computers are a valuable tool for children and should be embraced for their educational benefits.
787	789	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, the issue of excessive computer usage is a growing concern as individuals are spending more time in front of screens rather than engaging in meaningful activities such as communicating with loved ones, exercising, or enjoying the outdoors. According to expert Tim Tinker in his book ""Digital Detox,"" prolonged computer usage can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental well-being. Spending time outdoors, interacting with friends and family, and staying active are essential for a healthy lifestyle. Research shows that a large percentage of children and adults spend a significant amount of time on electronic devices, leading to a sedentary lifestyle and potential health problems. It is crucial for individuals to prioritize face-to-face interactions, physical activity, and connecting with nature. Not only does this promote overall well-being, but it also has long-term benefits such as increased life expectancy and a reduced risk of heart disease. It is evident that excessive computer usage can have negative consequences on health and social interactions, highlighting the importance of finding a balance between screen time and real-world experiences. Let us strive to unplug, reconnect with the world around us, and prioritize our health and relationships."
788	790	1	3	Having a computer at home is incredibly helpful in various aspects of life. It provides access to useful information, facilitates communication with friends and family, aids in school work, and can even assist in starting a business. With the advancement of technology, computers have become essential tools for everyday tasks such as getting directions, looking up information, and staying connected with others. Overall, computers have a positive impact on people's lives by making tasks easier, more efficient, and more convenient.
789	791	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, my name is @PERSON1 and I just want to emphasize the negative impact of excessive computer use on physical activity and social interactions. While computers have become an integral part of our lives, they have also led to a decrease in exercise, outdoor activities, and quality time spent with friends and family. Many individuals, especially children, are more engrossed in virtual worlds, neglecting the importance of physical health and real-life experiences.  It is concerning to see families spending less time engaging in outdoor activities like hiking, camping, or swimming, which are vital for physical and mental well-being. Instead of bonding over shared experiences, families are often isolated in their own digital worlds, missing out on valuable opportunities to connect and create lasting memories together. This shift towards screen time over real-life interactions can have detrimental effects on relationships and overall health.  In order to promote a healthier and more balanced lifestyle, it is important to limit screen time and prioritize activities that involve physical movement and social engagement. Encouraging individuals to step away from their screens and embrace the outdoors can lead to improved physical fitness, stronger relationships, and a greater appreciation for the world around us. By finding a healthy balance between technology and real-life experiences, we can ensure that our well-being and connections with others are prioritized in this digital age.
790	792	1	3	Computers are versatile tools that serve various purposes for different age groups. While adults primarily use them for business and productivity, pre-teens and teenagers find computers beneficial for schoolwork, developing skills, and entertainment. Popular chat groups like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 provide platforms for social interaction, sharing updates, and media content. Music websites and applications like @CAPS3 and iTunes offer avenues for listening to music and watching videos.   Moreover, computers come equipped with software such as Microsoft @CAPS5, Publisher, and PowerPoint, which are valuable for educational tasks. @CAPS5 allows for typing essays, creating projects, and editing content with diverse formatting options. Publisher is ideal for designing newsletters, flyers, and other visual materials, while PowerPoint facilitates the creation of dynamic presentations. These tools enhance learning experiences and aid in completing school projects efficiently.  Furthermore, computers play a crucial role in assisting individuals with special needs, providing communication tools and support systems. Overall, computers are essential in modern society, offering a wide range of benefits for both personal and professional use. Their impact on education, communication, and entertainment underscores their significance in today's world.
791	793	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a very positive effect on people. Now as technology keeps advancing there are many educational options online, you can now interact with people without physically being with them and you can play games that will enrich your lives. Firstly, I believe that computers offer a wide variety of educational options. On the internet alone you can view your school textbook. You can also have extra practice with the many resources that come with the online textbook. Without physically bringing your textbook home you can view the book online. There are tons of extra practice, and practice quizzes in the online textbook that are perfect for studying. Also, when you see on the internet you can get real-time updates of major events in the world. For example, the other day I logged onto the internet and saw an article about the earthquake in @LOCATION1. I saw nothing of this in the newspaper, but the internet was so up to date that you can stay informed about something that happened only a few minutes ago. But if you choose not to utilize the internet, there are many programs that are very helpful for learning. That are directly centered on developing your children's math and reading skills. These programs can give anyone a jumpstart in education. Another opportunity that could be helpful on a computer is the ability to interact with other people. Video chatting, @CAPS2, and using social @CAPS3 sites are very good ways to interact with people. When you video chat you can have a conversation with someone in class on video! Even though they are not physically with you, you can talk to them. Instant messaging is a less direct, but still useful way to talk to someone far away. You can share the news or just have a conversation with anyone you know. Lastly, social @CAPS3 sites such as Facebook and Twitter are a valuable way to communicate with people. You can post messages, play games, or simply talk to someone on these websites. They combine the best parts of online interaction and put them together. Finally, there are many online games that are very useful. If you ever wanted to go bowling but never had the time, you could play a game online. Or if you have ever wanted to drive a stock car, you could play a game online. These online games are good ways to give you the opportunity to do something you wouldn't normally do. Also, many games help sharpen your reflexes and quick thinking skills. These could possibly carry over into situations where you need good reflexes and quick thinking. Games could be very useful when you need to prepare yourself for something. Also, online games are fun and enjoyable. Overall, I believe the computer is a valuable resource in education, interacting with other people, and playing useful games. After all, who could pass up the opportunity to better prepare themselves for life?
792	794	1	3	I love technology because it provides numerous benefits to society. Computers, in particular, offer the ability to learn about any topic with just a click of a button. Additionally, they facilitate better communication with people who are far away, making it easier to stay connected. Moreover, technology plays a crucial role in protecting our country, with advancements like remote-controlled planes enhancing security measures. As technology continues to advance, it is essential to utilize it wisely and responsibly for education, communication, and national security. So, let's embrace the power of technology and use it to improve our lives and society as a whole.
793	795	1	3	To whom it may concern: Computers have a significant impact on individuals, providing a range of benefits that enhance daily life. In terms of education, computers play a crucial role in facilitating homework completion and research. They enable students to produce professional-looking reports and access information quickly. For individuals with illegible handwriting, computers offer a solution for creating neat and organized work. Additionally, computers allow for seamless communication with out-of-state family members through various online platforms, eliminating the need for expensive phone calls. Furthermore, when individuals seek entertainment or need to make last-minute decisions, computers provide a valuable resource for obtaining information and directions to different locations. Overall, computers serve as a valuable tool for both adults and children, offering efficiency, connectivity, and convenience in various aspects of life.
794	796	1	3	Isn't it great to feel refreshed when you're outside? Instead of sitting indoors looking at pictures of a beautiful location, why not experience the rush of jumping into the crashing waves there? Many believe that computers are beneficial to society, but they actually make us lazier. The human race has thrived for centuries without them and can continue to do so. We can gain knowledge just as effectively from books and improve hand-eye coordination through activities like sports, drawing, reading, and playing an instrument. While the internet may seem like a convenient source of information for travel, it can be unreliable as anyone can post misleading content. Reading from a book is a more trustworthy option. Nowadays, many kids are too reliant on the internet for socializing, but online relationships can never replace in-person interactions. It's essential to communicate face-to-face with friends to build real connections. In conclusion, computers are not as beneficial as they may seem, and it's crucial to prioritize real-life experiences over virtual ones. Thank you.
795	797	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers are truly a valuable asset in our society, providing numerous benefits that enhance our daily lives. They play a significant role in keeping us connected with our loved ones, simplifying tasks such as booking flights, and aiding in education, especially for students. The convenience and efficiency that computers offer make them indispensable tools in today's world. Overall, computers contribute positively to our society in various ways, making them an essential and valuable resource for individuals and communities alike.
796	798	1	3	"I walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer. I thought to myself ""she is always on that computer, doesn't she work to do?"". I said to my mom ""I think we should have an hour two of the computer each night, or not have one at all."" I told her that I think computers are a bad choice because you don't know who is on the internet and is trying to talk to you. Also, it gets in the way of exercising and spending time with family and friends. The internet/computers are very dangerous now a days. You never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you. Say if you were talking to someone and you thought it was your friend, well you don't know for sure if it is then or not. I could be an older man or women trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you. Steal from you and worse. Now I watch the news and see many kidnapping because kids are talking to people on the internet and don't know who they are or what they look like. Like, when a girl was talking to a man and she thought it was her friend, turns out it wasn't and she got in a whole lot trouble. Maybe if she met him she would have gotten very hurt and be scared of that memory for the rest of her life. Family is very important to most families now a days. I have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them, you learn new things. Sadly this is not happening because people are so isolated to their computers they don't spend one minute with family or friends. I have a friend who is always on the computer. She never spends time with her family or friends. She is so focused on the computer screen then what is going on around her. Recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends. Even her grades started going up because she spending more time studying with her mom and dad, then being on.... for example @CAPS1 or myspace and not getting any work done for school. In other words, she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through. Most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise. That is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body. People have spent more time having their eyes glue to the computer screen that they don't go out and play or maybe go a gym. The rate of obecity in our country is increasing for many reasons and lack of exercise is one of them because people spend to much time watching tv and being on the computer. I have a little cousin who is over weight and should be out playing sports and exercising. But does she, ""no""... She spends her free time on the computer in a stuffy room, instead of getting fresh air from outside. She keeps asking me how did I get and what age, and I keep telling her, I exercise and play sports so I can't tell you when. I keep saying that to her but she never listens. To this day she is still the same because she didn't take my advice to get off the computer and go outside to play. I strongly agree that we should have only two hours of the computer each night or have no computers at all. For kids saftey from bad people out there in the world, spending time with family and friends and finally for exercise and to stay fit with our bodies. I hope people understand what I say and take action to persue them in they own life and convice others too.  In conclusion, limiting computer use, especially for children, is crucial for their safety, physical health, and overall well-being. It is important to prioritize time with family and friends, engage in physical activities, and be cautious of the potential dangers lurking online. By taking proactive measures and setting boundaries on computer usage, individuals can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives."

798	800	1	3	Dear Newspaper, People nowadays rely heavily on computers for various tasks, such as research, writing papers, and entertainment. While computers offer numerous benefits, excessive use can be detrimental. Many individuals find themselves engrossed in their virtual lives, neglecting their real-life experiences. It is essential to strike a balance between utilizing computers for productivity and ensuring that they do not consume our lives entirely.  The convenience of computers provides us with knowledge, information, and connectivity with individuals worldwide. However, it is easy to become overly attached to these devices, leading to potential addiction. Instead of turning to the computer for relaxation, consider engaging in activities that stimulate the mind and promote social interactions.  Although online platforms allow for interaction with others, it is crucial to prioritize real-life relationships over virtual connections. While online friends can be enjoyable, they should not replace the value of face-to-face interactions. By managing computer usage and maintaining a healthy balance, individuals can lead happier and more fulfilling lives.  In conclusion, while computers play a significant role in our daily lives, it is important to regulate their use to avoid dependency and prioritize real-world experiences. Striking a balance between virtual and real-life interactions can lead to a more well-rounded and satisfying lifestyle.
799	801	1	3	Dear Newspaper people, you might have heard about the increasing belief that computers are beneficial to society. I personally agree with this perspective. Computers have the potential to make people miss out on new experiences, meeting new people, and engaging in physical activity. Time passes quickly when using a computer, causing individuals to overlook significant events and developments. For example, advancements like the new iPod Nano with a camera or the ability to download and read books on devices like the iPod may go unnoticed. Additionally, spending excessive time on a computer may result in missed opportunities for travel, social interaction, and physical well-being. It is essential for individuals to balance their screen time with real-world experiences, such as meeting new people, participating in outdoor activities, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. While computers offer numerous benefits, it is crucial to prioritize human connections and physical health. By inspiring others to reduce their screen time and prioritize real-world interactions, we can collectively work towards a healthier and more balanced society.
800	802	1	3	Dear local newspaper, The question that everyone is asking is do computers benefit to society. I used to think they didn't benefit to society but now I think they do. I think this because, one good place to get information, two we live in a technological advanced society, and three you can keep in touch with people that are at the other side of the world. so do computers really benefit to our society? Computers are a valuable resorce for me when I need to get information. For example, in my recent project in social studies class I need to go on the computer to get information on the subject. Also if you need facts on something and you can't go to the libary the computer has the same information. Also the computer is helpful when trying to find maps to a certain place or a phone number to a store. The computer is and always will be a great source of information. In the @DATE1 technology is a huge part of society. For example the first computer that came out was this huge block that when you did something on it you would put in cardboard card. Now we havethin and small portable computers. So knowing how to use a computer is vital to keep up with the @DATE1. So are you going to let technology pass you by? Computers are one of the best ways to keep in touch. For example if you call someone across the world your phone bill will sky rocket. But if you go on a website like facebook you can talk for free. Also another way to chat with people is by A.I.M. Another free way to talk to people. What same person wouldnt want to talk to their friends and family acroosthe worl, for free? The reasons I have given you are valid reasons with deatails. Technology is like a train are you going to live it.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in society by providing easy access to information, keeping up with technological advancements, and facilitating communication with people worldwide. Embracing technology is essential in today's world to stay connected and informed.
801	803	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I strongly believe that computers do more harm than good in society. While they can be useful for certain tasks, such as checking emails or researching information, the excessive use of computers for social media and gaming is detrimental to our well-being. People are spending too much time indoors, glued to their screens, instead of engaging in real-life interactions with family and friends. This sedentary lifestyle is contributing to the decline in physical activity and overall health of our society.   It is crucial for us to encourage people to limit their computer usage and prioritize activities that promote physical and social well-being. By spending more time outdoors, participating in sports, going on vacations, and exploring the world around us, we can lead happier and more fulfilling lives. It is important to strike a balance between the convenience of technology and the richness of real-life experiences.   We need to address this issue at a societal level and promote a culture that values physical activity, face-to-face communication, and real-world experiences over excessive screen time. By making these changes, we can work towards becoming a healthier and more active society. Let's put down our devices, step outside, and start living life to the fullest.
802	804	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, The effects of excessive computer usage on people are concerning. One major issue is the lack of physical activity involved when using a computer. Sedentary behavior can lead to weight gain and other health problems. Additionally, excessive computer use can lead to social isolation as individuals may prioritize screen time over spending time with friends and engaging in real-life social interactions. Moreover, there is a risk of online predators and privacy breaches when interacting with strangers on the internet. It is important to strike a balance and limit computer usage to maintain physical health, social connections, and online safety. Let's be mindful of the negative impacts of excessive computer use and make conscious efforts to prioritize our well-being and relationships over screen time.
803	805	1	3	School, family, and sports are crucial aspects of a student's life, as my mother always emphasizes. In today's digital age, many kids are glued to their computers immediately after school, neglecting important areas of their development. It is disheartening to see that a significant percentage of students prioritize screen time over quality family bonding. Expressing gratitude towards parents and spending meaningful time together should be a priority for youngsters.  Moreover, students need to divert their attention from social media platforms and redirect their focus towards academics. Instead of mindlessly scrolling through various websites, they should engage in educational activities that can enhance their knowledge. It is concerning to observe a large number of students failing to complete assignments on time due to excessive screen time. By dedicating more effort to their studies, students can achieve better academic results and secure a brighter future.  Additionally, physical fitness is often overlooked by students who are engrossed in their digital devices. Exercise is essential for maintaining good health and overall well-being. Many students are not at their ideal weight due to lack of physical activity and excessive sedentary behavior. It is vital for youngsters to engage in regular exercise routines to stay fit and healthy. Incorporating physical activities into their daily routine, such as running or doing push-ups, can significantly benefit their physical health.  In conclusion, students should strike a balance between screen time and essential aspects of their lives, such as family, academics, and physical fitness. By reducing their dependency on computers and focusing on these crucial areas, students can lead a more fulfilling and successful life. It is imperative for young individuals to prioritize these aspects to achieve holistic growth and development.

Moreover, the anonymity of the online world opens the door to potential dangers, such as interacting with strangers who may have malicious intentions. It is alarming to think that behind a screen, individuals may not be who they claim to be, posing a risk to unsuspecting users, especially children and teenagers. The threat of cyber predators and the possibility of falling victim to scams or viruses are real concerns that come with the territory of online communication.  Additionally, the constant use of computers can contribute to heightened levels of stress. From online conflicts with friends to technical glitches causing frustration, the digital world can be a breeding ground for tension and anxiety. The pressure to keep up with online trends, maintain a social media presence, or meet work deadlines in a fast-paced online environment can take a toll on mental well-being.  In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly enhanced our lives in many ways, it is important to recognize and address the negative impacts that excessive use can have. By being mindful of our screen time, staying vigilant against online threats, and taking regular breaks to prioritize physical and mental health, we can mitigate the potential harms associated with computer usage. Striking a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of technology is key to harnessing its full potential without succumbing to its pitfalls.

This lack of outdoor exposure can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to health issues such as obesity.  Furthermore, the excessive use of computers can also strain relationships within families. With individuals spending more time on their devices, quality family time is often sacrificed, leading to a breakdown in communication and bonding. This can have lasting effects on the emotional well-being of family members, especially children who may feel neglected or isolated.  In terms of health, the sedentary nature of computer usage can lead to weight gain and various health problems. When individuals spend prolonged hours in front of a screen, they are more likely to engage in unhealthy eating habits and neglect physical exercise.

810	812	1	3	Some people learn about faraway places, get the latest updates on important news, and make sloppy work and handwriting seem neat, all thanks to computers. People all over the world use computers to research different locations, with the ability to access photographs of the places they are exploring. For instance, when I had a social studies project on the @PERSON1 @PERSON1, I had no prior knowledge of this place. Thanks to the internet, I was able to quickly gather information and view images of the @PERSON1 @PERSON1 mountains.

811	813	1	3	Dear local newspaper, do you know any child or teen between the age of eight and seventeen who doesn't love to go on the computer? Well, platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and AIM have become online hangouts for kids everywhere. Once they log on, it's hard to get them to log out unless their parents intervene. Computers have a significant impact on people, and I have three reasons to support my belief. Firstly, people who spend excessive time on computers often neglect physical exercise. Instead of playing outside and staying active, they are glued to their screens, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. Secondly, excessive computer use results in a lack of interaction with others. Social skills can deteriorate when individuals prefer virtual communication over face-to-face interactions. Lastly, children are prone to sneak onto inappropriate websites, even if they were initially using the computer for research. Online platforms and games can be addictive, trapping users in a cycle of extended screen time. It is essential to remember the benefits of fresh air and real-world interactions. People need to balance their time on computers with outdoor activities and socializing to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Excessive computer use can lead to physical health issues, social isolation, and potential risks for children. It's crucial for individuals to prioritize real-world experiences over virtual ones to ensure overall well-being and development.
812	814	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I share your concerns about the negative impact of excessive computer use on people's lives. It is true that spending too much time in front of a screen can lead to health issues like weight gain due to lack of physical activity. Additionally, the anonymity of the internet can be dangerous, as people may not always be who they claim to be online. It is important to stay cautious and protect oneself from potential online threats.  Furthermore, the shift towards reading on computers instead of traditional books is a trend that may have its drawbacks. While technology has made information more accessible, there is something special about holding a physical book and immersing oneself in its pages. We should strive to strike a balance between the convenience of digital reading and the joy of flipping through the pages of a book.  In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly revolutionized the way we live and work, it is crucial not to let them take over our lives completely. We should be mindful of our screen time, prioritize real-life interactions over virtual ones, and remember the value of traditional forms of entertainment and education. Let us use technology wisely and not let it dictate our existence.
813	815	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers today have a negative impact on people in various ways. One significant drawback is the reduction in valuable time spent on daily exercise. Instead of being physically active, individuals often find themselves sitting around all day in front of their screens, clicking a mouse and typing away. This sedentary lifestyle can have detrimental effects on one's health and well-being.  Moreover, excessive computer usage can also lead to a decrease in quality family time. Many individuals get so engrossed in their virtual worlds that they neglect spending time with their loved ones. This can result in feelings of isolation and disconnect within the family unit, ultimately affecting relationships and overall happiness.  In addition to the negative health and social implications, the costs associated with owning a computer can be quite high. From expensive hardware and software upgrades to potential data recovery expenses in case of a virus or system crash, the financial burden of maintaining a computer can add up quickly.  Overall, while computers may seem like essential tools in today's digital age, it is important to consider the negative consequences they can have on our physical health, relationships, and finances. It is worth reflecting on whether the benefits of owning a computer truly outweigh the drawbacks. It is essential to strike a balance and prioritize overall well-being over technological conveniences.

815	817	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A resent concern has built up among experts that computers @MONTH1 have negative affects on society. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. Computers play a vital role in easing life's hassles, providing access to information about distant places and people, and facilitating communication with individuals worldwide.   Firstly, computers simplify daily tasks through various programs such as @CAPS1, which helps in organizing schedules efficiently. This program allows users to input important dates and events, sending timely reminders to ensure nothing is overlooked. Additionally, computers enable rapid access to a wealth of information. For instance, conducting research on topics like different car models becomes effortless with search engines like @ORGANIZATION3, saving considerable time compared to traditional methods like visiting libraries. Moreover, innovative tools like voice command features in programs like @ORGANIZATION2 Word cater to individuals with special needs, enabling them to write effortlessly.  Furthermore, computers serve as a gateway to learning about distant places and their inhabitants. Through visual aids like pictures and blogs, users can gain firsthand insights into foreign cultures and lifestyles. Studies suggest that individuals retain more information when exposed to visual content, such as images and videos, compared to text-based resources like encyclopedias. E-books available online also offer extensive knowledge about various destinations, assisting travelers in making informed decisions about their trips.  Lastly, computers promote global connectivity by facilitating communication with individuals worldwide. Video chat applications allow users to interact face-to-face with friends and colleagues, irrespective of geographical barriers. This technology proves invaluable for maintaining relationships and conducting business meetings remotely. Additionally, online platforms enable individuals to engage with communities around the world, fostering cross-cultural understanding and empathy.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in enhancing society by simplifying tasks, broadening knowledge about distant places, and promoting global connectivity. These technological advancements offer immense benefits and opportunities for individuals, ultimately contributing to a more interconnected and informed world.
816	818	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2,   I understand your concerns about the impact of computers on society. However, I believe that computers have many benefits that outweigh any potential drawbacks.   One major advantage of computers is their ability to improve typing skills.

By simply typing a query into a search engine, individuals can access a vast amount of information in a matter of seconds. This efficiency is particularly useful for students working on assignments or individuals seeking specific information for personal or professional purposes.   In conclusion, while there may be concerns about the negative effects of computers on society, it is important to recognize the numerous benefits they offer. From improving typing skills to facilitating picture editing and information retrieval, computers play a vital role in enhancing productivity and creativity in various aspects of life.

817	819	1	3	Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I think the opposite though. I think this way because you might have to look up something on the computer one day. Some jobs require you to apply online. Additionally, a computer allows you to communicate with others online. These are all valuable reasons why using a computer can be beneficial for individuals in today's society.
818	820	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I want to tell you why I'm a little bit against computers. There are so many things you can do in the world besides being glued to a screen. You can go out and play sports like basketball, handball, or just hang out with your friends. Taking a drive in the morning and feeling the breeze can be so refreshing and rejuvenating.  Moreover, the world is full of amazing places to visit. You can go see your friends, spend time with your significant other, or visit your family. Don't let technology isolate you from the real world experiences that can enrich your life.  Additionally, cruise ships offer a unique and exciting way to travel. You can sail to faraway destinations like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, and many more. Enjoy the luxurious experience of dining with the captain, meeting new people, and witnessing breathtaking sights along the way.  In conclusion, it's important to balance your time between technology and the real world. Don't let computers consume all your time when there is so much to explore and enjoy in the world around you. Let's make the most of our time on this earth and create unforgettable memories beyond the confines of a screen.
819	821	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, computers play a crucial role in our society today. They serve as a means of communication, allowing individuals to stay connected with loved ones through online platforms. Additionally, computers are essential for education, facilitating online learning and research. Furthermore, computers provide entertainment, offering a wide range of options from funny videos to music downloads. Overall, computers are a vital tool that enhances our daily lives in numerous ways.
820	822	1	3	In addition to the various benefits mentioned, computers also play a crucial role in education. With access to online resources and educational websites, students can enhance their learning experience and acquire knowledge beyond the traditional classroom setting. Furthermore, computers enable individuals to develop essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and digital literacy, which are highly valued in today's technology-driven world. Overall, the positive impact of computers on our lives is undeniable, making them an indispensable tool for communication, entertainment, information retrieval, and personal development. Embracing the opportunities that computers offer can greatly enrich our lives and contribute to our overall well-being.
821	823	1	3	Some experts are concerned about people spending too much time on computers and not enjoying nature. While computers have their benefits, it is important to find a balance between technology use and outdoor activities. Excessive computer use, especially for games and socializing, can lead to addiction and isolation. By going outside, individuals can engage in physical activities like sports and tag, promoting a healthier lifestyle and social interaction. Additionally, spending time in nature allows for hands-on learning experiences that cannot be replicated through a screen. Whether it's playing sports, exploring the outdoors, or learning practical skills, nature offers endless opportunities for personal growth and enjoyment. In conclusion, while computers have their place in modern society, it is essential to prioritize outdoor activities and embrace the wonders of nature for a well-rounded and fulfilling lifestyle.
822	824	1	3	Dear editor, I hear you are looking for your citizens' opinions on whether computers are bad or good. @CAPS1's opinion is that computers are bad. I think computers are bad in three ways and I want to express them to you and hopefully persuade you to lean towards @CAPS1's side. It smells nice out today. I can smell flowers, the grass, and many more. @CAPS1's first reason why computers are bad is that if you use the computer too much, you don't spend enough time enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful with its fresh air, green grass, and sometimes rainbows. You can take a walk in the woods and just be yourself. In other words, nature is very nice and you should go out and enjoy it. If you don't appreciate nature now, it might be too late because soon it will turn rainy, followed by winter which is cold and comes with tiresome chores like shoveling snow. @CAPS1's next reason why computers are bad is that spending all your time working leaves no time for exercising. Exercising is fun, you get to go outside, hang out with friends, and stay healthy. Without exercise, you can become unhealthy and weak. The possibilities of staying healthy are endless - biking, running, hiking, climbing mountains, and more. While exercising in the park, you can meet new friends unexpectedly, like @CAPS1 did with his friend. But since he goes to the park every day, he can potentially make a new friend each time. @CAPS1's last reason why computers are bad is that you don't get enough time to interact with friends and family. I love my family but if they are outside exercising and I am stuck on the computer, I miss out on precious moments with them. In conclusion, I believe that computers are bad because they hinder opportunities for exercising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with family and friends.
823	825	1	3	Dear local @CAPS1, I believe that computers are essential tools for children to have access to. Firstly, computers are crucial for students when they need to write essays for school. Nowadays, many teachers require students to type their essays, and having a computer makes this task much easier and more efficient. Additionally, children often need to research information for their school projects, and computers provide a vast amount of resources at their fingertips. Whether they are looking up historical facts or scientific data, having a computer enables them to access a wealth of knowledge. Furthermore, in today's digital age, communication is often done through email. Children may need to check their emails for important messages from teachers, parents, or even distant family members. Having a computer allows them to stay connected with others and communicate effectively. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in a child's education and overall development. They facilitate learning, research, and communication, making them indispensable tools for children in the modern world.
824	826	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student of the local middle school technology is utilized to the fullest. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently & complete research assignments. However, personally I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 help keep in touch with old college buddies', but no computer can replace face-to-face communication. From hard, cold text, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit. Bot, people are beginning to replace seeing one another with @CAPS3 networking. With the technological revolution came games like @ORGANIZATION2. These games are addicting, @CAPS4, our society mocks ""nerds"" for spending too much time playing these trivial games, but it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by @ORGANIZATION3 students, ""@NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise."" This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming. Ultimately consumes all free time. This is dangerous, because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion, @CAPS3 inadequency, obesity. @CAPS2 a people, we are quickly learning that what was once so genius, is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on and, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health. @CAPS2 aforementioned, obesity is issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 deficiency & a negative outlook & you've got yourself a issue. All of the deseases brought on by computers can be just by less time on the computer, & exercises. Naturally, @CAPS2 a specie we were not to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomena that is aquiring major health problems. The over usage of computers practionally, robs us of our time, destroys our health, & hinders our @CAPS3 interactions. This makes computers a negative influence on people & their health.  The extensive use of computers not only affects our physical health but also has a detrimental impact on our social interactions and overall well-being. As we immerse ourselves more deeply into the digital world, we risk losing valuable face-to-face connections, succumbing to addictive behaviors, and neglecting our health in the process. It is imperative that we strike a balance between the benefits of technology and the potential harm it can bring, ensuring that we prioritize our health and human connections above all else."
825	827	1	3	Computers have undoubtedly had a positive impact on people in various aspects of life. They play a crucial role in facilitating communication with family and friends through online platforms, enabling individuals to stay connected regardless of physical distance. Moreover, computers are invaluable tools for job seekers, as they can easily apply for positions and search for opportunities that match their skills and interests.  Furthermore, computers are instrumental in academic pursuits, providing students with access to a wealth of information for research and study purposes. They also offer convenient ways to engage in physical exercises through online tutorials and videos, promoting a healthier lifestyle. Additionally, computers streamline the process of writing essays and other assignments, making it easier for individuals to organize their thoughts and ideas effectively.  The portability of laptops allows users to work and access information on the go, without being tethered to a specific location. This mobility enhances productivity and efficiency, as individuals can stay connected and productive wherever they are. Moreover, computers enable online shopping, offering a convenient way to purchase goods and services without the need to physically visit stores.  In conclusion, computers have undoubtedly brought numerous benefits to people's lives, enhancing communication, education, productivity, and convenience. Their positive impact on society is undeniable, making them indispensable tools in the modern world.
826	828	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have been an incredible help to many people as they advance in knowledge. But, many people do not think about the negative effects of computers. Computers make research easier to find, and they organize data well and quickly. Computers make communication easy, but there are many negative effects as well as positive. Chat rooms on computers are a great way to communicate quickly, but they can also be dangerous.  More and more kids are spending time on computers, rather than outside exercising and communicating with friends and family. Chat rooms are commonly used by kids as well as adults. Kids use them to talk with friends, make plans, and catch up relatives. But kids aren't the only people that use chat rooms. Adults use them too. Some for good, others for bad. Adults sometimes have chats for their work to talk with their fellow workers. They can communicate easily what has been done and what needs to be done at the office such as what bills have been paid. This is a good way for workers to know what's going on outside of the office.  There are many other useful advantages of computers. Some other advantages of computers are the computer's functions. Computers are good for finding information quickly. Computers are useful to find information for school projects. Computers can also take that information, and organize it on graphs, and computer programs such as Microsoft PowerPoint. Other pluses about computers are that they can teach hand-eye coordination. Typing can help majority with this. Typing is also another advantage. If people don't have great penmanship, they can use a computer to type essays, homework, and school projects. This makes reading the assignment easier for the student as well as the teacher.  There are many advantages to computers, but there are also disadvantages. More and more kids are spending is their free time on the computer, instead of outside exercising. This is causing kids to become less active. Being in a chat room all day is also a disadvantage. Kids today are using a new language in chat rooms as well as texting. They are using abbreviations for words and phrases, such as ""idk"" for ""I don't know"". This language is damaging how kids read and write.  Although chat rooms on computers can be useful, they can also be dangerous. Kids as well as adults go into chat rooms and talk to other people, saying invalid information about themselves. Such as age. Some adults go into chat rooms and pretend to be a teenager. They talk to kids until they find out something like an address, phone number, school, and district. Once they got information like that, they can find out many other things about kids. This is extremely dangerous and unfortunately, it does, and has happened.  As you can see there are many advantages as well as disadvantages. I believe if people can find a balance between them, people will agree more about computers. In my opinion, computers are handy, but dangerous. If kids are more careful online, and spend more time outside than on the computer, there would be less controversy. Parents would be less concerned about their child's safety and health if kids only used computers for homework, and were safe about who they talk to online. Also, what kids say in profiles. If all of this happened, there would be a balance, and I think people would be less drastically over a period of time, and people would be more comfortable."
827	829	1	3	Computers are an amazing technology that has greatly impacted our lives. They have proven to be beneficial in various aspects such as education and law enforcement. For students, computers are valuable tools for research and learning. In law enforcement, they assist in tracking criminals and planning strategic operations. However, there are drawbacks to excessive computer usage, such as hacking and addiction. It is essential for parents to monitor and limit their children's computer time to prevent negative consequences. Despite some drawbacks, computers have revolutionized communication, security, and many other areas of life. It is crucial to find a balance in using this technology to fully benefit from its capabilities while avoiding its potential pitfalls.
828	830	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have a positive impact on people by teaching hand-eye coordination, providing convenience, and enabling online interactions. Computers offer various websites that help individuals, especially children, improve their typing skills, enhancing their ability to recognize letters and keyboard layout. Moreover, individuals with dyslexia can benefit from software that assists in identifying typed letters correctly. Additionally, using a computer is convenient for tasks such as research, as information can be easily accessed online without the need to purchase books. Furthermore, computers facilitate online communication through video chats, allowing families separated by distance or military service members to stay connected. Overall, computers play a vital role in enhancing coordination skills, offering convenience, and enabling online interactions, making them a valuable tool in today's digital age.
829	831	1	3	I belive having computers in a household is a good idea. They can play games, learn, talk and many more. Here are my three reasons having a computer is a good thing. Having a computer is great to play games! There are so many varieties to choose from. There are card games, board games, even @NUM1 games! You can play solo, but it might be more fun and easyier to bring some friends along for the ride. As you can see having a computer can be fun, but its not the only thing to do on a computer. Useing a computer to learn is wonderful too. The computer can take you to places you have never seen, heard, or been to before, or maybe a place you couldn't afford to go. You @MONTH1 learn that in on place it's sunny all the time and in other places it's not. Another thing the computer can teach you is about animals. Animals have been here way be for us. There is still much we dont know about them. Many scientists have spent their lives studying animal and have put it on the iternet for you to better educate yourself. The computer can also teach you hand-eye. Hand-eye is great to have if your trying out for a sport like football, baseball, and basketball. Also you never know when you'll need to catch somthing. My final reason is also very helpful. Being able to talk on the computer is good to using voice chat or instint messenger is your choice. While talking on the computer you might make some new friends that share the same intrests and hobbies you do. And you can chat with them as long as there online. Also while your talking you can express your ideas and feelings. Somtimes you might just need to blow off some steam. Or maybe post an idea that can one day be famous. As you can see games, learning and talking are easier to do on the computer. This is why I think having a computer in the household is a great idea.

831	833	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Are you spending all your precious time on a computer? On the computer your probably wasting every second searching or playing games. You shouldn't spend a lot of time on the computer it will just wash away your brain. You shouldn't go on computers for a long time because instead you should be exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with people. First of all, spending too much time on the computer is not good for you because you should be out exercising. On computers you can't jog the fat you gain by eating food. By jogging instead of going on the computer you can lose weight and see the real world than the world behind the computer screen. Nevertheless computers are fun to go on like playing addicting games. but isn't it better to play a real sport like soccer. In soccer you have to use your mind and a lot so it is much better than sitting or laying around dazed at a computer screen for a long period of time. Don't you love playing outdoor games! Like playing tag or hiding go seek isn't that more fun than playing an addicting game on the computer screen? For me I think it is. That is my reasons I think you should exercise then stare at the computer screen. Secondly, you shouldn't be on the computer for a long amount of time because you should instead be enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful and refreshing unlike a computer. Yeah I know computers offer a lot but do they offer the fresh air outside, the warm breeze land living animals the earth. I don't think so and neither should you. Instead of going on your computer when it is raining not you should play with your pets and if you don't have any put a raincoat umbrella and go outside. Especially in the summer you should be outside enjoying nature go for a swim or bring your annoying little siblings to the park. There is more to often in use than going on the computer. More importantly, you shouldn't go on the computer because you are better off. Interacting with living people in person. On the computer talking to people you are going nowhere on the computer chatting with people it is impossible to read someone's expression. So get off the computer and hang with your family and friends. Get into a fun conversation or debate. Make new friends when you're at the mall or discovering a new trail in a park. Do anything but interact on the computer when all you see is typed words writing back to you. Get yourself out in the world don't just interact with people but the world not the computer screen. In conclusion you shouldn't spend most of your precious time on the computer. It isn't necessary for you to spend all your time on the computer when you could be exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with people. I strongly believe people should be outside than on a computer. So what are you waiting for get off that computer and take a hike!
832	834	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4,  The average teenager spends @NUM1 hours on a computer daily! People spend too much time on their computers. They don't exercise as much nowadays. Also, they don't enjoy all the wonderful nature the has to offer. Most importantly, people who spend too much time on the computer don't see their family and friends. These are the reasons why people shouldn't spend so much of their time on a computer. Since people spend too much time on the computer, the exercise less and less. A recent poll shwos that @NUM2 in every @NUM3 @CAPS5 is overweight. If our modern society didn't have so many distractions like computers than maybe people would be bore & maybe fo outside. Back in @DATE5 only @PERCENT2 of the @CAPS6 population was obese. So, why in @DATE6 has this number skyrocketted to @PERCENT1? Back then electronics weren't popular so for fun, kids played games with eachother outside on a regular basis. Now it's rare for a kids to be motivated to put down the mouse, and go play kickball with neighborhood) friends. The kids would rather sit inside a airconditioned hoose thatn go outside & have some good healthy fun & work up a sweat. Computers keep people from exercising so their affect on people is negative. With computers being so popular, people are less involved with nature. Our society doesn't take the time to notice the cool breeze on an @DATE4 @TIME1, or the waves crashing on a hot @DATE3 @TIME1. They don't take time to appreciate has beautiful the follage is in @DATE2, or now it feels to be showered with snow on a chilly @DATE1 @TIME1. People would rather sit at a computer for @NUM4 hours doing wonders of our world. People don't respect the natural beauties that nature has to offer. Computers take away from people enjoying nature's joy. Computers run people's relationships with family and friend. @NUM5 year old @CAPS7 would rather talk to his girlfriend on the computer than spen time with this @CAPS8. Kids don't organize their priorities we enough. as it is, adding a computer into the mix just makes it worse. Peple have accounts on social networking sites like facebook and sometimes they are very drame filled and cause problems. Friendships are easily ruined and usually the cause of this is some kind of misunderstanding. It is very sad but true that kids would rather watch goofy vidoes than visit a grandparent. Computers are negative to people since they ruin their relationships with friends and family. People should spend less time on the computer. Computers are a main factor in the vast increase in obesity rates. Kids need to regain healthyness before it's too late! Also, people of all ages should realize the natural beauty of naturel, but computers get in the way of that. Most importantly, computers ruin many relationships with friends and family. The cause stress and unnecessary drama. As you can see, computer have a negative affect on people.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
833	835	1	3	When your were a kid, did your parents let you play all day on the computer? Well my parents don't let me and I think that's not fair. I think it's not fair because being on the computer has a lot of benefits, like teaching you hand-eye coordination. Another advantage is that when you're on the computer, you can chat with people through webcams. Also, with a computer, you can do homework assignments for something that requires you to do research. And of course, when you're on a computer, you can watch your favorite movie or TV show, like Netflix or Hulu. Now aren't these some great advantages? As an adult, I'm pretty sure that you like to do a lot of things from the comfort of your own home, well when you have a computer you can. One way you can keep in touch is by online chatting like through the webcam or my favorite AIM, which stands for AOL Instant Messaging. Surprisingly, another thing you can do is work online by setting it up at work or telling your boss how to do it. By the way, you're an adult who didn't go to college when you were young because you had to work. If you have a computer or laptop, you can go to school online, and the best thing is that you'll be in your bed nice and warm without any worries. Now don't you think that is a nice way to spend your day? When you're a kid my age, when you have a computer all you want to do is play games online with friends. Well, that is what most of us kids do nowadays, but our parents don't let us play too much. The only time they let us stay long is when we may be doing a project for school. But when you're a kid, besides playing games all day, we also want to learn about things like history or the solar system; that's what you. Most people would agree that when you have a computer, you can just book a hotel online instead of going all the way to the hotel. Of course, that's what my parents do, every time we go on vacation, they look everything online like the hotel, the flights, and the car rental. Yes, having a computer is helpful. Another thing you can do is watch movies online when you are on a plane going to the vacation, because that's what I do with my laptop. But the thing I like the most is watching shows because every time I watch different episodes of Friends, the time goes by so quick that a three-hour flight only seems like two hours. Finally, I have explained to you why having a computer is a good thing. One reason is that you can do a lot of things on the computer itself. A second reason is that you can do a lot of school work with it like doing a research paper or going to school online. And my final reason was that you can book things online without going anywhere, wasting gas. So now it's your turn to decide whether having a computer is a good thing or a bad thing.
834	836	1	3	Dear local newspaper,  I believe that children should be allowed to use computers to connect with their relatives across the world. I have personally experienced the benefits of staying in touch with family members in different locations through the use of a laptop. By communicating with my relatives in other countries, I have been able to learn about my family history and even visit them in person.  For instance, I discovered that I have relatives in a place called Location3, which turned out to have one of the most beautiful scenic views I have ever seen. Thanks to the information I gathered online, I was able to visit them and explore the area, creating lasting memories with my family.  Moreover, computers have allowed me to stay updated on news and information about my favorite celebrities, like the recent news about Chris Rock's divorce. Being able to access such information has broadened my knowledge and kept me informed about various events happening around the world.  In conclusion, I strongly believe that children should have access to computers to learn about the world, connect with their relatives, and stay informed about important news. The use of technology can open up a world of opportunities and enrich their lives in many ways.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
835	837	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, the big rectangular shaped black or white box with lights and beeps, the computer was a smart idea! But why do you ask? I'll show you. This device can teach you a new language, Skype can let you talk to friends and family on the web or on the phone (although you still have to pay for it). You can surf the web, have a laugh on YouTube, shop on eBay or Amazon, and watch movies on Netflix without leaving your home.   If you enjoy video games, you can download games like Sims and Spore on a PC. Macs offer great features like Finder, Safari, and Dashboard. When it comes to choosing a computer, you have the freedom to pick between a PC or a Mac based on your preferences.   You can also decide between a laptop, desktop, or netbook. A laptop is perfect for those who are constantly on the go, while a desktop is ideal for those who prefer working from home. Netbooks are convenient for travel and come with a built-in camera for video calls.   In conclusion, investing in a computer is a decision that should be based on your lifestyle and needs. Whether you choose a PC or Mac, laptop, desktop, or netbook, make a choice that aligns with your daily routine and preferences. Thank you for reading.

838	840	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers have a positive effect on people. Being on the computer teaches hand-eye coordination, helps people learn about faraway places and individuals, and allows people to communicate with others. Using the mouse and keyboard on a computer helps improve hand-eye coordination as users can navigate without constantly looking at their hands. Additionally, the internet provides a wealth of information about distant locations and people, making learning more accessible and efficient. Moreover, through chat rooms and online groups, individuals can stay connected with loved ones regardless of their geographical location. Overall, computers play a significant role in enhancing various aspects of people's lives.
839	841	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, Computers don't take exercising, enjoying nature, and no interacting with friends and family away from you. Your family can set time limits on the computer if they think you are spending too much time on it. If you have time limits then people will have a certain time they go on and off of the computer. For example, a child is on the computer and you can't get them off, time limits will stop that. The child is on a game and if the time limits are on, when your time is done the computer logs off automatically. That way your child can't get back on until their next time. The computer can do many things; you can play online games and chat with friends. Chatting will let you talk to friends over the computer and you won't need to call them. Online games will still let you talk to your friends but you can have an avatar you can dress up and be creative with. For example, an online game can let you chat, make friends, and have fun in a virtual world. Time limits on the computer can help balance screen time with other activities and ensure a healthy lifestyle for you and your family.
840	842	1	3	The computer is a wonderful tool, but its impact on people can be negative. It can draw individuals in for hours, leading to a lack of exercise, reduced time spent with loved ones, and potential cyber dangers. The CEO of a fitness company highlighted the issue of decreased physical activity due to excessive computer use. To address this, a proposal was made to live without electricity for a week in order to promote a healthier lifestyle. While computers facilitate communication and information sharing, they do not provide the same social skills as face-to-face interactions. Additionally, the internet is rife with cyber dangers such as online predators, cyberbullying, and privacy breaches. It is crucial to prioritize real-life interactions, exercise, and be cautious of the risks associated with excessive computer usage. Take a break from the screen, enjoy outdoor activities, and safeguard against cyber threats. Remember, balance is key in utilizing technology responsibly.
841	843	1	3	Alot of people would disagree that computers are benefiting people. But I think that computers are exremely helpful because they are a good way to learn, they are fun to use, and it's also a goodway to talk to old friends. I know there are some people who are on computers alot more than they should but still computers are very helpful. Computers are a very good way to learn because on a computer you could easily find out whi the @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 is. But if you didn't use a computer and you went to a library it could take hours to find the right and find were in the book it is. You could also learn about news faster without writing for it to come on the news channel. Computers are a lot beter than having to drive to a library because with just a couple as clicks you could find what you want and be done. Computers are also fun because you can play little games on the internet that could easily take up on extra @NUM1 minutes that yu might have on a work break or before school. And even some games exercise your mind like solitare its fun but hard. But there are some games that people tend to over do because they go addicted. But most people haven't ever prayed a game like that or only play once in a while. Lastly computers are a good way to stay in touch with old friends because there are a lot of ways to talk to people online like say if when you were in high school your best friends moved away you sould still talk to people on a chat room were you can text. or a video chat were you actualy see them face to face. In conclusion I think computers are helpful because you can learn, play and talk to people. Computers are best all around helpful.   Computers also provide a platform for creativity, allowing individuals to express themselves through various mediums such as writing, music, art, and photography. With the help of computers, people can showcase their talents and share their work with a global audience. Additionally, computers have revolutionized the way we work, making tasks more efficient and increasing productivity. The ability to access and share information quickly has transformed many industries, leading to advancements in technology, science, and communication. Overall, computers have become an essential tool in our daily lives, providing countless benefits that enhance our learning, entertainment, and social interactions.

843	845	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 everybody realizes, technology is getting more advanced every single day. That is a good thing and could help people with everyday problems like @CAPS19, getting an answer to a problem, and @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 work. The more advanced Computers become, the more advanced People are. To start, Computers can help People communicate just imagine someone on the other side of the world. You can use websites like @CAPS3 and e-mail to quickly communicate with typing. I @CAPS4 like @ORGANIZATION2 can quickly send live videos of yourself all the way across the world. Without these technologies, we would never see each other's faces and we would only be using telephones. With @CAPS5 book, you can also @CAPS6 @CAPS7 like never before. Have you ever been in the situation when you can't @CAPS15 @CAPS6 @CAPS7? well, I have @CAPS7 can be easily uploaded in a matter of minutes. It used to be that @CAPS10 traveled very slowly, @CAPS8, we can know about it only a few minutes after it happened, thanks to computers. Computers can relay information at practically the speed of light. It is also a lot easier to find the @CAPS10. You only need to @CAPS9 the mouse a few @CAPS18 and you find the biggest reservoir of @CAPS10 ever. There is international @CAPS10, @CAPS11 @CAPS10, and much more in the palm of your hand. @CAPS10 also travels @CAPS12 on the internet than on @CAPS10 @CAPS14 or @CAPS15.V.

Technology has revolutionized the way we live and communicate, making tasks more efficient and convenient. It is truly remarkable how much impact computers have had on our daily lives, and the possibilities for the future seem boundless.
844	846	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I have heard about this issue concerning people spending too much time on their computers. In my opinion, I believe that individuals should reduce their screen time and engage in more outdoor activities for various reasons. One crucial benefit of spending less time on the computer is the opportunity to get more exercise. Physical activity can lead to weight loss, increased energy levels, and overall improved well-being. Moreover, excessive computer usage can result in laziness and a sedentary lifestyle. By spending more time outdoors, individuals can avoid feeling lethargic and unmotivated. Additionally, being glued to the computer screen can cause individuals to miss out on valuable family time and social gatherings. Family events, dinners, and movie nights are important for bonding and creating lasting memories. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between screen time and outdoor activities to lead a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle. Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.
845	847	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 not advancing in technology?"" asks four-year-old @PERSON2. There are countless reasons why people are not progressing in technology. One major factor is that individuals are spending excessive amounts of time on existing technology such as computers. Instead of utilizing this time for physical activity, connecting with nature, and spending quality time with loved ones, people are glued to their screens. Research from @ORGANIZATION2 indicates that using a computer for one hour only burns a mere @NUM1 calories, far below the daily target of @NUM1,000 calories necessary for maintaining a healthy weight. In @LOCATION2, the average person spends around @NUM3 hours on the computer, equating to only @NUM4 calories burned. Even engaging in aerobic exercise for the remainder of the day may not be sufficient, as it typically burns only @NUM5 calories per hour. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to obesity, increasing the risk of heart attacks and premature death, with @PERCENT2 of obese individuals in @LOCATION4 succumbing to heart attacks.  Meanwhile, as technology consumes individuals' time, the beauty of nature is being overlooked and neglected. The destruction of the rainforest, as highlighted by former @CAPS6 @PERSON3, continues unabated as fewer people venture outdoors to appreciate the natural world. Shockingly, @PERCENT3 of the population have never experienced the wonders of nature firsthand, demonstrating a disconnection from the environment. The lack of concern for nature is evident in the alarming rate at which the rainforest is disappearing, displacing countless species from their habitats.  Moreover, excessive computer usage not only detracts from physical health and environmental awareness but also hinders meaningful relationships. Families and friends are neglected as individuals prioritize screen time over face-to-face interactions. Heartbreakingly, the regret of missed opportunities for deeper connections is voiced by individuals on their deathbeds, emphasizing the importance of cherishing moments with loved ones. The detrimental impact of technology on relationships is further evidenced by drug rehab patients attributing their substance abuse to feelings of neglect stemming from loved ones' preoccupation with computers.  In conclusion, while technology offers convenience and efficiency, its overuse can lead to detrimental consequences for physical health, environmental conservation, and interpersonal relationships. It is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between technological engagement and real-world experiences to lead fulfilling and holistic lives. Let us not allow the allure of screens to overshadow the beauty of nature, the warmth of human connection, and the essence of a healthy lifestyle."
846	848	1	3	Computers are very helpful in many ways. They can have a great impact on you by assisting in various tasks, such as planning vacations and providing information. One way they can help is by aiding in vacation planning, such as by helping with budgeting and finding deals. Additionally, computers can offer a wealth of information on a wide range of topics, from academic research to college choices. Furthermore, computers can be a cost-effective way to shop, allowing you to find better deals online than in traditional stores. Overall, computers are a valuable tool that can greatly benefit individuals in numerous aspects of their lives.
847	849	1	3	Dear Local @ORGANIZATION1 paper, I believe that computers play a crucial role in benefiting society in various ways. One significant advantage is their ability to provide easy access to information, which is especially helpful for students working on projects or reports. By having a computer at home, students can research and complete their assignments more efficiently. Additionally, computers serve as a platform for social interaction, allowing individuals to connect with others online and stay socially engaged.  Moreover, using computers can enhance hand-eye coordination and improve visual acuity, contributing to better overall eye health. In an educational context, computers can motivate students to excel academically by providing interactive learning opportunities and access to a vast amount of knowledge on various subjects such as history and science. This can ultimately lead to better academic performance and a deeper understanding of different topics.  Furthermore, computers raise awareness about potential dangers and educate individuals on how to stay safe online. They also help people develop faster typing skills and improve their digital literacy, which are essential in today's technology-driven world. Lastly, computers offer quick and convenient ways to access important information, such as local news updates or weather forecasts, allowing individuals to stay informed and prepared for any upcoming events.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on society by enhancing education, facilitating communication, improving skills, and providing easy access to information. Their role in our daily lives is undeniable, and they continue to play a vital role in shaping the way we learn, interact, and stay informed.
848	850	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about how computers impact human beings? The impacts, results, and education they provide? I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow individuals to communicate online, educate themselves in various subjects, and improve hand-eye coordination. Who says the only way to contact someone is through letters or the phone? Technology brought by computers enables people to talk online quickly and easily. In urgent situations, where a question needs an immediate answer, the computer serves as a convenient alternative for communication. Moreover, computers play a significant role in education. While books are excellent sources of knowledge, the internet offers a wide range of information from multiple authors. Online colleges are becoming increasingly popular, offering the convenience of earning a degree from home. Hand-eye coordination, a valuable skill, is enhanced through computer games. Contrary to popular belief, playing games on the computer challenges the mind and improves coordination. Overall, computers are essential for communication, education, and cognitive development. They have a positive impact on individuals by providing access to a vast amount of information, fostering learning opportunities, and enhancing essential skills.
849	851	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 studies have revealed a concerning trend of people, regardless of age, spending a significant portion of their free time on computers. This pervasive reliance on technology is a growing issue nationwide. An anonymous source mentioned using the computer primarily to reconnect with old friends, reflecting a common sentiment where people prefer digital communication over traditional methods like phone calls. However, this shift towards computer-mediated interactions can lead to isolation and sedentary lifestyles.  @PERSON1, a student at @ORGANIZATION2, shared a balanced approach by limiting computer usage to prioritize real-life social experiences. This perspective highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy balance between digital and offline activities. Excessive screen time not only hinders physical activity but also impacts mental well-being, as individuals may feel disconnected despite being virtually connected.  Furthermore, the ease of access to the internet can empower individuals, especially teenagers, to engage in harmful behaviors such as cyberbullying. The prevalence of online harassment among students underscores the need for responsible computer usage and parental guidance. By setting boundaries and encouraging outdoor activities, both adults and teens can mitigate the negative effects of excessive screen time.  In conclusion, while computers offer valuable resources and connectivity, moderation is key to a balanced lifestyle. Limiting screen time, engaging in physical activities, and fostering real-world relationships are essential for overall well-being. By promoting a healthy relationship with technology, individuals can enjoy the benefits of the digital age without compromising their health and social connections.
850	852	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, With the recent development in technology in today's society, I know that there is a lot of controversy with computers. Many people believe that computers are positive towards our society, while others disagree. I feel that technology can be both good and bad. Technology provides great advancements in our world, but people experience less of the outside world when they surround themselves with technology. However, I believe we can find a balance between the two views.  Having computers has brought a lot of advancement in today's society. Modern medicine, for example, would be nothing without today's technology in computers. The military also heavily relies on computers for its operations. But with all this technology, we still need to find a balance. It is reported that people spend a significant amount of time per week on computers, neglecting other aspects of life. This excessive use of computers can lead to a lack of physical activity, decreased interaction with family, and a disconnection from the world around us.  While computers are undeniably useful and essential in today's world, it is crucial to remember to take breaks and prioritize other aspects of life. Finding a healthy balance between computer use and real-world experiences is key to maintaining a well-rounded and fulfilling life. Let's embrace the benefits of technology while also recognizing the importance of disconnecting and engaging with the world beyond our screens.
851	853	1	3	Dear local newspaper,  Computers are an indispensable tool in today's world, utilized by people of all ages for various purposes. While teenagers use computers for entertainment and social networking, business workers rely on them for carrying out essential tasks. In our community of @LOCATION1, about ninety percent of workers depend on computers to fulfill their job responsibilities, whether it involves communicating with clients, creating spreadsheets, or conducting research.  The advent of the internet has further enhanced the capabilities of computers, allowing individuals to access a wealth of information and resources with just a few clicks. Residents of Granby can now stay updated on the latest news, weather forecasts, and even watch TV shows and movies online. Additionally, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace enable people to connect with friends and family, share updates, and seek support during difficult times.  Furthermore, the convenience of online shopping has revolutionized the way we shop for goods and services. From clothing to food to music, everything can be purchased online with just a few simple steps. This not only saves time but also provides access to a wide range of products that may not be available locally.  In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering endless possibilities and convenience. Embracing technology and utilizing it effectively can greatly enhance our productivity and connectivity in today's digital age.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
852	854	1	3	My opinion is that the more time we spend on the computer, the lazier we become. Computers are incredibly convenient but can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. People often spend hours sitting in front of a screen instead of engaging in physical activity. This can have negative effects on our health and well-being. Additionally, spending too much time on the computer can take away from quality time spent with loved ones. It is important to find a balance between technology use and real-life interactions. By making an effort to exercise regularly and prioritize time with family and friends, we can lead a more fulfilling and active lifestyle. Remember, the computer should not replace human connection and outdoor experiences. Take a break from the screen, go outside, and create happy memories with those you care about. In conclusion, while computers are useful tools, it is essential to prioritize physical activity and personal relationships to maintain a healthy and balanced life.
853	855	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have both negative and positive effects on people. While there are advantages to using computers, the negative impacts seem to outweigh the positives. Many people in the past lived their lives without the use of computers, showing that they are not a necessity for survival. In today's society, technology has contributed to the rise of obesity, as individuals spend prolonged periods sitting in front of screens, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. This overreliance on computers has resulted in people becoming lazy and less physically active.  Although computers can help individuals stay connected and informed, these benefits do not outweigh the negative consequences. As a student, I utilize my computer for schoolwork, such as typing papers and conducting research. However, these tasks could be accomplished using traditional methods like pen and paper or seeking information from others. Therefore, it is evident that computers are not essential for completing essential tasks.  Furthermore, with the availability of cell phones, individuals can easily stay in touch without the need for computers. Unlike computers, phones offer a safer platform for communication and prevent the risk of personal information being compromised. In conclusion, computers are not vital for daily activities, and their negative impact on health and lifestyle choices outweigh their benefits. It is crucial for individuals to limit their dependency on computers and prioritize physical activity and human interaction for a healthy lifestyle.
854	856	1	3	When using technology, it is often for work-related purposes such as writing essays, creating presentations, and conducting research. However, some people use it for leisure activities like social media and online chatting platforms. While these can be fun, there are concerns about inappropriate content being shared on these platforms, especially by younger users. Posting such content can have serious consequences as once it is online, it is nearly impossible to remove completely.  It is important to strike a balance between using technology for work and for pleasure. Excessive use of computers and other devices without engaging in physical activity can lead to health issues such as weight gain. Parents also play a crucial role in monitoring their children's screen time and encouraging them to be active outdoors. While technology can simplify our lives, it should not be a substitute for real-life interactions and physical exercise.  In conclusion, while technology can be a valuable tool, it is essential to use it responsibly and in moderation. It should not be a replacement for outdoor activities or face-to-face communication. By finding a healthy balance between screen time and physical activity, we can ensure that technology enhances our lives without negatively impacting our well-being.
855	857	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper, Have you ever wanted to see your @CAPS3 that lives across the country? Well computers can do that. They are positive in effecting people in more ways, such as letting people communicate with family or friends from across the world or making everything easy to find what they need. Many people are isolated, keeping them from talking to family or friends, but computers are helping them by allowing them to chat or type to them. People can now talk to relatives in the comfort of their home without worrying about how they look. Computers also save on phone bills because instead of calling your mom in @LOCATION1, you can just go on a chat and talk with her, it's just as good as seeing her in person. Some people also think computers give people too much access to information, but they give people the power to know what they need. This is good for school projects or looking for recipes. In conclusion, computers have made it easier for people to connect with others and find information they need. Let's embrace the benefits of computers in our lives.
856	858	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, I believe that we should tell the people of @LOCATION1 about the dangers of using computers too much. For example, people who use the computer constantly spend less time doing anything else in general. Also, the longer you stay on, the more you use it, and this habit forms an addiction, which might be hard to break. Finally, people who always play video games on computers begin to lose touch with reality. Computers are turning this nation into a group of mindless sloths. If you have children, consider what they do most of their lives. Are they going outside and getting exercise, or are their brains being sucked into a computer screen? Most kids by the age of @NUM1 have already used a computer for over @NUM2 hours. This shows that kids spend more time using the computer than anything else. I had a friend named @CAPS1 who used the computer @NUM3 and eventually became so weak and scrawny from lack of exercise that you could snap his arm like a twig. Please, if you don't want your kids to end up like @CAPS1, encourage them to get up and go play outside. You may think that using your computer every day couldn't lead to an addiction, but computers can be as addictive as drugs. Scientists have found that using the computer every day for just one hour can be enough to form an addiction. In fact, if we were to scan people for addiction, @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION2 population would be addicted to computers. This means that in @NUM4 years, the world's addiction to computers could be at @PERCENT2 or even higher. Do you want to live in a world where almost everyone is glued to their computers @NUM3? I certainly don't. Video games are a great advancement in computer technology, but they can also be harmful. Small doses may be fine, but non-stop playing can lead to serious issues. Due to the fantasy content, people might begin to lose touch with reality. For instance, scientists tested a video game on kids, and now @PERCENT1 of them believe in zombies. They can never play the game again, as it could cause serious brain damage. In summary, more computer use means less exercise and social interaction, the risk of addiction, and a potential loss of touch with reality. I trust that you don't want to see you or your children's brilliant minds turned to mush by excessive computer use.
857	859	1	3	The innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery. Unfortunately, the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty. With the computer came a plague of not exercising and a disinterest in, perhaps even an inability to enjoy nature. On top of this destruction of the mind, this monster is the cruel cause of many declining relationships for who has time for friends and family while in the middle of an internet game? As unique and intriguing as the computer might be, it is slowly destroying the mind. Increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as well as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day. While playing on the computer, the mind might be racing but the body sits unmoving, no physical activity is being done. Indeed, for some the addiction is awful enough that the person only moves to get food, use a restroom, go to bed or when a parent demands it. All of the day's food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off. Meanwhile, in some of the more severe cases the person is so entranced that bedtimes are pushed later. Sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging. Nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires. Even nature suffered from the advent of computers. Fewer people went out to admire its beauty. Nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world. Oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed. Attached as people are to computers, they cannot experience the world to the fullest. Some argue that flora and fauna can be found online, but seeing a picture is different, almost cheating, compared to being beside the plant, able to study it from all angles rather than in an unmoving form. The experience is not the same. Also, computers are indoors, so the true world is shielded from view. Even nowadays with laptops if one was to be brought outside, the user would be focusing on the screen, not what is around them. Computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature. Even family and friends suffer when computers are around. Many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen. They tend to only pretend to listen half the time. Even when chatting with friends online, the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet. Frequently, during conversations without a computer nearby, the mind is focused on something from earlier that day. Relationships are suffering, and computers are at fault. Computers are sucking in society, more of it each day. Much of what is done on computers, like the study of faraway places, can easily be found in books. Computers have resulted in a lack of exercise, less time with nature, strained relationships, and a generally unhealthy lifestyle. Through all of this, they have returned little to society. Why does the world continue to put up with computers and their negative effect on humanity? Despite the convenience and information they provide, it is important to balance computer use with physical activity, time spent in nature, and nurturing relationships to maintain a healthy and fulfilling life.
858	860	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, More and more people do use computers, but it is not a bad thing. Student come home from school tired, bored, and doesn't want to go outside and exercise. Students would rather go on the computer. When students go on the computer they can chat their friends, listen to music, or learn about distant places. Firstly, students would chat their friends on the computer. When it is winter, students can't go outside and exercise. Students can grab their laptop, and go on their warm and comfortable table bed to chat friends. Maybe a friend can help with homework. Going outside in the winter can make students sick and miss days of school. Secondly, students like to listen to music. Music is an important part to a student because music lyrics can express themselves. Students @MONTH1 be dancing to their favorite song. Dancing is exercise and adults do say we need more exercise. Also students can play very soft music than not doing homework at all. Thirdly, students can learn about distant places. When I am on the computer I type in www.google.com and want to learn about a place where I want sto visit other student might want to learn about places they've never visited. Italy, france, @LOCATION1, and much more places people would want to visit. They would want to learn about places before ever go. In conclusion @CAPS1, more and more people go on the computer, but it does not have to be a bad thing. Yes, students should go exercise but all the time. When students go on the computer they can chat with friends. Secondly, students can listen to music. Thirdly, they can learn about distant places. @CAPS1, it is not a bad thing that students go on the computer.
859	861	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I know the debate on whether computers benefit society is greatly debated, but to me, the answer is obvious. The internet is an extremely useful invention, used in all schools and is only inconvenient when misused. I'm not saying that it's necessary for every house to contain one, but that it's a luxury most people have. The computer and internet combination is probably one of the most genius ideas ever thought up. It is basically any information in a click. Websites such as MySpace and Facebook allow you to connect and reconnect with friends old and new. Also, the ability to create your web page is greatly useful when trying to promote a business or company. Not only that, but the internet also makes it possible to purchase clothes online without having to go to the store. I know that's useful for those parents, like many, that hate driving to the mall.  Secondly, I can guarantee you that almost every school in the country has a working computer with accessible internet. The computer was just one huge leap forward for education. There are many websites with an educational purpose only. These are websites for children and adults of any age. Many teachers nowadays are assigning homework where the internet is necessary. Also, tests such as the blue ribbon test are taken online. I can tell you right now that many teachers would be torn apart without the computer.  Lastly, one of the most important issues is the downsides of the internet. Even though MySpace and Facebook are meant for good, they also have a dark side. It is essential to be cautious and mindful of the potential risks that come with using the internet. Despite these drawbacks, the benefits of computers and the internet far outweigh the negative aspects. In conclusion, computers and the internet have revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate, making them indispensable tools in today's society.
860	862	1	3	Dear @PERSON1 editor, I believe that computers have both positive and negative impacts, but the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones. While excessive computer use can lead to a lack of exercise and isolation from family and friends, it also offers numerous benefits. For instance, computers allow us to connect with people around the world, access a wealth of information, and enjoy various forms of entertainment.  Personally, I enjoy using the computer to play games like Bubble Spinner and stay connected with loved ones through social media platforms like Facebook. Additionally, I find that conducting research and writing projects on the computer helps me stay organized and efficient. The ability to watch videos on platforms like YouTube and Google Videos also enriches my knowledge and understanding of the world around me.  Despite concerns about the impact of excessive computer use on physical health and social interactions, I believe that when used in moderation, computers can be a valuable tool for learning, communication, and entertainment. By striking a balance between screen time and outdoor activities, we can make the most of the technology at our fingertips without neglecting other important aspects of life. In conclusion, while it is essential to be mindful of the potential drawbacks of computer use, the many benefits it provides make it a valuable asset in today's digital age.
861	863	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are indeed detrimental to modern society, and it is crucial that we address the dangers they pose. In today's world, where environmental degradation is a pressing issue, we must strive to reconnect with nature before it's too late. The excessive use of technology, such as @CAPS3, has led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, making us more isolated and lazy. Furthermore, @CAPS2 are not only harmful and expensive, but they also contribute to the worsening state of the environment. With the rapid loss of natural habitats due to human expansion, we must take action to preserve what little nature we have left.   The addiction to computers is alarming, with @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 users spending a significant amount of time in front of screens. This not only hinders our physical health but also disconnects us from the real world. It is essential to break free from this cycle of dependency and embrace the beauty of the natural world. Additionally, the dangers of online interactions cannot be ignored, as they expose us to various risks, including cybercrime and online predators.   Moreover, the impact of @CAPS2 on our mental health is profound, with many individuals experiencing addiction and isolation. It is crucial to prioritize real-life connections and activities over virtual interactions to safeguard our well-being. By limiting our screen time, engaging in physical activities, and spending quality time with loved ones, we can protect ourselves from the detrimental effects of excessive technology use.   In conclusion, it is imperative that we recognize the harmful effects of @CAPS2 on our society and take steps to mitigate these risks. By fostering a healthier balance between technology and nature, we can ensure a brighter future for ourselves and future generations. Let us strive to break free from the shackles of technology addiction and embrace the world around us for the betterment of humanity.
862	864	1	3	It is evident that the increasing use of computers is having a negative impact on society, particularly on our health and social interactions. The sedentary lifestyle that comes with spending excessive amounts of time on computers is detrimental to our physical well-being. Children and teens are spending more time indoors on their computers, neglecting the benefits of outdoor activities and exercise. This lack of physical activity can lead to various health issues in the long run.  Furthermore, the prevalence of computer usage is causing individuals to prioritize virtual interactions over real-life connections. People are becoming disconnected from their families and friends as they get absorbed in their online world. Misunderstandings and conflicts can easily arise from communicating through computers, as tone and emotions can be misinterpreted.  It is crucial for us to recognize the negative effects of excessive computer use and make an effort to balance our time spent on screens with outdoor activities and face-to-face interactions. By disconnecting from our devices and engaging more with the world around us, we can improve our overall well-being and strengthen our relationships. Let us not let computers control our lives, but instead, let us use them as tools to enhance our experiences in the real world.
863	865	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  I am writing to express my concerns about the negative impact of excessive computer usage on individuals. One of the primary reasons why I believe computers are not beneficial is the potential for users to develop health issues such as obesity. When individuals spend prolonged periods on the computer, they are less likely to engage in physical activities, leading to weight gain and other health problems.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can lead to a decrease in quality time spent with family members. People may prioritize their virtual interactions over spending time with their loved ones, causing rifts in relationships and feelings of isolation. It is essential to strike a balance between screen time and personal connections to maintain healthy family dynamics.  Additionally, prolonged computer usage can hinder individuals from forming real-life friendships. By isolating themselves in front of a screen, people may miss out on social opportunities and meaningful interactions with others. Building and maintaining friendships require face-to-face interactions and shared experiences that cannot be replicated through online platforms.  In conclusion, the detrimental effects of excessive computer usage on physical health, family relationships, and social connections highlight the importance of moderation in screen time. It is crucial for individuals to prioritize real-life interactions and activities to maintain a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
864	866	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  In my opinion, computers are essential in today's world. They offer a wide range of activities and benefits that enhance our daily lives. Firstly, computers serve as a crucial tool for communication. Whether it's connecting with long-distance relatives through email or instant messaging, computers make it easy to stay in touch with loved ones far away. Additionally, computers enable us to access the vast resources of the internet, allowing us to search for information on a variety of topics, from directions to different locations to exploring new places around the world.  Moreover, computers provide endless entertainment options. Whether it's watching TV shows, movies, or music videos online, or simply listening to music, computers offer a plethora of ways to relax and unwind. Personally, I enjoy downloading music onto my iPod from my computer, creating a personalized playlist that brings me joy.  Overall, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives and have significantly impacted how we communicate, access information, and entertain ourselves. Without computers, our world would be drastically different. Therefore, I believe that computers are here to stay and will continue to play a vital role in shaping our future.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
865	867	1	3	I think that excessive computer use can have negative effects on individuals. One reason for this is the lack of physical activity that comes with spending too much time on the computer. Without exercise, individuals may experience health issues and weight gain. Additionally, using computers solely for recreational purposes, such as social media, can be unproductive and may lead to a sedentary lifestyle.  Moreover, repetitive computer use can result in musculoskeletal disorders. For instance, carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition that can develop from excessive typing or mouse usage. This can greatly impact an individual's ability to perform daily tasks and can even lead to surgery in severe cases.  Furthermore, computers are susceptible to viruses and hacking, which can compromise personal information and data. It is essential to take precautions when using the internet to prevent the loss of important files and protect sensitive information from cyber threats.  In conclusion, while computers have many benefits, it is important to be mindful of the potential negative consequences of excessive use. Balancing computer time with physical activity and using caution when browsing the internet can help mitigate these risks and promote overall well-being.
866	868	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, more and more people use computers @DATE1, but this is not necessarily a good thing. Spending too much time on computers affects your activity level. Also, kids are now staying up later on the computer, in turn lowering grades. Finally, spending too much time on the computer decreases the amount of time spent with friends and family. Firstly, spending too much time on the computer affects your activity level. The more time spent on a computer, the less time a person has to do something active, like exercising. @PERCENT1 of people spend more than @NUM1 @NUM2 hours on the computer per day, if @NUM3 or so hours were used to exercise or play a sport, that number would decrease to @PERCENT2 according to a recent study. Doctors have said that at least @PERCENT3 of overweight parents spend most of their time on the computer, thus limiting their time exercising. The amount of time spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity level and affect the number of overweight and obese people everywhere. If we want to become a healthier country, we should state @CAPS5 writing time spent on computers. Also, kids now stay up later on computers and lower their grades. More time spent on @CAPS1 or anywhere on the @CAPS2 means less time studying, which means lower grades. Kids spend an average of @NUM3 @NUM2 hours on the computer each day, while kids spend @NUM6 @NUM2 hours each day. A student in @PERSON2 saw their grades improve from a @CAPS3+ to a @CAPS4+ just by spending less time on the computer and more time studying. That student also felt more because they get more computer. This tests and quizzes. Computers clearly have a negative effect on grades and school work. Finally, computers limit the amount of time spent with family and friends. A student, @PERSON1, said that she spent more time going out with friends now that the computer isn't taking up all her time. By doing this, she has a better friendship with all her friends than before. ""A kid that uses the computer during all of their free time spends @PERCENT4 less time with friends than someone who uses it in moderation. Families also suffer from this as well. If a family member spends all their time on the computer, the other family members will have less of a relationship with them because they don't talk or do anything together and will likely not know what is going on in their life or if something is wrong. As you can tell, computers also have a negative effect on relationships with family and friends. The overuse of computers does not benefit society. They affect a person's activity level, students' grades, and most importantly, a person's relationships with family and friends. In order to make our country a better and healthier place, we must the time spent on computers."
867	869	1	3	In my opinion, computers benefit society in various ways. Firstly, they enable me to communicate with my friends and family through social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and MSN. The use of a camera on platforms like MSN allows me to see and talk to my family members who may be far away, making it easier to stay connected.  Secondly, computers assist me in completing my homework and other tasks efficiently. I can easily write lengthy assignments and conduct research online, simplifying the learning process. This convenience saves time and effort, making it more convenient for me to stay on top of my academic responsibilities.  Lastly, computers provide me with a platform to explore various activities and interests. Whether it's finding answers to questions, working on projects, or simply engaging in hobbies, the computer offers a versatile tool for personal and professional growth.  Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing communication, productivity, and personal development, making them a valuable asset in today's society.
868	870	1	3	Computers are a convenient tool to have, but if not used in moderation, they can have negative effects on our lives. Many people today are spending too much time on their computers, leading to a lack of exercise and overall poor health. This sedentary lifestyle is not only harmful to individuals but also costly to taxpayers, as healthcare expenses related to obesity continue to rise. It is important to prioritize our health and make time for physical activity instead of being glued to a screen all day.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can detract from the enjoyment of life. Life is precious and meant to be lived to the fullest, yet many people are missing out on valuable experiences by spending too much time on their computers. There are countless activities and opportunities for joy outside of the digital world, and it is crucial to strike a balance between screen time and real-life experiences.  Moreover, computers can also strain relationships with friends and family. While they offer a convenient means of communication, they should not replace face-to-face interactions and quality time spent with loved ones. It is essential to maintain a healthy balance between virtual and real-world connections to ensure that relationships remain strong and meaningful.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is important to be mindful of how we use them. By prioritizing our health, enjoying life outside of screens, and nurturing personal relationships, we can ensure that computers enhance rather than detract from our overall well-being. Remember, life is meant to be lived fully, so let's not let technology get in the way of that.
869	871	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  In my mind, the computer benefits us in many different ways. Computers are entertaining, help us with education, and serve important health and safety purposes. People enjoy entertainment, and computers provide a vast array of options in this regard. Computer games, for example, are not only fun but also stimulating for the mind. My friend recently purchased a computer game and found it to be both entertaining and non-damaging to the brain.  Moreover, computers have revolutionized the way we learn. In schools, computers are now essential tools for completing projects and homework efficiently. Research has shown that children who have access to computers perform better academically than those who do not. For instance, my friend mentioned that since getting a computer, his grades have significantly improved.  Furthermore, computers play a crucial role in advancing health and safety. For instance, the field of genetics has benefited greatly from computer technology, enabling scientists to make significant breakthroughs in understanding and treating diseases like cancer. Additionally, in terms of safety, new technologies can help track and locate individuals, especially children, in the event of an emergency. A recent incident where a mother was able to locate her missing child using a computer chip highlights the importance of this technology.  In conclusion, computers have become indispensable in our society, enhancing education, entertainment, and safety. Without computers, we would not have made the progress we have today. It is clear that computers have a significant positive impact on our lives and will continue to do so in the future.  Sincerely, [Your Name]

871	873	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that having a computer can have many positive impacts. While teenagers may spend a lot of time on the computer, it is essential to consider the reasons why parents choose to have computers in their homes. One primary reason is that computers are valuable sources of information. They provide a convenient way to access a wide range of knowledge and resources, which can be especially helpful for school projects and research. Additionally, computers allow teenagers to communicate with their friends through email and messaging, offering a quick and efficient way to stay connected. Furthermore, computers can provide information about places and services that may be unknown to users, helping them make informed decisions. Overall, the benefits of having a computer, such as access to information, communication with others, and convenience in various tasks, outweigh the concerns about excessive screen time. Ultimately, computers play a crucial role in modern life and can greatly enhance our learning and social experiences.
872	874	1	3	Almost every family has access to a computer. They have become a part of life and a way to be a part of life outside of your house, even if you have to stay at home. Computers are a source of vast knowledge from millions of sources. They have already caused exponential advancement. Overall, computers have a positive effect. on a rainy day, many students will spend time on their computers. out of those students, a significant portion will be on sites such as A.I.M., Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Even if they can't use their phone or get out of the house, they can communicate with friends, old and new. Teens and adults use the internet to reconnect with friends they haven't seen for up to several years. People will talk to each other more, building more relationships and better conversational skills. Over half of the sites used by teens are based on social networking. To be able to easily have a conversation with someone miles away is a sign of tremendous advancement. Companies like Facebook are multi-million dollar enterprises. Mark Zuckerberg, a CEO for Facebook, says that sites like Facebook have skyrocketed in popularity over the past few years. More and more people are putting down their physical dictionary to type the word into Google, where it is accompanied by a pronunciation and found more easily. Students use computers for information on school reports in subjects like English, History, Science, or Mathematics. Information can be found in any subject. There was a survey taken to see which is used more often, books with a specific subject or computers for information on various subjects. Computers are used overwhelmingly more often. They're quicker than books and it's easier to search for a resource on the internet. And a site of particular interest or exceptionally useful can be added to your favorites. Computers are more practical than books. Pictures of scientific laboratories where space shuttles are sent to the moon have computers as a main component. Advertisements from Apple show that their computers are getting smaller and smaller. There's a laptop that will fit in an envelope and a handheld touch screen computer that can almost fit in your pocket. You can type papers and assignments so they're more legible. Computers can even score tests. Advancement is centered around computers. Before computers, so many things we do now would seem impossible. But computers open up a realm of possibilities. Typing is faster than handwriting in some cases and papers can be saved electronically. If our country keeps advancing at the rate, then it is possible to have computers that do mundane chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes. There can be computers that talk back to you like a real conversation. People can learn more and more information and personally advance in intelligence. I look at a computer and think of progress. There are aspects of computers that are not ideal, but overall, computers are beneficial to society. With a computer, you have access to friends old and new and information from millions of sources. Most of all, computers represent progress and advancement. I see no direct harm from computers.
873	875	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The use of computer benefits society due to the positive affect on people. Such as good hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to talk online with family and friends. Did you know that teenagers who use computers often when compared to those who don't, have increased test scores? This is because they are able to look so definitions faster, research and learn about anything they need at their fingertips. Furthermore, families and friends that live across the country are able to keep in touch due to email, video chats and Facebook. It is fascinating to realize that the use of the computer can increase your hand-eye coordination. You are probably wandering how this is and think that I am insane but there are legitimate reasons. Since I play basketball, volleyball and softball, hand-eye coordination is extremely important. One cold, wintery day, I was working on a long history paper and an essay, which meant countless hours on the computer typing. At five o'clock off I went to my basketball grow, and the best game of my life was played. Then, a week later, we had another game but this time I went straight from church. Consequently, I did not play as well; missed a lot of passes and shots. This proved to me that through the use of computers, my hand-eye coordination improved. Can you imagine being able to learn about people in faraway places, their cultures, ethnicities and religion? Well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology. In history, we were doing research on the world hunger crisis in our allied countries. Through the knowledge of this hunger, I was able to start a fundraiser at my church. Many teenagers like myself do not eat for several hours. Research has proven that many children in countries of Africa die a day from malnourishment. Now that this has been brought to my attention, I am going to work four hours a day to give these innocent children even a portion of what I consume. Thus, through the use of computers I was able to learn about the pain those children suffer and now it's my turn to help. Do you have family that's across the country that you are rarely able to see? My aunt and uncle live in a different state and they were just blessed with a beautiful baby boy. Since we are only graced with their presence about once a year we begin to miss them. But now through Skype, email, and Facebook, we are able to stay updated on the success and growth of their child as well as where they have recently traveled to. Also, a large percentage of the teenage population in the U.S spend at least four hours a day texting, tweeting or using Facebook to stay in touch with their friends. Recently, I have moved from one location to another and staying in contact with my friends there is extremely important to me. Those are the people that I grew up with and have known since birth. The use of computers has allowed me to stay in contact with distant friends and relatives. To conclude, due to improved hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to communicate online with other people, the use of computers benefits society. Through the internet, people can learn about new places to travel, hike and exercise while enjoying nature. Furthermore, when family and friends want to spend time together, they need to plan the logistics of it and without email and being online this becomes nearly impossible. I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hopefully you will take my opinion into consideration when debating over the topic of computers.
874	876	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I strongly disagree with the assertion that computers are not necessary in today's society.

Instead of relying solely on traditional methods like books, the internet provides a vast amount of information at our fingertips. This quick and easy access to knowledge is invaluable in various fields of study and work.  Additionally, computers facilitate communication and social interaction. Platforms like instant messaging, social media, and online forums allow people to connect with others regardless of distance. These tools are especially important in today's interconnected world where maintaining relationships and staying informed is vital.  Furthermore, the internet serves as a gateway to a plethora of resources and entertainment. From downloading music and videos to playing games and accessing directions, the possibilities are endless. The convenience of being able to find almost anything online contributes to the widespread use and importance of computers in our daily lives.  In conclusion, computers are undeniably essential in modern society for research, communication, and accessing various resources. While it is important to balance screen time with outdoor activities, the benefits of technology cannot be overlooked. Embracing the use of computers allows us to enhance our knowledge, connect with others, and enjoy a wide range of entertainment options.
875	877	1	3	Dear editor, I believe that computers are an important part of modern life and prove themselves to be invaluable because they are used every day. Many times, we don't even think about using computers, as they have become a part of our daily routine. We use computers in various ways, such as staying in touch with distant friends, learning about different places, or even practicing hand-eye coordination. The presence of computers in our lives is so significant that it would be challenging to imagine a world without them.   Staying connected with friends and family who are far away is made easier with the use of computers. With built-in webcams, we can have video calls and actually see our loved ones, bridging the physical distance between us. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter also allow us to stay updated and connected with people from all over the world.   Additionally, computers provide us with the opportunity to explore and experience things that may be out of reach in reality. Virtual tours of exotic locations or online resources about different cultures allow us to broaden our horizons without leaving our homes. The convenience of accessing information online also proves to be beneficial for students conducting research or individuals seeking knowledge on various subjects.  Furthermore, computers contribute to the improvement of hand-eye coordination, a crucial skill in various activities like sports, gaming, and driving. Studies have shown that computer users tend to have better hand-eye coordination, which can be advantageous in tasks that require multitasking and coordination.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing communication, providing access to information, and improving hand-eye coordination. Their impact on modern life is undeniable, and they continue to be invaluable tools that enrich our daily experiences.
876	878	1	3	I think using the computer is great. You should heed my advice, people should be using computers. Computers are an excellent way to communicate. People can connect with others from all over the world. My dad moved to Brazil, so we have been communicating via email, Skype, and even Facebook. It's the easiest and cheapest way to communicate. If I call someone from a different country, it would cost me way more, but if I send them an email, it's cheaper. Studies from the University of California show that 80% of people think it's easier to use a computer to communicate. Moreover, you can do it instantly, so the information gets anywhere in milliseconds. Computers are indeed the best way to communicate.  Another thing computers are used for is learning. Many people from around the world have learned different languages from websites or programs that have great instruction and lessons. I learned to play guitar with many programs and online lessons. Many people depend on computers to get information and learn about things. My mom is a secretary at an insurance broker company. Without computers, the customers couldn't learn about the different policies that are available, and they might be spending more money than needed on insurance. Without computers, scientists couldn't do much research or learn about plants or rocks. Computers make it easier for them to study and learn about everything. Doctors wouldn't be able to do half of the things they can without a computer. They learn about different sicknesses and broken bones by using computers. A doctor said she couldn't help out as many people without the use of a computer; she states that she learned 70% of what she knows from websites that have information about the human body. Even teachers say that they get better teaching skills from websites. Builder and modern designer John Smith says he learned about different building designs that are sturdier and stronger shape; he used this in his building today. I hope that you can see how great computers are and how much they help our present-day citizens. Computers have truly revolutionized the way we communicate, learn, and work in today's world.

880	882	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people use computers more? No, they do not use computers more. Computers have many benefits to society, but they also have many negative effects on people who use them. People are spending more time on computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.  Firstly, people are spending less time exercising. Staying active is crucial for maintaining physical health and fitness. Athletes, like myself, understand the importance of regular exercise to perform at their best. Without proper physical activity, individuals risk becoming out of shape and weaker, affecting their overall well-being.  Secondly, individuals are missing out on the beauty of nature by spending excessive time on computers. Nature offers unparalleled experiences, from hiking in the mountains to fishing in a serene lake. These activities not only provide enjoyment but also contribute to mental and emotional well-being. Embracing nature is essential for a balanced and fulfilling life.  Thirdly, spending too much time on computers hinders meaningful interactions with family and friends. Quality time spent with loved ones is invaluable and strengthens relationships. Activities like going on family outings or spending time with friends create lasting memories and foster a sense of belonging and connection.  In conclusion, while computers have their advantages, it is crucial for individuals to prioritize physical activity, nature exploration, and quality time with family and friends. Balancing computer use with these essential aspects of life is key to overall health and happiness. So, do people use computers more? The answer is clear – it's time to unplug and engage in the world beyond the screen.

882	884	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I've heard that you were taking a survey to see if people believe in computers or not. Well, I'm someone who does because they can talk to their family and friends on sites like Facebook, MySpace, & AIM. They can also exercise on the internet because if they go to YouTube, then they can find different types of positions that they can do. Today, over 90% of people use computers, and it is like 80% adults and 70% children use computers, which means that more kids today are doing athletic sports. The adults use computers for their work ability and in schools. At newspaper places, they need to have a computer just to type the daily papers and if there's no computers, then how will they type their work. As people get home from wherever, and they didn't get the daily paper, then you can go online and look at it. For students, computers are so important to us because we get to talk to our friends and when we need to look up something, we just go to the internet. In some schools, they have really big books for different classes that they need to bring home. And that's bad for your back, so then schools came out with the books online. For those people who love sports, you can look up your favorite team and see if they won that week's game. There are also virtual sport games that you can play that are on the computer. When you first move somewhere out of town, you can go to Google and see where is a good town to live in and a good school system that you would want your child to go to. But there are so many things that you can do online and on computers. So thanks for letting me help you with your decision.
883	885	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I just heard that people are spending too much time on computers than with their families and friends. No, that is not true. Let me explain why. Computers can help you find people you are looking for, whether it's a long-lost family member or a friend you've never met. They can also assist you with various tasks, such as homework or difficult problems you may encounter. Additionally, computers offer a wide range of activities, from creating party invitations to researching new places for potential relocation. These reasons highlight the ways in which computers are actually valuable tools that can enhance our lives and relationships. I hope that this perspective helps to shift the narrative around computer usage and emphasizes the positive aspects they bring to our daily lives.
884	886	1	3	Debates have come up on whether or not computers are benefiting or destroying society. Computers are only helping in aid in the growth of society. Computers allow people to interact with other people, see and discover other places and people, and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers are helping people more than they are hurting them. First of all, computers allow people to meet and interact with other people. There are many popular websites that allow people to chat and communicate at anytime. Before computers were invented in order to talk to someone you would have to meet with them face-to-face, or send them a letter and wait on awfuly time get a responce. Now people can simply type up an email and hit send. Just like that, their message is sent to another computer for others to read and enjoy. Another advancement computer technology has developed is picture sharing. All one has to do to display and show their pictures to everyone is done by simply hooking up a camera, uploading your pictures onto your computer, and posting them on a site like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 bucket. Any in- the- @CAPS3 person would @CAPS3 that computers are very useful. Secondly, computers are important because they give people the ability to learn about and discover people & places that are new to them. In the old days if you did not @CAPS3 about something or someone, like a movie, you @MONTH1 never find any info about them. Computers have internet websites and search like @ORGANIZATION1, that allow you to type anything and instantly find all the @CAPS4 information and pictures or that subject.

In fact, many employers @MONTH1 hire you based on your keyboarding skills, ones one is skilled enough they @MONTH1 even teach themselves to type without looking at the keyboard. Although computers are not meant to replace your friends, family, and @CAPS5 air, they are very important tools that give you skills you will use for the rest of your life. Any individual that is highly educated would see the pluses in computer usage. In conclusion, computers are vital in order to properly function in many situations. They allow you to chat and send pictures to loved ones, teach you about faraway people and places that you @MONTH1 not @CAPS3 about other wise, and help one improve on their hand - eye coordination. Computers are very useful pieces of equipment. Additionally, computers have revolutionized the way we work, play, and communicate, making them an indispensable part of modern society.
885	887	1	3	Computers play a significant role in the lives of many people, and I am a strong advocate for the ongoing advancements in technology. One of the key benefits of computers is the ability to communicate with individuals who are located far away, allowing for connections with friends and family members across the globe. Additionally, computers help improve hand-eye coordination, a valuable skill that can be applied in various activities, such as sports. Moreover, computers provide access to a wealth of information about different countries, enabling users to learn about diverse cultures and societies. In essence, the continuous development of electronics, particularly computers, is crucial in enhancing communication, skills development, and knowledge acquisition.
886	888	1	3	Dear residents of @LOCATION1, it has come to my attention that there has been some controversy about whether or not computers are a good thing and/or helpful to society. I strongly believe that computers are a very helpful resource that make day-to-day life easier. Computers can help us in so many ways, including making learning easier, helping students do better in school, and serving as a great teaching tool.  One reason that I support computers is because they make learning easier. You might ask how a screen and a keyboard can make learning easier, it sounds crazy, but it's true! Let's say you're a middle school student that has been assigned to write a paper on a designated topic; instead of spending hours upon hours looking for the right information in a library, you could just Google search your topic and voila! You have exactly what you need to know in front of you within seconds, pretty cool right?  Still don't believe computers are helpful? What if I told you they allowed students to do better in school? That's right, computers allow students to do better in school. Websites such as Edline allow teachers to post their students' grades very quickly. How is this helpful? When you take a quiz, your teacher has to grade over 100 quizzes! And with things like absences, weekends, and vacations, the day you get your quiz back gets delayed further. Sometimes kids don't get their quizzes back for two weeks after they took them! By the time you get it back, it's time for a chapter test with 50% of your grade, and you just found out you didn't do well on one of the sections! This lowers your ability to do well on the test. But if your grade was posted on the internet days before, you will have more time to study and know what to study, and you will do better on the test.  As you can see, computers are very helpful for students, but are they good for teachers too? The answer is yes, computers are a good teaching tool. Has this ever happened to you? No matter how much your teacher explains to you, it just seems like they are speaking another language? What if they showed you a cool video on YouTube explaining it? Would you learn better with a visual in front of you? I sure would. Computers are also great for teachers because it gives them the ability to email other teachers if there is a problem and get the latest information about the school and what's going on.  Do you understand why computers are useful now? I hope you realize how useful computers are because they make learning easier, allow students to do better in school, and are a great teaching tool. These are only some of the many reasons computers are useful, and I hope you keep using them in our community.
887	889	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great benefits to our society. Whether it is because it helps people get their work done. Or it allows people to communicate without telephone numbers. Maybe it's because it helps students study. With any of these reasons, computers are really benefiting our society. Have you ever had a paper assigned one day and due the next? If you think back what had helped you complete the paper? Most likley it was a computer. In a recent survey 80% of college students say that they would not be getting the good grades that they were getting if they didn't have a computer. But, computers don't just help students, they can also help adults in the working community. I know that I have made friends over the years that have moved away and that I have lost touch with. With a computer it is easier to find those people and start talking to them. With different types of programs, you could most likley find anyone. Whether it's through social media, email, messaging, or online directories. Nine out of ten adults said that they found a lot of their high school friends thanks to the computers. Furthermore, computers are a way for students to study. Students could find search engines and research a paper. Or they could play educational games. With a computer if a student forgot his or her homework they could most likley use a computer to find out what the work was. When I went to the middle school to survey, 70% out of 100 students said that they would check to see if it was on the computer before asking a friend. So as you can see computers have benefits to our society today. Three just happen to be that they help people get work done faster, they help keep you in touch with friends and they help students to study. In conclusion, the impact of computers on our society is undeniable, as they play a crucial role in enhancing productivity, communication, and education for individuals of all ages.

890	892	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I often think about the effect of technology on humans. The human race has discovered many things but our biggest advance is technology. New machines are robots are built all the time, and our knowledge of machines and artificial minds is rapidly growing. The most widely used machine is the computer. People use it for all sorts of things, communication, awareness and learning, and entertainment. Some experts are concerned that people spend too much time on computers and I couldn't agree more. Computers may be useful but they are overused. People spend more time staring at the screen than exercising and interacting with friends and family.   Computers are also not always dependable or safe. First of all, the biggest computer users are adolescents. Young adults spend hours on websites like social media platforms, communicating with their friends. At their young age, exercise is very important. Obesity in children from lack of exercise is becoming very common, and it's because young people are glued to their computer screens. The average child needs 60 minutes of exercise a day, and many have very little or none. I say the computers are okay, but only in small doses. The growing mind and body need to move and exercise. If internet use among children and teenagers is not cut back, some worry that there will be a lot more health problems in the future.  Although it is very easy to quickly communicate through the internet, it can sometimes do more harm than good. Kids who spend hours gaming or emailing their peers spend less time with their families. I've heard parents say they barely see their kids because they're always either doing homework or on their computers. Also, face-to-face conversations are fading. Because of the internet, people no longer need to get together and talk, they can just turn on their computers, which is a waste of energy. Why not just go see your friend instead of typing all day?  Lastly, computers have just as many disadvantages as they do advantages. There are plenty of dangers out there on the internet. Online predators lurk in many corners, and your personal information and identity can easily be stolen. The risk of any of these things happening is very high. It's better to be safe than sorry. So, if you think about it, we really don't need computers to survive. You need your exercise, don't blow it off for online chat. It's very important to interact and be part of your family, and less internet use will cut down the risk of identity theft or any other problem or virus. It's your time now. Get outside, have face-to-face conversations with friends, and interact with your family. You can be healthy, happy, and safe without constantly typing away at the keyboard.
891	893	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think computers are a good thing, people use computers for business. Computers allow you to interact with people far away. They also allow you to do research. That is why I think computers are good. Computers can be used for many different things. They can be used for business. Some people work at home on computers.

892	894	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  I have been asked to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In today's society, computers are becoming increasingly popular, with many experts expressing concerns about the impact they may have on individuals' lifestyles. While some worry that people are not spending enough time outdoors, it is important to acknowledge the numerous benefits that computers bring to our lives.  One of the most significant advantages of computers is their ability to facilitate learning. Search engines like Google allow individuals to access a wealth of information at their fingertips. For example, during a casual dinner conversation with family friends, a quick search on the computer helped us identify the actor who played a specific character in a movie. This demonstrates how computers can help us find answers to our questions swiftly and efficiently.  Moreover, computers play a crucial role in both work and school environments. They enable individuals to send emails, create presentations, and stay organized with digital calendars. Research indicates that a significant percentage of people utilize computers to enhance their productivity at work. Additionally, learning how to use computers can improve cognitive function, as evidenced by the positive impact on individuals in nursing homes who engage with computer technology.  In conclusion, computers have a positive and beneficial effect on people by promoting learning, aiding in work and school tasks, and enhancing cognitive abilities. While it is essential to strike a balance between screen time and outdoor activities, it is evident that computers play a vital role in modern society and offer a multitude of advantages to individuals.  Sincerely, [Your Name]

897	899	1	3	Dear newspaper, don't you love to go on your computer? Don't you get a lot done on them? Well, I think they have a positive effect on people. I strongly agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. These are my three reasons; you can chat online with friends and family, help people do research on projects, and help people get their jobs done in everyday life. So please, local newspaper, keep reading and I will change your mind about computers' effects on people.  Do you have family or friends who don't live around here that you want to keep in touch with? Using the computer for email or a chat site like Facebook will do that. I have cousins who live in another state. The only way my family can keep in touch with them without spending money is through email. My mom and her sister are sending emails to each other all the time. If you ask me, I think that is a positive effect computers have.  Have you ever researched anything using a computer? I know I have! For a school project in 5th grade, I had to research about California. I did all my research on the computer. I got an A+! I would not have gotten that grade if I did not use the computer to do research.  Do you use a computer in your job? Well, even if you don't, I know a lot of people who do. For example, my dad uses a computer for almost the whole day he is at work. He is a financial analyst, which means he manages portfolios. He has to use software to check on the stock market. Another example is my mom, a teacher, she uses the computer to email parents if the student needs help or updates.  As you can see, computers have a good effect on our society. These are my reasons: you can chat online with friends and family, helps people do research on projects, and helps people get their jobs done in everyday life. I hope you agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. Say yes to computers' good effect!
898	900	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers have a profoundly positive impact on people, despite some negative opinions. Computers have revolutionized the way we work, communicate, and experience the world. For instance, your newspaper company benefits greatly from computers, allowing for efficient production and storage of articles. Without computers, the risk of losing valuable information to unforeseen events like fires would be much higher. Additionally, computers offer unparalleled visual experiences through the internet, enabling individuals to explore places and products in ways previously unimaginable. Moreover, computers facilitate connections with friends and family, making it easier to stay in touch and build relationships. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing productivity, connectivity, and creativity in our lives. I hope that others will also recognize the positive impact of computers in our modern world.
899	901	1	3	Dear local newspaper,  In my opinion, I believe that computer manufacturers should incorporate timers into their devices to regulate the amount of time people spend using them. This would help individuals, especially children, to manage their screen time better and engage in other activities. Additionally, there should be a law mandating that individuals must exercise before and after using computers to combat the sedentary lifestyle that often accompanies prolonged computer use.   Furthermore, I strongly feel that children should be limited in their computer usage compared to adults for health reasons. Excessive screen time can lead to eye strain and potential vision problems in children. Moreover, children are more vulnerable to online dangers, such as interacting with strangers on chat sites, which can have serious consequences.  Making these changes would benefit society as a whole and promote a healthier lifestyle for individuals of all ages. It is important to prioritize our well-being and take steps to ensure a balanced approach to using technology.  Thank you for considering these suggestions for the betterment of our community.  Sincerely,   [Your Name]

While some may spend excessive time playing games, it is ultimately a personal choice.

Parents can also set limits on screen time for their teenagers to ensure a balance between online activities and physical exercise. By making small adjustments, we can create a healthier and more active community. Let's strive for a harmonious balance between technology use and physical well-being.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
903	905	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I, a member of the public is writing a letter to you to inform you what I think about on the subject of if people spend to much time on the computer. My first idea is sometimes people do spend to much time on the computer than usual. Its a problem because some people began to become over wieght & start to lose control over the eating habits. My second idea is computers do alot of things for us. But there are still alot of things a computer cant teach us how to do. So computers are helpful but they're not always find something to do outside but whats sometimes different with a computer. My last & final idea is people become to attached to their computers & lose sight of what really matter, such as exercising & fitnesss. Then people are angry when their computer chrashes & forget how to do things because their always on the computer. And those are my ideas on the subject about if people spend to much time on the computer but not as much time with friends and family.  Some additional thoughts on this issue include the fact that excessive screen time can also lead to issues such as eye strain and disrupted sleep patterns. Furthermore, prolonged use of computers can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, which is linked to various health problems. It is important for individuals to find a balance between utilizing technology for productivity and leisure, and engaging in physical activities and social interactions. By being mindful of how much time we spend on our computers, we can ensure a healthier and more well-rounded lifestyle for ourselves and our loved ones.
904	906	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I want you to imagine it's a beautiful @DATE1 day. The birds are chirping, the smell of beautiful flowers are filling the air, but instead of playing outside with your neighbors, you are inside trying to master the unbeatable game cubefield on the computer. Computers have had a negative impact on today's society. When people are engrossect with whatever they @MONTH1 be doing on the computer they become very lazy, they lose the motivation to go out and exercise, people also lose intrest in helping around the community. This is why computers have a negative impact on todays society. Statics shows that @PERCENT1 of people would rather stay instead on the computer then out and about helping and working around their neighboorhood. Computers have had such a negative impact it makes people want to stay glued to their chairs with their eyes glued to their monitors. Yes computers have had a lot to do with a lot of technical advances, but at what cost do these technological advances come? Many kids are becoming obese and lack my motivation to come out of their room off of the computer. Computers are making society very lazy this is why they have a negative impact on us. Computers have also made society lack motivation to go and exercise. A very close family friend was very obese. She was lazy and never wanted to exercise. Instead of going out and doing something about it, she stayed in her room on facebook for weeks at a time. Though the computer wasnt the one who made her obese, it was used as a much to hide behind the real problems. It is sad when @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they would rather stay inside on myspace than going outside for a jogg. Yes its true computers helps you learn things you @MONTH1 not have known before, but so do books, newspapers and magazines. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Helping out in your community provides many opportunties to meet new people, and it feel a sense of accomplishment. But the urge to stay in on the computer clouds your better judgement. I know that I would rather help the elemntry school across the street build a new garden rather than stay inside on twitter. If you are inside searching the web how will you know if the old lady across the street needs help with her groceries? Helping around your community lets people know you care about whats going on. So dont let the computer have another second of your time. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Teenagers as well as adults have become very lazy. They lack motivation to exercise as well as help around the community. Now its your turn don't just stare at your computer screen absent mindley. Go out and toss the ball along with the neighbors dog. Youve heard the facts now make the right decision.  Computers have indeed brought numerous technological advances, but they have also led to a society that is increasingly lazy and lacks motivation to engage in physical activities or help in the community. Instead of being glued to screens, it is important to step outside, interact with others, and make a positive impact in the world around us. Let's not let the convenience of computers hinder our ability to connect with our surroundings and make a difference in the lives of those around us.
905	907	1	3	"Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I am @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1, I have recently been informed about the argument over computer use and I feel it is silly. We need computers in life to help us do jobs, communicate with family or friends traveling the world, and for research on homework. First of all, without computers many people would struggle. My father uses a computer for his job and he couldn't do his job without one. Sure, many people spend way too much time on their computer, but other people use it to save information or find research. I know people argue that computers should be used less, but could you get through a week without using one computer? Most people couldn't, especially if you own a business. In addition, from using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that moved away. Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they couldn't get connection on their cell phone, the only way to talk to them is chatting through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to business, so they are more useful than people realize. Lastly, as a kid we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but for homework. Some homework requires us to make powerpoints, write a paper on historical facts, and we need computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentially bring down their grades. My teacher always says, ""grades are the most important thing."" I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to people's lives. Think about people who travel a lot, kids with work that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that they need computers for, don't upset all of these people by decreasing computer time. Thank you for your time."

I have been a live for @NUM1 @DATE1 and have already live in @NUM2 different states: @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and now @CAPS2 you would think I would have had lots of friends living in so many places. How do I stay in contact with them you @MONTH1 use? I use various and @CAPS3. If you get rid of computers I would not be able to stay in contact with tem anymore. Moving from place to place was very hard and sad thing to do for me. Another hard thing to do for me was moving away from my family, but thank to technology and computers I stay in contact with them. Imagine you haven't seen you family in @NUM3 @DATE1, well sadly thats my life so many birthday @CAPS4 all the family you can see is you parents. School another great example where society benefits from computers students and teachers use them everyday to learn. In my opoion learning is the greatest thing. One of my friends, @PERSON1, said this about the dell computers we use in the library @CAPS4 ever u don't get something about what we learned in @CAPS5 class that day. I use the computers to better understand it. Computers are a great way to research a topic, and thats why they should not be gotten rid of. I use computers every day for two reasons for school, researching or writing a project for any of my classes. Everyday I spend at least @NUM4 our writing something up for school. Computers help lessen the time spend writing it because it is fast and easy it is easy to type something, like a @CAPS6 paper on the ways to persuassive the readier. In the end computers are something we I need in are life because it makes life simpler. If I was to send a message to some of my friends in @LOCATION2 through @CAPS7 it would take seconds. Instead if I was to use the @ORGANIZATION2 it would take days. A life with out computers is a lot harder to do things, that we cant make simpler with computers""Supplement appropriate details based on the existing information in the original text.

Job sites offer opportunities for learning and growth, with many college students engaging in online challenges and courses. For those pursuing online education, the flexibility and convenience of studying from home can lead to closer family connections and improved concentration. Additionally, computers facilitate communication through email and social media platforms, with a significant portion of daily interactions occurring online. Platforms like Facebook offer a space for connecting with friends and family, enhancing social relationships. Overall, computers enhance learning, communication, and social connections, making them valuable tools in today's society.
910	912	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, since computers were invented, they have significantly evolved, leading to increased usage among people. While some individuals believe that computers have a positive impact on society, there are also negative effects to consider. One major drawback is the excessive amount of time people spend on computers, which often results in a lack of physical exercise. This sedentary behavior can have detrimental effects on health, as individuals may neglect important physical activities in favor of prolonged computer use.  Furthermore, the rise of social networking sites like Facebook and communication platforms like Skype and Oovoo poses significant dangers, especially for young users. These platforms can expose individuals to various risks, including interactions with unknown and potentially harmful individuals. Researchers have highlighted the potential dangers associated with online activities, emphasizing the need for caution and awareness among users.  Moreover, the prevalence of computer usage can lead to reduced face-to-face interactions with family and friends. Instead of engaging in personal gatherings or social events, many individuals opt for virtual communication, which may not fully replicate the richness of in-person interactions. Building and maintaining relationships through computer-mediated communication can sometimes lack the emotional depth and authenticity found in direct human connections.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential to acknowledge and address the negative effects they can have on individuals and society as a whole. By recognizing the risks associated with excessive computer use, promoting safe online practices, and prioritizing real-world interactions, we can strive to achieve a balanced approach to technology utilization. It is crucial to find a harmonious balance between the advantages of computer technology and the importance of physical activity, personal safety, and meaningful interpersonal relationships.

Some say computers have negative effects on people when using them but I for one disagree with that statement. I believe that computers in today's society have created an atmosphere of learning, communication, and an ideal amount of creative fun. Computers are changing the way everyday people live. This technology is the basis of our future, and our future has evolved around our computers.

Computers contribute to people who want to learn. Being a popular used computer have beenimportant to make them the best. Whether that means faster internet better, researching book or more websites, a computer has it all. Back before the telephones was invented, people struggled to have a reliable source of communications with where communication is important because it is the main source of communicating. Through the computer, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and emails are easy and guarenteed ways to talk to everybody. With just a simple click of a mouse a person can talk to their bestfriend as if they were right next to them. Communication plays an important role for a civilization or society. It makes life so much easier without creating a place where people become lazy. Talking to people by using the computer has become easier and more dependable than ever. People can email their teachers if they have a question for homework, people can check there grades online, and people can talk to their friends and family all they want whenever they want. So we people say that the computer. If a sibling is away at college, their @CAPS3, when a family is to gether, they could since new things are discovered through the computer everyday. can come to a person in multiple ways. A computer can emphazize the fun is never a bad thing. Computers offer video games, learning games, and that bring creativity to. This technology gets people every to have an open mind with everything. It allows them to have fun but at the same time learn something about the world or even themselves. Sometimes computers can inspire people to do something like start a group to make the environment better or go running around ther block. Even though the actual computer is inside the fun and creativity can be whenever a person wants it to be. Computers expand a person's knowledge, allow one to communicate, and create a whole new word of fun. Researching topics can be easily accessed through a computer.

912	914	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  I am against the notion that computers benefit society in any way. While they offer a wealth of information and connectivity, the excessive use of computers can have detrimental effects on individuals. One of the most significant drawbacks is the impact on physical health. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to a lack of exercise, resulting in weakness, fatigue, and weight gain. Without proper physical activity, individuals may suffer from various health issues, including weakened bones and muscles.  Furthermore, excessive computer usage can hinder one's ability to enjoy nature. Being glued to a screen prevents people from experiencing the beauty of the world around them and engaging in outdoor activities. This disconnect from nature can have a negative impact on mental well-being and overall quality of life.  Additionally, spending excessive time on the computer can lead to a lack of interaction with family and friends. Building and maintaining relationships requires time and effort, which can be compromised when individuals prioritize screen time over personal connections. The meaningful experiences and memories created through social interactions are invaluable and cannot be replicated through virtual communication.  In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, it is essential to strike a balance and prioritize activities that promote physical health, connection with nature, and meaningful relationships. By being mindful of our screen time and making an effort to engage in activities that nourish our well-being, we can lead happier and more fulfilling lives.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
913	915	1	3	Computers have long been a topic of debate when it comes to their impact on society. While some argue that computers have greatly benefited society by providing new perspectives, increasing technological advancements, and making life easier, others believe that computers can be addictive, unsafe, and detrimental to personal relationships. It is important to remember that computers should be viewed as tools to enhance our lives, not as sources of entertainment or substitutes for human connection. Excessive use of computers can lead to dependency, communication barriers with loved ones, and potential risks such as hacking and identity theft. It is crucial to use computers responsibly and prioritize real-world interactions over virtual ones to maintain a healthy balance in our lives.
914	916	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1's the dilemma that people are supporting computer technology and others are not. I firmly believe that having computers generally has a positive effect. This is because many jobs are using them every day and it is very efficient for them. Also, having computers allows people to connect with other people, edit things that other technology cannot, and play fun games. Another effect that computers have is educational websites, games, and articles. This helps many kids find a good education and adults find a comfortable and happy job. Primarily, computers have a positive effect on people because jobs are using them frequently. Jobs such as @ORGANIZATION1 and any type of police work provide safely for people all around the United States and other parts of the world. My father always told me, ""Computers save people every day."" Even schools use computers! They provide educational information about the students in schools, and my school, @LOCATION1 school, uses them quite often. For example, I see my teacher, Mr. @CAPS4, using his computer every single morning in homeroom. Nearly @PERCENT1 of all jobs involve a computer by storing information or any other purpose required. Would you want all those people to lose their job because of their skills and techniques towards computer technology? I know I wouldn't, as computers provide a safe and healthy life for many people. In addition, computers have a positive effect on people because they can do many things that nothing else can do. This includes staying in touch with someone far away, editing photos, and even playing games on the computer, which can be relaxing to almost anyone. Skype is an example of staying in touch with someone else. For me, Skype is a life-saver. It allowed me to talk to my brother while he was at his chaotic college. In fact, nearly @PERCENT2 of people have an account on a computer of a public website like @CAPS7, Skype, or Zoom. Computers keep photos saved that can be edited and just saved to be admired. I don't want my pictures and my memories deleted because nothing else competes with the mighty computer, as it helps me have an enjoyable time and entertains me well. Thirdly, computers have a positive effect on people because they give adults and kids free access to education. I remember my old elementary school used to play many amusing math games. These were where my education grew greatly due to this game. Games like these are used frequently throughout the world. In addition, jobs have been found more and more every day from adults trying to find a decent job online. Computers have saved people from losing their house because of the money they made with the help of computers. Computers are a good idea. In conclusion, I implore you that computer technology has a strong positive effect on people. Computers are like a pencil to a student, for they are very important. Jobs use them every day, connections are made by people, and education grows because of them. That's why technology or computers affect people in a good way."
915	917	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects computers have on people are good. I believe this because people can learn hand-eye coordination, they give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and they even allow people to talk with people from around the world. Firstly, effects computers have on people are good because the people can learn hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is good in many occasions as it helps improve motor skills and reaction times. Secondly, computers effects on people are good because computers give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people is important because people can explore different cultures, histories, and traditions without leaving their homes. This can broaden their knowledge and understanding of the world. Lastly, the effects people have from computers are good because computers allow people to talk with people from all around the world, fostering global connections and promoting cultural exchange. This is useful for building friendships and understanding diverse perspectives. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing people's skills, knowledge, and global communication, making their impact overwhelmingly positive.
916	918	1	3	"To who this @MONTH1 concern, In my opinion, computers have greatly improved our lives. Therefore I believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good. Three reasons that support my decision are that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily, they allow us to connect with people in far away places, and they help us to learn more about life and the planet we live on. Please consider my reasons when making your decision. My first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily. This in turn allows us to get more done. For example lets say that your doing a report on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You could run out to the library and look through hundreds of books and newspapers or you could just sit down at your at your computer, open up a web browser, and type a ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" into the search box. Within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries newspapers and even other computers to find information on your topic. You can also look for information on videos. Old newscasts, inteveiws, documeteries, you name it. It's all there right at your fingertips. My second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect. If I said that to my mom she would probably tell me to go use the phone, but computers can do everyhing a phone can do and more. You ca share photos, videos, games, just about anything. Recently, I joined facebook and I now can talk to people I haven't seen in years who moved away I was born. Over the @DATE1 I had gone to my @CAPS3. My dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me. Then about month's later I got a friend request from a @CAPS4 who up in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, which is far from where I live, and now lives in. After talking to him for a while I learned that he was, the son of mydaduncle. If it weren't for my computer I would have never met him. Also,I recently learned and am getting pretty good. So one day my friends look me through a which has all it,. We began video taping a posting. So the computer has also allowed us to what without them having to be there. My third and final reason is that the computer allows us learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on. Many people say that if you on the computer all the time you'll become fat and lazy,but that isn't always the case. I have actually been able to improve my exercise rutine byuseing the computer. Whenever I go out for a run, I can come home and find out exactly how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and anything else I want to know. I have also been able to find new more effective excersizes that allow me to target different muscles. Now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet. We can use a computer to find weather patters which allows us to plan our days accordingly. We can also use it to learn about news happening around the world. For example, the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I opened up in my homepage and there it was and I was able to learn about what had happened. Finally a computer allows us to learn different cultures around the world. We can learn about how ancient egiptions lived, how the people in @LOCATION3 or @CAPS5 make money or how they construct their houses. All the things we would never know if we didn't have a computer. In conclusion, computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal. They have allowed us and how to improve our lives. I hope that this letter has helped you come to a decision about the effects a computer has on people lives."
917	919	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I understand the importance of computers in our society and how they have a positive impact on our town. Computers play a crucial role in helping individuals improve their hand-eye coordination, whether they are kids or adults. Through various interactive activities and games, computers aid in enhancing this essential skill. For example, in sports like football and baseball, practicing hand-eye coordination can be risky and potentially harmful. However, computers provide a safe and effective way to develop this skill without any physical risks.   Furthermore, computers have revolutionized the way we store and manage information. With the ability to store vast amounts of data electronically, computers have significantly reduced the need for physical storage space. This not only helps in organizing important documents and files but also ensures that valuable information is safe and easily accessible.   In conclusion, the positive effects of computers on our society, such as improving hand-eye coordination and efficient information management, are undeniable. I urge you to spread the word about the benefits of computers and how they contribute to the progress and development of our town. Thank you for considering these points.
918	920	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, have you ever considered the negative impact that computers are having on the people of @LOCATION1? It's a concerning issue that needs to be addressed. One major problem is that computers are contributing to a sedentary lifestyle. With people spending so much time in front of screens, they are not getting enough exercise. This can lead to weight gain and other health issues. Additionally, the financial burden of owning a computer can be significant. Many people feel pressured to buy expensive computers and software, ultimately draining their wallets. Furthermore, excessive time spent on computers is a waste of valuable time that could be spent outdoors enjoying nature. It's important to strike a balance and not let technology consume our lives. Overall, computers are having a detrimental effect on the well-being of individuals in @LOCATION1. It's time to rethink our dependence on these devices and prioritize our health and happiness.
919	921	1	3	I believe that computers benefit society and help people understand things more clearly. Computers help people study, learn, and even talk to other people. Here are some good reasons on why computers help people out with problems. First of all, computers give you information on things that you cannot find in books. People can look up places for vacations, what their child's grade in school is, and find healthy food recipes. Without computers, people would be lost not knowing what to do. Next, computers let you talk to friends. You can discuss things like weather, ideas you have, and even plan exercise days. If something important happens and a person does not have their phone, they could go on the computer and tell their friend, making communication easier. Finally, computers can improve hand-eye coordination. They can teach you how to type without looking at the keyboard, which is a valuable skill for various careers. Computers can also help you study for a new job and understand its requirements. In conclusion, computers make life a little bit easier by providing vital information at your fingertips, helping with communication, and teaching valuable skills for personal and professional growth.
920	922	1	3	To whom it may concern,  As more people are embracing the use of computers, it is essential to recognize the numerous benefits they offer in our rapidly evolving technological landscape. Computers have become the foundation of technological progress, offering advanced safety features such as privacy options and virus protection. With the increasing integration of computers into various aspects of society, including jobs, education, and the medical field, it is evident that they play a crucial role in shaping our future.  In the workplace, computers are becoming indispensable tools, with more jobs requiring proficiency in using them. Touchscreen devices and advanced software are making tasks more efficient and technologically advanced. Similarly, in schools, students are now required to take computer classes to develop skills in creating websites and digital content. This not only enhances their learning experience but also prepares them for a technology-driven world.  In the medical field, computers are revolutionizing the way healthcare professionals operate. Advanced technologies like 3D ultrasounds are providing more detailed and accurate imaging, leading to improved patient care. By embracing these technological advancements, healthcare providers can offer better diagnoses and treatment options.  Despite concerns about internet safety and viruses, there are measures that can be taken to mitigate these risks. By being mindful of privacy settings on social networking sites and using virus blockers, individuals can protect themselves online. Furthermore, the wealth of knowledge available on the internet allows users to explore diverse topics and gain insights that would not be easily accessible otherwise.  In conclusion, while some may have reservations about the increasing reliance on computers, it is clear that they are essential tools for navigating our modern world. By leveraging the benefits of technology while taking precautions to address potential risks, individuals can harness the power of computers to enhance their lives and expand their knowledge base. Embracing technology is not about being stuck in the past but about adapting to a changing world and utilizing the tools available to thrive in it.
921	923	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, Experts are concerned about the use of computers, as it can lead to a decrease in physical activity and face-to-face interactions. Spending hours on the computer may result in individuals neglecting exercise and outdoor activities, which can have negative effects on their health. Additionally, excessive computer use can limit social interactions with family and friends, as people tend to communicate more through screens rather than in person. This lack of direct socialization can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Moreover, chatting with strangers online poses a risk, especially for children who may unknowingly share personal information with potentially dangerous individuals. It is important to find a balance between technology use and real-life experiences to maintain physical and mental well-being. Thank you for considering these concerns about the impact of computers on our lives.
922	924	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Some people are asking others about the effects computers have on other people. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But my opinion is that the computer is great and it does not keep people away from other activities. First, the computer does not keep people away from other activities because there are only 24 hours in a day, and it's that person's fault if they don't get off the computer and engage in other activities. Even though the computer offers many interesting things, people should still have the common sense to balance their time. Additionally, there are numerous distractions, like television, that can also hinder people from participating in other activities. The computer can be a tool for learning and exploration, such as researching family history, which can actually enhance one's knowledge and experiences. Lastly, if people are truly concerned about neglecting other activities, it is their responsibility to prioritize and manage their time effectively. In conclusion, blaming the computer for keeping people away from other activities is not justified as individuals have the autonomy to make choices and prioritize their daily routines.
923	925	1	3	To whom it may concern, I was sitting at home when I realized this has to come to an end! The computer business has taken my mother and my stepfather away from me, I mean when they are on Facebook they are in a whole other galaxy. The family spends no time together whatsoever. Also, they argue, don't sleep, and again, we don't spend any time together! Not spending time with family isn't a good thing. Social activity is good for everyone. Even if the time spent is not with family, socialization plays an important role in our lives.  On the other hand, arguing isn't. Arguing just decreases the time spent together. Arguing in my family causes friction to the point where we become unsocial and turn to the computer. Now if we're arguing about the computer, then we have a huge problem. The arguing will never end! Not sleeping is my biggest concern though, when they are up all night on that stupid thing, oh gosh, don't get me started. I believe they don't have good days during the day when in school. Actually, I know they don't because they are dazed. Computers cause my parents to use up family time, fight, and not sleep. They spend more time on the personal computer than I'm comfortable with.  @CITY1 @PERSON1, I think we have a problem. A very big one! It's important that we address this issue and find a balance between technology and family time. It's crucial for our well-being and relationships to prioritize spending quality time together. Let's work together to make positive changes and ensure that we prioritize our family bond over screen time.
924	926	1	3	I believe that people spend too much time on the computer, leading to various negative consequences. Excessive screen time can result in deteriorating eyesight due to the strain caused by the bright lights of the screen. Moreover, prolonged periods of sitting in front of a computer lead to a lack of physical exercise, which can ultimately result in overall weakness and health issues. Additionally, individuals, especially teenagers, may neglect their homework and academic responsibilities if they are constantly engrossed in computer usage. This can lead to academic struggles and potential failure in classes, ultimately hindering their academic progress. In conclusion, it is essential for individuals to limit their computer usage to prevent negative impacts on their eyesight, physical health, and academic performance.
925	927	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree with some of the professionals who believe that excessive computer usage hinders people from exercising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with loved ones. While some may find it convenient and entertaining to be constantly connected to the internet, the reality is that this constant access to information can be overwhelming and distracting. The ease of finding answers online may lead to a dependency on technology, affecting our ability to think critically and solve problems independently.  As society becomes more reliant on computers, there is a risk of neglecting important issues such as environmental conservation and personal health. People are spending more time in front of screens, leading to a sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary habits. This lack of physical activity and human interaction can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental well-being.  It is crucial for individuals to balance their screen time with activities that promote physical fitness, outdoor exploration, and meaningful connections with others. By prioritizing face-to-face interactions and engaging in real-world experiences, we can strengthen relationships, improve health, and cultivate a more sustainable lifestyle. Remember, while technology can offer convenience and entertainment, nothing can replace the value of spending quality time with family and loved ones. Let's strive to find a healthy balance between our digital lives and the world beyond our screens.
926	928	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  Some people argue that the negatives of computers outweigh the positives, but I believe that computers have more benefits than drawbacks. While there have been instances where computers have caused harm, such as cyberbullying or data breaches, the advantages they offer far outweigh these negatives.   One significant way that computers are beneficial is in aiding rehabilitation for victims of accidents. Through the use of specialized software and technology, individuals can improve their reflexes and physical capabilities, ultimately leading to a quicker recovery process. Additionally, computers play a crucial role in connecting people who are physically distant, such as soldiers and their families. The ability to communicate via video calls or messaging platforms helps maintain important relationships and provide much-needed emotional support.   Moreover, computers provide a gateway to knowledge and exploration, allowing individuals to learn about and experience new and amazing places. For example, a young child browsing the internet may come across information about the wonders of the Amazon rainforest, sparking an interest in environmental conservation and inspiring future exploration.   In conclusion, while there are some drawbacks to the use of computers, their positive impact on human life is undeniable. From aiding in rehabilitation to connecting people across distances and fostering a sense of curiosity and discovery, computers play a vital role in enhancing our lives. It is essential to recognize and harness the benefits of technology while also being mindful of its potential pitfalls.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
927	929	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe computers are a huge benefit to society. I myself have a computer; it is very important and useful to me. Over @PERCENT1 of the families in our town own at least one computer. Computers are a great source of information. They also allow you to talk to people, even if they are far away. They are also very convenient and easy to use, in my opinion. Based on these positives, @CAPS3't you agree with my opinion? Computers are a great source of information. Unlike books, which you must find and buy, there is an enormous amount of information just a mouse click away! With computers, you can learn about far away places and people without having to visit or talk to them. Let me compare this to a book. Let's say you wanted to do research on @PERSON1. You would have to go to the library and search for a book about him. And what would you do if you couldn't find one about him? With a computer, you could type ""@CAPS2 of @PERSON1"" into a search engine and receive of information in under a minute! I love saving time, and computers help me do that. They also augment the information I use. Another astounding development in computer technology is that you can talk to other, no matter where their location is. Email is extremely faster than writing a letter. having to pay to travel. Who @CAPS3't like that? Computers are very convenient. You can surf the internet, talk to people, and much more from the comfort of your bedroom. There are jobs that you can do from home on a computer. No need to go anywhere to work. My uncle is one of those people. He is s stockbroker, and operates his whole job from the computer in his house. It is a convenient and a well-paying job. I asked him what he thought of his job. He said, ""I love my job because I can work when I want to work, and from the comfort of my home."" @CAPS3't you want to have his job? I would most definitely. In conclusion, computers are very beneficial to us. Did you know computers were first invented by @ORGANIZATION1 to perform calculations that were very long? Look at what they have evolved into @DATE1. They bring us information at amazing speeds. They let us talk to people all over the world. They are very convenient. These are major benefits to society, and everybody should embrace computers. In a world where information and communication are key, computers have truly revolutionized the way we live our lives."
928	930	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people due to their ability to facilitate communication, learning, and coordination. One of the key benefits is the way computers enable individuals to interact with others, whether it be with distant friends or new acquaintances. This can be especially valuable for keeping in touch with loved ones and monitoring their well-being. Furthermore, computers offer opportunities for expanding one's social circle and forming new connections. In terms of learning, computers provide a wealth of educational resources for both children and adults. They can help teach new concepts, vocabulary, and skills, contributing to personal growth and development. Additionally, using a computer can enhance physical coordination, such as improving typing skills and posture. Overall, while some may argue against the benefits of computers, it is clear that they play a valuable role in enriching people's lives through communication, learning, and physical well-being.
929	931	1	3	I think computers have both positive and negative impacts on people. Some individuals spend excessive amounts of time playing games and being inactive, which can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. However, others utilize computers for necessary tasks, such as work or school-related activities. Many professions now require computer usage, like banking, where employees rely on technology throughout the day. Similarly, students often rely on computers for research, typing reports, and accessing information online. While some may argue that people spend too much time on computers, it is undeniable that technology plays a crucial role in our modern lives. Personally, I appreciate the convenience of computers, especially for staying connected with family and friends in distant locations like @LOCATION1. In conclusion, while excessive computer use can have negative consequences, it is undeniable that computers serve important functions for many individuals in today's society.
930	932	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and kids of all ages in our society, the excessive focus on the latest technology, particularly computers, is negatively impacting our lives. We need to break free from this habit and engage in different activities that allow us to connect with nature, exercise, and spend quality time with friends and family.   Many people are spending an excessive amount of time glued to their computer screens, missing out on the beauty of nature and the joy of physical activities. It's essential to step away from the virtual world and immerse ourselves in the wonders of the natural world.   By reducing our reliance on computers and embracing outdoor activities, we can improve our overall well-being and lead healthier, more fulfilling lives. The sedentary lifestyle encouraged by excessive computer use has contributed to a concerning rise in obesity rates, highlighting the need for a shift towards more active pursuits.   Furthermore, the impact of technology on family relationships is also significant, with many individuals becoming isolated and disconnected from their loved ones due to excessive screen time. It's crucial to prioritize face-to-face interactions and meaningful connections with family members, rather than allowing technology to dictate our relationships.   In conclusion, while computers and technology have their benefits, it's important to strike a balance and not let them dominate our lives. Let's make a conscious effort to unplug, go outside, and enjoy all that nature has to offer. By doing so, we can lead happier, healthier lives and strengthen our bonds with those we hold dear.
931	933	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers are detrimental to society for several reasons. Firstly, they lead to a lack of quality time spent with family members. Many individuals, including myself, find themselves glued to screens for extended periods, neglecting opportunities to engage in meaningful interactions with loved ones. Additionally, the use of instant messaging platforms often results in poor spelling habits. It is common for students to rely on abbreviations and make spelling errors, affecting their academic performance. Lastly, computers can be highly distracting, especially when trying to focus on tasks like homework. The temptation to browse the internet or engage in non-educational activities can hinder productivity and learning. In summary, the negative impact of computers on family time, spelling skills, and concentration underscores their detrimental effects on society. I hope you share my concerns on this matter.
932	934	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I strongly believe computers have positive effects on people and society. My reasons are that you can learn and find new information on anything, talk to people far away, and develop skills for the future.   Firstly, the internet allows for easy access to a wealth of information, making learning and research more convenient. Search engines like Google and Yahoo provide a platform for gathering facts and data for various purposes, such as school projects or personal interests. This accessibility to information has sparked a greater interest in learning among individuals, especially children.  Secondly, computers enable communication with individuals who are geographically distant. Through various online platforms, such as video chat services, staying connected with friends and family members is easier and more cost-effective. This not only fosters relationships but also reduces the need for expensive long-distance calls.  Lastly, the skills acquired through computer use are essential for success in the modern world. Many professions require computer proficiency, and familiarity with technology is becoming increasingly important. Whether for academic purposes or professional development, computer skills are indispensable for navigating the digital age.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in enhancing knowledge, facilitating communication, and preparing individuals for the demands of a technology-driven society. Embracing the positive impact of computers can lead to personal growth and societal advancement.
933	935	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, but are they really as great as they seem? While they offer numerous benefits, such as easy access to information and communication with others, they also come with their downsides. One major concern is the amount of time people, especially kids, spend on computers, which can lead to various negative consequences.  Many individuals, young and old, find themselves getting absorbed in various online activities, such as social media and video streaming, to the point where they neglect other important aspects of their lives. For example, students may procrastinate on their homework or lose sleep due to excessive computer use. This not only affects their academic performance but also their overall well-being.  Moreover, the dangers of the online world cannot be overlooked. Personal information can easily be accessed and misused by malicious individuals, posing a threat to one's privacy and safety. Even seemingly harmless actions, like sharing photos online, can inadvertently reveal sensitive details that could be exploited by strangers.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can create rifts within families, with members vying for screen time instead of spending quality time together. Sibling rivalry over computer usage is not uncommon, leading to conflicts and discord within households. This not only hampers familial relationships but also contributes to a disconnect in real-life interactions.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is crucial to acknowledge and address the negative impacts they can have on individuals and society as a whole. Finding a balance between utilizing technology for its advantages and maintaining a healthy offline life is essential. As we navigate the digital age, it is important to be mindful of the ways in which excessive computer use can hinder personal growth, jeopardize safety, and strain relationships.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
934	936	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 news paper, I think computers are a mixed blessing. On one hand, they can keep people isolated indoors for long periods, leading to a lack of social interaction and physical activity. However, computers also provide valuable benefits such as allowing people to connect with distant family members, access important information about events, and facilitate learning in schools.  For instance, without computers, it would be challenging for students to complete their homework or for teachers to efficiently manage their classroom activities. Computers are essential tools for research, communication, and collaboration in the modern educational environment.  On the downside, excessive use of computers, especially for activities like gaming, can lead to addiction and unhealthy habits. I have seen a friend who became so engrossed in video games that he neglected his social life and family interactions. Thankfully, his parents took steps to limit his screen time and encourage him to engage in outdoor activities with friends.  In conclusion, while computers have both positive and negative aspects, it is crucial for individuals to maintain a balance in their usage to ensure a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. Finding a middle ground between the benefits and drawbacks of technology is key to harnessing its potential for personal growth and well-being.
935	937	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, more and more people in our proud and courageous country of @LOCATION1 have been increasingly dependent on computers. While computers were initially created to assist with tasks such as typing, research, and financial management, the excessive use of these devices has led to negative consequences on our society.  One significant impact of excessive computer use is the decline in physical activity, particularly among our youth. Many children are spending countless hours in front of screens, neglecting opportunities for exercise and outdoor play. This sedentary lifestyle has contributed to a rise in obesity rates and other health issues among young individuals. Without regular physical activity, children are missing out on crucial opportunities to develop healthy habits and maintain their overall well-being.  Furthermore, the overreliance on computers has also resulted in a decline in face-to-face interactions with family and friends. Instead of engaging in real-life social interactions, individuals are turning to virtual communication, which can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnect from their loved ones. Building and maintaining strong relationships require time and effort, which can be compromised by excessive computer use.  It is essential for us to recognize the negative consequences of computer dependency and strive to find a balance in our usage. By prioritizing physical activity, spending time in nature, and nurturing our relationships with family and friends, we can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives. Let us not allow the convenience of technology to overshadow the importance of maintaining our well-being and connections with those around us.  Thank you for considering these important issues, and I urge you to raise awareness about the impact of excessive computer use on our society. Together, we can work towards a more balanced and harmonious relationship with technology.
936	938	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a child of the tech generation, or the generation in which technology has taken on a new meaning. That meaning is life. Our life revolves around technology in general as the @LOCATION3 revolves around the sun. The chief technological preference, computers, is greatly beneficial, arenít as bad as many people speculate, and help us live and prosper in this struggling world. Look, if you want to roast computers then by all means, roast away. But if you do so without first regarding all the angles of them, then you, my friend, have absolutely no standing on the situation. You could say that they are a nuisance but could never have used aho. You could argue that they can be used to detonate bombs, but, let's be practical, how many normal people actually wake up and point out the dreariness of life and then type in a command to detonate a bomb? A serious benefit you have obviously chosen to overlook is the invaluable information it aptly places in front of you on a @NUM1 inch screen. You can read book reviews, read books, bag things, and get the cutting-edge news you want, to name just a meager amount of possible strengths. Furthermore, not everything that you speculate as bad has to be bad just because you say it so. When you think of @CAPS3. Do you always think about vulgar, inappropriate pictures, and illegal images? That's funny because @CAPS3 keeps family in touch, gives people things to do, and keeps friends in different states on the same server. Youtube is not all swearing and bad videos. My family casts actors for shows, and one way they know what an actor is capable of is by going to their channel and looking at the videos that they have created. My mother actually contacts actors in videos to see if they want to become professionals. That is the business, finding talent where it is seldom found. Lastly, did you even think about the fact that computers are used to start companies and saves lives? You probably didn't even know that, from a computer, astrologists monitor images of the universe captured by the Hubble Space Carrier meteorologists track cloud formations from satellites using a computer. Maybe you didn't choose to say that surgeons can dictate operations from their office in @LOCATION1 on a patient in @LOCATION2? You didn't even say that seismologists use computers to track the shifting of the tectonic plates to see where the epicenter of a major earthquake is? You just didn't know. So, let's face it, computers are important. You probably used to do what little research you did on them. In fact, pardon me. You probably didn't do the research in the first place, instead pointing fingers at the innocent. Smooth move, buddy.  Computers have revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate in today's world. From providing valuable information at our fingertips to enabling life-saving operations and groundbreaking scientific discoveries, the importance of computers cannot be overstated. So before dismissing them as mere nuisances, consider the countless ways in which they enhance our lives and contribute to the progress of society.
937	939	1	3	I agree that having a computer can be beneficial in many ways. It allows for easy access to information, communication with others, and organization of important data. However, it is important to use it in moderation to prevent negative effects such as eye strain and sleep deprivation. Finding a balance between using a computer for productivity and relaxation is key to maximizing its benefits while maintaining overall well-being. In conclusion, while computers offer numerous advantages, it is essential to be mindful of how much time is spent on them to avoid potential drawbacks.
938	940	1	3	Dear local newspaper,   I disagree with the idea of giving kids access to computers because it can lead to negative behavior such as being rude, not listening, being loud, and neglecting homework. When children are on the computer, they can be exposed to inappropriate content and dangerous information that may influence their behavior. Additionally, being engrossed in the computer can make children disrespectful and unresponsive to their parents' instructions. The constant distraction of the computer can also prevent children from focusing on their schoolwork and lead to academic neglect.   Therefore, I believe that limiting children's access to computers is essential in promoting positive behavior and academic success. Parents should monitor and control their children's computer usage to prevent negative consequences. It is crucial for society to recognize the potential harm that excessive computer use can have on children and take appropriate measures to address this issue.   In conclusion, the negative effects of unlimited computer access on children's behavior and academic performance highlight the importance of setting boundaries and restrictions on computer usage. By doing so, we can ensure that children develop healthy habits and prioritize their responsibilities.

Computers can most certainly improve our society. In conclusion, the integration of computers into our society has proven to be essential for communication, education, and fostering a sense of balance among individuals."
940	942	1	3	"Dear local newspaper committee,  I am writing to address the significant issue surrounding computer use, which presents a dilemma with both positive and negative aspects. In my assessment, while computers offer benefits, the drawbacks are more pronounced. One of the primary concerns is the addictive nature of computer usage, leading to a decrease in physical activity and a negative impact on social interactions.  The allure of social media platforms, such as ""@CAPS1,"" can be particularly captivating, drawing individuals away from important tasks like homework. This diversion not only hampers productivity but also contributes to the addictive quality of computers. Moreover, online gaming further fuels this addiction, consuming valuable time that could be better spent on physical exercise.  The sedentary nature of prolonged computer use has detrimental effects on health, with studies indicating an increase in weight gain among individuals who spend excessive time in front of screens. This unhealthy habit not only jeopardizes physical well-being but also detracts from opportunities for regular exercise and fitness.  Additionally, the reliance on computers for social interaction can lead to a decline in real-world relationships. By prioritizing virtual connections over face-to-face communication, individuals risk alienating themselves from friends and damaging their social environment. The addictive nature of computers exacerbates this issue, creating a barrier to meaningful human connections.  In conclusion, while computers may offer convenience and utility in certain contexts, the pervasive addictive tendencies associated with their use pose significant risks to health and social well-being. It is crucial to recognize the detrimental effects of excessive computer use and prioritize activities that promote physical fitness and meaningful interactions with others. Ultimately, striking a balance between technology and real-world engagement is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and thriving social relationships.  Thank you for considering these concerns regarding computer use in our community.  Sincerely, [Your Name]"

Whether it's for academic purposes or professional endeavors, the convenience and efficiency that a computer provides are unmatched.  Education, in particular, stands to benefit greatly from the use of computers. With access to a vast repository of information online, students can easily conduct research and gather data for their projects and assignments. This not only saves time but also enables them to delve deeper into a topic without the constraints of traditional resources like books and encyclopedias. Moreover, the ability to type and organize schoolwork on a computer streamlines the process, allowing students to focus on enhancing their learning experience.  Furthermore, a computer can be a source of income for individuals looking to start an online business. By leveraging the power of the internet, one can establish and run a business from the comfort of their own home, eliminating the need for physical storefronts and reducing overhead costs. Additionally, the convenience of online shopping not only saves time but also money on transportation expenses, making financial management easier and more efficient.

942	944	1	3	Dear @CAPS1,  I believe the increasing use of computers is driven by the practical benefits they offer in today's world. With the rise of job losses and economic uncertainty, having computer skills can be crucial in finding employment opportunities. Additionally, the escalating prices of cars make online shopping for vehicles a cost-effective option for many. Furthermore, the desire to travel to distant destinations like @CAPS2 or @LOCATION1 motivates people to search for accommodations and activities online. In the realm of education, parents can explore alternative schooling options such as @CAPS4, cap pre, classicle, brizzal, to ensure their children receive a quality education. Embracing technology not only broadens one's horizons but also facilitates learning and access to essential services. By utilizing computers, individuals can navigate through various aspects of life more efficiently and effectively.
943	945	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people for several reasons. Firstly, they enable individuals to learn about distant places, facilitating travel planning and language acquisition. Additionally, computers facilitate online communication, allowing for family connections and social interactions. Moreover, computers can assist in job searching and career advancement. Overall, computers serve as valuable tools that enhance various aspects of people's lives.
944	946	1	3	According to the government, 90% of individuals spend 4 hours or more on a computer a day. A study reveals that people are not getting sufficient exercise, neglecting time with family, and failing to enjoy their lives. With the increasing use of computers, individuals are leading sedentary lifestyles, resulting in a rise in obesity rates. For example, a formerly fit individual became obese after spending excessive time on the computer and consuming junk food. Lack of physical activity led to failure in making the school baseball team. Similarly, people are sacrificing quality time with family due to excessive computer use. A poignant instance is a father missing his child's crucial championship game because of being engrossed in computer activities. This detachment from personal relationships can lead to regrets and missed moments. Furthermore, individuals are missing out on activities they once enjoyed, like playing basketball with friends, due to prioritizing computer usage. This shift can impact one's happiness and overall satisfaction with life. It is crucial to find a balance between technology and real-world experiences to lead a fulfilling life. Ultimately, it is essential to prioritize physical activity, quality time with loved ones, and engaging in activities that bring joy, rather than being consumed by computer use.
945	947	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has an essay due on plants for science tomorrow. She was absent @DATE1 and didn't know about it. If she had a computer, she could go on to the website and check, but she doesn't. The town took them away. Another student, @LOCATION1, is working on the same essay.

Another example is that public look up information about the world on my computer. When many heard about earthquake in @LOCATION2, they could pull up information within seconds. This led to many bake sales and fund raisers. Lastly, when kids miss their favorite @CAPS2 shows one day, they can just look it up the next day to get caught up. This is a big part of teenager life. Society needs computers in order to look up crucial information. Many people also use the internet for communication purposes. I know that in my family ""e-mail"" is what makes it all work.

Another mode of communication is ""facebook"". Any time my friends and I have a question about anything anything that happened that day. We will ask each other on this website.

Additionally, computers enable efficient completion of homework tasks by providing quick access to a wealth of information without the need to visit a physical library.

Communication engineers emphasize the importance of online communication, especially for maintaining relationships with distant relatives. By utilizing platforms like Facebook, individuals can feel as though their loved ones are just a click away, fostering meaningful connections despite geographical barriers.

Also, they help people from adults years out of college to teenagers in high school communicate with their friends. Therefore, computers help us all in some little way and makes life easier and more fun. To begin with computers helps us expand our knowledge. It us helps us look up facts or recent news quickly.

A family member could be watching a funny on youtube or @ORGANIZATION1 and could think its so funny that they want their whole family to see it you. In addition, stores sell clothes online now so mother and daugther can sit down together and shop without leaving the house. Computers bring my family together by we rent movies from @LOCATION1 on the computer. It brings us together when choose and pick which movie to rent. Also, it brings us together to have a family movie night.

Another way computers are beneficial is they bring everyone together. There are many ways communicate on the computer these days. There is facebook, twitter, email, aim, and many more.

I believe that the act of computers overwhelming a person's life should be with in a serious manner. Exersizing, an essential part of anyone's life, since the development of the internet forty years ago, the average @CAPS1 or body mass inter of an average person has increased fifteen percent! This is no coinfidence, computers are causing more and more people to challenge themselves to nex that extra mile, or swim that extra lap, and instead so home and play on their computers. This not only is hurting peoples' weights, but excersize equipment store owners are having to close their shops, because less and less people are coming into work out, or excersize like they should everyday! Our children are also being affected by this addicting sensation, childhood obesity is one of the main effects on children, because when they get heard playing on these they as well stop excersizing, and play videogames . The average amount of people who went to @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 every year was around @NUM1, but since the invention of the computer that the attendance dropped to a more @NUM2 people every year. Less and less people are to enjoy a fresh @DATE1 and instead spend it indoors on their country. This is hurting people as well as the wildlife around them. The rates of squirrels to people in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was @NUM3 in @DATE2, the year the computer has invented. But a mere ten years later, the changed so now their are squirrels! This is because now that they less people feeling less squirrels live in the @CAPS3 @CAPS3, went live in the to find food by themselves. Tour guides who worked in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, we being fired, due to less people wanting a tour, so less tour guides are needed. Families are seeing that the more a person plays on a computer, the less time that person is going to spend talking to @LOCATION1, or @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Scientists held to have three different people spend an hour reading a book, another spend an hour on a computer, and three hours on a computer to see who could stay in a conversation with their mother the longest. The first person spent twenty minutes on the phone with their mother, the second only ten minutes, and the last, a mere five minutes. This shows that the mere time spent on a computer, the less interactions are held between son and mom, an important relationship in any one's life. Mother's worry that the next time they have a barbeque, @PERSON1 won't be in his room, playing on his computer like last time. @PERSON2 was chosen to conduct an experiment on @PERSON2 had three freinds @CAPS6, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. They were asked to spend an hour on the computer before meeting up for lunch. The results were alarming as their interaction was significantly reduced, with more focus on their devices rather than each other. This highlights the negative impact of excessive computer use on social relationships. In conclusion, it is essential for individuals to balance their computer usage with real-life interactions and activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle and relationships.
953	955	1	3	I walked outside to get the mail and newspaper. I saw the front page talking about computer. An article said, too much computer using. I though there wasn't going to sell more computer but, it said that people are using computers and are not exercising much. I think that people are not going to have a hard time quitting to use their computer. I had a friend that didn't know how to use the computer. He past his hour playing outside. In the @DATE1 he tries out for @CAPS1 baseball. He is a very good athlete. He does grate in school too. Others people without a gob are not looking for something 'to do they are at the computer everyday. When they should be doing work around and inside the house. Peoples with computers shouldn't be all day like these friend my friend haves is using his computer everytime he comes from school. He don't do his homework on time. Every time he doesn't want to go out and exercise his mind or get a little bit of sun he sometimes don't eat so he should give his brain a rest and do physical things that will help them. Other person such as the computer workers should write a note to people with computer saying how computer can be addicted to people and maybe realize how much often they should use their computer and was using it to go to get information and to collage. She started to use the computer to chat with people and ended up using the computer a lot and not going to collage. I believe that computers are an major impact on people. People should be going about to have fun get sunlight not staying at the computer all the time. Many adults don't use the computer is most the teens and kids. People should go to the gym and build strong muscles. They should stay away from computer for a time. Agains computer would be the right thing to do.  People need to find a balance between using the computer and engaging in physical activities. It is important to prioritize exercise and outdoor activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle. By reducing excessive computer usage, individuals can focus on physical well-being and overall health. It is crucial to limit screen time and incorporate exercise into daily routines for a balanced and fulfilling life.
954	956	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They offer a wide range of benefits, such as providing online education opportunities for those who may not have access to traditional classrooms. For example, single mothers can earn diplomas and degrees by taking online classes, while others can learn new languages like English. Computers also serve as a valuable resource for research and learning, offering a wealth of information on various topics. Additionally, they enable communication with teachers and access to weather forecasts and news updates.  In essence, computers are like helpful robots that assist us in numerous ways, from typing reports to playing educational games. They open up a world of possibilities, allowing us to explore different subjects and connect with others. Overall, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people by enhancing education, communication, and access to information.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
955	957	1	3	"Dear Local @CAPS1,  I am delighted to express my support for the positive impact that computers have on people. In today's digital age, computers play a crucial role in facilitating communication, enabling research, and providing essential information such as directions to various places.  One significant advantage of computers is the ability to communicate with family and friends, even over long distances. For instance, when my friend had to move to @LOCATION1, we were able to stay connected through emails, social media platforms like @CAPS2, and messaging apps like @CAPS3. This allowed us to maintain our friendship despite the physical distance between us.  Moreover, computers are invaluable tools for conducting research. For example, when studying a book like ""My Brother @CAPS5 Is Dead,"" I could easily access additional information and resources online to deepen my understanding of the text. Without the convenience of a computer, such in-depth research would have been much more challenging and time-consuming.  Furthermore, computers provide essential information such as directions to unfamiliar places. In a situation where I needed to attend a friend's birthday party at an unknown location, I was able to quickly find and print out detailed directions online. This not only saved time but also ensured that I reached the destination without any hassle.  While some may argue that computers can lead to harmful content and addiction, I believe that when used responsibly, they offer numerous benefits for communication, research, and accessing information.  In conclusion, computers have undoubtedly made a positive impact on people's lives by enhancing communication, facilitating research, and providing valuable information. Thank you for considering these points in support of the benefits of technology in our daily lives.  Sincerely, [Your Name]"
956	958	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things? Instead of going on the computer, you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. This is why you need to spend less time on the computer. Exercise is important for your body, and computers are not. You can get some weights and exercise in your room. A run on the beach doesn't sound bad either. Just by doing that, you lose a lot of weight and avoid gaining weight by sitting on the computer. So, go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! Computers also prevent you from getting fresh air and playing outside. When you are outside, you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere on the computer. You don't even have to play outside; you can just walk with someone or sit on the grass and talk. The computer prevents you from doing all these fun activities outside. Spending time with your family is a significant activity that your computer is preventing you from doing. You are on the computer for an hour, and your family is having a barbecue. When you finally get off the computer, you realize that spending time with them is much more fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. This is why computers are a distraction for everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. You can use the computer, but just don't stay on for too long because you are missing out on the fun.
957	959	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the affects of computers is that while there are good benefits that come out or them, I believe more strongly that negative issues and situation arise from computers and that they affect people with greater impact in a not so good way. @CAPS1 three main reason as to why I think there are more negative impacts than positive and constructive impacts from computers are @CAPS2-bullying is a very big issue. Also there are many 'scams' and 'cons' out there on the @CAPS9. Lastly there is a lot of mis-leading or wrong information online. Going back to @CAPS1 first reason, ""@CAPS2-bullying."" @CAPS2-bullying can be derined as rude or nasty teasing over the @CAPS9. On social networking websites such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and so on. '@CAPS2-bullying' can include teasing, hurtful comments horrible name-calling and fowl language. It is much more effective than regular bullying, such as ""Give me your lunch money"", because once you put words out on the @CAPS9, you can never take them back, no matter how hard you try. '@CAPS2-bullying' is the new generation of mean. Secondly, scamming and cons come out of the @CAPS9/computers. When purchasing items online, you never really know what your going to get. @CAPS1 father was scammed, or connect on the @CAPS9. He was looking on what seemed like a very official site to purchase a big boat. He drove all the way to @LOCATION1 to get it. He took it out on the water in @LOCATION2, at our @DATE1 home, and the engine and motor were broken. That is what can happen when buying something off of the @CAPS9. Lastly, mis-information can be another negative impact from computers. When researching a topic, you should stick to the library, it @MONTH1 sound old-fashioned and slow, but when you research on the @CAPS9, you need to remember anybody can put or post anything, even mis-leading or untrue statements and 'information' online. Researching topics is not the only way to get false information. People can pretend to be who they are not in real-life, which is why ananymous chat-rooms and instant messaging are dangerous and un-reliable. As a conclusion, the @CAPS9 basically has stronger negative impacts and consequences than positive ones. Because @CAPS2 bullying, scamming or conning and mis-information are all negative factors of the @CAPS9, and out-wiegh the positives.  In summary, the negative impacts of computers, including bullying, scams, and misinformation, outweigh the positive aspects. It is essential to be cautious and aware of the potential dangers and pitfalls associated with using computers and the internet."
958	960	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  Computers are not necessarily a benefit for everyone in society. One of the main drawbacks is the excessive amount of time that people spend on them. Many individuals prioritize screen time over outdoor activities like riding bikes or taking walks, which can have negative implications for physical health and social interaction.  Moreover, the high cost of owning a computer is a significant barrier for many people. A basic computer can be quite expensive, and the additional costs of internet access and software can quickly add up. This financial burden can exclude certain individuals, particularly those from lower-income households, from accessing the benefits of technology.  Furthermore, not everyone has the necessary knowledge or skills to effectively use a computer. Older adults, in particular, may struggle with technology due to a lack of exposure or training. This digital divide can further marginalize certain segments of the population and hinder their ability to fully participate in an increasingly technology-driven world.  In conclusion, while computers can offer numerous advantages, it is important to recognize the limitations and challenges that they present for many individuals. It is crucial to address issues of affordability, digital literacy, and screen time management to ensure that technology truly benefits all members of society.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
959	961	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, Have you ever found yourself thinking about the computer, or wishing you were on it? I heard you were looking to see if computers have negative or positive effects on society. I feel that it is a negative effect because of less time exercising, little time with family or friends, and how easy it is to become addicted to it. Exercising is crucial for a healthy body and mind, yet many people struggle to find time for it. Instead of using free time to exercise, they may end up spending hours on social media platforms like Facebook. Additionally, computer maintenance can also take away time that could be spent on physical activity. Just recently, my computer got a virus and the time it took to fix it could have been used for exercising. Obesity is a significant concern as well, as sitting in front of a computer for long periods can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle. Spending quality time with loved ones is important, and computers can often distract individuals from meaningful interactions with family and friends. It is essential to maintain a balance between screen time and real-world connections to preserve social relationships. Addiction to computers is a serious issue that can impact various aspects of life. Our dependence on technology has made us reliant on devices for simple tasks, such as navigation. If these devices malfunction, we may struggle to perform basic skills like reading a map. Moreover, the shift towards digital communication has affected traditional skills like handwriting, with many individuals now typing instead of writing. This reliance on technology can lead to a loss of essential abilities that were once commonplace. In conclusion, the negative effects of computers on society, such as reduced physical activity, strained relationships, and potential addiction, highlight the importance of moderation and balance in our interactions with technology.
960	962	1	3	To whom it may concern, I think computers are a good thing. It is good because you get to learn about foreign places, keep in touch with family and friends, and it is good entertainment. First, computers are great for learning about foreign places. You can research a place, look at pictures, and find the best places to visit or stay. For example, when I had to do a report on a state I've never been to, I used the computer to gather accurate and up-to-date information. Additionally, computers help you stay connected with loved ones. Websites like Facebook, AIM, and MySpace allow you to share photos and communicate with friends and family, even those who are far away. Lastly, computers provide entertainment by allowing you to watch concerts, movies, and even check the news and weather. They offer a convenient way to access a variety of information and content. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in our lives by offering valuable resources for learning, communication, and entertainment.
961	963	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that people do spend a lot of time on computers, especially teenagers. From personal experience and a survey conducted in @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class, it is evident that many teens are spending excessive amounts of time on the computer. Some use it for homework or communication, while others become addicted to social media platforms like @CAPS1, neglecting outdoor activities and sports.   In my own case, I found myself constantly on the computer, missing out on quality time with family and friends. Although I eventually deleted my @CAPS1 account, I still feel a lingering addiction to technology, like many others who are constantly listening to music, chatting with friends, or checking emails.   The survey in @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class revealed that a significant percentage of students spend hours on the computer daily, with a high number admitting to being addicted. This trend is not limited to a specific age group but affects people of all ages. It is crucial for parents to monitor and limit their children's screen time to prevent excessive computer usage.  In conclusion, the prevalence of computer addiction among teenagers is a concerning issue that requires attention. By recognizing the signs of addiction and taking steps to reduce screen time, individuals can maintain a healthy balance between technology use and real-world interactions.
962	964	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 Have you ever wondered how much the world wide web has to offer? I would definitely agree that computers have a beneficial effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and they give people the chance to reconnect with new people. The internet has so much to offer and is absolutely beneficial. Studies done by @PERSON1, a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1, stated that @PERCENT1 of people who are on the computer typing have better hand-eye coordination than those who do not. You could be improving your coordination and not even know it! Intelligent people would agree that being on the computer is very helpful to you. There are many computer games out there that require quick reactions and call for fast reflexes and hand-eye coordination. Since @CAPS2 been on the computer more, I have noticed that my reaction time off this block has shockingly improved! Yes, I know that some people should get outside and exercise, but you can exercise and improve your hand-eye coordination, either way you can go wrong. As the massive sits in space like high take fascinating worlds it the computers. The technology of computers helps us learn about far away places. Kevin, a scientist, stated that @PERCENT2 of our knowledge about space comes from computers! For example, think about Google Earth; it allows the human eye to see clear pictures of anywhere in the world! Without computers, we would lack a lot of knowledge about the wonderful world around us. By using high-tech computers, we can learn about life outside, like space, and other galaxies. Did you know that @NUM1 of the population uses the computer to talk and reconnect with friends and family? I know I do! People shouldn't be on the computer all the time, but it's a great way to stay in touch with people. Websites like Skype and Oovoo allow you to chat with others online. Friendly, educated people agree that this is a good way to catch up with old friends from high school or even way back to grade school. Another great aspect of online communication is that long-lasting friendships can be created. Newly explained, now they are not only online but have gotten so close they even meet in person! Personally, I know that I go to @DATE1 camp every year and make new friends. Internet websites like Facebook have helped me keep in touch with them. The time has come to decide that using computers would definitely be a wise choice. Without a doubt, it will certainly help you improve hand-eye coordination and keep you connected with people. Most importantly, it gives people the ability to learn about the wonders of far away places. So don't make the wrong choice, appreciate and use all that computers have to offer.
963	965	1	3	"Dear newspaper, Do you want to learn good hand-eye coordination? Do you want to have the ability to learn about faraway places? And do you want to talk online with other people? If you said yes to all of these questions then using a computer is the way to go! While using a computer, you can do many things. You can look up a healthy recipe for your family or find a good relaxing place to do your daily yoga. Although some people say that using a computer cuts down your time for exercising and enjoying nature, it really doesn't. A recent poll conducted at Planet Fitness in Newington showed that 70% of the exercising people discovered Planet Fitness through the internet. The Director of the Department of Health and Wellness mentioned, ""20% of my customers take online courses for exercising at home so that they don't have to be in public."" I know it seems lazy to not go to a gym, but some people are terrified about what others think of them. Who wouldn't want to exercise in the warm comforts of their own home and not have to go to a sweaty old gym? All right-minded people would choose to stay at home and exercise from their computer. So, why go to a sweaty old gym when you can stay at your beautiful, clean home with the internet? Imagine, as soon as you get up well-rested, instead of going to a yucky gym, you can stay home and enjoy a relaxing workout in the comfort of your own space. Certainly, you care about your nose and would like to smell a nice, warm apple, right? So, don't go to a gym, stay at home, and enjoy your day with the internet! I say stay at home and love your internet!"
964	966	1	3	Dear the daily newspaper crew,   I have seen some of your own disagree about using computers. I for one believe that using a computer really isn't that bad. For example, the computer is actually good for education. Many use them to create images of things for school projects or science fair projects. I use these machines to play video games to cure my boredom like most young teens and children do. Unlike most people, I don't stay on it forever. I usually play for a couple of hours.  There are some downsides to having a computer in the house. For one, the machines use up a lot of energy in the house, making the electric bill rise. On some websites, there are people who try to be stalkers, like the website MySpace and Twitter. But on the bright side, those who try to be stalkers usually instantly get caught and put in jail.  Computers actually have a positive effect on the mind and movements. For example, children who have computers learn how to fly a kite or play catch for themselves with their parents watching, and they learn hand-eye coordination. Many children who play sports that have computers actually manage to catch a ball faster than usual.  So you see, computers are not that bad. Please think of what will happen to children if computers are banned. In conclusion, while there are some drawbacks to using computers, the benefits they provide in education, entertainment, and cognitive development far outweigh the negatives. It is important to consider the positive impact computers can have on children and not simply focus on the potential risks.   Thank you for considering my perspective.
965	967	1	3	"I Believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are a relatively new invention, they have become very popular. Computers allow people to talk online with each other. They also allow students to complete homework assignments and important projects. Computers also allow people to store important files and pictures in places that won't get lost. Computers are helpful in so many ways, but these are just a few. Computers allow people online. whether it's through email, instant messaging, or a video chat, computers replace old and outdated ways of communication. For example, instead of writing a letter to someone, mailing it to them, and having to wait two days for them to receive it, email them! Obtain an email address, type a message, and click send. They will receive the message instantly, and even reply soon enough. The president of the organization, says, ""Computers are an important part of technology. People use them every day."" Using them every day doesn't mean just for fun. They also help with work. Three out of four adults who used computers say that they help them with their work and social status. Computers are a part of everyday life, and they can help with almost anything. Computers allow students to finish homework and projects quite fast. Instead of hand-writing that four-page essay on textbooks and use the internet for finding information. Computers also allow students to email teachers in case they missed classes and assignments. A student at who had missed quite a few days of school, says, ""All I had to do was email my teachers, and they sent me the homework assignment. I missed it was that easy."" is not the only one who agrees that computers are a big help. Millions of kids & adults agree. Computers not only let students write reports; they also allow them to save them for future uses. They also save important files and precious pictures. Everyone hates it when their camera or video camera breaks, and all their precious and wonderful memories are gone. Well, just save them to the computer, and they're there forever!  out of people who store their pictures in a computer agrees this is the best way to do it. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people. They allow people to talk online. do homework & projects, and store important files. I can assume that everyone agrees with me that computers are an important part of everyday life. We just wouldn't be the world we are without them."
966	968	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I think computers are a great tool for everyone if they use it right. Here are my reasons why. First of all, I think computers are good because news travels quickly. Using the internet, world-changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds. It is great for staying in the loop and reading about things you need to know. This reminds me of the time when a massive earthquake hit @LOCATION2 and traumatized its citizens. Within moments of the accident, it was already circling the internet. This brought mass attention to @LOCATION2, which caused many people to donate needed items.  Secondly, the computer is also good for researching topics for school and common interests. If you need facts for a school project, you can easily search what you need through the internet's wide variety of search engines. You will be able to pinpoint exactly what you are looking for and also look up things that interest you. If you have a favorite sports team, band, or are interested in a famous figure, you have tons of information on them at your disposal. You can do all of this within the privacy of your own home, so you can remain as secret as a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. This reminds me of the time when one of my idols died. Within seconds of hearing the tragic news, I was able to search the topic and get an endless euphoria of information regarding his death.  Finally, you can chat with someone from around the world if you wanted to! Using social networking sites like Facebook and Myspace, you can connect with your friends and chat with them for hours on end. You can also enter chat rooms with people who share a common interest with you. Just like how I talk to people about a band we both love. I believe access to news, research, and staying in touch with your friends is without a doubt the best reasons to use a computer. What are you waiting for? Get one!  In conclusion, computers are indeed a valuable tool for communication, research, and staying informed. With the internet at our fingertips, we can connect with others, access a wealth of information, and keep up to date with the latest news. Embracing technology can truly enhance our lives in countless ways.
967	969	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to share my perspective on the impact of computers on individuals. I disagree with the notion that people are spending excessive amounts of time on their computers. One of my reasons for this disagreement is the issue of safety. Online communication, while convenient, can be risky as individuals may unknowingly share personal information with strangers, leading to potential dangers such as online predators. Moreover, excessive computer usage can lead to addiction. Some individuals become engrossed in activities like violent video games, which can blur the lines between virtual and real-life actions, potentially resulting in harmful consequences. Additionally, prolonged computer use can have adverse effects on one's health, leading to issues like obesity and lack of social interaction. In conclusion, I believe that while computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential for individuals to use them responsibly to avoid potential pitfalls. Thank you for considering my perspective.
968	970	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @DATE1's society has seen significant changes over the past twenty years, especially with the advancement of technology. The accessibility of the internet through smartphones has brought people together, expanded their knowledge, and kept many workers in various industries sharp and prepared for their tasks. While some may argue against the benefits of technology, I believe it plays a crucial role in pushing us forward and away from ignorance.  For instance, construction workers face challenges during off-seasons when they cannot be on-site working. However, with the development of virtual training programs for crane operators, they can maintain their skills and readiness even when they are not physically operating machinery. This not only helps them stay sharp but also prevents potential accidents on construction sites.  Moreover, personal endeavors such as learning a new language have also been made easier with technology. The internet provides access to language learning resources, study tips from native speakers, and cultural information that would have been difficult to obtain without a computer. This not only makes learning enjoyable but also cost-effective for those on a budget.  Additionally, technology has revolutionized how we connect with our loved ones, especially for those who are far away. Social networks and instant messaging have made it easier and more affordable to stay in touch with family members across the globe, bridging the distance and making it feel like they are right beside us.  In conclusion, technological advancements have proven to be valuable tools for skill maintenance, education, and connection in @DATE1's society. Embracing these changes can bring numerous benefits and opportunities for growth.
969	971	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, there are big arguments about whether computers are good or bad. I believe that computers benefit our society in various ways. One significant advantage of computers is how they make socializing easier. Through computers, people can easily connect with friends and family, no matter where they are in the world. Messages can be sent instantly, allowing for quick and efficient communication. Additionally, computers have revolutionized education by providing access to a vast amount of information. With computers, individuals can learn about a wide range of topics, from space exploration to different cultures around the world. This easy access to knowledge has greatly enhanced our education system. Furthermore, computers have had a significant impact on businesses. They have improved efficiency, organization, and communication within companies, ultimately contributing to economic growth. Overall, computers have played a crucial role in enhancing social interactions, education, and business operations in our society.
970	972	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  I am writing to express my concerns about the impact of excessive computer use on individuals. One of the main issues I see is that people who spend too much time on computers risk letting their lives pass them by. While it is understandable for those who work on computers for extended periods, it is concerning when individuals spend hours on end in front of a screen without any productive purpose.   Furthermore, it is important to note that even when individuals are on the computer, they can still engage with their families, as they are often in the same household. By balancing computer use with family interaction, people can maintain important relationships and not isolate themselves from loved ones.  Lastly, I question why some individuals choose to spend the majority of their lives on computers. It is crucial to find a balance between screen time and real-life experiences, especially when it comes to enjoying time with family and pursuing personal fulfillment. By prioritizing meaningful activities over mindless computer use, individuals can lead more fulfilling lives and create lasting memories with loved ones.  In conclusion, it is essential to be mindful of the time spent on computers and ensure that it does not overshadow real-life experiences and interactions. Finding a healthy balance between screen time and personal engagement is key to leading a fulfilling and enriching life.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
971	973	1	3	I am writing this article to inform you on how most people are spending their time on computers. In this article, I am going to tell you about computers and what people are doing with them these days. Some people use their computers for business or work-related tasks. However, there are also individuals who use them for entertainment and social activities, often spending hours on end in front of a screen.  Many individuals find themselves constantly browsing social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter, becoming engrossed in the endless scroll of updates and posts. These websites can be highly addictive, drawing users in with notifications and the need to stay connected with friends and family online.  Others simply enjoy searching and browsing the internet, exploring different topics and interests. While this can be a great way to learn and discover new things, spending excessive amounts of time online can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and isolation from real-world interactions.  It is essential to remember the importance of balance and moderation when it comes to computer usage. While computers offer endless possibilities and entertainment, it is crucial to take breaks, go outside, and spend quality time with loved ones. The virtual world will always be there, but real-life experiences and connections are irreplaceable.  So, take a step back, limit your screen time, and make time for the things that truly matter. Enjoy life beyond the computer screen and embrace the beauty of the world around you. Thank you for considering these thoughts on computer usage and its impact on our lives.
972	974	1	3	What computers prevent you from doing is your homework in school. However, when you engage in unauthorized activities on the computer, you may find yourself stuck on a website that you cannot easily exit. Therefore, it is advisable to limit your computer usage to no more than a few minutes. This will help you stay focused on your tasks and avoid getting distracted by unnecessary websites. Remember, moderation is key when it comes to using computers for schoolwork and other activities.
973	975	1	3	Computers are a common household item these days, and their impact on society is significant. While they offer a wealth of information and convenience, excessive computer usage can have negative effects. Many individuals spend a significant amount of time on computers, whether for work, gaming, socializing, or other activities. This can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, with people missing out on outdoor activities and physical exercise.  Furthermore, some individuals may develop problematic behaviors such as online gambling, which can have serious consequences. Despite these drawbacks, computers can be a valuable resource for tasks such as research or gathering information quickly. In such cases, the efficiency and accessibility of computers prove to be beneficial.

By establishing boundaries and limiting screen time, individuals can enjoy the benefits of technology while also prioritizing their health and well-being.
974	976	1	3	Dear editor, I see that there is an argument between computers being good or bad. I think that my opinion can help your decision. I think that computers are good. I think they are good because they help kids with social skills, they help people with bad handwriting, and they help people learn about things around the world.   First of all, computers help kids all around the world with social skills. They help them because there are so many ways to communicate with people through the computer. There is instant messaging and webcaming websites. Also, a survey said that a majority of parents say that the computer has improved their kids' social skills significantly.  Another thing the computer helps with is people with bad handwriting. It helps because you can go on Microsoft Word and instead of writing a report that no one can read, you can type it. I find that when I have a paper for school where neatness counts, I always type it up on the computer to ensure it looks professional. This can help a lot of people who can't write as well as others because on the computer, you can change the font and everything to make it look as nice as you want.  The last reason I think the computer is a good idea is that many people don't have time to read newspapers or watch the news, so they prefer to research specific subjects they like to know what's going on around the world. I know my mom doesn't have time to watch the news, but when she checks her email, the biggest news of the day pops up. People all around the world use the computer to find out the latest news.  I hope you consider my opinion when you make your decision. Think of all the different kinds of people it helps - people with social problems, people with bad handwriting, and just busy individuals who can't sit down and watch the news. Thank you for your time.
975	977	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, I believe that people spend too much time on computers, and there are several reasons to support this view. Firstly, individuals are losing valuable time that could be spent on activities such as socializing with friends and family. Secondly, prolonged computer use can lead to a lack of energy as people become sedentary and inactive. Finally, constantly being glued to a screen can result in a significant portion of one's life being wasted on unproductive online activities. It is essential for individuals to disconnect from their devices and engage in real-world experiences to maintain a healthy balance. By reducing computer usage, people can regain time, energy, and meaningful interactions with others, ultimately benefiting society as a whole. It is crucial to find a balance between technology and real-life experiences for a fulfilling and well-rounded life. Thank you.
976	978	1	3	"Dear Readers, can you imagine not talking to distant friends, only knowing about your town, or even failing because you didn't have a computer? I know I couldn't. Some of the great benefits of having a computer are talking online with friends, learning about new places and things everywhere, and being able to study for tests from the internet. First, being able to talk to distant friends and relatives is now possible with the computer. Facts show that 85% of families in the United States have distant friends or relatives, now all of these people can talk to each other! I'll never forget the time that my close friend moved, but I was still able to talk to him because of the computer. Second, the computer allows you to learn about new places and things all around the world. I never would have known about some of the places I've been to if it weren't for the computer, as an expert mentioned, ""Computers are the reason we know so much about places."" Lastly, it is now possible to study without the use of physical books, it can be done online. I'll never forget the time that I forgot my book, but I could still study because of the online resources available. In conclusion, the computer has benefits for you, like interacting with friends online, learning about new places, and being able to study. Computers are just all-around beneficial tools for modern life."
977	979	1	3	To whom it may concern, Computers can be a great asset to our society, but they are an even bigger hindrance. People are wasting their days away on the computer, leading to a decrease in physical activity and interaction with friends and family. This sedentary lifestyle is contributing to the rise in obesity rates, as individuals are not prioritizing exercise and outdoor activities. In addition, excessive computer use is preventing people from creating meaningful memories in nature or visiting national parks. The decline in family time and social interactions is also a concerning trend linked to the increasing dependence on technology. It is crucial for individuals to strike a balance and prioritize real-life experiences over excessive screen time. By reducing computer usage and spending more time outdoors with loved ones, we can improve our overall well-being and create lasting memories that will enrich our lives. It's time to disconnect from the virtual world and reconnect with the beauty of the world around us.
978	980	1	3	Dear local newspaper, People spend too much time on the computer, neglecting exercise, nature, and real-life interactions. This trend is concerning as it leads to physical inactivity and obesity. For instance, my father's excessive computer use led to weight gain until my mother intervened and encouraged him to go to the gym, resulting in significant weight loss. It is a well-known fact that America has high obesity rates due to a lack of exercise and excessive screen time.   Moreover, the beauty of nature is often overlooked as people immerse themselves in the virtual world. The experience of feeling the cool breeze at the beach far surpasses staring at a computer screen in a confined space. If computers existed in the early exploration era, we might have missed out on great discoveries as individuals would have been less inclined to venture into the unknown.   Additionally, prioritizing quality time with loved ones over screen time is crucial. Missing out on opportunities to spend time with family and friends due to computer usage can lead to regret and missed memories. Real-life interactions are invaluable, and choosing a computer over a friend's invitation can strain relationships.   In conclusion, it is essential to balance computer use with physical activity, nature exploration, and meaningful connections with others. While computers have their benefits, excessive reliance on them can hinder personal growth and overall well-being. Let us remember to step away from the screen and embrace the beauty of the world around us.
979	981	1	3	Dear newspaper, I don't believe that computers benefit our society. They pose dangers such as online predators and scammers, making people vulnerable to harm. The police in our town report that a significant percentage of kidnappings are linked to social networking sites, where individuals can be targeted and lured into dangerous situations. Additionally, credit card scams are rampant online, with many individuals falling victim to fraudulent schemes that result in financial losses. Moreover, computers contribute to laziness by offering endless entertainment options that discourage physical activity. Research shows that a high percentage of overweight individuals engage in excessive computer usage. Considering these risks and negative impacts, it is clear that computers do not truly benefit society. It is crucial to be cautious and mindful of the potential dangers that come with technology.
980	982	1	3	"In my opinion, I do believe that computers are good for you. I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on whats happening around the world. First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3 if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in ""language of @CAPS2"", and listen what it tells you of @CAPS2! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on tv's bevause computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click, ""locate area"", on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. You could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an . Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the qhats happening around the world. Would'nt you wan't to uphold those amazing events also?"

984	986	1	3	Dear local newspaper, a recent survey conducted at @ORGANIZATION1 revealed that a significant number of students, @NUM1 out of @NUM2, spend a majority of their time on computers. This trend raises concerns about the impact of excessive computer usage on individuals, particularly in terms of safety, health, and education.  One of the primary concerns associated with increased computer usage is the potential for safety issues to arise. The anonymity of the internet can lead to encounters with dangerous individuals, putting users at risk of various threats such as fraud, harassment, and even physical harm. Furthermore, the lack of privacy controls on certain platforms can make personal information vulnerable to exploitation, highlighting the importance of exercising caution while navigating online spaces.  In addition to safety concerns, prolonged computer usage can have adverse effects on one's health. Many individuals, including a significant portion of teenagers, lead sedentary lifestyles due to excessive screen time, leading to a higher prevalence of obesity and related health issues. Moreover, extended exposure to screens can strain the eyes and contribute to headaches, emphasizing the importance of taking regular breaks and practicing proper eye care habits.  Furthermore, the impact of computers on education is a growing concern, as students may become easily distracted by the multitude of entertainment options available online, leading to neglect of academic responsibilities. This distraction can result in poor academic performance, as students may prioritize computer activities over essential tasks such as homework and studying for exams.  It is crucial for individuals to recognize the negative effects of excessive computer usage and take proactive measures to mitigate these risks. Balancing screen time with physical activity, implementing privacy settings, and establishing boundaries for educational purposes can help promote a healthier relationship with technology.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits and conveniences, it is essential to be mindful of the potential drawbacks associated with their excessive use. By fostering awareness and adopting responsible habits, individuals can harness the power of technology without compromising their safety, health, or educational pursuits. Let us strive to find a balance that allows us to enjoy the benefits of computers while safeguarding our well-being and overall quality of life.
985	987	1	3	Dear @CAPS1,   I am writing to share my thoughts on the excessive use of computers in our society. It is evident that many individuals have become overly reliant on technology for various aspects of their lives, whether it be for research, communication, or completing tasks such as homework. This heavy dependence on computers can have detrimental effects on both physical health and social interactions.  Spending countless hours in front of a screen not only limits physical activity, but also hinders the development of important social skills. Many individuals find it difficult to disconnect from their devices, feeling the need to constantly check messages and social media platforms. This behavior not only contributes to a sedentary lifestyle but also leads to poor eating habits, as individuals often snack mindlessly while engrossed in their digital world.  Moreover, the reliance on computers for academic success can be concerning. Students who solely depend on technology to complete their assignments may struggle to adapt when faced with challenges that require critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It is essential to teach young individuals alternative methods of learning and encourage activities that promote physical well-being.  In our community, the rise in obesity rates can be attributed not only to unhealthy eating habits but also to the lack of physical activity due to excessive computer use. It is crucial to address this issue before it becomes more prevalent and has long-term consequences on our health and well-being.  In conclusion, it is imperative that we recognize the negative impact of excessive computer use and take steps to reduce our dependency on technology. By finding a balance between screen time and other activities, we can improve our overall health and foster meaningful connections with others. Let us make a conscious effort to limit our computer usage and prioritize activities that promote physical and mental well-being.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
986	988	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think computers aren't good for people because they could spend that time exercising, hanging out with friends and family and reading. The first reason I don't think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercising instead of @CAPS2'ing you could ride your bike or even walk the dog, exercising @MONTH1 be hard work but, it's better then staring at your computer screen. Just because you eat well dosen't mean your healthy. You need exercise to stay healthy too. So, run, ing, walk the dog, go to a gym instead of sitting at the computer. Another reason I think computers aren't good for you is because in the time your on the computer you could be hanging out with your friends and family. Lets say your family is going to the beach, you stay home to play games on facebook. Your family comes back talks about all the fun they had, even tho you weren't there. You could have been apart of those memories. Now time to compare with your friends. Its movie night, all your friends are going. But, you stay home to webcam with your aunt. You stayed home both times just to be on the computer. You missed out on a lot. My final reason I think computers are bad is because, instead of computer time it should be reading time. Looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book. Reading books increases your vocabulary, you learn about different types of litature. Over all reading books makes you smarter. When your reading online you just read what people say, basically rumors. READ! In conclusion I think people should spend more time exercising, hanging out with family and friends and reading instead of being on computers.
987	989	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, In today's age computers are seen everywhere and they have been so helpful. They act as an information highway and connect people together. The new advances in technology have had a positive effect on humans all over.

The internet is fast, simple and reliable when you know how to use it."" said student @PERSON1. Children from the age of @NUM1 and up are learning how to use the internets multiple online encyclopedias, magazines, news sites or other resources to get information. I remember my kindergarten computer class where we'd research dinosaurs and weather patterns on kid-friendly websites. And now being in middle school we use websites like @CAPS1 Online for up-to-date reliable information. Moreover, I've seen my mom, a nurse and hospital manager, use the internet for videos and articles on how to do certain procedures and ways to organize a productive hospital. The internet is a great way to have a highway of information at the touch of a button. Furthermore, computers are used as a way for people to stay in touch. @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they talk to other peers using @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. It's a great way for us to communicate with our busy schedules when we can't always get together. Also, with parents losing jobs in this economic downfall, kids are always moving. Last @DATE1 one of my best friends in the world moved all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought we'd never talk again and I was so upset to say goodbye, but because of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 we talk non-stop and have actually never been closer. And it's not just for young people to fool around with friends but adults use social networks too. They connect for business through the internet and talk about future deals or problems and even use it to connect with old friends they haven't spoken to since college or childhood. As you can see the internet has had many positive effects from doing research faster to connecting with old friends, computers are helping everyone."

992	994	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Have you even been on a computer too long & haven't spent time exercising, or haven't spent any time with your family? Well, that's a big problem here in the @LOCATION1. In my opinion, to make this problem better, people should only be allowed on the computer for a certain amount @ORGANIZATION1 time & after they enjoy themselves with a nice workout, time outside & most importantly with their families. I think this will make the problem better, because you can enjoy yourself a little bit more rather than getting home from school & shooting right to wherever your computer is & being on it for the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the night. I also think this will help the problem because it will also allow you to get better grades. If your on computer all the time & don't have any time to exercise, go outside, and bond with your family then that most likely means you have no time to do homework. By not doing homework, your grades could go lower & you most likely won't understand what you are learning in that class. This one problem ran also affect you so many other ways. The problem with computers & why people, mostly kids are so attached with them is because @ORGANIZATION1 websites such as twitter, facebook, youtube, etc. & kids are @CAPS1 to them. This is part @ORGANIZATION1 the problem because kids can't get off @ORGANIZATION1 them, they like it so much. This problem leads to the main problem because if parents say ""Time to get off... go get some fresh air."" the kid always goes ""one minute"" & the parents let them get away with that, but then that ""one minute"" turns into an hour at most. This is bad because by the time the kid gets off the computer, its dark out and they can't go run around outside. I think this is important because think that facebook & twitter should be limited amount @ORGANIZATION1 time and should log you off after @NUM1 minutes. In conclusion, this problem is a national issue & in my opinion should be a new law, that kids have to play outside, and spend time with their families before going onto any computer. As you can see having all these great websites leads into a problem with kids. Thanks for your time on reading why I think computers are a big problem here in the @ORGANIZATION1.

994	996	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 I heard a lot of people are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.

996	998	1	3	"Imagine your life without the benefits of the computer. Do you think it would make life a little harder? Computers have positive effects on people for educational reasons and for a new way to develop skills. Computers are very important to our society. Computers can help with our educational needs. When a school project is going on, more than 50% of students use a computer to access the information they need. I agree that students depend too much on a computer and not on books, but the computer has more information to offer than the average book. The computer allows us, as students, to broaden our horizon. The organization stated that ""a near 70% of students learn something new from a computer that they did not already know."" For example, in history and geography, a student could find more information on a specific country than they could with a book. I predict that as a result of the informational access the computer gives us, that soon grades will boost at least 10% to 15%. In a survey that was done by the organization, found that 85% of students found more information, that was relevant, on a selected topic than in the whole school library. Next, the computer can help with hand-eye coordination for young kids. In school, students are observed to see how well or if their coordination is being developed. With 30% of students having very little coordination, computer games lowered the percentage to 15%. The computer does help with the educational needs of students in urban areas. The computer is a great way to socialize with friends. It is a new and inventive way to communicate. I know that some may say that there is less time spent humanly interacting, but on the computer, it is still interacting. With a phone, you can only chat with each other, but a computer has a webcam. This device allows you to talk to people with some human interaction. Around 20 to 30 million users have this device to use. It is preinstalled into many laptops, giving us portable access to talk. The CEO at a tech company said that ""since the laptops have come with a built-in webcam, one out of every two that have it installed use it to chat socially and for business."" The computer can help with our communications for personal or business needs. The computer is a good way to start and develop technical skills. More than 60% of children use a computer to start with the beginnings of their technical skills. Computers allow many people to become proficient with each other in new and effective ways. In conclusion, the average computer can benefit our lives in positive ways. From our educational needs and to our technical needs, the computer positively affects us in these two very important ways."

However, computers have undeniably made a positive impact on our communities.   One of the most significant ways computers have benefited society is in the field of education. They have revolutionized the way students learn, both in schools and at home. Tasks that would have taken hours to complete by hand can now be done in a fraction of the time with the help of computers. Programs like Microsoft Word offer a range of tools to enhance the learning experience, from different fonts and colors to spell-check and grammar correction. Additionally, teachers are increasingly incorporating technology into their lessons, using computers for tests, research, and presentations.   Moreover, computers have transformed the way we communicate with friends and family.

The ability to share photos, videos, and updates in real-time has made staying in touch easier and more convenient than ever.   In addition to their educational and communicative benefits, computers also provide a wealth of entertainment options. Whether it's playing games online, watching funny videos, or connecting with old friends on social media platforms, the internet offers endless sources of amusement. Websites like YouTube and Facebook have become staples in our daily lives, offering a mix of information, interaction, and enjoyment.

Computers can calculate, pollutional margins, and provide solutions to the large amount of pollution humans release in the air and @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 Nature can be spared. So much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use. People must adapt to @LOCATION1 technology, or we will fall behind and watch our @CAPS1 slip away. This proves the effect computers have on people is not only positive, but necessary to advance in an ever-growing world. Stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans. Computers in most cases, do better work and create less error than humans themselves. Instead of requiring humans to work in dangerous locations such as deep water, computers can be sent down to visualize the before unattainable areas. Also, faster communication is extremely helpful in certain circumtances, such as an occurance in a workplace causing the area to be off-limits. As member of the workplace can simply e-mail his employer, informing them of the accuracy and preventing them from putting themselves in danger, or simply preventing men the trouble of a commute to work. Even from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2, with simply the press of ""@CAPS2"", people across the world can be of the accident. Foreign communication, specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations, in the fields of both business and government. Lastly, finding information, is so easy with a @CAPS3. Where would be without computers to find information rapidly? We would be still going to the library and checking out books, reading through page after page to find the information that would have taken less even a minute on a computer. Even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial. As you can see, on even a less global level of use, the computer still proves to have a positive effect on its users. The one thing, parents especially, that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability. When these two topics are analyzed, it is so simple to eliminate unreliability and danger of the computer. Installing a program of which there are infinite to choose from, that allows ""good"" websites to be viewed, and ""bad"" on potentially dangerous @CAPS4 to be binded. This eliminates all that is heard about on-line interactions and activity gone bad. Even without software to block dangerous websites, computers are generally safe. Only @NUM1 out of @NUM2 websites, includes content considered ""detrimental"" to humans. Also, of those @NUM2, @NUM4 provide reliable, correct information. Those two statistics annihilate the question of safety and reliability that some users come to ponder. That goes to show that the computer's negative aspects can be eliminate, leaving only the positives to remain. In conclusion, computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives. Computers are the future, and have even proven to save lives. Why wouldn't somebody want to save the life of another? Also, the benefits of @CAPS3, or personal computers, are too large and helpful to pass up. Lastly, when viewed carefully, computers are very reliable, and can be made extremely safe, which eliminates the main fear computers. We have come so far to create such a safe, beneficial, and necessary device, we must put it to use, and by doing so, better our own lives, and the life of @ORGANIZATION1. The impact of computers on society is undeniable and essential for progress."
999	1001	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers are essential for various specific reasons. One important reason is to maintain contact with family and friends, especially when physical distance separates us. Through platforms like social media, we can easily stay connected and updated on each other's lives. Additionally, computers provide a means for entertainment and social interaction, such as playing games with others online.  Furthermore, computers are crucial in professional settings. Doctors utilize them to communicate important information about patients, while workers rely on them to access job opportunities and stay informed about their tasks. For students, computers are valuable tools for completing assignments and staying organized in the absence of teachers.  Moreover, in fields like carpentry or real estate, having a computer is indispensable for managing inventory, communicating with clients, and navigating locations efficiently. Whether it's for work-related tasks or personal interests, computers offer a wide range of benefits that enhance our daily lives.  In conclusion, the versatility and convenience of computers make them essential in our modern world. From facilitating communication to aiding in productivity, the use of computers has become integral to our daily routines. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to have access to computers for various purposes in order to stay connected, informed, and efficient.
1000	1002	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, computers have become essential tools in our daily lives, offering instant access to information and making tasks easier to accomplish. However, while computers have their benefits, there are also negative impacts associated with excessive use.  One major concern is the way computers can isolate individuals from real-life interactions. People often get lost in the virtual world of the computer, spending hours online instead of engaging in face-to-face conversations. This lack of social interaction can hinder the development of important social skills, which are crucial in today's society.  Moreover, prolonged computer use can have physical consequences, such as eye strain. Staring at a bright screen for extended periods can lead to discomfort and potential damage to eyesight. It is important to take breaks and limit computer usage to protect our health.  While computers are valuable tools for work and research, it is essential to strike a balance and not let them consume our lives. We should prioritize real-world connections and activities, ensuring that we maintain a healthy balance between the digital and physical realms. Let's remember to step away from the screen and enjoy the world outside our windows.
1001	1003	1	3	Dear Newspaper, People should prioritize spending time with their family and friends over excessive computer use. This shift in focus can lead to improved physical health, stronger family bonds, and better academic performance. Engaging in physical activities with loved ones, rather than sitting in front of a screen, can significantly contribute to overall fitness levels. Studies show that regular exercise not only helps in weight management but also promotes a healthier lifestyle. Additionally, family relationships benefit greatly from quality time spent together. By avoiding excessive screen time, families can strengthen their connections and provide essential emotional support to each other. This, in turn, can positively impact academic performance, as children from closely-knit families tend to excel in school. By reducing computer usage and prioritizing family interactions, individuals can enhance their well-being, foster stronger relationships, and achieve greater success in various aspects of life. Embracing a balanced lifestyle that values personal connections over digital distractions can lead to a more fulfilling and prosperous future for everyone involved.
1002	1004	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have computers in their household but they disagree with how a computer can help you. There are some advantages in using computers such as being able to search for information, learn hand-eye coordination, and become organized, but it also has its disadvantages like children spending more time on the computer rather than going outside to play with friends, exercise, and stay fit. However, I believe that computers do produce a positive impact on children. Computers not only allow a child to stay in contact with family members who live far away, but they can also help them complete projects more efficiently and quickly. It may seem like we are only doing one thing on the computer, but in fact, we can be uploading pictures and movies, downloading music, and playing games all at the same time. With all that being said, I hope that we share the same viewpoint on computers and their positive impact.
1003	1005	1	3	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say that computers are ""taking over people"", I strongly disagree. People spend the amount of time they need and want then become active or spend time with family and friends. Computers allow people to learn, they allow people communicate to family and friends, too. Also, @CAPS5 people use computers for work and jobs. I believe computers allow people, like myself, to learn. You can learn also @CAPS5 things on the computer. You can learn about other countries, you can read articles on news, also. You can learn different languges and about the world. Online people can communicate with others. There is skype, which allows you to communicate with others while on the internet, you use a webcam. there is also instant messanger, or @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is like having a conversation with a person who's right next to you! Then there is email which can send letters, photos and comments. @CAPS5 people use computers for work. Microsoft @CAPS4 allows you to type stories and type letters. @CAPS5 people do job reports on @CAPS4. Also, the internet is helpful for work. Websites and search engines help you a lot. Websites can contain information that working people need. To finish this letter, I want to say that @NUM1) Computers allow people to learn. @NUM2) They allow people to communicate with friends and family. Lastly, @NUM3) @CAPS5 working people use the computer for work and reports. I hope I influenced you to see why computers aren't bad.  Computers have revolutionized the way we learn, communicate, and work. They provide endless opportunities for expanding our knowledge and connecting with others. Instead of taking over our lives, computers enhance them by offering valuable tools and resources. Let's embrace the positive impact of technology in our daily lives."
1004	1006	1	3	"I strolled into my bedroom and noticed the computer sitting on a wonderful desk. Computers have always been a topic of debate, with some arguing they are beneficial to society while others disagree. Personally, I believe that computers are incredibly useful and support this technology. They can be valuable tools for students, helping with schoolwork and projects. For example, when I had a science project about the relationship between my hobbies and science, the internet provided me with endless resources and information, ultimately leading to a high grade on the assignment. Additionally, computers can help us stay connected with friends and family, even those who may be far away. Through online chatting platforms, I was able to reconnect with a friend who had moved away, allowing us to communicate regularly. Moreover, computer programs like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4"" can help enrich our minds and improve our academic performance. By using these tools, I have gained confidence in my abilities and feel better prepared for upcoming tests. Overall, computers have a positive impact on society, helping individuals learn, connect, and grow. I firmly believe that more people should embrace this technology for its numerous benefits."
1005	1007	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have truly revolutionized our daily lives in many positive ways. They have enhanced our ability to connect with loved ones, make new friends, and complete work efficiently and professionally. Social networks like @CAPS1 have facilitated reconnections with long-lost friends and relatives, bringing joy to many. Additionally, computer software from @ORGANIZATION2 has simplified tasks like creating presentations and reports, making our work more polished and effective.  While some may argue that excessive computer usage can lead to a lack of outdoor activity, it is important to recognize the benefits of improved hand-eye coordination that technology can offer. From creating multimedia projects to excelling in sports like baseball, computers play a crucial role in enhancing this essential skill.  Overall, the computer is a valuable tool that has brought about positive changes in society. It has made communication easier, work more efficient, and skills like hand-eye coordination more refined. Embracing the advancements in technology can lead to a more connected and productive world for all.
1006	1008	1	3	Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, it is true that more and more people are using computers in today's society. However, it is essential to question whether this excessive use of computers is truly necessary. While I myself have been guilty of spending hours on my computer in the past, I have since discovered the joys of outdoor activities like skateboarding and snowboarding, which have led me away from the screen.  There are still many individuals who spend a significant amount of time on computers, and I believe it is crucial for people to reduce their screen time. Excessive computer use can lead to weight gain, which can have detrimental effects on one's health. I have witnessed the struggles of friends who have become overweight due to their sedentary lifestyles, and it is heartbreaking to see the impact it has on their well-being.  Furthermore, there are countless activities that are far more fulfilling than sitting in front of a computer all day. Whether it is engaging in sports, shopping, or simply spending time with friends, being active and moving is far more beneficial than being glued to a screen. Taking a walk or participating in any outdoor activity can provide a much-needed break from technology and promote a healthier lifestyle.  In conclusion, it is important to recognize the negative consequences of excessive computer use and prioritize activities that promote physical and mental well-being. Getting outside, being active, and spending time with loved ones are essential for a balanced and fulfilling life. So, to all the computer enthusiasts out there, remember to take a break and enjoy the wonders of the world beyond the screen.
1007	1009	1	3	Has your child ever asked for computers in their school? The idea may seem appealing at first, with promises of improved hand-eye coordination, learning opportunities, and global communication. However, before jumping on board, consider the potential drawbacks.  Safety is a major concern with children interacting online, as they may be exposed to strangers asking for personal information or even face-to-face meetings. Addiction to computers can also lead to a sedentary lifestyle, potentially causing health issues like obesity.  Financially, introducing computers to schools can be a significant investment, with potential costs for repairs and maintenance. Moreover, there is a risk of exposure to viruses from inappropriate websites, leading to further expenses and disruptions.  Ultimately, the focus of schools should be on education, not on providing excessive technology that may have negative consequences. It is crucial to carefully weigh the pros and cons before deciding on implementing computers in the school environment.
1008	1010	1	3	Dear local newspapers,  It has come to my attention that there is a push for people to use computers more frequently. I believe there are three key reasons why this is a beneficial idea. Firstly, using computers can enhance hand-eye coordination. As individuals become more adept at typing on a keyboard, their coordination improves, leading to faster and more accurate typing skills.  Secondly, computers provide a gateway for individuals to learn about faraway places and people. Through search engines like Google, people can easily access information about different cultures and locations. This exposure broadens their knowledge and understanding of the world around them.  Lastly, computers facilitate communication with individuals from various locations through platforms such as AIM, Myspace, and Facebook. These online channels enable people to connect, engage in conversations, play games, and build relationships regardless of geographical boundaries.  In conclusion, the use of computers offers benefits such as improving hand-eye coordination, expanding knowledge about distant places and individuals, and fostering connections with people worldwide. Therefore, I believe that encouraging people to utilize computers more frequently is a valuable proposition.  Sincerely,   [Your Name]
1009	1011	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, do you have a computer at home? Right now, more than 80% of people have at least one or more computers at home. Computers are common nowadays, but people argue whether they are really needed in our society. Computers have negative effects on people, such as eye sight problems, interacting with strangers online, and lack of outdoor exercise. The rate of people wearing glasses is increasing rapidly, with one out of five people now needing them. Children and adults are spending too much time on computers, leading to eye strain and headaches. This shows that computers have detrimental effects on society.  When people are online, there are no limitations. They can access countless sites, many of which may not be trustworthy. Interacting with strangers online can be dangerous, as there is no way to know who is on the other end. People cannot always trust the privacy settings of social media platforms like Facebook, where personal information can be easily accessed by others. The rate of internet addiction is also on the rise, leading people to isolate themselves indoors and neglect their health by consuming unbalanced meals from fast food establishments.  In conclusion, computers have negative effects on society by increasing the number of people with vision problems, creating unsafe online environments, and contributing to unhealthy lifestyles. It is crucial for individuals to be mindful of their screen time and prioritize real-world interactions and physical activity to maintain their well-being.
1010	1012	1	3	Dear local newspaper writer, I'm writing to talk to you about the use of computers. I think computers benefit our communities a lot. I feel this way because it can warn us about natural disasters. It teaches us about everything and anything. Lastly, we get to talk to people online. In these next paragraphs, I'll share my thoughts about this topic with you.  My first reason is natural disasters. Computers always warn us about them. For example, when Hurricane Katrina hit, computers were able to track its progress. Many people were able to evacuate the city before it made landfall. Statistics show that computers can accurately predict a large percentage of natural disasters. Computers save lives each and every time they warn us about impending disasters. Another recent example is the earthquakes that occurred in our region. Computers quickly informed many residents about the seismic activity, allowing them to take necessary precautions.  My second reason for believing that computers benefit us is that they teach us about everything and anything. With just a simple search, we can learn about faraway places, new words, and current events in our own country. For instance, when working on a project, I easily found a wealth of information about a historical figure just by typing their name into a search engine. The vast amount of knowledge that computers provide is truly astounding, making learning more accessible and convenient for everyone.  Lastly, computers allow us to communicate online. While there are risks involved, talking online can be a fun and engaging way to connect with others. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram enable us to stay in touch with old friends and family members. Additionally, video chat services like Skype or Zoom make it possible to have face-to-face conversations with loved ones, even when miles apart. It's essential to exercise caution online, but the internet can be a valuable tool for staying connected.  In conclusion, I believe that computers make our lives easier in many ways. They warn us about natural disasters, provide us with a wealth of information, and allow us to communicate with others online. Embracing the benefits of technology can enhance our daily lives and help us stay connected in an increasingly digital world.
1011	1013	1	3	I believe that spending excessive time on the computer can have negative effects on individuals. Firstly, prolonged screen time can lead to vision problems due to straining the eyes. It is essential to limit computer usage to prevent such issues. Secondly, being glued to the computer can result in missing out on quality time with family and friends, impacting relationships and social interactions. Lastly, sedentary behavior while using the computer can contribute to weight gain and overall health issues. It is crucial to strike a balance between computer use and other activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, reducing computer time can benefit individuals by safeguarding their eyesight, nurturing relationships, and promoting physical well-being.
1012	1014	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever thought about people's views on certain technology? While some people say that others spend too much time on their computers and are wasting their time, I think computers can help us with many different things. They can assist with homework, interacting with people, and even aid in exercising. In the end, computers prove to be beneficial for everyone.  For many students, computers are essential for understanding subjects. Online lessons and books are readily available, making it easier for students to complete their homework. Websites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 allow for interaction with others, providing a platform for discussions and assistance when needed.  Contrary to the belief that computers detract from exercising, they actually offer valuable resources for staying fit. Websites offer diet plans, exercise tips, and recommendations for gyms like @LOCATION2 fitness. It's not the computer's fault if people neglect exercise; the tools are there for those who choose to utilize them.  Computers have become indispensable in today's world, offering numerous benefits to users. They facilitate learning, communication, and health improvement. Embracing technology can enhance various aspects of our lives, proving that computers are indeed assets for all. Thank you for considering these perspectives.
1013	1015	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I disagree with those who support advances in technology and believe that spending time on the computer has a positive impact on people. Instead of rotting away in front of a screen, why not spend time with friends, travel to new places, or even focus on improving your health through exercise?   While it may be tempting to explore different destinations online, nothing beats the experience of actually traveling to these places and immersing yourself in the culture. Stepping out of your comfort zone and exploring the world can be a truly rewarding and enriching experience.  If traveling is not your cup of tea, you can always focus on improving your health and fitness. Just like my mother who successfully achieved her weight loss goals through dedication and hard work, you too can make positive changes in your life by prioritizing your well-being.  Furthermore, spending time with friends and family in real life can provide a sense of connection and fulfillment that cannot be replicated online. Building strong relationships and engaging in face-to-face interactions can greatly enhance your overall well-being and happiness.  So, instead of wasting your time on the computer, take a step outside, engage with the world around you, and make the most of your life. Embrace new experiences, prioritize your health, and nurture your relationships - you won't regret it. It's time to break free from the confines of technology and embrace the beauty of the real world.
1014	1016	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I am one of those people who do not agree. I believe that spending excessive time on computers can have negative effects on individuals and society as a whole.  One of the main reasons why I think excessive computer use is detrimental is that it often leads to a lack of physical activity. When people spend all day on their computers, they are less likely to engage in regular exercise. Physical activity is essential for maintaining good health and overall well-being. Without exercise, individuals may experience a decline in physical fitness and an increased risk of various health problems.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can also lead to a disconnect from nature. Spending too much time indoors on computers means missing out on the beauty and tranquility of the natural world. Nature has a calming and rejuvenating effect on individuals, and it is important for mental and emotional health to spend time outdoors and appreciate the wonders of the natural environment.  Lastly, spending too much time on computers can lead to a neglect of relationships with friends and family. While computers can provide a means of communication and connection, they cannot replace the value of face-to-face interactions with loved ones. Building and maintaining strong relationships with friends and family members is essential for emotional support, social connection, and overall happiness.  In conclusion, while computers can offer many benefits and opportunities, it is important to strike a balance and not let excessive computer use overshadow other important aspects of life such as physical activity, connection with nature, and relationships with friends and family. Finding a healthy balance between technology and real-life experiences is key to leading a fulfilling and well-rounded life. Thank you for considering my perspective.
1015	1017	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that people shouldn't spend too much time on the computer because it can have negative effects on their health, relationships, and overall enjoyment of life. Excessive computer use can strain your eyes, trigger seizures, and lead to a sedentary lifestyle, all of which are detrimental to your well-being. Furthermore, spending too much time online can cause you to neglect spending quality time with your family and friends, leading to strained relationships and feelings of isolation. Additionally, being glued to the screen prevents you from experiencing the beauty of nature and engaging in physical activities that are essential for a healthy lifestyle. It's important to find a balance between technology and real-life interactions in order to lead a fulfilling and healthy life. Take a break from the computer, go outside, and enjoy the world around you. Your mind, body, and relationships will thank you for it.
1016	1018	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, back a couple decades ago, before computers existed, children were outside exercising, playing with friends, and living somewhat danger-free lives. Then came the computer. Computers are driving the next generation to a dangerous life of staring at an assortment of pixels all day long as well as ruining any civilized relationships they had. I strongly believe that computers have a negative effect on society. Did you know that as the number of computers sold increases, the obesity rate has gone up by 15% since computers came into our lives? People spend way too much time on screens and not enough time exercising! Another effect of the long hours spent in front of screens is a decrease in eyesight ability. My family friend had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer. ""I'm worried about my daughter's eyes...she stares at that screen for hours on end!"" said a concerned parent at a local school. How could something so harmful possibly be good for our society? The internet is also very unsafe. Predators surf the web, looking for young, innocent people to meet and most likely abuse. Many parents are unaware that the internet makes it easy to talk to anybody in the world. Monitoring children's computer usage would come in handy when it comes to inappropriate content. It is so easy to come across things that should not be seen while surfing the web! People easily get caught up in being hidden behind a computer, and say mean, hurtful things that would never be said face to face. These unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today. Computers have a very negative effect on relationships nowadays. So many fights happen through computer communications. Even if online conversations are friendly, they get people accustomed to making people ""keyboard warriors"" through a computer, not face to face. After being in a computer-oriented friendship, people tend to forget how to act face to face and find personal meetings awkward. ""I can't imagine only talking through computers, never being civilized with other human beings! Unfortunately, that is where computers are leading us to..."" said an eighth grader at a local school. Spending all day in front of a computer, putting yourself and relationships in danger is, unfortunately, the effect of computers. Make the change today and stop the advances in technology before it is too late. Let's not lose our humanity to the screens."
1017	1019	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to read this letter, it means a lot to me. I am writing today to express my strong belief in the significant benefits that computers bring to society. Despite some people claiming otherwise, computers play a crucial role in our daily lives and offer a multitude of advantages.  One of the most notable benefits of computers is their ability to facilitate research. As I mentioned earlier, computers provide easy access to a vast amount of information through online resources and databases. This enables individuals like myself to conduct in-depth research on a wide range of topics quickly and efficiently. Whether it's for academic purposes or personal interest, the convenience of finding reliable information with just a few clicks cannot be understated.  Moreover, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate with others, both locally and globally. Through various online platforms and communication tools, such as video chat and instant messaging, we can connect with people from different parts of the world in real time. This not only helps us stay in touch with loved ones who may be far away but also allows for meaningful interactions and collaborations with individuals from diverse backgrounds.  In conclusion, the impact of computers on society is undeniable. From enhancing research capabilities to facilitating global communication, computers have become an indispensable part of modern life. As we continue to advance in technology, the benefits of computers will only continue to grow, shaping the way we live, work, and connect with others. Thank you once again for considering the importance of computers in our society.
1018	1020	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. My first reason is that some people at college are far away from home like my sister and my family talks to her through the computer. Also many people have an email! that tells them about sales at grocery stores or clothing stores and it saves people money using those coupons. Statistics state that grownups that use the computer at night feel more awake in the evening. My second reason is that if someone is going on vacation or they are moving they can go on the internet and find out if where they're going is safe or if they have a nice school there and they can learn about the place and see what it looks like. They can also find out about colleges and see how nice they are, see if it's a small school if there are a lot of kids that go to that school, and so on. My third and final reason is that when people use the computer their hand-eye coordination gets better because when you're typing you're moving your fingers and you're getting the feeling when you use it and you're getting faster at typing. Also, you're not just sitting there, you're moving your fingers and you're using your brain. Scholastic Kids states that kids who use the computer and use the keyboard bring their grades up by 1 point. In conclusion, I don't think that the computer has a bad effect. After you're done reading this, I hope you agree with me.
1019	1021	1	3	I think that it is fine that people spend a lot of time on the computer instead of having time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends because it is the person's choice to either stay on the computer all day or go outside. Computers affect people's lives in good ways and bad ways. People stay inside all day and do nothing besides sit there and just click buttons. Good ways are that it educates you in many ways because when you are on the computer watching or reading interesting things, you could end up learning something before you learn it in school. It is good to go on the computer for a little bit, but if you are on it all day, then you could have no exercise and become lazy and fat. However, if you go outside sometimes, you won't have to worry because you are getting exercise that helps your body.  I think computers are a great way to have fun. You can chat with your friends, and if you have a webcam, you can video chat with friends. A computer is a great way for communication. Millions of people use a computer for working at their job. Without computers, life would be ten times harder for people in this world. People like accountants use computers for their job. They store data into the computer to remember things, and people also make websites on the internet to help educate. People also make search engines, which are engines on a website that searches for things you type in. If you type in something, you will get what you were looking for.  My whole point of explaining this is that it's the people's choice if they would like to be on all the time. Because computers and internet connections aren't free. It doesn't even do anything bad to your brain; it mostly educates it. People even go to school online to learn and study things that are on the internet. Plus, you could get jobs at places for working with computers. You could make programs and anything you would want. So, my statement here is that it's okay to spend a lot of time on your computer instead of exercising, going to see friends and family, and enjoying nature. I think that computers are fine, and it doesn't matter how long you're on it; it just depends on your learning and not playing games all day, being lazy, and getting fat.
1020	1022	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  Computers have undeniably made a positive impact on society in various ways. One of the significant benefits they offer is assisting individuals in writing papers. Gone are the days of laboriously writing multiple drafts by hand; computers allow for easy editing and formatting, resulting in polished and professional-looking documents. This not only saves time but also enhances the quality of written work.  Furthermore, computers serve as valuable social tools, facilitating connections and communication among people. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter have revolutionized how individuals interact and stay in touch with friends and family, even across long distances. These platforms also play a crucial role in fostering relationships, as seen in the success of online dating websites like eHarmony and Match.com, which help individuals find compatible partners and build meaningful relationships.  Additionally, computers have simplified the process of conducting research by providing quick access to a vast array of information online. With just a few clicks, users can find the latest articles and resources on any topic, eliminating the need to spend hours in libraries searching for relevant material. This ease of access not only saves time but also enables individuals to delve deeper into their research and make more informed decisions.  In conclusion, computers have had a positive impact on society by aiding in paper writing, serving as social tools for communication and connection, and streamlining the research process. Their contributions have made tasks more efficient and accessible, ultimately improving the quality of life for many individuals. It is clear that computers play a crucial role in modern society and should be appreciated for the benefits they bring.
1021	1023	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  I am writing to express my concerns about the negative impact that computers can have on people. Computers can lead to weight gain, eye problems, and financial difficulties.  Spending long hours on a computer can often result in weight gain. When people are glued to their screens for extended periods, they may not have time to prepare healthy meals and resort to eating junk food instead. This can contribute to unhealthy eating habits and ultimately lead to weight issues.  Additionally, staring at a bright computer screen for hours on end can strain the eyes and cause discomfort. Prolonged exposure to screens can lead to eye fatigue, dryness, and even more serious conditions like digital eye strain. It is important to take breaks and rest your eyes to prevent long-term damage.  Moreover, relying on a computer for work can have financial consequences. If someone loses their job because they were unable to perform their duties remotely, they may struggle to pay their bills. This can create a cycle of financial instability that is difficult to break out of.  In conclusion, it is essential to be mindful of the potential negative effects of excessive computer use. By prioritizing health, taking breaks, and maintaining a balance between screen time and other activities, individuals can mitigate these risks and lead a healthier lifestyle.  Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.  Sincerely, [Your Name]

That is a common occurrence on computers, where clicking on such pop-ups can lead to viruses and the theft of personal information. This is just one reason why computers can be harmful. Additionally, according to the missing child agency, more than 2 kids are abducted each day due to online interactions. Children can easily get into trouble in chat rooms and other online platforms.   Moreover, our reliance on computers is excessive and unhealthy. Online advertisements often cause numerous problems, as mentioned by experts. A worldwide poll conducted in recent years revealed that over 50% of the global population owns computers, with a significant percentage being children. When kids use computers, they are prone to clicking on pop-up ads, which can result in various issues such as viruses and identity theft.  Chatting online is also risky, especially in chat rooms where dangers lurk. Despite the convenience that computers offer, it is crucial not to rely on them entirely. Not everything on the internet is accurate, as highlighted by Technology Today magazine. Relying on online information can lead to misinformation, as experienced in the example of a canceled flight.  It is essential to be cautious and not depend solely on computers for every task. Taking matters into our own hands and minimizing our reliance on technology can help prevent potential risks and inaccuracies. Let's strive to strike a balance between using computers and engaging in real-world activities for a more secure and reliable lifestyle.
1023	1025	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. It teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allows people to talk online with others. Computers are one of the best technological inventions that benefit society.  Firstly, computers teach hand-eye coordination. When using a computer, individuals need to know where specific keys are located on the keyboard to type efficiently. This not only improves typing speed but also enhances hand-eye coordination.  Secondly, computers provide the opportunity for individuals to learn about distant places. Through the internet, people can explore different cultures, traditions, and landscapes without physically traveling. This expands knowledge and broadens perspectives.  Lastly, computers enable communication with others online. In today's digital age, social media platforms and email have made it easier to connect with friends, family, and even strangers across the globe. This fosters relationships and facilitates the exchange of ideas.  Overall, computers have a positive impact on society by enhancing coordination, expanding knowledge, and promoting communication. It is evident that the benefits of computers outweigh any potential drawbacks, making them an essential tool in our modern world.
1024	1026	1	3	"Dear trained @ORGANIZATION1 reader, @CAPS1! Ah, I love hearing my computer thunk on when I wake up. Such a lovely sound. Some people feel the need to disagree and say computers are bad for people. But, I feel the computer is a magnificent invention. All that @CAPS2 will help improve hand-eye coordination, you can look up anything in the world, and you can even meet new people and keep in touch with faraway friends. The world is just a click away! What's this? You need to write a paper on how to play baseball and improve your pitching skills at the same time? No need to worry, you can just type that paper up on the computer! This is one of the many perks of owning a computer. @CAPS2 a paper is so much faster than writing @CAPS3 by hand. Studies show that @CAPS2 a paper is @PERCENT1 faster than writing @CAPS3 out. Even @PERSON1, and handwriting enthusiast, says ""@CAPS2 is so much easier than having to write! I type all my books proper handwriting."" @CAPS3's been said by officials that most hand-written lovers are converting to @CAPS2 for better hand-eye coordination. If @CAPS3's used by the people that oppose @CAPS3, @CAPS3's gotta be great! Let's say you're doing a project on panda bears, but you don't know anything about them. What do you do? Search @CAPS3 up on @CAPS4.com of course! @CAPS4.com is a bounty of information, serving up morsels of links for any-and every-topic. I remember this one time I had a big report to write but I didn't know anything about the subject. So what solved my problem? @CAPS4! @CAPS3's been proven that @PERCENT2 of information found on @CAPS4 is true. You know what else on the computer can help you with information? Just about any domain name on the web. Just type what you're looking for, add .com at the end and @CAPS5! all the information you could need. Hm, what else can the computer help with? I know. Your friend that moved away, you can send her a message and get back in touch. Or, if you don't like your friend that moved away, you can meet new people. For example, @LOCATION1 is a site designed to match people up for romantic relations. So maybe you don't like computers. Oh well, all I can tell you is that you're missing a lot. Great hand-eye coordination, magnificent information, and colorful people like I said, the world is just a click away! Whether it's for research, communication, or simply entertainment, computers have revolutionized the way we live our lives.

1025	1027	1	3	Dear readers, many people use computers, but not everyone realizes the benefits they bring to society. I, however, strongly believe in the positive impact of computers on our lives. The internet, for example, is a powerful tool that allows us to connect with people we are looking for. Social networking sites like Facebook provide a platform for communication and finding friends and family members. Additionally, online shopping has revolutionized the way we make purchases, offering convenience and a wide range of products at our fingertips. In situations where we may need directions, websites like MapQuest provide easy access to maps and routes, ensuring we reach our destination without getting lost. Overall, computers offer numerous advantages, from connecting people to facilitating online transactions and providing essential information. Embracing technology can truly enhance our daily lives and improve the way we interact with the world around us.
1026	1028	1	3	Dear Newspaper, did you know that two out of three individuals own a computer? Computers have become an essential tool in society, benefiting people in various ways. They facilitate communication, learning, and even improve hand-eye coordination, making them invaluable in today's world.  One of the most significant advantages of computers is their role in communication. With the advancement of technology, people can now communicate through webcams, allowing for face-to-face interactions regardless of distance. Additionally, email and communication websites like instant messaging platforms have made it easier for individuals to stay connected and exchange information quickly and efficiently.  Moreover, computers serve as a valuable educational resource. They provide access to a vast amount of information, allowing people to learn about diverse topics from around the world. Students, in particular, benefit from computers as they can type projects or papers more efficiently, improving their organizational skills and hand-eye coordination in the process.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in modern society by enhancing communication, facilitating learning, and aiding students in their academic pursuits. Their impact is undeniable, and their benefits are felt across all aspects of life. It is clear that computers have become an essential tool that enriches the lives of individuals in numerous ways.
1027	1029	1	3	Dear Newspaper editor, do you have a computer at home? Do you use Facebook, Twitter, or any other type of social networking site? Well, if you are like the majority of the respectable, caring individuals in this country, you probably answered yes to both of these questions. You most likely also believe that the computer is a great tool to teach hand-eye coordination and is an awesome way to talk with other people online.   Not only that, but you should notice the great potential the computer has for showing us distant, faraway lands and cultures. What would we be able to do without hand-eye coordination? Nothing, that is what we could do. Without the hand-eye coordination that computers and video games help you develop, you wouldn't even be able to go outside and enjoy a peaceful game of tennis, baseball, or even basketball, all because without hand-eye coordination, you are clumsy and your depth perception is off.   If it weren't for hand-eye coordination, you wouldn't even be able to pick things up because your hands wouldn't go where your eyes were looking. Even though the computer isn't the only way to learn hand-eye coordination, it is still an important strategy that takes no effort to perform. If you are a social butterfly and love to converse with other people, then you simply must own a computer! Computers, cell phones, PDAs - they are all the same because they are all the same form of a computer.   When you think about it, our country would be nowhere without these spectacular devices. These computers helped to industrialize and grow our great superpower of a country. Can you imagine having to drive to people's houses just to talk to them? These machines get our messages and voices to people who can be all the way across the world in just a few seconds. They are a great innovation in technology.   Imagine having a paper for college or an assignment at work due tomorrow, and you have messy handwriting. There is no way you will get it done in time and have it be legible; and worse, you'll be fired or expelled if it's not done. But your savior has arrived! The computer improves people's handwriting, speed, and research all at the click of a few buttons. With computers, there's no more need for long tedious hours of handwriting or searching through books at the library.   What would happen to us without this wonderful invention? The time has come for you to decide for yourself. Do you like this time-saving, teaching invention that you can socialize on, or would you rather go back to the stone age? Ultimately, the computer has revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate, making it an indispensable tool in our modern world.
1028	1030	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Computers are a great invention that we have created. Some people are concerned that individuals are spending too much time on their computers and neglecting time with friends and family. While this is a valid concern, it is essential to recognize the benefits that come from utilizing computers in moderation.  One significant advantage of spending time on a computer is the opportunity to learn something new every minute. Whether it's through online research, educational videos, or interactive tutorials, the wealth of knowledge available on the internet is endless. By exploring different websites and resources, individuals can expand their understanding and skills in various subjects.  Additionally, computers serve as a valuable tool for communication and social interaction. In today's digital age, staying connected with friends and family members is easier than ever. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and video calls enable individuals to maintain relationships and engage in meaningful conversations regardless of physical distance.  Furthermore, computers offer the flexibility to multitask and combine different activities. For instance, individuals can exercise while watching online workout videos, listen to music while working on a project, or play online games with friends. This versatility allows individuals to enjoy recreational activities while staying productive and connected.  While it is important to balance computer usage with other aspects of life, it is essential to recognize the positive impact that computers can have on learning, communication, and overall well-being. By harnessing the potential of technology in a mindful and purposeful manner, individuals can maximize the benefits of computer usage while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Let us embrace the opportunities that computers provide and make the most of our digital experiences.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1029	1031	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a significant impact on people, both positively and negatively. Despite the drawbacks, I lean towards the belief that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. The internet, facilitated by computers, provides individuals with the opportunity to broaden their horizons and connect with others in a way that was previously impossible. For instance, I have three cousins living in @LOCATION1 whom I rarely see, but thanks to computers, we can stay in touch through emails and video calls. This has strengthened our bond despite the physical distance. Moreover, computers enable us to explore different cultures and countries without leaving our homes. Recently, while researching @LOCATION4 for a school project, I discovered fascinating information that sparked my interest in visiting the country someday. Additionally, computers have made it easier to make new friends and interact with diverse individuals worldwide. While there are risks involved in online interactions, with proper precautions, it can lead to meaningful connections. In conclusion, the advancements in technology, particularly in the realm of computers, have significantly enriched our lives by fostering communication, knowledge sharing, and global connections. Thank you for considering my perspective.
1030	1032	1	3	Computers and other devices play a crucial role in the lives of young people, offering various benefits such as communication, attention retention, and access to information. Communication is made easier and faster through technologies like cell phones, which allow for calling and texting. Email and video chat further enhance communication by enabling long messages and face-to-face interactions with distant loved ones. Technology also helps in keeping individuals engaged through games, music, and interactive instructions, making learning more exciting. Moreover, the internet, accessed through devices, provides a wealth of information on a wide range of topics, from directions to job offers. However, excessive reliance on technology can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and a disconnect from real-life interactions. Therefore, while technology offers numerous advantages, it is essential to strike a balance and not let it hinder physical activity or interpersonal relationships. Ultimately, the key lies in using technology responsibly and in moderation to fully enjoy its benefits without compromising overall well-being.
1031	1033	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 technology has grown exponentially in recent years, with the use of computers skyrocketing. However, this trend is not necessarily something to celebrate. The excessive use of computers can have negative impacts on people's health, relationships with family and friends, and their appreciation of nature.  Spending long hours in front of a computer screen can lead to feelings of sleepiness and irritability. The lack of physical activity while using a computer can contribute to health issues such as obesity and high blood pressure. Research has shown that prolonged computer use is linked to an increase in blood pressure levels. It is crucial for individuals to limit their computer usage in order to maintain good health.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can also lead to social isolation. Many individuals, especially adolescents, rely on computers for communication rather than engaging in face-to-face interactions. This can result in a disconnect from real-life relationships and can even lead to the spread of rumors and secrets online, causing harm to personal connections.  Moreover, the constant use of computers can hinder people's appreciation of nature. Instead of immersing themselves in the beauty of the natural world, individuals often opt for artificial digital experiences. The sensory richness of nature, from the sound of rain to the feel of cool lake water, is irreplaceable by any computer screen.  In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly brought numerous benefits, it is essential to recognize the potential drawbacks associated with their overuse. By limiting screen time and prioritizing real-life experiences, individuals can safeguard their health, relationships, and connection to the natural world. Let us remember to unplug and step outside to truly appreciate the wonders that surround us.
1032	1034	1	3	I support advances in technology because in the future, our world will be run by computers. People can learn about places and people that they can never afford to see for real, and this helps to connect people to other people without talking to them directly. Have you ever thought about the future? I know I have. Usually, when you think of the future, you imagine a world filled with automation and technology. The reality is that our world is evolving to be primarily run by technology. As we, the people, become more intelligent, so does the technology. What good is the future if none of us know how to operate simple technology like a computer? In the next few years, our world will rely heavily on computers, where we may not have to do much except operate them.  Without computers, how would we know about all the knowledge we have now? How would people learn about ancient civilizations like Egypt from thousands of years ago? They wouldn't have to physically visit the location; they could simply look it up on a computer and learn just as much. Computers allow us to learn about historical figures and events that have shaped our world. What if you wanted to learn about a past president? With a computer, you can easily access this information without having to spend hours in a library.  Some experts are concerned about the over-reliance on technology, but for many, it is the only way to stay connected with loved ones. Imagine having family members living in another country; how would you communicate with them? Using a computer to connect with them is convenient and practical. In today's society, computers have become essential for communication and staying in touch with friends and family.  In conclusion, maintaining technology in our lives is crucial for the future. It allows people to learn about new places and people, and facilitates communication with loved ones. While concerns about the lack of physical activity in children due to excessive computer use are valid, it is important to acknowledge the many benefits technology brings to our lives.
1033	1035	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 -in-@CAPS2, Computers are indeed valuable tools in our modern society, offering numerous benefits that enhance our daily lives. One of the key advantages of using computers is the improvement of hand-eye coordination skills. As we navigate through the keyboard and monitor, our hands and eyes work in harmony, strengthening this important cognitive ability. This development is not only beneficial for computer use but also translates to activities like driving, where precise hand-eye coordination is essential.  Furthermore, the wealth of knowledge available through computers is unparalleled. The internet serves as a vast repository of information, accessible to anyone with just a few clicks. Platforms like @CAPS3 provide a plethora of resources on virtually any subject, empowering individuals to expand their knowledge and skills at no cost. This easy access to information plays a crucial role in education and personal growth.  Despite some arguments against computer usage, they can actually enrich our social lives. Instant messaging services such as @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 enable real-time communication with people worldwide, fostering connections and relationships beyond geographical boundaries. Social networking sites like @CAPS5 offer a platform to share updates with friends and family, strengthening bonds and staying connected in today's fast-paced world.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in improving cognitive skills, facilitating learning, and enhancing social interactions. Embracing the opportunities they provide can lead to personal growth and enriched experiences in various aspects of life. Thank you for considering these perspectives on the benefits of computers in our daily lives.
1034	1036	1	3	Dear the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, Some people say that computers are a negative contributor to society. In my opinion, computers have a positive impact on the world around us. I believe computers give people hand-eye coordination and a way to be organized. Not only that, people are still interacting with others. If you don't believe me now, read on for more details and you'll feel the same way I do.  When you consider hand-eye coordination, computers give us this skill. There's no way to use a computer without typing. Whether you're just typing in a short password or a long essay, you'll always have to type, and this improves movement in your hands. This can later help you in sports when you get out and exercise. Since computers have become so popular, I think that in the future, typing or using a computer will be essential. This could be because of the hand-eye coordination computers provide. The theory is whatever you think, you type.  In addition to hand-eye coordination, computers provide organization which is a big concern in present-day life. Do you have picture files laying around your house? Well, there's no need to. With computers, you can store all your files neatly. With just a few clicks, you can make everything easy to find and locate. Even doctors use computers for your medical needs and keep track of your information. Computers can help us stay organized.  Furthermore, computers continue to help us stay connected with friends and family. Even if they are far away, computers keep us together. I'm not saying that it's always a good thing, because we all need face-to-face interaction. However, when you aren't able to get that, it's a good way to stay in touch. To conclude, computers positively affect our lives. We're able to improve our hand-eye coordination, stay organized, and connect with others when face-to-face interaction isn't possible. Despite what some may think, I believe that computers benefit society.
1035	1037	1	3	Dear editor of @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to express my concern about the lack of exercise people are getting due to excessive time spent on the computer. Many individuals are glued to their screens, neglecting physical activity and risking their health. It is crucial to raise awareness about this issue.  Firstly, prolonged sitting and minimal movement can have detrimental effects on one's health, particularly the heart. Sedentary behavior can lead to weight gain and various cardiovascular problems, ultimately impacting overall well-being. Encouraging people to prioritize exercise over excessive screen time is essential to prevent these health issues.  Secondly, the content people are exposed to online, especially children, can be harmful and inappropriate. Children may stumble upon disturbing images or information that is not suitable for their age, potentially causing psychological harm. Monitoring children's online activities and guiding them towards educational and safe websites is crucial to protect their innocence and well-being.  Lastly, chat sites can be breeding grounds for attention-seeking behavior and inappropriate interactions. Individuals, including minors, may engage in risky behavior or communicate with strangers who have malicious intentions. It is important to closely monitor chat sites and educate users about online safety to prevent any negative consequences.  In conclusion, it is imperative to address the issue of insufficient exercise due to excessive screen time and the potential risks associated with online activities. By promoting physical activity, monitoring online content, and ensuring online safety, we can help individuals lead healthier and safer lifestyles in the digital age. Thank you for considering these important topics for publication.
1036	1038	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I understand your perspective on the potential benefits of a world without computers. The idea of focusing more on exercise, enjoying nature, and strengthening relationships with family and friends is indeed appealing. It is true that excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, disconnect from nature, and reduced social interactions. These factors can have negative impacts on physical health, mental well-being, and overall quality of life.   However, it is essential to acknowledge that computers also play a crucial role in modern society. They have revolutionized communication, education, work efficiency, and access to information. In today's digital age, computers are essential tools for many aspects of daily life. They facilitate global connections, enable innovative advancements, and provide numerous opportunities for growth and development.  While it is important to find a balance between technology use and other activities, completely eliminating computers may not be a practical solution. Instead, promoting a healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise, outdoor experiences, and meaningful interactions with loved ones is key. By incorporating these elements into our lives, we can enjoy the benefits of technology while also prioritizing our well-being and relationships.  Ultimately, the choice between having computers or not is a personal one. It is crucial to recognize the value of technology while also prioritizing physical health, connection with nature, and meaningful relationships. Finding a harmonious balance between the two can lead to a fulfilling and enriched life.
1037	1039	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some parents are concerned about their child spending too much time on the computer. While there are valid reasons for these concerns, there are also many positive aspects to consider. One benefit of using computers is the ability to communicate with others. Whether it's chatting with friends about schoolwork or connecting with people from different countries, the internet provides a platform for social interaction. Additionally, computers offer a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips. Websites like @ORGANIZATION2 can provide valuable information that can be beneficial for personal growth and education.  However, there are downsides to excessive computer use as well. One major issue is the risk of developing an addiction to technology. It's easy to get caught up in endless hours of screen time, neglecting other important aspects of life. Another concern is the threat of viruses, which can not only damage the computer but also compromise personal information. Lastly, spending too much time on the computer can lead to isolation from family and friends, hindering real-life social interactions.  To strike a balance, it's important to set limits on computer usage. Encouraging children to engage in other activities, such as outdoor play or hobbies, can help prevent overreliance on technology. By promoting a healthy relationship with computers, children can enjoy the benefits of technology while also maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle.
1038	1040	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON2 and I am here to give you @CAPS1 opinions about computers. Computers are fun and educational. They have lots of websites for games. Such as portaportal, @NUM1.com, they have safe fun games for kids under @NUM2. They also have educational websites that help you with your work. Such as google. Ask your question.com these websites have all the info on things you need help with. They also have @CAPS2, facebook. Yes I know there has been rumors about people threatening over chats. But other than that your able to chat with your friends instead of waiting for your mom to get off the phone. @CAPS2 lets you meet new people without having to tell them who you are. @CAPS1 opinion is that computers are safe in different occassions but are also very fun & educational.  Computers offer a wide range of opportunities for both entertainment and learning. They provide access to various websites that cater to different interests and needs. Despite some risks, such as potential threats in online interactions, the overall benefits of using computers outweigh the drawbacks. In conclusion, computers are valuable tools that can enhance our experiences and knowledge in numerous ways.
1039	1041	1	3	I think that people should limit their computer usage in order to spend more quality time with their family and friends. While computers can be useful for entertainment and communication, excessive use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and isolation from loved ones. It is important to strike a balance between online activities and real-life interactions. By prioritizing time with family and friends, people can create lasting memories and enjoy a more fulfilling life outside of the digital world. It is essential to break away from the screen and engage in activities that promote physical, mental, and emotional well-being. So, make sure to step away from the computer and prioritize meaningful connections with those around you.
1040	1042	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I took a poll of @NUM1 people and @PERCENT1 of them agree computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can help people talk to someone in a far away place, teach people hand-eye coordination, and give the ability to learn about people or places. Using computers is a great way to keep in touch with someone. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION2. Some of the ways I keep in touch with them are e-mailing, video chatting, and instant messaging. Some other good things about talking to people online is if you're talking to many people at once or if your parents are on the phone. Another good thing about computers is they are good at teaching people hand-eye coordination. The ways of teaching this are typing, and clicking on something, @CAPS1 people, when they type, look at the keyboard. But, with practice, they will advance to looking at the computer screen while typing. To click on something, you need to move the mouse while still looking at the screen. That, believe it or not, is hand-eye coordination. One last reason computers are good at helping people is if a student needs to look up a place or person for a school report, they can very easily go to google.com and type in who or what they are looking for. Another option is, say someone is going on a vacation to @LOCATION1 and they know nothing about it. They can go on the internet and get information on @LOCATION1 with just a couple clicks of the mouse. Finally, say someone wants to learn about @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 for fun: They type @ORGANIZATION2 in look at all the websites, choose the best one, and start reading. In conclusion, I definitely think computers have a positive effect on people for the reasons I have stated. People can talk to someone online, computers can teach hand-eye coordination, and finally, people can look a person or place up using the internet. This is my opinion on computers, I hope you agree.   Computers are indeed powerful tools that facilitate communication, enhance coordination, and provide easy access to information. Embracing the positive impact of computers can greatly benefit individuals in various aspects of their lives.
1041	1043	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 writing to talk to you about how computers benefit society. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 homes have at least @NUM3 computer in their home? Well who wouldn't! Computers let you learn more because you can research more, it's quicker than having to go and look things up in the library, and with tools like @CAPS3 and Facebook, you can talk to people you normally don't get to see.  Computers let you learn more because of the internet. With the internet, you can use websites like Google, @LOCATION1, and @LOCATION2. When you look stuff upon these websites and many others, you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life. For example, if I was looking up a chocolate chip recipe and I tried different things to make it unique then sold it, just think that life changed with one click on the computer.  Computers are very quick. I can make @NUM4 PowerPoint slides @CAPS6 with useful information in the time it would take me to go to the library, find a good book, and write enough information to make PowerPoint slides. On average, @PERCENT1 of people turn to the computer to find useful information. When I was doing @CAPS1 social studies project @TIME1, I had to find out what the @CAPS4 flag looked like. So, instead of trying to possibly find a book in the library, I just hopped on Google and clicked images and typed in @CAPS4 flag. Within seconds, my screen was filled with real and edited pictures of the @CAPS4 flag.  Have you ever heard of Facebook, Myspace, @CAPS3, or Twitter? Well, they are all great ways to communicate with people using the computer. When I am @CAPS3 or Facebook, I can talk to people that I might not get to see all the time. One of my friends from camp lives in @CAPS10, so I don't get to see her a lot. With the wonderful invention of Facebook, I could talk to her all the time.  So don't you want information to be easier to research? Quicker to find out information. And talk to friends more easily. Well, let's make it @NUM2 out of @NUM2 homes that have a computer and help benefit society by doing your part and just getting what you need on the computer then enjoying life. Just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer. With computers, society can continue to progress and connect in ways never thought possible before.
1042	1044	1	3	Do you really think we need computers to live? I agree that spending less time on computers and more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends is important. This is because our well-being and relationships with family are vital. We don't necessarily need computers to function; there are alternative ways to stay connected and informed. For instance, if we need to look up information, we can use devices like iPods. If we want to communicate, cell phones are convenient. In school, there are libraries available for research and reading. Reading is a great way to improve our knowledge and skills. If we struggle with understanding a topic, we can always ask our teachers for help during appropriate times. It's essential to avoid plagiarism by not solely relying on computers for projects. Some parents may not realize when their children are plagiarizing. The internet can have negative effects on children, so taking breaks and engaging in physical activities is crucial. Spending time with family, exploring nature, and staying active through activities like hiking, swimming, and biking are beneficial for our overall well-being. Computers should not replace these important aspects of life. Making a change to reduce computer usage and prioritize other activities can lead to a more fulfilling and balanced lifestyle. There is nothing to lose by making this shift.
1043	1045	1	3	I think computers have a very positive effect on people. All kids should have access to them. Computers teach life skills such as hand-eye coordination and technology knowledge. Expert studies show that a significant percentage of successful jobs involve computer interaction. Technology is an integral part of today's world and will only continue to grow. Therefore, it is crucial to introduce children to technology early on. My sister, for example, learned to use computers at a young age and excelled in her career because of it. Additionally, computers help children learn and communicate with each other, as well as research for school projects. Therapists suggest that kids who interact with others online are often more socially active. While there are concerns about online safety and screen time, setting limits and using parental controls can mitigate these risks. Ultimately, computers offer numerous benefits to children and should be embraced as a valuable tool for their development and future success.
1044	1046	1	3	I believe that computers are extremely beneficial in our lives. They help us in various ways such as learning, communication, and even in finding jobs. Through computers, we can improve our hand-eye coordination, explore the world, and learn important skills like typing. Computers also facilitate communication by connecting us with friends and family, even in times of need. Additionally, computers offer opportunities for economic advancement by providing access to job opportunities online. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing our learning, social interactions, and economic well-being.
1045	1047	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are destroying modern youth. The rapid advancement in technology is not a positive thing. The popular social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are putting youth at danger of cyberbullying and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. ""I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but every time I logged onto Facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live."" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is a victim of cyberbullying. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues, then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, 10 cyberbully victims have committed suicide. Those are 10 lives that could have been saved; 10 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spend time they could use exercising in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends 80% of their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In 2021, children spent 70% of their day in front of a computer and only 30% outside. Over the past four years, these numbers have headed south due to the advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our world's weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuaded you to make a stand and halt this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting cyberbullying which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives."
1046	1048	1	3	Dear readers, if I told you that every time you sit in front of a computer, you are that much closer to death, would you believe me? What if I said that computers are slowly destroying your lives? It may sound extreme, but the truth is shocking. It's hard to deny the negative impact that excessive computer use can have on our health and well-being.  One of the most significant drawbacks of spending too much time in front of a computer is the lack of physical activity it promotes. People who spend hours glued to their screens are less likely to exercise, leading to a sedentary lifestyle that can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and other serious health issues. While computers can offer virtual sports and games, they can never replace the benefits of real physical activity.  Moreover, research has shown that staring at a computer screen for extended periods can actually kill brain cells. The constant exposure to screens can hinder the production of new brain cells and negatively affect cognitive function. Instead of relying solely on computers for information and entertainment, turning to books and other sources of knowledge can help preserve brain health and function.  Additionally, excessive computer use can also impact our social lives and relationships. Spending too much time online can lead to isolation from real-world interactions, causing individuals to neglect their personal connections. Virtual friendships are no substitute for genuine human connection, and it is essential to maintain a healthy balance between online and offline relationships.  In conclusion, while computers can offer convenience and efficiency, it is crucial to be mindful of the negative effects they can have on our health, cognition, and social lives. By limiting our screen time, prioritizing physical activity, and seeking knowledge from various sources, we can protect ourselves from the detrimental consequences of excessive computer use. Let's take a stand against the harmful effects of computers and strive for a healthier, happier lifestyle.
1047	1049	1	3	Dear editor of my local newspaper,  I believe that computers have a positive impact on people and society as a whole. The advancements in technology, particularly in the realm of computer usage, have brought about numerous benefits. One of the key advantages of computer use is the improvement of hand-eye coordination. Just like practicing sports, playing computer games can help individuals enhance their hand-eye coordination skills. The act of defeating monsters or completing tasks in games requires quick reflexes and precise movements, which are essential in various sports activities. Therefore, spending time playing computer games can be a fun and effective way to improve one's coordination skills.  Moreover, computers provide us with the opportunity to learn about different places and people from around the world. Before the era of computers, obtaining information about faraway lands and cultures could be a time-consuming process, requiring extensive research and reading. However, with the internet and search engines like Google and Bing, acquiring knowledge about any topic has become much more accessible and efficient. This easy access to information enables individuals to expand their horizons and learn about diverse cultures and societies with just a few clicks.  Additionally, computers serve as a valuable communication tool, allowing individuals to connect with others across the globe. Whether it is staying in touch with friends and family members who are far away or meeting new people through online platforms, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate. Instant messaging, email, and video calls have made it easier than ever to maintain relationships and share experiences with others, regardless of physical distance.  In conclusion, the positive effects of computers on individuals and society are undeniable. From improving hand-eye coordination to facilitating learning and communication, computers have become an indispensable part of our daily lives. It is essential to recognize the numerous benefits that technology brings and embrace its potential to enhance our lives in various ways. By leveraging the power of computers, we can continue to explore new horizons, connect with others, and enrich our experiences in the digital age.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1048	1050	1	3	Dear @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, I'm sure you all have heard the sound of a mouse or people typing when you walk into various places like offices, libraries, or schools. Computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, allowing us to access emails, connect with family members around the world, and complete important tasks like research papers. In my view, computers have a significant impact on people and offer various benefits.  One noticeable benefit of using computers is the development of hand-eye coordination. Whether you're playing games or typing a document, using a computer can help improve this essential skill. Additionally, computers provide quick access to information on specific subjects that may not be readily available in books. For example, my friend @PERSON1 was able to quickly find statistics on type @CAPS5 diabetes using her laptop, showcasing the convenience of internet research.

This allows for quick exchanges of information, such as confirming meeting details or discussing homework assignments with classmates. The privacy and security features of email and messaging accounts also ensure that sensitive information remains confidential.  Overall, computers have become a vital tool in today's world, aiding students, professionals, and individuals in various aspects of their lives. The accessibility and efficiency provided by computers make them an indispensable technology that has greatly benefited society. Thank you for considering these points.
1049	1051	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, our society should have computers because they offer valuable learning opportunities and facilitate staying in touch with friends and family. Computers provide access to a vast amount of information that may not be covered in school or work settings, allowing individuals to expand their knowledge on various subjects. Moreover, they enable people to communicate with loved ones who may be far away or difficult to reach through traditional means. Whether it's through email, messaging, or video calls, computers make it easier to maintain relationships and bridge gaps in communication. Overall, the presence of computers in our society enhances learning and connectivity, making them a valuable tool for personal and professional growth.
1050	1052	1	3	Did you know that a significant percentage of children today prefer playing games on the computer over other activities? In my opinion, it is crucial for children to engage in activities beyond sitting in front of a screen all day. This is because physical exercise is important for their health, excessive computer use can lead to addiction, and being too reliant on technology may hinder their ability to navigate the real world. Regular exercise is essential for children's well-being, and spending excessive time on the computer can detract from their physical activity. Additionally, children who are addicted to computer games may neglect their responsibilities and struggle in school. Moreover, relying too heavily on computer games may prevent children from developing essential skills needed for success in the future. It is vital for children to strike a balance between screen time and other activities to ensure their overall development and readiness for the challenges of the real world. Remember, there are numerous opportunities beyond the computer screen that can enrich a child's life and prepare them for the future.
1051	1053	1	3	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1 and I believe that computers have a negative influence on people. When people are on computers all day they have less time exercising. They are in alot more danger, and they spend less time with there family. These are my only some reasons why computers dontbenefit society. In more, more time spent on computers equals less time exercising. With the obesity rate rising no one wants to be unable to do regular activitys. With spending all your time on the computer, you would just be using to get over weight and unhealthy. It also makes many people feel self consiou about themselves. If they dont have enough time exercising and keep eating they will become even more self consious. More over it will bring more danger to you and your family. There are many places on the internet where you can meet new people. But how do you know if people are who they seem to be? If you spend more time on the computer then you will increase your chances by @PERCENT3 to get a personal assuts, or even give you personal information up. So why should you take the risk? Just get off that computer! Even if you dont meet on internet assuter you will still be glued to your computer cauzing it more likley to be harrased. I definatly dont want that for my family. The last reason is the most important to @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 family. If you are spending all this time on your computer you will be out on in your family. This time is verry important because you never know when your family will be gone! And it is a verry scarry topic to think about. I know that most people in @LOCATION1 was spend all the time with there family. On another note a survey shows that @PERCENT2 of children that spend time with there family and less than @NUM1 minutes on the computer have grades higher than @NUM2 in all classes. Wouldn't you want to make the honnor role in your school? In conclusion, computers have a negiteve effect on people! Spending most time on your computer can causes less time spent exercising, more danger/harm to people, and less time spent with your family. Wouldn't you just rather spend less time on your computer? Thank you for your time.  In addition, it is essential to find a balance between technology and other activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Prioritizing physical exercise, safety, and quality time with loved ones over excessive screen time is crucial for overall well-being and happiness. Let's strive to limit our computer usage and focus on what truly matters in life.
1052	1054	1	3	Computers have become an indispensable tool in today's society, offering a wide range of benefits and uses. One of the most prominent advantages of computers is the ability to engage in various activities such as playing online games, surfing the web, watching videos, and chatting with others. These activities not only provide entertainment but also help in enhancing skills and knowledge. For instance, online platforms like www.MOCpages.com allow individuals to showcase their creations, interact with others, and engage in discussions.  Moreover, computers play a crucial role in education by providing access to a vast amount of information for research purposes. Searching for relevant material has become much more efficient with the use of keywords, saving time and effort that would have been spent on traditional methods like scouring through books. This convenience has greatly benefited students in completing assignments and projects effectively.  Additionally, computers serve as a vital tool in various sectors, including the military, where they are used for storing information, conducting attacks, maintaining records, and piloting aircraft. In personal life, computers aid in communication with distant family members and friends, as well as in completing tasks like typing up homework or documents.  In conclusion, computers offer a multitude of benefits ranging from entertainment and education to essential tools for work and communication. The versatility and efficiency of computers have revolutionized the way we live and work, making them an indispensable part of modern life.
1053	1055	1	3	To whom it may concern,  Many people find it enjoyable to spend time on computers, but it can become an obsession that leads to the loss of things they once cherished. In my opinion, excessive computer use can have detrimental effects on people's finances, weight, and sleep.   I have seen how my father's obsession with online financial deals has affected our family. With five children and only one laptop, it's difficult to find happiness when someone is constantly glued to the screen. The bills keep piling up as the obsession grows, potentially leading to the loss of important things like our home and stability.  Another issue I have observed is the impact of computer use on weight. It may be comfortable to lounge in a chair with snacks while gaming, but the consequences of a sedentary lifestyle can catch up quickly. Without physical activity, weight gain becomes a serious concern that can ultimately affect one's health and well-being.  Furthermore, excessive screen time can disrupt sleep patterns, as in the case of my brother who stays up late on his computer. Lack of sleep can have negative effects on eyesight, cognitive functions, and overall physical health. It's important to strike a balance and not let technology consume our lives to the point of neglecting our well-being.  As a young person, I enjoy using the computer but make sure to prioritize physical activity and time outdoors to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It's crucial to not let technology overshadow important aspects of life such as relationships, physical health, and overall happiness. Instead of being consumed by screens, it's essential to engage in activities that promote well-being and fulfillment.  In conclusion, while computers can provide entertainment and convenience, it's vital to use them in moderation and prioritize health and relationships. Excessive computer use can lead to financial struggles, weight gain, and sleep issues, ultimately impacting one's quality of life. Finding a balance between screen time and real-world experiences is key to living a fulfilling and healthy life.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]

1058	1060	1	3	Dear local newspaper, in today's digital age, the prevalence of computers has raised concerns about their impact on society. While these devices offer convenience and connectivity, they also come with drawbacks that can hinder our well-being.  One major issue is the decrease in physical activity that comes with spending long hours on a computer. With sedentary lifestyles becoming more common, the lack of exercise can lead to various health problems such as obesity and cardiovascular issues. Finding a balance between screen time and physical activity is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  Additionally, the time spent on computers means less time spent enjoying the beauty of nature. As more people are glued to their screens, the appreciation for the outdoors diminishes. The importance of nature in promoting mental well-being and reducing stress cannot be overstated. It is essential to disconnect from technology and reconnect with the natural world around us.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can lead to social isolation as individuals prioritize virtual interactions over face-to-face connections with family and friends. The quality time spent with loved ones is essential for building strong relationships and fostering a sense of belonging. It is crucial to strike a balance between online and offline interactions to maintain healthy social connections.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential to be mindful of the negative impacts they can have on our physical health, connection to nature, and relationships with others. Finding a healthy balance between technology use and other aspects of life is key to ensuring a well-rounded and fulfilling existence.
1059	1061	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, do computers have a negative impact on people? I believe they do. People spend excessive amounts of time on their computers, getting easily distracted from their work. The temptation of the internet is always present, leading individuals to veer off track from their tasks. In addition to the internet, games like @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and hearts can also serve as distractions on computers. Furthermore, individuals often express frustration and anger towards their computers when they encounter technical issues or malfunctions. This blaming and reliance on computers can hinder productivity and lead to unhealthy habits, such as neglecting physical activity. Overall, the overuse of computers can have detrimental effects on individuals' focus, productivity, and overall well-being.

1063	1065	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my name is @CAPS3 and I do not know where to start this letter. I am writing to express my belief that not everyone should use a computer. One of the main reasons for this is that excessive computer usage can lead to distractions that cause individuals to neglect their schoolwork. This distraction often results in lower grades and incomplete assignments, ultimately impacting their educational performance.   Furthermore, frequent computer use can also lead to a lack of quality time spent with parents. Instead of engaging in meaningful interactions with family members, individuals may become engrossed in their digital activities, further straining relationships and causing disconnect.   Moreover, prolonged exposure to screens and technology can have negative effects on one's health. From eye strain to poor posture, excessive computer usage can lead to physical ailments that can impact overall well-being. This lack of balance between screen time and other activities can result in a lack of a well-rounded lifestyle.   In conclusion, while computers can be valuable tools, it is important to recognize the potential drawbacks of excessive usage. By being mindful of the impact of technology on academics, relationships, and health, individuals can strive for a more balanced approach to computer usage. Thank you for considering my perspective.   Sincerely,  @CAPS3
1064	1066	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 there is a lot of debate surrounding the impact of computers on society, with some arguing for their benefits and others against. Personally, I stand on the side that supports the positive role of computers. I believe that they do more good than harm. One of the key advantages of using computers is the improvement in hand-eye coordination, which is particularly beneficial for learning musical instruments. Additionally, computers provide a wealth of knowledge and learning opportunities, especially for students. Without computers, students would have to rely on encyclopedias for research, which is much more time-consuming compared to a quick internet search. Furthermore, computers facilitate communication with loved ones who are far away.   Firstly, let's discuss the enhancement of hand-eye coordination skills through the use of computers. These skills are essential for tasks that require coordination between hands and eyes, such as playing musical instruments or engaging in sports like football. For instance, when playing the guitar, one must coordinate their fingers with the notes on the screen. Similarly, in football, players need to track the ball with their eyes and position their hands correctly to catch it.   Moreover, computers offer a vast world of learning opportunities. When faced with a question about historical facts or any other topic, individuals can easily access information through search engines like Google. This accessibility to a wealth of knowledge empowers students to conduct thorough research and expand their understanding of various subjects. Consequently, schools can challenge students with more advanced tasks knowing that they have access to a wide range of information through computers.  Lastly, computers play a crucial role in enabling communication over long distances. In today's digital age, maintaining connections with friends or family members who have moved away has become easier through online platforms. Unlike traditional long-distance phone calls that incur high fees, internet communication is cost-effective and convenient. By utilizing the internet, individuals can stay in touch with loved ones without worrying about excessive charges.  In conclusion, the benefits of computers in improving hand-eye coordination, enhancing learning experiences, and facilitating communication cannot be overlooked. It is essential for individuals to understand the positive impact of computers before engaging in debates or arguments about their significance in society.
1065	1067	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have computers, and @CAPS2 people use them. It's been brought to my attention that the government is worried about people using them too much. Well, I think you can't use a computer too much. They offer so many things such as information, communication, and life skills. Information is something we as humans live for. Also, in schools and jobs, you need to know a variety of unusual facts. Where can you learn these? Computers, of course! When @PERSON1 (my teacher) gives us a research paper on Walt Disney, we use computers to find our information. Without the computer, I wouldn't know Walt Disney died before Disney World opened. That clearly shows one of the many things we need computers for. Communication is another aspect of our lives. With a computer, you can have many ways to communicate. Yes, some of these ways can be dangerous, but many are safe. When I was in 5th grade, my teacher Ms. Casserelle set up a classwide email for us. This allowed us to email another school. This form of online communication was perfectly safe. As long as the person using these forms of communication is semi-responsible, nothing can go wrong. Where can you go wrong with that? Did you know that a large percentage of your life skills can and are learned on computers? As a matter of fact, your job likely involves a computer! One life skill you can learn is how to type. As I stated earlier, research papers need computers, well it's not just for the information. You have to type them too. Most jobs in our world need the computer for something or other. Can you think of a job that doesn't require one at all? I didn't think so. Information, communication, and life skills are all important to our human nature. I think computers are essential to humans. Whether you admit it or not, everything we do involves a computer to some degree. Can you spend countless hours on a computer? Yes, but you need to. Computers play a vital role in our daily lives, providing us with essential information, communication tools, and valuable life skills. It's clear that the benefits of using computers outweigh any concerns about excessive usage. So, embrace the technological advancements and make the most of what computers have to offer.
1066	1068	1	3	Computers have undoubtedly made a significant impact on society, but it is important to consider whether they make everything better. One major concern is the amount of time people spend on computers, which can have negative effects on both physical and mental health. While computers are essential for many tasks, excessive use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and weight gain. Being inactive while on the computer and snacking can contribute to obesity, which can have serious consequences for health and well-being.  Furthermore, computers can also contribute to drama and conflicts in people's lives. Social media platforms like Facebook and Formspring can be breeding grounds for cyberbullying and harassment. People may hide behind anonymity online and say hurtful things, leading to emotional distress and harm. Additionally, there are risks of privacy invasion and cyber threats, as hackers can access personal information and pose serious dangers.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is crucial to be mindful of the potential negative impacts they can have on individuals. It is important to find a balance and limit computer use to prioritize physical activity, mental well-being, and personal safety. By being cautious and responsible with computer usage, individuals can avoid the pitfalls associated with excessive screen time and protect their health and relationships.
1067	1069	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 of people use computers @CAPS2 for many different types of things. Computers are very beneficial to society. Even though people @MONTH1 use their computers too much, the tasks they complete help our world run smoothly. Also, computers allow us to keep in touch with friends and family that we don't see anymore, and they teach us valuable information very quickly. Without computers, society would not run as smoothly as it does now.  One way that computers benefit our society is by completing tasks such as writing papers and researching information much quicker. For example, if you, the @ORGANIZATION1, needed to quickly print an article in the paper on the devastating earthquake in @LOCATION1, computers would greatly benefit you because they would allow you to type the article much quicker than having to handwrite it. Computers are very beneficial to society because they allow us to complete things very quickly and efficiently.  Another reason why computers are very beneficial to society is that they allow us to maintain relationships with people from long distances and always keep in touch with old friends and family. Moving to a new country, computers have greatly helped me stay connected with friends from back home. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of college graduates stated that computers not only help them stay in touch with friends from their hometown but also allow them to see and interact with them through video calls, making the distance seem shorter.  Search engines such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, and more allow us to research anything we want to know at just the click of a button. This ability to quickly access information has a great impact on people's knowledge and intelligence. As @PERSON1, a computer scientist at @ORGANIZATION2, mentioned, ""The knowledge people gain from computer search engines allows them to do better things and achieve more in their lives.""  Computers benefit society by teaching us new information quickly, performing tasks efficiently, and enabling us to keep in touch with people worldwide. If it weren't for computers, things would take longer to accomplish, and society would not progress as effectively. We rely on computers to enhance our abilities, complete essential tasks, and live fulfilling lives."
1068	1070	1	3	I think spending a lot of time on the computer is not a good idea because it exposes you to harmful content online. This can include dangerous situations like kidnappings, which are often portrayed in videos and movies. Additionally, excessive computer use can have negative effects on your intelligence. After spending long hours on the computer, you may feel disoriented and less alert when you finally step away. Furthermore, constantly being glued to the screen can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, making you lazy and lacking in physical activity. This can have detrimental effects on both your mental and physical well-being. Overall, it is important to limit your time on the computer to avoid these negative consequences.
1069	1071	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that the use of computers can have both positive and negative effects on individuals. On one hand, computers can offer numerous benefits such as gaining knowledge and connecting with new people. For instance, spending time on a computer can help individuals learn how to troubleshoot technical issues, which can be a valuable skill in today's digital age. Additionally, engaging with individuals from different backgrounds and cultures online can broaden one's perspective and foster new friendships.  However, there are also drawbacks to excessive computer use. One significant concern is the potential for weight gain due to sedentary behavior. Many people spend hours sitting in front of a screen, leading to a lack of physical activity and unhealthy snacking habits. This can have adverse effects on one's overall health and well-being.  In conclusion, while computers can be powerful tools for learning and socializing, it is important to use them in moderation. Balancing screen time with physical activity and face-to-face interactions is key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By being mindful of the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use, individuals can harness the benefits of technology while also prioritizing their overall health and wellness.
1070	1072	1	3	Dear editor,  While some may argue that spending a lot of time on the computer is beneficial, I firmly believe that it is important for people to prioritize exercise, fresh air, and quality time with family and friends. Instead of being glued to screens all day, individuals should make an effort to engage in physical activities, enjoy the outdoors, and nurture relationships with loved ones.  It is concerning to see individuals, especially children, becoming increasingly sedentary due to excessive screen time. Instead of sitting indoors all day, they should be encouraged to participate in outdoor activities such as biking, playing sports, or simply going for a walk. Physical exercise is essential for maintaining good health and should not be neglected in favor of digital entertainment.  Furthermore, the lack of fresh air that comes with spending too much time indoors can have negative effects on both physical and mental well-being. People should take breaks from their screens to step outside, breathe in the fresh air, and enjoy the natural beauty that surrounds them. This simple act can do wonders for rejuvenating the mind and body.  Lastly, the importance of spending quality time with family and friends should not be underestimated. While online interactions have their place, face-to-face communication and shared experiences are invaluable for building strong relationships and creating lasting memories. Taking the time to connect with loved ones in person can foster a sense of belonging and deepen emotional bonds.  In conclusion, it is evident that excessive computer use can have detrimental effects on physical health, mental well-being, and social connections. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to strike a balance between screen time and real-world experiences. By prioritizing exercise, fresh air, and quality time with loved ones, people can lead happier, healthier lives.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1071	1073	1	3	To my opinion computers have a negative effect on people I think it has a negative because it causes people to get less exercise you spend less time with your family and friends and it distracts you from things get done. First of all computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get exercise. For example, there are many football, soccer and baseball games practicingg these they will just computer on the webcam all night. Another way is that you can get work done. WIthout even leaving your house. You can shop online, stay home and work online, and even go to college those things include getting out around, but now you can just day and do those things and be lazy. Second, the computer causes you to interact with people less. Now, when family or friends. i went over my I sat right and she didn't even look at me playing computer games. i know that a lot more kids too because I was reading in a magazine that @PERCENT1 of interacting with their kids as much as they got a computer. Lastly, i think the computer has a negative effect because it them. It distracts kids conversations first of all when people to talk with someone on the computer it is very hard because, they are absorbent in they're doing. Secondly, the computer distracts kids from homework. I know this first hand, because wherever I have in type up assignments I get and end up going on different websites, and not getting my work done. lastly, it distracts kids from household chores. Some kids just put them to the side and forget to do them because they're budy playing game or surfing the web. i know that if I did I'd get in big trouble. Those are the reasons why I think the computer has a negative effect on people. Because, it causes them to get less exercise, they don't interact with people, as much, and it distract them. So unless you want all those things happening to you, I suggest you spend less those on the computer!
1072	1074	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have been complaining about computers in our society, but they fail to see the numerous benefits they bring. Computers are a valuable source of information, allowing us to research anything we need to know quickly and easily. Gone are the days of searching through scrolls; now, information is at our fingertips with just a few keystrokes.  Moreover, using computers can actually improve hand-eye coordination. Typing on a keyboard and using a mouse require precision and dexterity, helping to enhance these skills in individuals, especially children. This can have long-term benefits beyond just computer use, as better hand-eye coordination is essential in various activities.  Additionally, computers enable us to stay connected with people who are far away. Whether through email, social media, or video calls, technology allows us to maintain relationships with loved ones regardless of physical distance. This is crucial for staying social and involved in each other's lives.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in our society, offering a wealth of information, improving hand-eye coordination, and facilitating communication with others. Embracing technology and its benefits can enhance our lives in many ways. So, let's appreciate the value that computers bring and continue to utilize them for our betterment.
1073	1075	1	3	Dear readers, today I want to discuss the impact of computer usage on individuals. Computers have both positive and negative effects on our lives. On the positive side, computers provide us with various means of communication. Whether it's through online chatting, emails, or social media platforms, staying connected with others has never been easier. Additionally, computers are essential for getting work done efficiently. They have become indispensable tools for tasks such as creating presentations, writing essays, and analyzing data.  However, excessive computer usage can lead to negative consequences. One major concern is the sedentary lifestyle that often accompanies prolonged computer use. Spending long hours in front of a screen can contribute to health issues such as obesity and poor posture. It is important for individuals to balance computer use with physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits in terms of communication and productivity, it is crucial to be mindful of the potential negative effects of excessive use. Finding a balance between utilizing technology for its advantages and prioritizing physical well-being is key to leading a healthy and fulfilling life. Let's embrace the benefits of computers while also taking care of our health and well-being.
1074	1076	1	3	To the editor of the @ORGANIZATION2, I am writing to state my opinion as to whether computers benefit or harm society. I believe that computers are a great tool for several reasons. First, computers are a learning resource and a way for people to stay updated with the world around them. Additionally, computers keep us connected with friends and family more easily. Clearly, computers are more helpful to people than they are harmful. Life as we know it today would be greatly altered without the advances in computer technology that have been made over the past few decades.  Today, if I need to know something, whether it be for @ORGANIZATION1 or my own reasons, I can almost instantly look it up and get answers from many different sources. This helps people to be more educated and updated with the world around them. Dr. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 recently performed a study on high @ORGANIZATION1 teenagers and concluded that those with access to computers scored significantly better on standard testing due to the background information they have acquired online.  Along with the internet, there are programs such as @ORGANIZATION4 and @ORGANIZATION3, which help people to learn a new language or write on the computer. Also, computers keep us updated with events that are happening in the world. For example, when the earthquake devastated @LOCATION1, I first saw it on the news but got very few details. I then looked it up online and immediately got the death toll, the aid that was being given, and ways I could help donate. Without computers, I would have known none of this.  Another reason why computers are so helpful to society is that they are tools that help us keep in touch with others. With things like Facebook and @CAPS2, I can chat with people, invite friends over, and even plan parties. Without computers, I would need to call each person individually, but with computers, I can write one message and send it to everyone all at once. This gives me more time to do things like play outside and exercise. Also, things like @CAPS3 and Facebook help people stay in touch with old and distant friends.  Studies done by @ORGANIZATION5 show that @PERCENT1 of people with some type of social networking account have a more active social life than those who do not. According to doctor @PERSON1, this means that these people will have an easier time adapting to different social situations than those who do not. Clearly, this is a great benefit.  In conclusion, the computer helps society a great deal more than it hinders it. It easily allows people to stay educated, updated, and connected. It helps people stay aware of the world around them and educated about everything. It makes things that would otherwise take lots of time very quick, giving people the chance to do other things such as playing outside. It keeps people socially capable and active, and allows people to connect with others. Without a doubt, computers are a very good thing.
1075	1077	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, the excessive use of computers can have negative effects on people's lives, especially children. Spending too much time on activities like gaming, social media, and email can hinder physical activity, social interaction, and overall well-being. It is important for both children and adults to balance their time on the computer with outdoor activities, sports, and learning experiences.   Furthermore, the content individuals post online can have long-term consequences, affecting their future opportunities. Inappropriate photos or comments on platforms like MySpace or Facebook can impact one's professional reputation and career prospects. Additionally, there are risks of interacting with strangers, including potential encounters with predators posing as someone else online.  Therefore, it is crucial for parents to monitor their children's online activities and educate them about the potential dangers of the internet. By promoting a healthy balance between computer use and other activities, individuals can protect themselves from negative consequences and enjoy a well-rounded lifestyle. It is essential to be cautious and mindful of the impact that excessive computer usage can have on one's life.
1076	1078	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1: you recently posed a question in you Newspaper. The @CAPS2 yourk @CAPS3, asking if the readers were for or against technology. I support computers because they give one opportunity to learn about different people all over the world and their culture, they save massive ammounts of time in today's hustle-bustle society, and you can talk to people online via certain computer programs.  With a computer, one can learn scores of information about foreign countries and their culture. I read an article in the @CAPS4 @CAPS3 about a man who was participating in a church program in which a foreign citizen would come to @LOCATION2 for a while to make friends and learn about the @LOCATION1. This man, @PERSON1, was assigned a woman from the farms of @CAPS6 who had never been out of the fields. @PERSON1 thought it would be nice to welcome her into his house with a familiar setting. Unfortunately, he knew nothing about @CAPS6. He did have a computer, though, which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home. When the woman stepped into his door, she was ecstatic to feel like she was home again. She ended up staying with @PERSON1 and getting married. If he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer, she might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him.  Also, @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 says that language students, such as Spanish and French, have a 10% higher success rate if they have a computer to learn more about the countries. He says the average grade for kids with a computer is an A, but the average grade for kids without a computer is a C+. Therefore, having a computer to learn about faraway places and people can ensure happiness and success in the future.  Computers also save a massive amount of time. In the school Newspaper, @PERSON6 told about her homework problem. ""Last night I had 3 hours of homework. I had vocab words galore to deal with. I had to look up each word in the huge dictionary, I was failing my classes because I just didn't have the time for my homework! Then my family bought me a computer, it was so nice using the online dictionary. I could finish my homework in 30 minutes compared to 2 hours! I was finally doing well in my classes."" Without her computer, @PERSON6 would have had to spend 2 hours. She would have just kept failing without her time-saving computer.  Also, @PERSON3 says that 70% of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening on the radio. He says that 85% of people get a promotion because their boss is so impressed with their consistent timing. As you can see, time is a valuable thing which computers can help save.  Finally, computers allow one to talk online. A student once had the misfortune to break one of his vertebrae. The doctor told him that he would not be able to participate in school for a month. The student, @PERSON5, came up with a plan to speak to his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Everyday, the teachers would give @PERSON5 an update over his computer. When he finally marched back into school, @PERSON5 barely had any work to make up because his teacher had interacted with him over the computer. Without his computer, @PERSON5 would have a month's worth of work and learning to make up which would have been overwhelming.  Also, @PERSON4 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that students that communicate with their families during college have better relationships after college. Obviously, being able to talk to someone over the computer is a useful thing to have.  In conclusion, having a family computer is a very good thing. Not only does it allow people to learn about places other than their home, it also gives us more time and allows us to talk to others without ever leaving the comfort of home. I recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer."
1077	1079	1	3	Dear newspapers, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people in various ways. One major benefit is the ability to chat online, allowing individuals to connect with others from all over the world. Additionally, there are educational electronics available for children that can be connected to computers, helping them learn important skills such as the alphabet, numbers, and spelling.   Moreover, the convenience of being able to pay bills online is a significant advantage of using computers. Instead of having to physically go to a local office, individuals can easily manage their finances from the comfort of their own homes. Furthermore, social media platforms like Facebook and Myspace enable people to connect with others, discover new friends, and even find long-lost acquaintances.  In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of benefits that enhance communication, education, and convenience for individuals. With the continuous advancements in technology, it is clear that computers will continue to play a crucial role in our daily lives for the foreseeable future.
1078	1080	1	3	People should spend less time on computers because of several reasons. Firstly, excessive online gaming can lead to addiction among children, causing them to spend hours glued to the screen. This not only hinders physical activity but also affects their overall well-being. Secondly, the excessive use of social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, AIM, and others can lead to unnecessary conflicts and rumors among both children and adults. It is important for people to limit their time on these platforms and focus on real-life interactions. Lastly, children should prioritize outdoor play and physical exercise over screen time. Spending time outdoors can help in developing physical strength and social skills, which are essential for overall growth and development. In conclusion, reducing computer usage and increasing outdoor activities can have numerous benefits for individuals of all ages.
1079	1081	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I believe that computers can have negative effects on people in this world. While they do offer advantages, there are also significant drawbacks to consider. Some individuals misuse computers for inappropriate activities, such as accessing pornographic websites or hacking into secure servers. This misuse goes against the intended purpose of computers, which should be focused on positive endeavors. Moreover, the anonymity of the internet can be dangerous, as people may not always be who they claim to be online. This deception can lead to serious consequences, including crimes like kidnappings and murders. Cyberbullying is another concerning issue associated with computers, as it can result in harm to individuals and unresolved crimes. Additionally, excessive screen time on computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to problems like obesity. It is crucial for society to reconsider how computers are being used and to promote more responsible and beneficial practices. Let us strive to harness the potential of computers for positive purposes and prioritize real-world interactions and physical activity for a healthier and safer world.
1080	1082	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, You use a computer a lot right? Good if you @CAPS7 because @CAPS7 you believe that experts are questioning why @CAPS5 use them a lot? Well I think people need them because it's how @CAPS5 know what's going on in the world, it's how @CAPS5 know how the weather is like so accidents can be avoided, and you can flip on your @CAPS2.V., but then you have to wait for what you want to go on. So you decide @ORGANIZATION1, should @CAPS5 be outside more? Don't you need to know what's going on too? Of course you @CAPS7, everyone does.  I think that it is important that @CAPS5 know if a meteor is about to strike the world, right? President @PERSON2 even says the computer is where @PERCENT2 of the world gets info on what's going on. Are you just going to sit there and not listen to the president of the @LOCATION1? I don't think so. I'm sure that @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't want to be known as the accident State. That's why @CAPS5 need the computer! For people to know if it will snow, sleet, or if there is bad traffic, then @CAPS5 need to go to the internet to find out where and what time.  CEO of @CAPS3, @PERSON1, says, ""If someone says '@CAPS5 might be getting some snow or rain,' then they usually go right to the internet."" You can turn on your @CAPS2.V. to find out what's going on, but not all of it you will want or need to know. So you will have to wait. The internet just does it right on the spot. No waiting involved! (unless you have a bad internet connection). Do you think these reasons are making a good argument? I do. Do you use your computer for finding out what's going on, what the weather is like, and instead of the @LOCATION2? If so, I think you would agree with me. So, next time you question why people use computers so much, remember all the important information and convenience they provide in our daily lives."
1081	1083	1	3	I think that using a computer is fine because it allows us to connect with family members who are far away. Instead of just hearing their voices on the phone, we can actually see them and show them cool new things we have. It's great for keeping in touch with loved ones, especially when they are traveling.   Computers are also helpful for practical reasons, like when your car breaks down or you don't have access to transportation. You can shop online from the comfort of your own home, with many stores offering delivery services. You can even buy food online and find great deals to save money.   There are also many entertainment options available on computers, such as dating sites to meet new people, free online games to play with friends, and the ability to watch movies and shows online. Overall, computers offer a wide range of benefits and can enhance our lives in many ways. While it's important to balance screen time with outdoor activities, the convenience and opportunities that computers provide make them a valuable tool in today's world.
1082	1084	1	3	Computers offer numerous benefits to people in various aspects of life. They serve as valuable tools for tasks like homework, research, and project creation. With access to the internet, individuals can easily find information and resources to aid in their endeavors. Additionally, computers facilitate social interaction by enabling communication through platforms like social media and messaging apps. This allows people to connect with others, regardless of physical distance, and maintain relationships. While it is important to balance computer usage with physical activity, incorporating technology into daily life can enhance productivity and communication. Overall, computers are a valuable resource that can greatly benefit individuals in today's digital age.
1083	1085	1	3	Computers have truly revolutionized the way we live our lives. They have provided us with a wealth of information about countries all over the world, making it easier for us to learn about different cultures and places. Additionally, computers have made it possible for us to stay connected with our loved ones through video chats and messaging services, saving us money on long-distance calls. Moreover, computers have simplified tasks in the workplace, making jobs more efficient and productive. With the constant advancements in technology, it is exciting to think about how computers will continue to evolve and improve our lives in the years to come.
1084	1086	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 post, I have been pondering about the impact of computers on our daily lives. I agree with experts who argue that people are spending excessive amounts of time on their computers, neglecting other activities. I believe that everyone, myself included, is guilty of spending too much time online. Even if it is for research purposes, wouldn't it be more beneficial to immerse ourselves in a book for information? The same can be said for computer games; wouldn't it be more enjoyable to play virtual kickball outside? Computers hinder us, as they consume our time and prevent us from engaging in physical activities. The more time we spend on computers, the less time we have to enjoy the outdoors. Instead of staring at a screen, we should be interacting with nature and participating in physical activities. Setting time limits on computer usage could encourage us to be more social and active. Additionally, computers cannot physically help us or promote physical activity. As a cheerleader, I have realized that watching videos online to learn new techniques does not compare to having a physical instructor guide me. Lastly, reducing our time spent on computers would be beneficial for our overall well-being. After spending extended periods online, I often feel lethargic and unproductive. However, when I spend time outdoors, I feel energized and active. In conclusion, while computers are valuable tools, excessive usage can have detrimental effects on our health and well-being. Thank you for reading.
1085	1087	1	3	You say that computers are bad for today's society? I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit today's society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can go log onto Facebook and do everything a phone has to offer and more. Computers are essential for schoolwork, with programs like Windows and Microsoft Office providing tools for professional-looking assignments and projects. Google, the most popular search engine, offers a wealth of information and resources for all kinds of needs. In conclusion, computers have greatly benefited us in various aspects of our lives, making tasks easier and more efficient. So next time you think computers are bad for society, think again and recognize the countless ways they have improved our daily lives.
1086	1088	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever wanted to see the whole world with just a click of a button? That is as simple as going out and purchasing a computer. Computers are becoming increasingly popular, and some may argue that people are using them too much. However, computers offer numerous benefits that cannot be overlooked.  First and foremost, computers are invaluable tools for academic purposes. Whether you need to write an essay, research a topic, or understand a challenging assignment, computers provide easy access to information and resources. For instance, word processing software like Microsoft Word can help you track the word count of your essay, ensuring you meet the required length. Additionally, the internet offers a vast array of educational materials that can aid in your studies and enhance your learning experience.  Furthermore, computers enable individuals to connect with people from all around the world, facilitating cultural exchange and language learning. By joining online chat rooms or social networking platforms, you can interact with individuals from diverse backgrounds and gain insights into different cultures. This interaction not only broadens your perspective but also fosters understanding and appreciation for global diversity. Moreover, it presents an opportunity to learn new languages and customs, enriching your overall knowledge and social skills.  Lastly, computers allow you to explore and understand the world around you in unprecedented ways. Through satellite imagery, online research, and educational websites, you can delve into topics such as environmental conservation, natural phenomena, and even outer space. By utilizing these resources, you can expand your awareness of the planet, its ecosystems, and the universe at large.  In conclusion, computers offer a wealth of benefits that extend beyond mere entertainment. From aiding in academic tasks to fostering global connections and facilitating exploration, computers play a crucial role in enhancing our knowledge and understanding of the world. So, while it's essential to balance screen time with outdoor activities, embracing the potential of computers can open up a world of learning and discovery.
1087	1089	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I have the same questions for you and I was hoping you could answer them. I was wondering, do you have any computers in your house, if so how many? Also, do you like using the computer? I am trying to figure out how many people don't use computers because I want to ask them how do they survive without one!? Computers are essential to our present day lives. Everything in the world is in one computer. You can talk, email, even see people through a computer because nowadays everyone has a videocam hooked onto their computer. I want to tell you all of the great things computers do not make our lives so much easier. People are always looking for a way to get in touch with someone like if your phone is dead, how are you going to tell your friend what time you're going to meet at that place? You can easily just text her from the computer. You can either use your screen-name to text someone or just go on Verizon, AT&T, Sprint... etc.com and text people from there. It would save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it. Has there ever been a time where you needed a number, but you couldn't find your telephone book? It sure has happened to me, but you know what I do? I go on the computer and go on yellow pages.com and just look up the restaurant/place on the website. It's as simple as that. You can look up almost anything on the computer, prices, places, facts, anything! Most of the time the true facts will always be there. Computers help you a lot if you need help on historical, scientific, and @CAPS2 facts. Computers help us every day. People need them for communication, telephone numbers, or facts about anything. Most of someone's life can be saved on the computer. If you have bad handwriting, then you could just type up your paper and hand it in all nice and neat. Like I said before computers are essential to our present day lives @CAPS3 reading this, I bet you'll agree.   Computers play a crucial role in our daily lives and have become indispensable tools for communication, research, and organization. They have revolutionized the way we access information and connect with others, making tasks more efficient and convenient. In a world where technology continues to advance rapidly, embracing the use of computers has become essential for staying connected and informed.
1088	1090	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion about computers is that they benefit people by providing assistance, entertainment, and communication. Computers are valuable tools for individuals as they can help with research, writing papers, and solving complex problems. Additionally, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options such as social networking sites, streaming services, and online games. Moreover, computers facilitate communication by allowing people to connect with others around the world through video calls and messaging platforms. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing the lives of individuals by offering various benefits and opportunities for interaction and entertainment.
1089	1091	1	3	Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, People say that technology is affecting everybody left and right. Computers actively help us with our daily lives. It helps us do project for school, let us understand culture around the world, and gives us the ability to talk and connect with friends and family everywhere. Our shool makes us do tons of project and the computer is our main course. If you want to go somewhere far away, you're most likely to research it, and then plan on going. It is also might be used to talk with friends on facebook, twitter, and @CAPS3. Computers help us learn and communicate. To start off, as an eight grades, we are prepared to go to high school. Fortunately, it means we do projects, reports, and research on the computer. The computer enables us to find information for a project, or construct a diagram or data table for a survey. Many people use this method for jobs. People do reports on celebrities and famous people from history. Books can't always give the information you are looking for, so they look up that persons name, and they will find our hundred of web sites that give information and photographs of that person. In addition to, computers let you book flights, buy, tax rates. Sometimes, people don't always to go and drive to a local car, so they go online to a website that sells, and they are able to look at all of the features of the car, the price, and mileage. The only way you can get tickets is if you go onto the internet. They have websites that let book whatever kind of flights you want. It can be to go to florida, or it can be a flight to @LOCATION1. If you also how the economy is doing, you can look up tax rates and how find out how much our country is in debt. You can even find out how much an average family pays - every year. Computers can be very they resourceful at @CAPS2. It gives capability to do more than you can imagine. Most importantly, computers have created a way for you talk to friends and family around the globe. Facebook and twitter are the new things of the century. Facebook and twitter let you talk to friends, post photos and talk about your personal life. They have a new thing now where you can play lifestyle games. @CAPS3 is not as popular anymore and doesn't have as many cool things. It only let's you talk to friends and that's why no one uses it anymore. People want to be able to do more than just talk. It comes to my attention that computers have over time. Computers these days enable you to talk with friends, do research and projects, and let you book flights and buy cars. Our school's curriculum has many projects and reports. They can be done only by the help of a computer. You can research people and places and or get pictures. You can also book flights for far away trips and buy cars and other items off the internet. We even have the capability to talk with friends on facebook and twitter. Computers have a positive influence on people. Technology is truly shaping the way we live our lives, making tasks easier and connecting us with the world in ways we never thought possible.
1090	1092	1	3	"Dear Parents,  Are you always telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer? Well, I might just be able to help. Computers do not benefit our society today. People are spending too much time on them, not enjoying the outdoors, and taking away time to spend with friends and family. I believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems. Computers can be very distracting and you can use them too often. Staring at the computer screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells. That's one thing kids and adults don't notice. You need your brain cells for school, jobs, and other activities; computers can also distract you from completing work, and then you have to stay up late to finish homework. Schoolwork should come before the computer. Time flies by as you're clicking and typing. The next thing you know, it's ten o'clock and your work is not completed. Since my schedule is so busy after school, I try to complete my work, then go to the computer before dance. This way, I am with my friends and can relax. Taking time away from the computer is a smart idea.  As it comes to summer time, the weather is going to be beautiful, and you don't want to waste a pretty day on the computer. Our human body needs oxygen. Clearly, computers don't supply that. A great way to receive oxygen is going outside for some exercise and energy. Playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or play sports. My doctor once told me, ""Everyone should have at least an hour of exercise a day."" You can't accomplish that by sitting at your computer. Next time there is sunshine out, no matter what season it is, go outside and take a break from electronics.  Spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer. Friends and family are not people to take advantage of. They are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh. When your relatives come to town that you haven't seen in a while, you don't want to spend it on the computer. Talking and catching up with one another is a great way to re-connect. During family holidays, we don't bring our computers. We shut them off to spend time with each other. Friends and family are special gifts. So, don't throw away friendships or relationships with your family. Get away from the computer and bond.  Remember, balance is key. Limit your time on the computer, enjoy the outdoors, and make time for family and friends. Your overall well-being will thank you for it."
1091	1093	1	3	Dear Newspaper, it has come to my attention that some people have been concerned about using computers too much. Well, I disagree with this statement. I think the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination. The computer also lets you explore more about foreign people and places. Lastly, computers help you communicate with others.  As previously stated, I believe computers are beneficial because they improve hand-eye coordination. For example, typing papers for school or work requires coordination, and as you become more adept, your speed increases. This skill is valuable and can be honed through computer use.  Furthermore, computers are essential in everyday life for learning about distant cultures and locations. Through the internet, you can access information from around the world without the need for costly travel. The computer serves as a window to the globe, broadening our understanding and knowledge.  Lastly, computers facilitate communication with friends and family. With just a few clicks, you can chat with loved ones near and far, staying connected regardless of physical distance. This social aspect of computers enhances relationships and fosters connections in a digital age.  In conclusion, computers are valuable tools that offer numerous benefits, from improving coordination to expanding our global awareness and enhancing communication. Rather than being a cause for concern, computers should be seen as valuable assets in our daily lives. Let's embrace the opportunities they provide and continue to utilize them for personal and professional growth.
1092	1094	1	3	Dear Newspaper,   The majority of people now possess computers, which have greatly advanced society and technology. While some may argue that computers have negative effects, the benefits they bring are undeniable. Computers have influenced people in many beneficial ways. For instance, technology is required in schools, where kids are taught to type their papers, allowing them to finish faster and potentially avoid staying up too late to complete their homework. This, in turn, is better for their health. Additionally, computers help develop hand-eye coordination, an essential skill for later in life.  In my opinion, computers have greatly contributed to advancements in technology. They enable us to explore places humans have never been before and to create and distribute items at a much faster pace. Moreover, computers allow us to learn about faraway places, different cultures, and diverse people, expanding our horizons and introducing us to new experiences.  Social media platforms like Facebook, used by more than a percentage of students in an average school, have revolutionized communication, enabling people to interact with others from all around the world without worrying about running out of cellphone minutes. Far from making people antisocial, computers actually facilitate more frequent and diverse forms of communication.  In conclusion, computers are more of a benefit than a burden. They have become an essential part of our daily lives, broadening our horizons and connecting us to people and places we never knew existed. Computers truly are the next best thing since sliced bread.
1093	1095	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I thought that I should express my concern. @CAPS4 are becoming too dependent on computers. @CAPS4 need to go outside more and be active. While some people @MONTH1 think we're not wasting our time on the computer, I believe we should only go on if it is necessary. People are always coming up with @CAPS2 gaming ideas to draw people in, but what people don't realize is that it doesn't only waste their time, it also wastes our money. Electricity bills are through the roof. Also, instead of going out to meet people, they are staying home and talking on social networking sites, which makes them less social. Children are not enrolling in sports, which makes them lose any physical strength they would get. Additionally, children could be getting overweight by just sitting there with no physical activities. While ideas like Microsoft Word are fine, going on every day for games is not. Teachers, parents, and all need to show them that the computer is not the only thing. Computers can benefit us very well by letting us have knowledge of something at the tip of our fingers, but they can also take away family and friend time. It affects everyone around you, not just the person using it. What we need to do is get together and unite. We need to go outside more, exercise, and limit our time on the computer. Therefore, let's make this a better place and get out and have a little time for going on the computer.
1094	1096	1	3	I think that having computers is essential because they enable us to connect with people, discover new information, and stay updated on various topics. With computers, we can easily find long-lost relatives or friends, communicate with others through platforms like MySpace or social media, and access a wealth of knowledge through online searches. For example, by using a computer, we can quickly check the weather in different locations, learn about the age of certain objects, and explore various subjects that interest us. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing our lives and expanding our horizons.
1095	1097	1	3	Dear fellow citizens, imagine having to acquire a book for every question you had - the time-consuming process of obtaining the book and then reading it would be a daunting task. Luckily, computers have revolutionized the modern world by providing us with quick answers, connecting us with long-distance friends, and offering entertainment at our fingertips. The versatility of computers is truly remarkable, with endless benefits that we may not even realize.   One of the most significant advantages of computers is their ability to keep us in touch with friends who are far away. Platforms like social media and online gaming sites enable us to communicate and interact with friends regardless of their location. Gone are the days when maintaining a long-distance friendship meant lengthy phone calls; now, we can chat with friends while multitasking and going about our daily activities.   Furthermore, computers provide us with entertainment options such as games, funny videos, and TV shows. Instead of waiting for a specific time to watch a show on television, we can easily access it online and enjoy it at our convenience. This convenience saves time and effort, making entertainment more accessible than ever before.   Lastly, computers enhance our efficiency in research and information retrieval. With the click of a button, we can find information much faster than searching through physical libraries. The convenience of online resources allows us to access a vast amount of information without leaving our homes.   Despite concerns about computers taking away from reading time, the reality is that they offer numerous opportunities for reading online or even having text read aloud. Computers have become an essential tool in our daily lives, providing us with more time to accomplish tasks and making our lives easier. As technology continues to advance, the benefits of computers will only increase, making them an indispensable part of modern society. Embrace the advantages of computers and make the most of their capabilities in this fast-paced world.
1096	1098	1	3	Dear local newspaper, there are several reasons why computers have an effect on people. Some individuals may not use computers wisely, getting caught up in the online world and neglecting real-life experiences. This can lead to negative consequences, such as isolation and a lack of personal growth. For example, a friend of mine became so engrossed in online interactions that he neglected his studies, lost touch with reality, and ultimately lost his sense of purpose. It is important for individuals to strike a balance between their online and offline lives to avoid detrimental effects on their well-being.  Additionally, some people may use computers to enhance their lives by utilizing online resources for travel planning, connecting with loved ones, or accessing valuable information. By using the internet responsibly, individuals can benefit from the convenience and efficiency that technology offers. However, it is crucial to prioritize real-world experiences and relationships to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.  In conclusion, while computers can have a significant impact on people, it is essential for individuals to use them thoughtfully and responsibly. By finding a balance between the online world and real-life interactions, individuals can harness the benefits of technology while safeguarding their well-being and personal growth.
1097	1099	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects that computers have on people is that more and more obese people. People tend to get moody. and it seems that computers are addictive. I think computers have a huge effect on people. The nubmer one thing is that more people every year are becoming obese because they do not leave the chair they sit inside for most of the day. Also they get so lazy they don't want to get up so they will just order food and have it delivered right to their hause. The next idea is that they do not get enought exersise, because they isn't sit there all day and don't move. But when they do move its to get something to eat or go get their phone. This is why they should limit kids and adults to only @NUM1 hours or less of computer time each day. @CAPS1 next reason is because people that are on computers tend to get . Like one second they are happy and once they get off the computer they are sad. They get all couped up inside for the whole day. They don't see enough because people don't see they . If they hour each day the moody ness would change. People need lot of exersise to maintain weight and muscle. @CAPS1 last receson the computers have effects on people is that people will tend to act addicted to the computer . Like if they are playing a game all day and don't realize it they will get addicted and not stop playing all day. People need to leave the computer and do something else like ride a bike or play a sport. In conclusion what I am trying to tell you taht it is not good that people stay inside all day and play on the computer, because it is hazardous to your health and it is putting you at a hgih risk of obesity. So can you please listen to @CAPS1 ideas.
1098	1100	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I have been reading about the debate about computers. People say that computers are teaching important skills. Others are saying that, ""People are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising."" @CAPS1, I think that people should be able to use computers (I mean they were meant to help us anyway) @CAPS2 think how much computers have helped the @CAPS3 race, from talking to friends/family in other countries to looking at what time the plane leaves to @LOCATION1. It is said that more than one million people use their computers more than once a day. Without the computer, there is no worldwide web which is connected to everything in this world. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to control any robotics, which would give more jobs, but the cost of food would go up tremendously. Without computers, the equipment wouldn't work in hospitals, computers can save lives, they store important information. We would have to go back into the dark ages with typewriters again. Another big issue is that people are overusing the computer. Once you learn to moderate the usage of your computer, that won't be a problem. Some people say computers cost too much. There are ways to put so-called ""down payments"" on computers, something like a but you pay each month and setting up the internet is easy as @NUM1. So, yes, there are good and bad things talked about computers, but without them, we wouldn't have a modern era. Then control the robot that makes your to the that saves lives, so with all this said I would like to say thanks for listening and go computers!  Computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, enabling us to connect with others globally, access vital information, and even save lives in medical facilities. While there are concerns about excessive computer usage, learning to balance and moderate its use can help us enjoy its benefits without negative consequences. The cost of computers can be managed through installment payments, making them more accessible to a broader population. Overall, computers have revolutionized our world and continue to play a crucial role in our advancement and daily activities."
1099	1101	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to share my thoughts on the positive and negative effects of computers. One of the main reasons for the success of computers is their ability to provide valuable information quickly and easily. Whether it's finding directions, researching a topic, or learning about a person, computers are incredibly useful. However, it's important to remember that not all information found online is accurate, as anyone can post on the internet.  On the negative side, computers can also pose risks, such as exposing personal information through unsafe websites or pop-up ads. These dangers are especially concerning for children, who may come across inappropriate content. Despite these drawbacks, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, with email communication being a common and convenient way to stay connected.  Additionally, advancements like video calls have made it easier to interact with others online, a trend that is rapidly growing. In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, it is crucial to use them responsibly and be mindful of potential risks.
1100	1102	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that the computer is not a bad thing because of three reasons. One reason is that we can learn about faraway places. Another reason is that they teach hand-eye coordination. The last reason is that we can talk to friends and meet new people.   From the computer, we can learn about faraway places, whether it be for a report or out of curiosity. We can discover the types of plants grown in different regions, such as tropical areas producing bananas and coconuts. Understanding their cuisine is also possible; for example, in Location 1, beans are a prevalent ingredient in various dishes, even salads. Additionally, we can explore languages spoken, like Spanish in Location 2.  Moreover, computers can enhance hand-eye coordination as they require finger and eye coordination for typing and using the mouse. This skill can be beneficial in various activities beyond computer use.  Lastly, computers provide opportunities for social interaction through platforms like MySpace, Facebook, AIM, and web chats. These avenues not only allow for connecting with existing friends but also facilitate meeting new individuals. Online gaming and organizing gatherings are also made easier through these digital tools.   Despite concerns about family time, setting boundaries and prioritizing face-to-face interactions can address these issues. In conclusion, computers offer valuable benefits such as learning about distant places, improving coordination, and fostering social connections.
1101	1103	1	3	I believe that the household computer can be incredibly useful for everyday tasks such as research, homework, artwork, and accessing a vast array of information. It serves as a valuable tool with endless possibilities, including a 24-hour online store, video games, and advanced calculators. However, while new programs and features constantly emerge, it's important to be mindful of the potential dangers of becoming addicted to the computer. Excessive screen time can lead to social isolation, strained relationships, health issues like carpal tunnel syndrome and poor posture. It's crucial to enjoy the benefits of technology in moderation, prioritizing a healthy balance between screen time and other activities. Remember, computers are meant to enhance our lives, not consume them entirely. Enjoy their capabilities responsibly for a fulfilling and well-rounded lifestyle.
1102	1104	1	3	Dear Readers, one of the most important inventions of the past decades is the computer, and it has its pros and cons. I think people spend too much time on computers, especially teenagers. They spend too much time on social media and gaming, and not enough time outside enjoying nature and playing sports or exercising. While they may talk with friends online, it is not the same as going to the park with friends and playing a game of baseball. Families also are distant from each other when they sit around on screens. Teenagers spend too much time on the internet when they should be doing more beneficial activities like reading.  I am sure we all know at least one obese person or teenager. The statistic that a high percentage of the population is obese is not exaggerated at all. In my opinion, it is the fault of the computers and the internet. Instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends, they go to the computer and chat and eat junk food. They spend their time watching pointless videos, while they should be playing sports. Computers are a large factor in obesity because they encourage people to sit around instead of being active.  The next pressing issue is the amount of reading the average teenager and adult does. Many individuals spend minimal time reading because they are too busy chatting with friends online. This lack of reading leads to missed educational opportunities and a decline in critical thinking skills. Instead of utilizing the resources available, individuals waste time on screens.  Computers and the internet are not only affecting our health but also taking away the experiences we could have in nature. Nature holds natural wonders that cannot be replicated by screens. Unfortunately, many people choose to spend their time indoors on computers instead of exploring the beauty of the outdoors. It is crucial to take action now to reduce the time spent on screens and start appreciating the world around us. Let's make a conscious effort to prioritize outdoor activities, exercise, reading, and preserving the environment. We need to take steps to ensure a healthy balance between technology and nature before it is too late.
1103	1105	1	3	"Dear editor, @TIME1 week, I noticed an article in the paper headlined ""@CAPS1 off the computer and go exercise."" This caught me off guard because there are many benefits to computers, such as enhancing education, learning about foreign countries, and connecting with others. In today's digital age, computers have become an essential tool in schools, providing easy access to information and helping students excel in their studies.   I remember a time when a question stumped the teacher, and we would turn to the computer for answers. It has revolutionized the way we learn and research, making projects easier and more informative. In art class, we used software like photoshop to create stunning visuals, bringing our ideas to life.   Moreover, computers open up a world of knowledge about foreign countries, their cultures, and histories. With just a few clicks, we can explore different parts of the globe and gain a deeper understanding of the world around us. Websites like @CAPS2.com keep us updated with the latest news and events, expanding our horizons beyond the classroom.   Additionally, computers allow us to stay connected with friends and family through email, instant messaging, and social media platforms like Facebook. These tools make communication fast and convenient, bridging the gap between distances and fostering relationships.   In conclusion, while exercise is important for our physical health, computers play a vital role in enhancing our education, expanding our knowledge of the world, and connecting us with others. They have become an indispensable part of our lives, shaping the way we learn, communicate, and interact with the world around us."
1104	1106	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, did you know that eight out of ten homes in @LOCATION1 have at least one computer if not more? Computers play a crucial role in our society, offering numerous benefits that impact our daily lives in various ways.

Moreover, computers provide a cost-effective alternative for long-distance communication, reducing the need for expensive phone calls or mobile devices.   In addition to communication benefits, computers also streamline tasks and improve organizational efficiency. For students, writing essays or completing assignments becomes more manageable and neat when using a computer. Businesses rely on programs like Excel to maintain data organization, enhancing productivity and reducing clutter. This efficiency not only saves time but also ensures accuracy in managing information effectively.   Furthermore, one of the most significant advantages of computers is the vast amount of knowledge they offer at our fingertips. With a simple search, individuals can access information on diverse topics, from recent global events to educational resources. This easy access to information promotes continuous learning and enhances our understanding of the world around us.   In conclusion, computers are invaluable tools that benefit not only individuals in @LOCATION1 but society as a whole.

1106	1108	1	3	Dear local newspaper, as you can see, about 20% of our population overuses the computer. They should be out getting fresh air and spending time with their family and friends. However, the computer can come with much use for many people. Family members often live far away, as well as some friends, making getting out of touch a possibility. The computer can also serve as a tool to learn about distant places, like Italy. It is frequently used for projects and essays, which are important for education. The computer can be utilized in many beneficial ways. One such way is to keep in contact with loved ones who are far away. It is a great way to stay connected and updated on each other's lives. For example, a cousin studying abroad can keep everyone informed through a blog. Learning about far away places is another advantage of using a computer. Online resources offer insights into the history and culture of different locations, providing a virtual tour through images and information. This knowledge may inspire individuals to visit these places in person someday. Additionally, in today's education system, students have numerous projects and essays to complete. A computer facilitates typing and editing, making the academic workload more manageable. On the other hand, the sedentary lifestyle associated with excessive computer use contributes to the rising rates of obesity in America. It is important for individuals to balance their computer time with physical activity and quality time spent with loved ones. Ultimately, the computer can have both positive and negative effects on people's lives. It is essential to use it judiciously and for beneficial purposes.

1109	1111	1	3	Being a teenager myself, I understand the importance of computers in our daily lives. They have become an essential tool for communication, research, and entertainment. However, the overreliance on computers may be hindering our ability to engage in more meaningful activities.  When it comes to education, computers have revolutionized the way we learn and access information. While they provide a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips, they have also led to a decrease in traditional research methods such as using books and magazines. Many young people today may not possess the skills to navigate through physical resources effectively.  Moreover, the prevalence of computers in our daily routines has contributed to a disconnect within families. Instead of spending quality time together, family members often retreat to their own devices, diminishing interpersonal relationships. The lack of face-to-face interaction can have a detrimental impact on communication and bonding.  Furthermore, the excessive use of computers has led to a disconnection from nature. People are spending more time indoors, glued to screens, rather than experiencing the beauty of the natural world. This disconnect not only affects our physical health but also our mental well-being.  While it may seem impossible to imagine a life without computers, it is essential to recognize the negative consequences of their overuse. Finding a balance between the convenience of technology and engaging in real-life experiences is crucial for our overall well-being.

1113	1115	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 a family. Just a normal family whose lives have been changed due to computers. They are overweight, constantly suffering from fatigue, lonely, nature deprived, and lazy. However, they could have turned out differently if they just shut down their computers. They might have been healthy, fit, energetic, radiant, hardworking people if they had stopped spending hours on the computer daily. Although there are some positive aspects to computers, the negative impacts can be dramatic. They isolate you from friends and family, deprive you of the nature around you, and most of all, they can cause you to become overweight or even obese.   Friends and family are two very important things in everybody's life, even if you don't realize it. By using computers rather than interacting with them, you are damaging the connections you have. Computers can cause you to isolate yourself. They might cause you to talk to your family less. Unfortunately, friendships can be strained. ""Spending long hours on my computer had caused me to become disconnected. It made me feel lonely, tired, and sad,"" says a family member. By reducing the use of computers, you are doing yourself a favor. Computers can deprive you of the nature that surrounds you. You are more likely to be on your computer rather than going outside. Instead of spending countless hours on the computer, you could be playing a sport or engaging in outdoor activities. By playing sports, you are improving your hand-eye coordination far more than if you were on a computer. Wouldn't you rather be having fun with your friends playing volleyball, basketball, swimming, or hiking rather than sitting in front of your computer?   The obesity rates of this country will increase if people continue to use computers excessively. You will miss out on physical activity, leading to a rise in obesity rates. Computers can ruin lives by increasing your chances of becoming unhealthy and overweight. So now, think about it; would you want to be lonely, overweight, and deprived of nature? I know I definitely wouldn't. This is why computers should be used less frequently! It's time to join together and raise awareness of the negative effects of excessive computer use. Let's make a change for the better."
1114	1116	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I am here today to state my reasons why I am against the usage of computers. My main reason for this is the negative aspects that come with using computers. For instance, the numerous pop-up ads that appear on websites can be overwhelming and often contain inappropriate content, especially for children. Additionally, there is a concern about who is online when individuals are using the computer. With a significant portion of people engaging in online activities every day, there is a risk of encountering online predators who target vulnerable individuals, particularly children. This poses a serious threat to their safety and well-being.  Furthermore, the lack of proper monitoring by parents or guardians while children are using the computer can lead to exposure to inappropriate content. Without adequate supervision or parental controls in place, children may access sites or materials that are not suitable for their age. This lack of oversight can have detrimental effects on their development and mental well-being.  In conclusion, the potential dangers associated with computer usage, such as exposure to harmful content and online predators, highlight the need for caution and vigilance when using this technology. It is essential to prioritize online safety, especially for children, and take proactive measures to ensure a secure and positive online experience. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.
1115	1117	1	3	Statistics show that more and more people are choosing to spend their time on computers rather than engaging in physical activity. This trend has led to a rise in obesity rates, as individuals are not getting the exercise they need to stay healthy. Additionally, there is a concern about online safety, as sharing personal information on the internet can put individuals at risk of being targeted by malicious individuals.  While some argue that technology has a positive impact on society, it is important to consider the negative consequences as well. Spending excessive amounts of time on the computer can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which in turn contributes to weight gain and other health issues. Furthermore, the potential dangers of sharing personal information online highlight the importance of being cautious and mindful of one's online activities.  It is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between using technology for enjoyment and ensuring that they prioritize their physical health and safety. By being mindful of the amount of time spent on computers and being cautious about sharing personal information online, individuals can work towards maintaining a healthy lifestyle while still enjoying the benefits of technology.

Always being on your computer is bad for your health. @CAPS5 you are a computer freak, you will become overweight, it's bad for your eyes, and you can't enjoy beautiful nature. ""@CAPS3 you want to be so heavy that you can't even lift yourself out of bed? I don't think so. @CAPS5 you are always sitting at the computer desk, then you might be like that. @PERCENT1 of doctors say that if @CAPS5 you don't get up from the computer desk, you will become obese! Being obese is terrible for your health. It can take years off your life. @CAPS5 you want to live a long healthy life, you need to get up from the computer and exercise. ""@CAPS4 I think I need a stronger prescription, my eyes are getting worse! @CAPS5 if something like this has ever happened to you, it's because your eyes are glued to the computer screen all day. @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS5 if you are at the computer all the time, you will need glasses or a stronger prescription."" @CAPS6 and children need to get away from their computers. Studies show that more adults are on computers, playing games than children. Have fresh, healthy eyes and get away from the computer. The breeze on your skin, the sun giving you the most beautiful tan. @CAPS3 you like the sound of this? Take a break from your computer and go outside. This is the amazing experience you can get from going outside. @CAPS5 if you sit at the computer screen all day, maybe you can watch someone else enjoying the great, relaxing experience you should have. Get up, get active, and go outside. Now is the time to step away from your computer. @CAPS5 if you haven't learned, the computer is an unhealthy thing for humans to use. Be like me and get rid of your computer. You need to be healthy, and most of all, active. Have good eyes and enjoy nature. Don't be glued to the computer."
1117	1119	1	3	Currently, there has been a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. Some people say that computers enable internet conversations between friends, and computers pass off information about faraway places and people. However, I tend to believe that the computer is not necessary. People exploit most of their time on computers, reducing their exercise time. Not many pay attention to nature, and instead of talking to friends on the internet, why not meet them at the park? Many people who use their computers reduce their metabolism. This is one reason why the United States has the highest obesity rates in the world. In addition, the less you exercise, the less healthy you will be, and the more pain you'll receive; you will feel more tense if your muscles are not exercised. If we, as humans, continue to lack exercise, there won't be many possibilities for us in the future. Isn't it difficult to know that people pay too much attention to the computer when there are endangered species in nature? Pandas, polar bears, whales of different types, and other creatures all need our help to fight this extinction problem. Unfortunately, we pay much of our attention to the computer; with consideration, as humans, we make things possible, so we should help creatures in need to survive for generations. Perhaps we will learn more about these creatures if we take time off of the computer to do so. Perhaps we will find nature more interesting. Why do we have text messaging on our computers if we have the ability to talk to our friends in a park? We have the freedom of speech in the United States. Our families need help occasionally, but sometimes we're not available. While reducing our social life, our computer hours are becoming more important and are distracting what's most important. In conclusion, by reducing computer hours, you must think about what can be done for nature, for your health, and for your family and friends. Let's not forget to prioritize real-life interactions and the well-being of our planet over excessive screen time.
1118	1120	1	3	Dear editor, I have heard about the ongoing debate regarding the advancements in technology. I believe that technology greatly benefits our society for several reasons. Firstly, it enables us to easily communicate with friends and family, bridging the gap between distances. For instance, when my friend moved to a different city, I was able to stay connected with him through online platforms, which would have been difficult otherwise.   Secondly, computers and technology provide a wealth of information at our fingertips, making research and learning more efficient. Instead of spending days searching through books for a project, I was able to gather all the necessary information within minutes online. The vast resources available online also ensure that we have access to a diverse range of knowledge and perspectives.  Lastly, technology can assist us in everyday tasks, such as finding directions, locating stores, and discovering new places to explore. During a vacation when my family got lost, the use of GPS technology helped us navigate our way back, highlighting the practical benefits of technology in our daily lives.  In conclusion, the advancements in technology have undeniably enhanced our society by facilitating communication, providing information, and simplifying everyday tasks. It is clear that technology plays a crucial role in improving our quality of life and connectivity in the modern world. Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.
1119	1121	1	3	Computers play a crucial role in assisting people in various aspects of their lives. They serve as valuable tools for accessing information quickly and efficiently, which is essential in today's fast-paced world. Whether it's for work, education, or personal research, computers provide a vast amount of knowledge at our fingertips.  Moreover, computers are instrumental in the learning process. They offer interactive ways to acquire new skills and information through online courses, tutorials, and educational websites. This accessibility to educational resources helps individuals enhance their knowledge and stay updated in their respective fields.  Overall, computers have proven to be invaluable in helping people navigate through the vast sea of information available today. Their ability to facilitate learning, provide quick access to information, and enhance productivity makes them indispensable tools in our daily lives. With the continuous advancements in technology, computers will undoubtedly continue to play a significant role in empowering individuals and enriching their lives.
1120	1122	1	3	I believe that computers have a strong negative effect on society but a stronger positive one. Computers these days are very advanced and allow you to talk to your friends, access information more efficiently, and have increased our manpower in scientific research. Almost every teen has a screen name that allows you to chat online with your friends. This function keeps kids in touch and active. Even though instant messaging can distract kids from their daily life, it can also be amazingly helpful. Just last week a friend of mine had forgotten to write down their homework and easily contacted me online. I was able to let them know in a matter of seconds. Likewise, with this online communication, you can also talk and video chat as if you were right there with your friends. Not every day do you get to hang out with your friends, so this is an easy alternative. Not only is it quick and easy, but it's free. Computers keep kids off their phones and from racking up the bill and causing those loud, annoying phone bill conversations about how to limit your texting.   The most important effect computers have on society is the gathering of information. The internet allows people to access millions of websites at light speed. Every second of the day, there is someone on the internet searching for data that they would have to go to the library to get. Computers are a key part of society, and we depend on them. Without them, we would all be lost. They provide an easier way of life that us lazy individuals need to survive. The internet keeps us updated and informed on what's going on all around the world without even going there. We need the internet, and we couldn't access it without computers. One of the largest aspects of life computers have helped us with is research. Computers have multiplied our manpower, giving us a more organized way to store data. Recently, I was watching a show where they had a computer testing items for a process that would take a human weeks. They also help us be different and more creative people. With the computer came smaller, more compact computers until they were able to fit in the palm of our hand. They have led us to think we can do greater things in life and keep our earth safe and to stop damaging it as much. They have led us to research the unknown areas of the world where years ago a scientist with a pad of paper wouldn't have dared to even think about. Computers have linked the world through communication and information and have propelled us to greater heights in understanding how we came to be. Overall, society needs computers, and they have an overwhelmingly positive effect on society.
1121	1123	1	3	Many computers that people have they use it everday right? Most of them be on it from the time they get off of work or out of school until it's time for them to go to bed. What I think they should to is find some other activity to do instead of sitting on the computer for six hours and not doing nothing with their life and plus at that when you look at a computer for so long you can mess up you eye sight. Why be on the computer all day when you can go outside and get some fresh aire? Why would you wanna be on the computer when you have family and some friends you could be spending time with and taken care of? You don't want to be lazy and not do nothing for yourself. You wanna be able to go for a walk instead of being cooped up in the house on the computer. Why would you even wanna be on the computer when you could have fun going out to eat or to an place you always have wanted to go your whole entire life? You can't always depend on a computer when you wanna go out and explore something new you have to try it out yourself to really see whats the whole thing about. You don't want to have a boring life now do you? Cause that's what it seems like by you sitting around on the computer everyday looking of a bunch of @NUM1-since you wanna do what you want to do and have fun by doing what you like to do. It's not easy finding a job or planing to go out far away by looking on the computer because you have to click a lot of numbers or pictures to go threw what you wanna get to when you can go and do it yourself by looking for better and other things to do. When you take a break from the computer, you can enjoy the outdoors, spend time with loved ones, and explore new experiences. Don't let your life revolve around a screen; go out and live life to the fullest.
1122	1124	1	3	"Dear @PERSON2 - @CAPS1, I strongly suggest that people do not spend as much time on computers as they do currently. People will benefit greatly from engaging in activities such as exercising or spending quality time with family and friends. Both of these alternatives are not only better for one's physical and mental well-being but also essential for building strong relationships and social skills.   Exercising is a fantastic way to replace the hours spent in front of a computer screen. Research conducted by @ORGANIZATION3 and the @ORGANIZATION1 studies revealed that the average person spends five hours daily on the computer. By reducing this screen time, individuals can allocate more time to physical activities, which are crucial for maintaining a healthy body. Additionally, @PERSON3 from @ORGANIZATION4 highlighted that ""@PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people do not exercise enough in the @LOCATION1 alone."" By prioritizing exercise over excessive computer use, individuals can take better care of their bodies and overall health.   In my personal experience, I abstained from using my computer for a week and dedicated that time to learning a new skill like mastering a backflip in gymnastics. This highlights the countless opportunities for growth and development that arise when individuals limit their computer usage.  Furthermore, reducing computer time allows individuals to enhance their social skills by spending more quality time with loved ones. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION5 emphasized that interacting with family and friends helps individuals develop essential social skills for their future. Research from @ORGANIZATION2 demonstrated that individuals who spend three hours or less on their computers exhibit up to @PERCENT2 improvement in social, verbal, and quick-thinking abilities. Strengthening relationships with family and friends, rather than with screens, is undeniably beneficial for personal growth and well-being.   While some may argue that online interactions also contribute to social skills development, face-to-face interactions provide a more authentic and emotionally engaging experience that fosters quick thinking and emotional intelligence.  In conclusion, prioritizing physical exercise and meaningful social interactions over excessive computer use is vital for maintaining both mental and physical health. By making these lifestyle changes, individuals can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives. Thank you for considering my perspective."
1123	1125	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,  It has recently come to my attention that computers are having a negative impact on people's daily lives. I agree that excessive computer use can lead to a lack of exercise, social interaction, and enjoyment of non-technological activities. This sedentary lifestyle is contributing to the rising rates of obesity in our country. Instead of spending hours on the computer, people should prioritize physical activity, whether it's a simple walk with a pet or joining a local gym. Interacting with friends and family is also crucial for social development and overall well-being. By spending more time with loved ones, individuals can improve their communication skills and build stronger relationships. Furthermore, engaging in activities that do not involve technology, such as exploring nature or trying new hobbies, can lead to a more fulfilling and balanced life. It is important for individuals to make a conscious effort to prioritize their health, relationships, and overall happiness over excessive computer use. By making small changes to their daily routine, people can lead a more active, social, and enjoyable life.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
1124	1126	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that computers are essential in today's world. They play a vital role in various aspects of our lives, from education to communication. Computers are crucial for almost every job in our increasingly technologically advanced society. For instance, police officers rely on computers to track down criminals and maintain records. Schools use computers for research, assignments, and homework. Personally, as a student at @TIME1, I use computers regularly for my academic tasks.  Moreover, computers provide us with the ability to explore the world and stay informed about current events. They allow us to access news from around the globe and conduct research on a wide range of topics. Whether it's writing essays or browsing the internet for information, computers make these tasks more efficient and convenient. I, for one, use computers to stay updated on global news and complete assignments for @LOCATION1.  Additionally, computers enable us to communicate with others online. Whether through email or video calls, we can connect with friends and family members, no matter where they are. Online communication is especially valuable for maintaining relationships with loved ones who are far away. Personally, I have used webcams to celebrate special occasions with distant family members, like on my birthday with my sister who was unable to be physically present.  In conclusion, computers are indispensable tools that enhance our productivity, knowledge, and connectivity. They have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering countless benefits. From facilitating work tasks to keeping us informed and connected, computers have revolutionized the way we live and interact with the world.
1125	1127	1	3	The negative impact of computers on people's lives is becoming increasingly apparent. While computers offer benefits such as easy access to information and communication with others, the drawbacks outweigh the advantages. One significant issue is the sedentary lifestyle that computer use often promotes, leading to weight gain and health problems. Additionally, online interactions can be risky, as people may share personal information with strangers, potentially leading to identity theft. The financial burden of computer-related health issues, such as vision problems and internet addiction, can also be substantial. In light of these concerns, it is essential for individuals to consider the potential risks of excessive computer use and prioritize their well-being over virtual convenience.
1126	1128	1	3	Having a computer can be both a blessing and a curse when it comes to staying healthy and fit. While it can be a useful tool for work and communication, spending too much time on the computer can lead to a lack of exercise and unhealthy eating habits. It is important to use technology responsibly and prioritize physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle. By balancing computer use with regular exercise and outdoor activities, one can achieve a fit and healthy body while still enjoying the benefits of modern technology. Remember, moderation is key in all aspects of life to ensure overall well-being and happiness.
1127	1129	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, This era is all about computers. Computers are a benefit to have. They increase hand-eye coordination, communication skills, and easy access to knowledge. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that helps with physical movements, such as using your hands. Studies have shown that a majority of individuals have improved hand-eye coordination. It also stimulates nerves in the hands and brain, especially beneficial for children who have undergone hand surgery. Recent studies have indicated that a significant percentage of children show faster improvement in hand movement through computer therapy.  Furthermore, computers play a crucial role in communication through email or messaging platforms. This is particularly advantageous for pen pals, saving time and money compared to traditional mail. It also aids shy individuals in improving their conversational skills, with a considerable percentage of shy children showing increased talkativeness at school. Enhancing communication skills not only boosts confidence but also fosters better relationships in various aspects of life.  Moreover, computers serve as a valuable tool for acquiring knowledge. While books can sometimes be challenging to navigate, computers offer a quick and efficient way to access information. With a simple search query, one can find the desired information without sifting through irrelevant content. In educational settings, bookmarks make it even easier to access specific websites quickly, streamlining the learning process.  In conclusion, the era of computers is rapidly gaining popularity due to the numerous benefits they offer. From improving hand-eye coordination to enhancing communication skills and providing easy access to knowledge, computers have become indispensable in today's world. Embracing technology can lead to a more efficient and enriched lifestyle for individuals of all ages.
1128	1130	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  I disagree with the use of computers for extended periods, especially by children. Spending excessive time on computers can lead to health issues such as obesity, eye strain, and even cancer. It is concerning to see children choosing to stay indoors, playing video games and consuming junk food, instead of engaging in physical activities outside with friends.  I have witnessed the devastating effects of computer overuse firsthand, as my aunt passed away due to brain cancer after years of using the computer extensively for work. Her son had to witness her deteriorating health and suffer through the pain of losing his mother.  Therefore, I believe that it is crucial to limit computer usage to no more than a couple of hours a day to prevent potential health risks and encourage a balanced lifestyle that includes outdoor activities and social interactions. It is essential to prioritize our well-being and not let technology consume our lives.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1129	1132	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I disagree that computers are important to people because they have research, online colleges, and online stores. Those are my top reasons and I'm going to give more details. My first main idea is that computers help students find important information on a project. You can do on the Wikipedia to help find information about the battle of Gallipoli and other important history. One example is I went to American history.com to find good information about Wall Street and what happened there. People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school. You can get research about the earth and what happens to it. My second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school, you can go to college. Some colleges can be found on the internet and you can go to college at home on your computer. One example is my cousin. She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children. Whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online. My third and final reason why computers are good for people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store. Children like to go shopping a lot but they can't go to the mall or the stores because you don't want to go. You can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores. It can be shipped to your door without going anywhere. My mom sometimes orders from Amazon so she doesn't have to go there. It gets shipped to our house in less than a week. There was my main reasons why people should have a computer. They can find research, online schools, and online shopping stores. This can help people understand computers.
1130	1133	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 news editors, @CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1, and I would like you to write an article on the effects computers have on people. Computers have been the technological item to have over the past @NUM1 or so years. They allow people to learn many new skills, get important work done, and even socialize! However some experts believe that people spend to much time on computers, and that people are not as active or healthy because of it. Everyone wants to be healthy. While computers are fun and useful, could they have a negative effect on society?  @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are employed as of @DATE1, and with that number dropping people need to get more work done to keep their jobs, or even keep their businesses open. With computers available at work (or school) much more work can be done. Some people are working with stocks, and these days, the stocks could be good or bad, so you need to keep up! Laptops make work possible on the go too! Computers teach many skills you need to know for jobs, and other skills you @MONTH1 need times in life. Not only do computers teach skills and work, they are very fun too!  Computers increase math skills and hand-eye coordination too! You can read your favorite books via online scans! Online gaming has become a sensation, and many people are gaming now. Some people believe the ludicrous notion that technology is making @LOCATION1 into fat, lifeless losers, but the opposite is true. With computers, you can efficiently complete work and learn new skills! Computers are positive if used correctly.  In conclusion, while computers have their downsides in terms of health and excessive screen time, they also provide numerous benefits such as enhancing work efficiency, teaching valuable skills, and offering enjoyable social activities. It ultimately comes down to how individuals balance their computer usage with other aspects of life to ensure a well-rounded and healthy lifestyle. Thank you for considering these perspectives.
1131	1134	1	3	Dear sir, I believe that computers are great for society. There are lots of benefits to having a computer to use. You can talk to people online with instant messaging, which is more dependable than a telephone or cell phone at times when people may not answer. With a computer, you can easily send a message from the computer to a person's cellular device.   Computers offer a vast amount of knowledge that can be accessed online, including information about the world and people from different cultures. This knowledge goes beyond what a traditional teacher may provide, allowing individuals to expand their understanding and learn new things.   While it is important to balance computer use with physical activity, modern technology allows for multitasking. For example, you can listen to music or watch a movie while working out on a treadmill, combining exercise with computer use.   In conclusion, the benefits of having a computer today are significant. Despite the potential for overuse, the ability to incorporate exercise into computer activities makes it a valuable tool for personal growth and communication.
1132	1135	1	3	Recently, there has been debate about whether or not computers benefit society. Although each side has its own reasons, computers do have a positive effect on people and on society. Computers are beneficial in several ways. With the use of computers, you have the ability to research and learn about foreign and local places, communicate with others, and help people complete everyday tasks. At one point in everyone's lives, you need to know about local or even foreign places. It is completely unrealistic for someone to travel to every place they need to know about. This is where computers come in. Over the internet, you can research everything from the main staple of the diet in a particular location all the way to the traditions of a different culture. You learn about things in the comfort of your home or your hometown. Also, you can learn about local upcoming events and the world around you. Communicating with people on the other side of the world is difficult. Mailing a letter could take weeks to reach the recipient. Computers provide us with an immediate method of communicating with others whether they are local or far away. Scientists say that about 80% of all individuals have communicated with someone at least once through computers, with 50% using this method regularly. Although we still use phones and traditional mail, our society heavily relies on computers for social interactions. Everyday, computers help people get things done quicker, giving them more time to spend with their families and loved ones. Without computers, everyday tasks would take longer, leaving less time for leisure activities. Computers benefit society by helping individuals obtain knowledge, strengthening relationships through constant communication, and making everyday lives easier and more efficient. In conclusion, computers have a significant positive impact on people and should continue to be an integral part of everyday society.
1133	1136	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that more than half the students in the world use the computer to study. I think that people don't spend a lot of time on the computer. And even if they are it's for studying learning of catching up with old friends. Here are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. Most kids use computers to learn about things they are doing in class. And they also use the computer to study about a country or a person they are doing a report on. Also there are games on the computer that can help you with math. Now onto my secod reason. You can also use the computer to send emails to friends that live faraway, and also you could use things like facebook to find friends that had moved away. And you could also use a video camera to video chat with a friend or if you are a business man or woman you could videochat with clients all across the country. Now onto my third and final reason. Computers also have applications like microsoft word which lets you type things such as essays or term papers instead of having to write them out by hand. Also there is an application that lets you make a powerpoint if you need to make one for a project. And there is an application that lets you paint pictures or draw pictures. Those are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. If we didn't have computers the world would be very different like kids wouldn't be able to search things for projects or type essays. And you wouldn't be able to keep contact with someone who moved away. Also you wouldn't be able to make power points for projects. And that is why I think computers have a good effect on people.  Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, especially for students. They offer numerous benefits, from aiding in research and studying to staying connected with friends and family. The convenience and efficiency that computers provide are undeniable. Without them, many essential tasks would be much more challenging to accomplish. In conclusion, computers have undoubtedly had a positive impact on society, making our lives easier and more connected than ever before.
1134	1137	1	3	Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think computers are one of the most incredible inventions ever. They have revolutionized education, making learning more accessible and efficient. Computers play a vital role in education by providing various tools and resources for students to study and learn. Specialized websites cater to different educational needs, such as studying for exams or teaching young children essential skills like reading and writing. With the widespread availability of computers, many schools provide students with access to technology to enhance their learning experience. Studies have shown that students who use computers for learning tend to achieve higher test scores, highlighting the positive impact of technology on education.  Moreover, computers have made everyday tasks much easier and faster. Instead of laboriously writing essays by hand, individuals can type them quickly and use spell check to ensure accuracy. Information retrieval has also been simplified through the use of computers, as searching for specific details online takes mere seconds compared to traditional methods like visiting a library. This convenience and efficiency have significantly improved the quality of life for many people, showcasing the versatility and benefits of computers in various aspects of daily living.  Furthermore, computers have transformed the way we travel and communicate. Booking tickets online has become the norm, replacing the need to visit physical locations to make travel arrangements. Additionally, the use of email for correspondence has largely replaced traditional mail, offering a quicker and more reliable communication method. The integration of computers in travel and communication has streamlined processes and made them more convenient for individuals, illustrating the significant impact of technology in these areas.  Overall, computers have become indispensable tools that have greatly enhanced education, daily tasks, and communication. With technological advancements continuously improving, the role of computers in various aspects of life will only continue to expand, making them essential in modern society. While moderation in technology usage is crucial, the benefits of computers in enhancing efficiency and convenience cannot be denied.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1135	1138	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, There has been much debate surrounding the impact of computers on society, with some arguing against their benefits. However, I firmly believe that computers are indeed beneficial. One primary reason is the ability to communicate with others. Whether through messaging or video calls, computers facilitate easy and instant connections with friends and family, even those far away. For instance, I was able to reconnect with a long-lost friend from @LOCATION1 through an online search, a heartwarming experience made possible by technology.  Moreover, the range of activities available on computers and the internet is vast, offering entertainment, education, and productivity tools. From completing school assignments to playing games, the computer serves as a versatile tool for various tasks. Personally, I enjoy spending time chatting with friends, making plans, or simply unwinding with a game after a long day. While acknowledging the addictive nature of excessive screen time, it is essential to balance computer use with physical activities like exercise.  Statistics indicate that a significant portion of the population owns a computer, and many individuals check their emails or browse the internet frequently. Despite the potential drawbacks, the convenience and opportunities provided by computers cannot be overlooked. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in modern society, enhancing communication, offering a plethora of activities, and serving as valuable tools for personal and professional use. Embracing technology responsibly can enrich our lives and connect us in ways previously unimaginable. So, if you do not already have a computer, consider acquiring one to experience the benefits firsthand. It will undoubtedly be a worthwhile investment.
1136	1139	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, The average American uses the computer at least once every day. Computers definitely benefit society in various ways. With them, people can easily learn about faraway places, study without having to carry heavy books and papers, and chat with individuals all over the country and sometimes even the world.  Firstly, computers can provide extensive knowledge about the world without the need to visit a library. Free sites like Wikipedia offer quick access to information on a wide range of topics. These sites can be utilized for essays, trip planning, and satisfying one's curiosity. Some individuals may argue that computers discourage physical exercise and enjoying nature; however, they actually promote these activities. Computers offer easy access to travel agencies and information on popular tourist destinations, as well as advertising for gyms and home exercise ideas. They make it simpler to organize outings and nature walks.  Moreover, computers make tasks like studying much easier by eliminating the need to carry heavy books. A small laptop can contain all the necessary information, eliminating the burden of tracking papers. Files can be organized efficiently on a computer, ensuring even the most disorganized individual can stay orderly. For example, in schools like @ORGANIZATION1, laptops have streamlined the learning process, making it more manageable for students.  Lastly, computers facilitate communication through chat sites and email. Individuals can easily stay in touch with relatives or friends who live far away. Email is faster and more private than traditional mail, enhancing the speed and security of communication. Socializing sites and messaging platforms allow people to connect with others from different cities and even countries, bridging cultural gaps and promoting understanding.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in improving our community. They enable us to learn about distant places, simplify our daily activities, and facilitate communication with people from various locations. When considering all these benefits, it becomes evident that computers are truly beneficial to our society.
1137	1140	1	3	Computers are the future. They are the best technology we have created, allowing us to improve our hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway people and places, and interact with our friends. Typing and using a mouse on a computer can enhance hand-eye coordination, which is beneficial for tasks like writing and driving. By exploring different cultures and learning about diverse places through the internet, we can broaden our knowledge and understanding of the world. This exposure to new ideas can inspire us to make positive changes in our own lives. Additionally, computers enable us to communicate with friends through various means such as chatting, emailing, and video calling. This not only helps us stay connected with loved ones but also facilitates sharing important files and information. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in improving various aspects of our lives, from enhancing skills to expanding our worldview and maintaining relationships.
1138	1141	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive affect on people like me. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they even allow people to talk online with other people. I will tell you why we should benefit from these computers. The first reason is computers teach hand-eye coordination. You can learn how to type really fast. Without hand-eye coordination how are you supposed to hit a ball coming at you with a bat, how are you supposed to catch a ball with your hands? The second reason is you can learn about far away places and people. Like how we are in the United States and we want to learn about China or say that we are in France and we want to know about the German people, we can look it up instead of traveling there. The last thing is you can talk online to anybody you want from Africa to the US all the way to Japan. So you see computers are really special because you don't want to write someone a million things, it is not right so we need computers. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing our lives by improving hand-eye coordination, providing access to information about distant places and cultures, and enabling communication with people around the world. Embracing these technological advancements can greatly benefit society as a whole.
1139	1142	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend too much time on their computers. I believe people should spend more time outside with their family. This can certainly lead to brain problems, difficulty in seeing, and even death.   Firstly, prolonged computer use can result in brain problems as individuals become obsessed with their screens, neglecting real-life interactions. This excessive screen time can have detrimental effects on mental health and cognitive functions. It is essential for individuals to disconnect from their devices and engage in meaningful activities with their loved ones to maintain a healthy balance.   Moreover, spending excessive time on computers can also lead to vision problems. Eye doctors have reported an increase in cases where individuals, especially teenagers, experience difficulties in seeing due to prolonged screen exposure. This can result in the need for special glasses, causing financial strain and potential long-term damage to eyesight.   Additionally, there have been tragic cases of individuals losing their lives due to excessive computer use. The addiction to screens can lead to impulsive and harmful behaviors, putting individuals at risk of engaging in illegal activities or facing dangerous situations. It is crucial for people to prioritize real-world experiences and relationships over virtual interactions to safeguard their well-being and prevent potential tragedies.   In conclusion, it is imperative for individuals to limit their screen time and prioritize spending quality time with their families outdoors. By striking a healthy balance between digital and real-life activities, we can protect our mental and physical health, strengthen relationships, and ultimately avoid the negative consequences associated with excessive computer use. Let's take the initiative to disconnect from our devices and embrace the beauty of the world around us.
1140	1143	1	3	To the @CAPS1, I have recently heard that some people think that computers don't benefit society. However, I disagree with that. First, it allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things. Also, it allows family and friends to connect with other family and friends. And lastly, it is a form of entertainment on a day that you can't go outside. Some people might not agree with me. However, I believe the computer wasn't a waste of thought. I think the computer is a benefit to society and the whole world.  First, the computer allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things. People, professors, historians, and other highly educated people pass discoveries and information about things every day. That means every day someone can learn something new and expand their knowledge. The computer is the best way to allow people to share information they've learned for others to see and gain knowledge. There are endless possibilities for everyone who owns a computer to learn. You wouldn't believe the things you can discover on a computer.  Additionally, the computer allows family and friends to stay in touch with loved ones in faraway places. If it weren't for computers, staying connected with family members who have moved to different locations would be much more challenging. The computer allows for sending emails to family members' computers or cellular phones, making communication efficient and instant. It is the best way to stay close to family and friends even when they are miles away. For example, I am able to video chat with my brother who lives in @LOCATION1 every day, thanks to the computer.  Lastly, the computer provides a form of entertainment on a rainy day. There are various software options that allow people to create games and share them online. When the weather prevents outdoor activities, individuals can turn to their computers for entertainment. Whether playing games alone or engaging in online multiplayer games with others, the computer offers a wide range of entertainment options. Some games even have educational value, teaching players about history and other subjects.  In conclusion, the computer is a valuable asset to society, offering opportunities for learning, staying connected with loved ones, and providing entertainment. Its impact on individuals and communities is profound, making it a beneficial tool that enhances our daily lives.
1141	1144	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION4 @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are a great invention but people are starting to dislike it. On the hand, I believe the computers put positive effects on people. First of all, they are a great way for kids to have fun: @CAPS1, people can learn very interesting facts. Lastly, it is a great way to communicate with friends and family. These are a few reasons I think computers put a positive effect on people. To begin with on a computer you can have a lot of fun by playing games. The computer saves money for a lot of us. For example, if you bought a game system it would cost well over @MONEY1 but on a computer you can find and play games for free. Not all games have to be like ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS5"" they can be games about sports. Suppose one student broke his leg and he loves playing soccer. He could just get on the computer and play a game of soccer even though he has a broken leg. People can learn various facts right from their computers. The most important thing that computers are made for is to learn new things. No one in the @CAPS2 knows everything, but if everyone puts what they know into the computer then people can learn anything from them. I remember my friend once told me about some guy named @PERSON2. I had no idea who he was so my friend started laughing at me. When I got home, I searched him up and by the time I was done reading about him, I knew more than my friend about @PERSON2. If we ever have a question in class and our teacher can't answer it, he/she always tells us to either ""@CAPS7"" it or ""@CAPS8"" it. They both are search engines. Not only can you learn a lot from computers, you can communicate with people from different countries. What if @PERSON1 did not invent the telephone? How different would our life be right now? Anyway, most people use the computer to communicate nowadays. Whether it's texting or video calling, or whether it's through email or social media, all are a great way to communicate with people. With telephones, it costs money to talk with people in a different country, but with the computer, it is absolutely free. You could be living in one place and chatting with someone in another. Communication everywhere is fast and easy with the computer. My whole family lives in @LOCATION6 and it costs us twice as much to make a call there. But when we use the computer, it is even better because they can even see our face through the webcam. As you can see, computers are not negative at all; in fact, they help people around the world. They help kids have fun with the games they can play, it teaches children and adults various new things, and lastly, it is a great communication strategy. I hope that you put those reasons in our local paper so everyone can see how computers have a positive effect on people."
1142	1145	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  You know that over 90% of people own computers? Computers are one of technology's greatest advancements and are sweeping the nation, as well as the world. I believe that computers have positive effects on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, create the ability to learn and research quickly and efficiently, and offer ways to chat online.  Computers are essential in developing hand-eye coordination, which is beneficial for activities like sports or games. Studies have shown that people who use computers have improved hand-eye coordination, leading to better performance in various tasks.  When it comes to learning and researching, computers are invaluable. Instead of spending hours in the library, all you have to do is go online to find the information you need. Whether it's for a school project or personal interest, computers make the process faster and more convenient.  Furthermore, computers provide numerous platforms for online communication. From social media to video calls, staying connected with friends and family has never been easier. It helps to decrease boredom and loneliness, especially during times when meeting in person may not be possible.  In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering numerous benefits. They improve hand-eye coordination, facilitate learning and research, and enable seamless communication with others. If you don't already have a computer, consider getting one to experience the positive impact it can have on your life.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1143	1146	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, computers play a crucial role in our lives by providing us with a wealth of information and opportunities. While some may argue that excessive computer use can be detrimental, I believe that the benefits far outweigh any drawbacks. One significant advantage of computers is their ability to connect us with loved ones who may be far away. Through webcams and online communication tools, we can bridge the gap of physical distance and stay in touch with family and friends around the world. This is especially important for those who cannot afford to travel or rely on expensive phone calls. Additionally, computers facilitate job searches and applications, making it easier for individuals to find employment opportunities without leaving their homes. This convenience can be a game-changer for those in need of work or looking to switch careers. Furthermore, computers serve as invaluable tools for education, allowing us to explore and learn about the world from the comfort of our own homes. Whether it's researching a new subject or delving into a different culture, the vast amount of information available online broadens our horizons and enriches our knowledge. In essence, computers are a powerful resource that enhances our lives and empowers us to connect, work, and learn in ways that were once unimaginable. Embracing the positive impact of computers can lead to a more connected and informed society overall.
1144	1147	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 staff,  Computers play a vital role in our daily lives, enhancing productivity and facilitating communication on a global scale. They enable us to explore new places, learn about different cultures, and connect with individuals worldwide. In the educational sector, computers are indispensable tools for both teachers and students, providing access to online resources and aiding in the learning process.  Furthermore, computers have revolutionized the way we work, with word processing applications simplifying tasks and increasing efficiency. Programs like @CAPS1 have become popular among people of all ages, allowing instant communication and collaboration with others. Additionally, emailing has streamlined communication, making it easier to share information and stay connected with friends, family, and colleagues.  In essence, computers have become essential in our modern world, serving as a valuable resource that simplifies our daily routines and enhances our overall quality of life. Embracing technology and utilizing computers wisely can significantly improve our productivity and communication capabilities. Let us continue to leverage the power of computers to support our needs and facilitate our everyday tasks.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
1145	1148	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, as we witness the ongoing debate regarding the benefits and drawbacks of computers, I firmly believe that they are indeed advantageous. Computers provide a wealth of information at our fingertips, enabling us to explore new topics, communicate with people worldwide, and engage in various activities. The internet, in particular, offers a vast array of knowledge that is easily accessible. Whether it's discovering the capital of @LOCATION6 or staying informed about global events like the earthquake in @LOCATION4, the internet serves as a valuable resource. Moreover, connecting with individuals from different parts of the world fosters a sense of unity and understanding. The convenience of online shopping and the ability to try new hobbies, such as pingpong, further demonstrate the practicality of computers. Despite concerns about inappropriate content, when used responsibly, the internet proves to be a versatile tool that can enhance our lives in numerous ways. In conclusion, computers, when utilized effectively, offer a multitude of benefits that contribute to personal growth and global connectivity.
1146	1149	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Advances in technology, while amazing, don't always have a positive effect on society. That is why, I honestly believe computers do not benefit my community. For instance, computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them! Not to mention, computers cost way too much money. To begin, my mom and dad always say, ""don't talk to strangers,"" when I go out. I think they should say the same when I go to use my computer. Computers can truly be dangerous for someone who isn't careful. For example, online predators often depict themselves as someone they aren't. Therefore, you can't ever really trust someone you simply met in a chat room. Also, cyber bullying is another problem computers put people at risk for. Another danger computers have, is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone. This includes pictures, blogs, comments and. I believe society would be better off without the constant worry of a computer! Secondly, people, especially the younger generation, spend excessive amounts of time on computers. Some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them. If people spent just as much time helping their community as much time helping their community as they did on the computer, the world would be a much better place to live. Not to mention, it would bring people closer to one another. Computers seem to control peoples' lives and that just isn't healthy. I think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen! Lastly, computers are like vampires, sucking away your money. In today's economy people need to be saving their money for college or even simpler things like a new pair of shoes! Additionally, at the rate that technology is advancing, even the most high-tech computers are out of date in a year or two and a new one is needed. Also, computers' prices are constantly rising. It is very hard to keep up! I strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down. All in all, computers just are a negative attribute in communities across the world. First off they can be dangerous. Secondly, they are too time-consuming, and thirdly, computers are too expensive. Computers are simply a hassle in today's world. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on society cannot be overlooked. It is high time that we reevaluate the role of technology in our lives and consider the detrimental effects it may have on our well-being and community. Let's strive for a more balanced and mindful approach to the use of computers for a healthier and happier society."
1147	1150	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a great piece of technology that serve various purposes in our lives. One of the key reasons for their widespread use is for pleasure. People can connect with friends, watch movies, listen to music, and play games, all from the comfort of their own home. Additionally, computers offer convenience by allowing individuals to pay bills, communicate with colleagues, and create websites for their businesses. Moreover, computers play a crucial role in education, providing access to a vast amount of information for learning and research purposes. Whether it's studying, taking notes, or completing homework assignments, computers have become an indispensable tool in the educational realm. Overall, the versatility and functionality of computers make them essential in today's society for entertainment, convenience, and learning purposes.
1148	1151	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, it is my belief that people are spending too much time on computers. Nowadays, almost everything can be done on a computer - from talking to friends and playing games to controlling our home appliances. However, what are we sacrificing in return? Our excessive computer usage is taking away our communication skills, leading to the rise of cyberbullying. It also hinders us from enjoying the beauty of nature and engaging in physical exercise. Shockingly, one out of every ten teens spends more time communicating online than in person, which can severely impact their social development and overall well-being. Studies show that with each new generation, communication skills are declining by 2%. This trend could lead us to a world where face-to-face interactions become obsolete. Furthermore, the sedentary nature of computer use contributes to health issues, with individuals spending over 100 days a year sitting in front of screens when they could be outside exercising. Being cooped up indoors also increases the likelihood of falling ill, as 41% of people who use computers at home are more prone to sickness. It is crucial to remember that the computer cannot replicate the experience of being in nature or the benefits of physical activity. Reflecting on my own habits, I have realized that I, too, am becoming overly reliant on computers, neglecting real-life connections and outdoor experiences. We must break free from this dependence on technology and strive for a more balanced lifestyle. By reducing our screen time and embracing the world around us, we can improve our overall well-being. In conclusion, computers have the potential to be a negative influence on humanity, and it is imperative that we use them in moderation to prioritize real-life interactions and experiences. Thank you for your time.
1149	1152	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today about the increasing use of computers among people. I believe this trend is highly beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, using computers helps improve hand-eye coordination, especially when engaging in activities like typing. Learning to type efficiently without looking at the keyboard can enhance motor skills and dexterity. Additionally, computers provide a gateway for individuals to explore and learn about distant places and cultures. Researching different countries, religions, and people online broadens one's knowledge and understanding of the world. Furthermore, the ability to communicate with others through online platforms like social media facilitates connections with individuals from various backgrounds. This virtual interaction allows for the formation of new friendships and the exchange of ideas. Overall, the growing use of computers offers numerous advantages, from enhancing coordination skills to expanding cultural awareness and fostering social connections. I encourage everyone to embrace this technology and experience its many benefits. Thank you.
1150	1153	1	3	"Imagine this: You entered a raffle at your child's school for an all-expense paid trip to @LOCATION1, and you won! You are so excited until you realize you know nothing about @LOCATION1. You don't know what the weather is like, you don't know what kinds of food they eat. You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So you go online and learn everything and anything about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriately, and you have a great time. All because you had a computer. Computers can help you get a better education, no matter what your age. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. They can teach a whole new language, or help you understand the science lesson better. There are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if you're really busy. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like Facebook or MySpace. For example, my cousin is in the navy, he has been for 10 years, and before I got a Facebook, I had lost touch. Now I talk to him all the time. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is ""internet"". But that's not all a computer is good for. Nowadays, many jobs use computers. Banks, businesses, teachers, doctors, even cashiers. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necessity. In fact, 2 out of 3 jobs require a computer. Computers allow you to type up that book report, or make a very important letter look professional. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. So, it looks like access to a computer made that trip to @LOCATION1 easier. Clearly, computers have become a part of everyday life. You can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job. But most importantly, you can learn so much!"
1151	1154	1	3	Dear Readers, I understand that some people think computers can have a negative impact on individuals' lives by discouraging outdoor activities and exercise. However, I believe that the use of computers is ultimately a personal choice, and they can actually enhance our lives in various ways.  Computers provide a wealth of information and resources that can inspire people to engage in outdoor activities. Through online platforms, individuals can discover new hobbies, sports, and recreational opportunities that they may not have been aware of otherwise. Additionally, computers offer access to workout videos, fitness apps, and instructional materials that can guide individuals in staying active and healthy.  Moreover, computers play a crucial role in education and professional fields. They enable students to access online courses, research materials, and academic resources that enhance their learning experiences. Professionals in various industries rely on computers for communication, data analysis, and organizational tasks, which contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of their work.  While it is true that excessive use of computers can lead to sedentary lifestyles and health issues, it ultimately comes down to individual self-control and moderation. By utilizing computers in a balanced manner, individuals can benefit from the vast opportunities and conveniences that they offer.  In conclusion, computers have the potential to positively impact our lives by providing information, resources, and opportunities for personal growth and development. It is important to recognize the value of technology and harness its benefits while maintaining a healthy balance with other aspects of life.
1152	1155	1	3	Computers are becoming more advanced everyday, almost everyone owned, or owns a computer. I think, ther benefit society very greatly. One of the many ways is, they teach you hand eye coordination. So even @CAPS1 your playing games your hand-eye coordination @MONTH1 be improving. With hand-eye coordination you @MONTH1 need it to play sports like baseball. When do you need hand-eye coordination the most? I use it most, when I'm playing hockey or, baseball. So next time your on a computer, remember your hand-eye coordination is improving. Another reason we benefit from having computers, is we learn about far away places. @CAPS1, you know about places that are far away from you that you can or can't travel to, use a computer to gain some background knowledge @CAPS1 you travel somewhere on business and know nothing about it, what do you do? I know! get on a computer and do some research about it! An example of this is, @CAPS1 you have to fly out to @LOCATION1 and don't know anythin about it, use a laptop on the way over there. @CAPS1 you do that, you'll have some schema about the place. As you can see laptops and computers are great for learning of foreign countries. Finally, computers are great for learning a new language. You need to learn spanish in a couple of weeks. What will you do? Download a free language learning app. @CAPS1 you don't know a lot of french and need a few words but don't have a dictionary. Use a translator. When you are talking to someone from @LOCATION1 and you don't know there language use an english to african dictionary translation app on your computer. Computers have a great translater applications that are free so, @CAPS1 you don't know a language hop on a computer and learn it! In conclusion, computers are used every day and help us greatly, weather it be learning a new language, or just talking to friends. Computer benefit society greatly.   Computers have also revolutionized communication. Email, social media, and video conferencing have all become integral parts of modern communication. Whether it's connecting with loved ones across the globe or conducting business meetings remotely, computers have made communication more accessible and efficient. Additionally, the internet provides a vast amount of information at our fingertips, allowing us to educate ourselves on a wide range of topics. From online courses to research papers, computers have democratized access to knowledge. Overall, computers have become essential tools that enhance various aspects of our lives and contribute positively to society.
1153	1156	1	3	To the editor of the daily newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on people of all ages. Computers these days are being used way too much for activities that are not necessarily productive. While individuals spend countless hours on the computer, they are neglecting physical activity. Emailing and social media platforms like Facebook are great for communication, but people are often so engrossed in checking emails or social media updates that they overlook important moments with their loved ones. This excessive use of computers can lead to distractions, affecting children's focus on completing their homework.  The sedentary lifestyle encouraged by excessive computer use is a significant concern, especially with the rising rates of obesity in America. People need to prioritize exercise and physical activity, but the allure of various websites and online activities can deter individuals from engaging in healthy habits. Additionally, the constant use of computers for communication purposes can hinder genuine interactions with family members. Instead of sharing meaningful moments, individuals may find themselves absorbed in virtual conversations, missing out on valuable time spent with loved ones.  Furthermore, the impact of computers extends to academic and work responsibilities. Many students find themselves spending hours on the computer for entertainment purposes, only to realize that they have neglected their homework assignments. This lack of focus and prioritization can lead to academic setbacks and increased stress levels. It is essential to strike a balance between computer use and fulfilling obligations such as schoolwork and professional responsibilities.  In conclusion, while computers are a valuable technological advancement, their excessive use can have detrimental effects on individuals' physical health, family relationships, and academic or work performance. It is crucial for people to recognize the negative consequences of excessive computer use and make a conscious effort to prioritize activities that promote overall well-being and meaningful connections with others. Thank you for considering these important concerns.
1154	1157	1	3	In my opinion, computers are a good source of information, communication, and business tools. They make tasks easier and more efficient. For example, instead of going to the library to research something, you can simply use a computer to find the information you need. Computers are one of the most advanced technologies, allowing you to search for anything in the world. They are also extremely helpful for school projects or work tasks, with many jobs requiring the use of computers. Additionally, computers are great for learning about new topics, with online classes being a popular option. They can also assist in planning vacations and communicating with others, whether it be through email, social media, or online messaging platforms. Overall, computers have a positive impact on people's lives by providing a wide range of benefits and opportunities.
1155	1158	1	3	Dear newspaper, I believe that computers have numerous benefits for people. One significant advantage is how they help maintain connections between friends. Social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace enable individuals to stay in touch with friends who may be far away due to relocation or other reasons. Research shows that a large percentage of individuals have reconnected with old friends through these platforms, contributing to overall well-being and happiness. Personally, I was able to reconnect with a childhood friend through a social networking site after we both moved to different towns, highlighting the positive impact of computers on relationships.  Additionally, computers serve as valuable sources of knowledge. With the vast amount of information available online, individuals can easily access data that may not be readily available in traditional books. Experts predict that computers will become the primary source of knowledge in the future, emphasizing their importance in education and research. The ability to find a wealth of information at the click of a button makes computers indispensable tools for learning and personal growth.  Furthermore, computers offer programs that enhance teamwork and team-building skills. Many computer games have multiplayer features that require players to communicate and collaborate to achieve success. Engaging in these games can help individuals develop essential teamwork skills that are valuable in various aspects of life. The emphasis on cooperation and coordination in these programs promotes a sense of unity and mutual understanding among participants.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in connecting people, providing access to knowledge, and fostering teamwork skills. The positive impact of computers on individuals' lives is undeniable, making them valuable assets in today's society. Embracing the benefits of computers can lead to improved relationships, expanded knowledge, and enhanced teamwork abilities for individuals of all ages.
1156	1159	1	3	"In a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are spending more than @NUM3 hours a day on the computer. ""@CAPS1 computers became so popular here has been an increase in social problems, health issues, and pollution,"" says @PERSON1. The question is then, do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative effect on people? I strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us.  First, fewer people are spending time outside enjoying nature. Imagine sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. How will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? Eight out of ten @CAPS2 surveyed by the national nature @CAPS3 admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer. ""The more people who see how beautiful it is, the less likely they will pollute it with smoke,"" says Dr. @PERSON2. How is our country supposed to be clean if people won't even turn off the computer for a few hours a day and see the world? In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people because they hinder them from seeing the beauty around them.  Second, computers take up so much time that people are neglecting their families. Communication in real life with people is better than through emails or instant messaging. Seventy-nine percent of families split up due to social problems. Smart and successful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of excessive computer use.  Lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. Teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day, but @NUM5 out of @NUM2 teens surveyed at @ORGANIZATION2 admit to not getting that exercise. There has been a @PERCENT1 increase in obesity in children since @DATE1 when computers weren't as prevalent. Almost half of boys in 8th grade at @ORGANIZATION2 agree that they spend too much time on computers. In conclusion, computers take away important things like exercise, contributing to health issues in society.  In conclusion, excessive computer use is detrimental to individuals and society as a whole. It hinders people from experiencing the beauty of nature, disrupts family communication, and leads to a lack of physical activity. It is essential for individuals to balance their computer usage with outdoor activities, quality time with family, and regular exercise to lead a healthy and fulfilling life."
1157	1160	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe computers have a good effect on people. The reasons believe that is because the computer teaches us a lot of things, you can also find a relitive you have not seen in a long time. Two more reasons is because you could talk to your friends, another is you need it to put music on @NUM1's, @CAPS1's and other devices.  My first reason I thought computers have a good effect on people was because it teaches us alot of things. If you wanted to know about a countries culture you will be able to go and find out on the computer. Without the computer you would have to visit not knowing what shot to take for sickness they have. Other things it could teach you is how to get from one place to another without stopping to ask people where a place is. It's important to know things on on the computer you can look it up and find out. Another is you can find a family member you haven't seen in along time. Being able to reconnect with someone is very important. What if something happened to them and you didn't know, like a broke leg or hip you can find out if you find them on the computer. Also alot of people @MONTH1 have family they miss and want to be close to or talk to again they cannot find them and fill close to them again. And they can find you if they relly need to talk to you. You could also talk to your friends in a chat room with other friends or alone. If you have moved far away the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends. Talking to a friends releaves some kids of their stress they had. It helps when your friends make you laugh and talk to you about leaving everything alone and breath. Everyone has one friend that talks them out of doing bad things. A friend like that is helpful. Last reason is you need a computer to put music on your @NUM1 players. Music is very fun and alot of people love to listen to it. If you had no computers there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot you need the computer for. People like to listen to music on their @CAPS1 or @NUM1 while exercising but you need the computer to put music on it. Without computers their's no point of music. In conclusion I think computers have a good effect on people.  In conclusion, computers play a significant role in educating individuals, reuniting families, maintaining friendships, and facilitating music enjoyment. The ability to access information, connect with loved ones, and enjoy music through computers enhances people's lives and contributes positively to society.
1158	1161	1	3	To @CAPS1 it @MONTH1 concern, today people of all ages are using computers for various purposes. Computers are essential for tasks like writing reports, communicating with friends and family, and conducting research. In schools like @ORGANIZATION1, students often have projects that require writing papers. Using a computer to type these papers ensures neatness and legibility, which can be challenging with handwritten work. Fortunately, students can access computers at the nearby library to work on their assignments.  Additionally, the internet has become a popular platform for communication, with sites like '@CAPS2' allowing individuals to connect with friends and relatives, especially those who are far away or lack access to phones. While some may view social media as a distraction from homework, it can also serve as a helpful tool for obtaining missed assignments or clarifying doubts with classmates.  Search engines like '@CAPS4 pile', '@CAPS5', and '@ORGANIZATION2' are valuable resources for gathering information on a wide range of topics. For instance, individuals planning trips to @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 can use these platforms to discover attractions such as the @LOCATION1 zoo or @CAPS7 World. These search engines facilitate learning and exploration, making them indispensable tools in today's digital age.  In conclusion, the widespread use of computers has revolutionized the way we work, communicate, and learn. Embracing technology and leveraging online resources can greatly enhance productivity and knowledge acquisition. Thank you for considering these insights.
1159	1162	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I understand why some people may believe that computers and technology are detrimental to society, but I strongly disagree. In my opinion, technology, especially computers, can bring people together and offer numerous benefits.   One of the most significant advantages of computers is their ability to connect people, regardless of distance. For instance, I have been able to maintain close relationships with both a friend who moved across the country and my grandmother through video chatting on my laptop. Without this technology, staying in touch with them would have been much more challenging.   Furthermore, computers are incredibly beneficial, especially for students like myself. I attend @ORGANIZATION1, and on multiple occasions, I have relied on my laptop to access important notes or complete assignments that I may have forgotten about. Without this convenient tool, I could have faced severe consequences in my academic performance.   Additionally, computers can save time and money by allowing individuals to purchase goods online. With the convenience of online shopping, people can order a variety of items from the comfort of their homes, reducing the need to drive to physical stores and saving money on gas.   In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in our lives by fostering connections, aiding in educational endeavors, and providing convenience. As technology continues to advance, more individuals will likely realize the numerous benefits that computers offer to people of all ages and backgrounds.
1160	1163	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that the effects of computers on people are overwhelmingly positive. Computers play a crucial role in connecting individuals with faraway friends and family members, allowing for easy communication and maintaining relationships. They also enable people to discover and explore amazing natural parks, sparking a renewed interest in nature and adventure. Furthermore, computers facilitate access to local gyms and exercise equipment, promoting a healthier lifestyle among individuals in the community.  In today's digital age, staying connected with loved ones across the country or even around the world has never been easier. Through the use of computers, people can communicate through video calls, messaging apps, and social media platforms, bridging the gap of physical distance and fostering strong relationships. The convenience and accessibility of technology have revolutionized the way we interact with our family and friends, enhancing our emotional connections and sense of community.  Moreover, computers serve as powerful tools for discovering and exploring nature parks. With just a few clicks, individuals can find information about breathtaking natural wonders, hiking trails, and scenic landscapes. This easy access to information ignites a sense of curiosity and exploration, encouraging people to venture out and appreciate the beauty of the natural world. By promoting a deeper connection with nature, computers have the potential to inspire a greater appreciation for environmental conservation and sustainability.  Additionally, computers play a vital role in promoting physical fitness and well-being. Through online resources, individuals can easily locate nearby gyms, fitness classes, and exercise equipment, making it convenient to prioritize health and fitness goals. The accessibility of information on the internet empowers individuals to take control of their health and make informed decisions about their exercise routines. By encouraging regular physical activity, computers contribute to a healthier and more active community.  In conclusion, the positive effects of computers on people are evident in their ability to facilitate communication with faraway loved ones, inspire a love for nature and outdoor exploration, and promote a healthy lifestyle through access to fitness resources. As we embrace the benefits of technology, we can harness its potential to strengthen relationships, foster a deeper connection with the natural world, and prioritize health and well-being in our daily lives. Overall, computers play a valuable role in enhancing the quality of life for individuals and communities alike.
1161	1164	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I am aware of the current debate about technology, specifically computers. Computers are a helpful, interesting, and even fun piece of technology. They open the world to new people and places, and limiting that is uncalled for. Computers are keys to innovation and creation. When @ORGANIZATION1 conducted a study on the use of computers, @PERCENT1 of people said they got their news, files, and even planned through the computer, and now @PERCENT2 of creations are being done through the computer. This illustrates the power of computers, allowing people to do things that were once impossible. Now, humans are capable of spreading information around the world in seconds.   Computers also help businesses grow through advertisement or work software. They are the key to opening the world to new possibilities and options not possible @NUM1 years ago. My opposition wants to limit the use of computers, which I find unfair and possibly unconstitutional. They argue that people exercise less due to computers, however, @PERCENT3 of people, when asked if computers have negatively impacted their exercise, said ""no,"" with one man stating, ""Because of computers, I learned new workouts and even found a great local trainer.""   @CAPS2, you can understand that computers are not just about games and toys, but also about allowing people to grow, learn more, find places to travel, and assist in their exercise. Computers are a wonderful tool when it comes to communication. Emails, @CAPS3, and other software allow people to communicate across the world. As the world continues to innovate, communication is key. People are able to spread news in seconds, with @PERCENT4 of news now being done through the computer.   New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have moved their news mainly to the internet, allowing people across the globe to access them. Work is primarily done through the computer now, with people able to send files, ship, and even order online. Important business meetings are also conducted through the computer, where all participants can be at their respective locations. Computers are necessary for communication, work, and news.   In conclusion, computers are needed to grow a world solving problems, communicating, and expanding. That is why I believe there are no problems with computers."
1162	1165	1	3	Dear @PERSON1,  I am writing to share my thoughts on the benefits of computers as a worthwhile investment. Computers play a crucial role in society by aiding children in their homework, facilitating communication with friends, and providing entertainment options.  For students, computers are invaluable tools for completing homework efficiently. With access to the internet, children can easily research and find information needed for assignments, like the date of the Revolutionary War. This not only enhances their learning experience but also fosters independent problem-solving skills.  Moreover, computers enable children to stay connected with friends, whether they are in different states or simply out of reach. Through online platforms, youngsters can maintain and strengthen friendships, leading to better social connections and reduced feelings of isolation.  Additionally, computers offer a variety of entertainment options for children, such as playing games or listening to music. These activities not only provide a break from academic responsibilities but also contribute to overall well-being by promoting relaxation and enjoyment.  In conclusion, investing in computers for children can have a positive impact on their academic performance, social interactions, and leisure activities. By embracing the versatility of computers, parents can support their children's development and overall happiness.  Sincerely, @CAPS1
1163	1166	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are helpful once in a while but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people believe that they are a waste of electricity. Computers aren't beneficial to everyday life overall. When people are on the computer they spend multiple hours on it. This means that they aren't getting enough exercise and that they are harming them bodies. Not only this but people have a tendency to use this machine obsessivly. They spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family. Every one knows exercise is important. However, what happens when we don't get enough? Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the @LOCATION1. Heart disease is caused by obesity. That's what happens when you don't exercise. When you are on the computer you are sitting down rather than moving around. This means that your motabolism isn't going and you burn less calories. That is not healthy for anyone. Even people in perfect condition. Gaining weight isn't the only way you can potentially harm your body. When using the computer you have to look at the screen which is with very bright @CAPS3 lights. After looking at the screen for so long your eyes will begin to feel the affects of the lights. Many people say its like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time. About @PERCENT1 of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for to long. That @PERCENT1 is @PERCENT2 more than we had before. We used to have about @NUM3. Like I said before, when you use the computer you use it for an extended amount of time. What about family? They deserve more attention than a machine. To spend more time on the computer than your own flesh and blood isn't right. In a survey an average of @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people said that the spent about eight hours on the computer between work and home, and about an hour with family. The results were more than shocking with all of this in mind, ask your self how useful the computer really is. Sure it's good at researching things quickly but its also good at making people gain weight, making people spend money on glassses and tearing them away from their family members. At the end of the day, the computer isn't very helpful at all.  In conclusion, while computers may offer convenience and efficiency in certain tasks, their negative impact on physical health, family relationships, and overall well-being cannot be overlooked. It is important to strike a balance between technology usage and real-life interactions to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.
1164	1167	1	3	Without computers, the world would regress significantly in terms of communication, education, and overall convenience. Computers have become an essential tool in our daily lives, enabling us to stay connected with others, access a vast amount of information, and learn new things. Communication has been revolutionized through instant messaging and video chat, allowing us to connect with people worldwide in real-time. Additionally, the educational landscape has been transformed with online resources like dictionaries, encyclopedias, and language learning platforms. Computers also offer opportunities for physical exercise and nature exploration, as well as bonding with family through shared activities and video calls. Overall, the positive impact of computers on society is undeniable, making them a valuable asset that enhances various aspects of our lives.
1165	1168	1	3	Dear newspaper writer,  I believe that computers have a positive effect on people for several reasons. Firstly, they help individuals all over the world learn new languages without the need to spend a significant amount of money. Unlike expensive language learning programs like Rosetta Stone, online resources provide a cost-effective way to broaden one's linguistic skills. The accessibility and affordability of online language learning platforms make it easier for people to communicate with others from different cultures and backgrounds.  Secondly, computers facilitate communication with friends and family members worldwide through various platforms such as instant messaging, video calls, and social media. This eliminates the need for expensive international calls or lengthy travels to stay connected with loved ones. The convenience of digital communication helps strengthen relationships and bridge geographical barriers.  Lastly, computers streamline the process of sending important messages and documents to employers or superiors. Emailing reports, updates, or requests to bosses is faster and more efficient than traditional methods like faxing or mailing. This not only saves time but also ensures that information reaches its intended recipient promptly, regardless of their location.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by making language learning more accessible, facilitating global communication, and improving workplace efficiency. The convenience and efficiency provided by technology enhance interpersonal connections and streamline professional communication, ultimately benefiting individuals in various aspects of their lives.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1166	1169	1	3	To the Middlebury paper, regarding the article on whether or not computers benefit society, I believe that computers bring numerous advantages that make them essential in schools, homes, and businesses. They play a crucial role in our daily lives, aiding us in staying connected and informed. In schools, computers enhance learning by providing online resources for various subjects, such as math and health. They also help in saving costs by offering virtual learning opportunities, eliminating the need for expensive field trips. Additionally, computer games can improve hand-eye coordination, a skill vital for children's development. The educational benefits of computers will continue to grow with advancing technology, making it unwise to restrict children's access to them.   Moreover, computers facilitate communication, allowing students to receive assignments and interact with teachers through email. This efficient communication saves time and enhances productivity. Cost-effectiveness is another advantage, as using computers for communication reduces expenses on phone bills and tutoring services. Furthermore, computers simplify staying in touch with family members, enabling quick and easy communication with multiple relatives through a single email. Speeding up communication through computers undeniably offers benefits that should not be overlooked.   It is important to note that blaming computers for the lack of exercise is unjust, as individuals have the autonomy to choose how they allocate their time, whether it be for physical activity or screen time. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with the user, not the computer, in determining the extent of computer usage. Therefore, maintaining the current level of computer usage is crucial for sustaining communication, education, and overall societal advancement. When used judiciously, computers can greatly contribute to society by enhancing connectivity and knowledge-sharing.
1167	1170	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS1 has come to @CAPS2 attention that certain members of our society believe that computers are not beneficial. This position comes from lack judgment and a closed mind. Computers are lifelines to business workers who use them to complete all of their work. These tools also enable news of disasters or weather to spread efficiently and effectively. These technological devices also create and sustain communication between family members and friends. In today's society, computers are vital, and getting rid of them would be like stopping oxygen from making its way to the body, accompanied by multiple severe consequences.   First and foremost, about 90% of all modern companies require their employees to work on computers. These works of art aren't just handy-dandy toys, but are essential to the working class - a pencil to a student taking a test. @PERSON3, an owner of a small business, agrees. ""@CAPS2 company designs software and uses computers extensively. Many of @CAPS2 employees work from home and have to own computers."" The growth of computers is not something to be frowned upon, but an achievement in technology enhancing the lives of others. By ripping computers from the lives of workers, chaos would be created with many unappealing consequences.   Adults aren't the only ones whose jobs consist of computers. Nowadays, students' homework is mostly online. Computers decrease the amount of time needed to write an essay and are a glare to students of all ages. @PERSON4, an eighth-grader at @ORGANIZATION1, is an example of this dilemma. Every night she has at least three hours of homework, and usually one hour requires a computer. However, this isn't a problem because it cuts back the time it takes for @PERSON4 to do her homework. She can quickly type up an essay or research a science topic instead of doing it painstakingly slow using an old-fashioned method.   Moreover, computers are doors into the real world, especially for residents of secluded areas like @LOCATION1. Whether some people like to believe it or not, @LOCATION1 is a bit of a secluded area where people aren't aware of what is going on outside of their closed-off town. Computers cause news to spread like electricity and open residents' eyes to national and global problems. @PERSON2, another student at @ORGANIZATION5, states, ""When the earthquake took place in @LOCATION3, my friends and I were all at lunch, and we came back to class, our teacher was projecting the news via her computer onto the whiteboard."" If computers were taken away, a stream of knowledge would be cut off from adults and children.   Most importantly, computers create communication between friends and family. Calling up to talk to someone isn't always an option, so computers are the better choice. Families can connect with each other no matter if they have cell phone reception or what area of the world they are in. @PERSON1, a senior at @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1, who agrees. ""@CAPS4 I go to college next year, I am going all the way to @LOCATION2 and want to be able to talk to my family, via email and instant message I can contact them even if it's inconvenient because they don't have to respond right away."" @PERSON1 brings up a good point - computers serve the luxury of communication, which is vital to keep healthy relationships, as shown in a study at @ORGANIZATION4.   In conclusion, computers are an incredible piece of equipment that should be valued and not taken away. They are vital to workers and students and bring news to residents of any corner of the world. Computers also are how friends and family are able to stay connected and communicate. Therefore, I urge you, readers of the @ORGANIZATION2, to raise your voice about the benefits of computers, so they aren't taken away from our society."
1168	1171	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1? Are you there?"" ""@CAPS2 you hear me?"" You never have that issue with computers. It has come to my understanding that there is a dispute about the benefits of computers - should we have them and advance them, or not? Well, I believe that computers are a necessity for an average person. Computers help everyone, and make life easier! Sure, there are cellphones and other helpful electronics, but are they always as trustworthy as computers? Computers are always reliable - whether it's for homework or another reason! Computers provide easy interaction without breakups, they make it easier to learn, and if you are smart, then they are safe. Without computers, who knows where our society would be? To begin, computers allow people to have conversations with others... that are halfway across the world! There are a variety of applications that you can choose from, and they are all easy to use. My personally preferred option is email. I myself have family in another continent, which is a whole continent away! Sure, I could call them, but my phone bill would be through the roof! How else am I supposed to keep intact with my loved ones? Do you know how many others face the same problem? Through a recent study, a large percentage of families in a particular location say they have relatives that are far away. That is a significant portion of the population! Imagine there was no computer for them to use. Phone companies would be in money and regular families would be living on the streets. Or worse - they would lose any relationship with their family. Do you want that? Computers are easy to access, and you can interact with loved ones, friends, or new people. It doesn't get any better than that! So, which would you choose - losing your family relations or keeping in touch via email and computer applications? If that isn't enough, computers make it easy to learn new things and accomplish tasks. I know that as a student, other students and I need to type our homework at least three times a week! Just yesterday I had to type up a response, a free writing choice, and an entry for a history project. Imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters. Either homework wouldn't be done or everyone would have a major lack of sleep. Both options are unacceptable. Plus, computers are great for research. If you have to look up a new country, look at far away colleges, or find out about the world, why not visit your handy computer? You could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house. You could visit a new country without leaving town! Sure, you could read a newspaper, but answer me this - where does the paper come from? Yup, trees are killed for them. Computers are the easy, environment-friendly alternative for you. If those two reasons didn't convince you, maybe this one will. Most people think computers are unsafe, and that may be partly true. But if you are smart or listen in school like me, you will know that isn't always the case. In our school, we are taught about the risks of computers, and how to prevent any possible issues. I'm sure most schools do. In fact, nine out of ten students say that when it comes to safety, computers are rated an A+. Everyone knows about hackers, and so we avoid them. My parents even say that for over thirty years they have never had a single issue or risk of safety when using a computer, and neither have I. ""Issues are only powerful if you let them be, and let them take control,"" says an expert on the subject. So, if it's safety you are worried about, then don't. The kids of today, and tomorrow, know what is out there, and how to stop the minor issues. So, why don't we recap what we learned today. Are computers helpful and the best way to go for communication? Yes, they are. What is the best way to learn new things easily? I believe the correct answer is computers. What are safe even if some don't agree. It wasn't phones... no, not television... oh yes, computers! I see why you might think no, they should be outside, well let me tell you, cellphones and t.v. will keep them from that anyway. At least computers don't rot your brain. Well, I have done my part. I support computers, and their advancement. But it isn't up to me, is it? No, it's not. So please do your part by spreading the word. It's the right thing to do. You know that you want to! And remember, computers are here to stay and make our lives better in countless ways."
1169	1172	1	3	More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I feel that those people that think computers do not benefit society, are right. I feel this way because people need to start exercising it more, and interact with family and friends. Also, should enjoy life. Please read on to read in detail, as to why I feel this way. Firstly, those who are always on the computer need to exercise more, they need to exercise to stay healthy and strong. If they don't, they will most likely eat more and gain a lot of unwanted fat. Also, some of them don't even exercise at all. Secondly, they don't interact with their family and friends as much. Those people tend to probably argue with their family because they had to get off of computer. When you fight with people you want to get away from it so you go back to the computer. It's not healthy to be on the computer for long periods at a time. Lastly, they should enjoy life. See the world through their own eyes. Party with friends and family. Go to college and do something with their lives. They need to enjoy things how they originally were without any computers, ipods, or even cellphones. In conclusion, the reasons I feel this why are because people need to exercise more, and interact with family and friends. Also, they need to enjoy life. I hope you understand as to why I feel this way.
1170	1173	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are beneficial to society. This is because computers perform tasks such as aiding in research, facilitating communication with others, and providing entertainment through games and websites. Computers serve as valuable resources for various activities. Without computers, I would feel lost as they act as digital encyclopedias, containing vast amounts of information on a wide range of topics. For instance, when working on an essay that requires credible information, accessing online databases or websites through a computer can yield the necessary facts quickly and efficiently. This eliminates the need for extensive research efforts. Additionally, computers enhance communication by enabling the use of email and social media platforms like @ORGANIZATION1, which allow for instant messaging and interactions with others. Video chatting has further revolutionized communication by allowing individuals to see and hear each other in real-time, bridging distances between loved ones. In terms of entertainment, computers offer a plethora of gaming websites and online games like @CAPS6.com, miniclips.com, and @LOCATION1. These platforms provide a means of relaxation and enjoyment, helping individuals unwind after a long day. Popular games like The @CAPS7 offer immersive experiences that transport players to different worlds, offering an escape from everyday stressors. Overall, computers play diverse roles in society, contributing to research, communication, and leisure activities. Their multifunctionality makes them indispensable tools that enrich people's lives in various ways. In conclusion, computers are essential components that significantly enhance society and are indispensable in today's world.
1171	1174	1	3	Dear Local Community,  Did you know that spending too much time on technology could increase the risk of cancer? As technology continues to advance, people, especially children, are becoming more immersed in it, often neglecting the potential negative impacts on their physical and mental health. The obesity rate in our community is at an all-time high, with many individuals unaware that technology plays a significant role in this issue. For example, the average teenager spends hours on the computer each day, leading to a sedentary lifestyle and increased risk of obesity and diabetes.  Limiting computer use to one hour a day and incorporating regular exercise can significantly improve overall health and well-being. Not only will you have more energy and mental focus, but you will also reduce the risk of developing various health conditions associated with excessive technology use. Additionally, excessive screen time can lead to social isolation and cyberbullying, affecting relationships and mental health.  Furthermore, some forms of cancer can be linked to the radiation emitted by technological devices, highlighting the importance of moderation in technology use. It's crucial to be mindful of the impact of technology on our health, social interactions, and mental well-being. By reducing screen time, staying active, and prioritizing face-to-face interactions, we can safeguard our health and improve our overall quality of life.  Let's make a conscious effort to limit our reliance on technology and prioritize our health and well-being. Together, we can create a healthier and more connected community.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
1172	1175	1	3	"Dear people, Computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people far away, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it. They go on the internet, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. People are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the internet. In fact, a high percentage of all the people in this country who own a computer are addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow in the next few years. Addiction to computers can lead to serious issues. People have died because they spent too much time on the computer without eating and sleeping. In another incident not long ago, it was reported that a student attending a prestigious university was dropped out for doing poorly in school. His parents found out that he was addicted to a particular game. This game is currently the most played game on the internet in this country. Studies show that computer addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction.   My second reason why computers have a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on social media, forums, and email and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feelings. Online bullying is worse than in-person bullying because when you say something on the internet, people don't know who you are. A professor who recently studied online bullying says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than in-person bullying. People are threatened more and hear more hurtful words online."" Online bullying and harassment will continue to worsen if people don't stop. People can also face legal consequences for what they write online.   My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise. Computers contribute to overweight issues. On the computer, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you can email. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You can buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting at a computer. But this is why people become overweight and obese. A significant percentage of people who use computers are obese or overweight. People spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature.   In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Many issues arise because of computer usage. If you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your day. Use the computer for an hour at a time and take breaks before using it again. Addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight are not the only problems associated with computer usage; there are many more."
1173	1176	1	3	Dear newspaper, it is evident that the use of computers is becoming increasingly popular among people, and this trend is indeed commendable. The ability to communicate with others online, learn about distant places and individuals, and improve hand-eye coordination are just a few of the many benefits that computers offer to society.   One significant advantage of using computers is the opportunity they provide for individuals to stay connected with their loved ones, regardless of geographical distance. For instance, people can communicate with family members who are far away through online platforms, fostering relationships and maintaining strong bonds. This aspect of computer usage is especially valuable in today's fast-paced world, where physical distance can often hinder communication.  Moreover, computers play a crucial role in enhancing hand-eye coordination, as demonstrated by the example of an elderly individual who has developed impressive coordination skills through computer use. This improvement in coordination can have a positive impact on various daily activities, highlighting the practical benefits of incorporating technology into one's routine.  Additionally, computers serve as powerful tools for expanding knowledge and accessing information about diverse subjects. Whether it is researching a specific topic for a project or exploring different cultures and locations, the internet offers a wealth of resources that can broaden one's understanding of the world. This aspect of computer usage not only facilitates learning but also stimulates intellectual growth and curiosity.  In conclusion, the widespread adoption of computers is undeniably beneficial for society, offering numerous advantages that contribute to personal growth, communication, and knowledge acquisition. By embracing technology and harnessing its potential, individuals can enhance their lives and connect with others in meaningful ways. The positive impact of computers on society is undeniable, making them an indispensable part of modern living.
1174	1177	1	3	I agree that computers have a negative impact on people because they lead to a decrease in physical activity, which can result in lethargy and a lack of fitness. Additionally, excessive computer use can hinder cognitive abilities and memory retention, leading to difficulties in learning and focusing. Furthermore, spending too much time on the computer can isolate individuals from their loved ones, causing them to miss out on valuable time with family and friends. In conclusion, it is important to strike a balance between computer use and other activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle and strong relationships.
1175	1178	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 as a student, I believe that computers have many negative effects on people. While they are undoubtedly useful for school research and work, there are also numerous drawbacks to excessive computer use.   One major concern is the amount of time kids spend on computers, which can lead to neglect of important tasks like homework and projects. Additionally, children are increasingly meeting strangers online through social networks, which can be dangerous if they decide to meet in person. This exposure to unknown individuals poses a significant risk to their safety.  Moreover, unrestricted internet access allows young people to view harmful and inappropriate content, impacting their mental and emotional well-being. The sedentary lifestyle associated with prolonged computer use can also lead to health issues such as weight gain and lack of physical fitness.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can result in social isolation as individuals spend less time engaging in real-life activities and relationships. Keeping computers out of kids' bedrooms can help prevent them from staying up late and disrupting their sleep schedule.  In order to mitigate these negative effects, it is essential for individuals to establish a balanced schedule for computer use. By setting limits and prioritizing other activities such as exercise, socializing, and family time, people can maintain a healthy lifestyle while still benefiting from the advantages of technology. It is crucial to recognize the potential drawbacks of excessive computer use and take proactive steps to address them for a well-rounded and fulfilling life.
1176	1179	1	3	I believe that people spending too much time on computers can affect their health and relationships with friends and family. When immersed in computer activities, individuals may prioritize screen time over social interactions, leading to strained relationships. Choosing to stay indoors on the computer rather than engaging in outdoor activities with friends can create distance and hinder bonding. Similarly, opting to remain online instead of participating in family gatherings or events can weaken family connections. Moreover, excessive computer use can impact physical health by replacing time that could be spent exercising. Sedentary behavior due to prolonged computer use can contribute to weight gain and health issues. Additionally, excessive screen time can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to fatigue and difficulty concentrating on daily tasks such as school or work. Overall, it is important to strike a balance between computer use and real-life interactions to maintain healthy relationships and well-being.
1177	1180	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1! Get off that computer it is @TIME1. But mom I donít want to im in the middle of a game. Does that conbersation sound familiar? Of course it does. Every kid likes to play on the computer. However, noticing your kid being on the computer @NUM1 is not a good thing. In this matter experts are definatley @PERCENT1 right because kids and adults are spending too much time on the computer. These people can do other things like excersising more, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Spending too much time on the computer is not healthy. On the other hand, if someone kicks you of the computer you can always get that six pack you wanted. There are three main things that can get you in shape. First, taking a light run every night on your community track can get your legs from being fatigued every time you walk up the stairs to having your legs be firm and able to run lap after lap just for a warm up. Every years my dad takes me to the track in @DATE1 and times me for @NUM2 and @NUM3 yard dash, the @NUM4 meter, and the mile. Between the months I train all the way up to @DATE2 then my dad does another assment. I do this training because I play baseball. Weight lifting is another way to get in shape. Some basic excersises are bench pressing, squating, and dumbell curles. There are more challenging excersise but I won't go into that. Once you feel like your in shape, take all of that trainign and put it into a sport. Excersising is not the only thing you can do. Enjoying nature is another option. Just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer. Absoarb everything about the nature. From the squirrls to the tress. If you are in the winter enjoy the snow instedid of being inside @NUM1 playing computer games. But, if that doesn't work out for you then hangout with your family. Hanging out with your family can be thing you can do. Gather your family and plan a trip. You can go to a baseball game, park, or movies anything that will get you away from that computer. That is my opinion why I think people should get excersise, enjoy nature, and spend time with their families insted of being on the computer @NUM1. Remember, a balanced lifestyle that includes physical activity, time in nature, and quality time with loved ones is essential for overall well-being. So, next time you find yourself glued to the screen, consider stepping outside and engaging in activities that will benefit your health and relationships.

I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers help people with hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk with others online. This is what computers can do to help our society become better.  Firstly, the computer can teach us hand-eye coordination. By playing games, we can use what we learn in real life. A boy can play football online, then take what he learned and use that in a real football game. Hand-eye coordination on the computer can help us to learn new things about our society. We could use what we learned to discover new things and help us to make the community as a whole better. These skills can also help us do more things at once. Multitasking is a difficult task, and with hand-eye coordination and computers, it becomes easier.  A second productive task can help us with learning. Some people don't know what is going on in the world. The computer can direct us to news. The computer is like one huge encyclopedia of knowledge. Another positive effect that computers have on people is communication. Many people have Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, etc., and all those websites can help. Products like Skype, video chat, AIM, and email allow people to have a conversation online. Email is something that has so many new uses. You can not only talk but also do business, send pictures, invitations, and announcements. Schools, offices, and companies all over the world use these products, and it doesn't only make society better, it makes the world better.  In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on people around the world. They can help with hand-eye coordination, help you learn about faraway places, and help people communicate. That one girl doing her homework gets an A, and the girl talking on her computer signs off to be with her family.
1179	1182	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that computers and advanced technology greatly benefit society in various ways. One significant advantage is the improvement of hand-eye coordination, which is essential for many activities in our daily lives. Additionally, computers provide a convenient and efficient way to learn about distant places and diverse cultures, enhancing our knowledge and understanding of the world. Moreover, utilizing computers helps individuals save time and manage their tasks more effectively. Whether for educational purposes, communication, or productivity, the influence of computers on society is undeniably positive. In conclusion, the integration of computers into our lives offers valuable benefits that contribute to our overall well-being and progress as a community.
1180	1183	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think Computers have a bad effect on people for three reasons. One they can really hurt your eyes, two it is not safe if you have little kids in your house. Finally, three you will never see your family or friends if you are always on the computer.  The first reason computers have a bad effect on people is that they can really hurt your eyes. Constantly staring at a computer screen can lead to eye strain and potential vision problems. It is essential to take breaks and protect your eyes from the harmful effects of prolonged screen time.  The second reason why computers have a negative impact is that they are not safe if you have little kids in your home. Children can easily access inappropriate content or be exposed to harmful online activities. It is crucial to monitor their usage and ensure their safety while using computers.  The third reason is that excessive computer usage can lead to isolation from family and friends. Spending too much time on the computer can result in neglecting personal relationships and missing out on important moments with loved ones. It is essential to find a balance between screen time and real-life interactions.  In conclusion, while computers have numerous benefits, it is important to be aware of the potential negative effects they can have on individuals. By taking precautions, limiting screen time, and prioritizing real-world connections, we can mitigate these adverse impacts and enjoy the benefits of technology in a healthier manner.
1181	1184	1	3	In today's day and age, computers play a vital role in various aspects of our lives, benefiting society in numerous ways. One of the key advantages of computers is the ability to access up-to-date information, enhancing education by providing students with the latest knowledge on various subjects. Additionally, computers serve as a valuable tool for communication, bridging distances and enabling individuals to stay connected with loved ones regardless of geographical barriers. Moreover, the use of computers can improve hand-eye coordination, a valuable skill that is essential in daily activities. Overall, computers have become indispensable in modern society, offering a multitude of benefits that positively impact individuals and communities alike.
1182	1185	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, People like computers, @CAPS2 a known fact. They are very much like a dry, addicting and irresistible. Despite what people believe though computers are very good for our daily lives. You can communicate play @ORGANIZATION1, listen to music watch movies, even learn a language on the computers. So in all ways, the computer is anything but bad. @ORGANIZATION1 are fun. They help us relax. In today's age, @ORGANIZATION1 just don't give people the joy they experienced when younger. Computer @ORGANIZATION1, they are the replacement. Imagine playing baseball with a friend who lives miles away from you, while still being a kid in @LOCATION1, or set in your exercise adventure. Computer @ORGANIZATION1 broke the border giving you a higher level or ""You got mail"". Many people hear that sentence more than once everyday. By many, I mean millions. @CAPS2 a alert saying that someone sent you a email. @CAPS4 are messages. Sent over the @CAPS7, faster than any service. Instead of waiting @NUM1 days for a letter, In a matter of minutes you can have a message sent to your friends. Microsoft @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and other electronic messaging systems are a superior form of communication, these let us speak to the world! Although it sounds silly, @CAPS5 you wanted by you could send a message to anyone with a message box. Lets say you went to watch a certain movie, but you don't own it. With a computer with a dose drive, you can watch any @CAPS6. Better yet, you can download the movies media are available @CAPS7, with you able to watch them with the click of the mouse. Computers are filled to the top with gadgets & accessories that make our life easier. @ORGANIZATION1, movies, @CAPS4 anything you is not likely on a computer. They are the perfect tools in modern society. In conclusion, computers have become essential in our daily lives, offering a wide range of benefits from communication to entertainment, making them indispensable tools in the modern world."
1183	1186	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1: Some people believe computers benefit society. However, others feel they are too consuming. I for me I belive computers help society. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, give people, and even allows computer to chat online with other people. I'd bet your job requires you to use a computer, you probably even have a personal computer which you like to use to chat with friends. I do that all the time and I like it. Another thing I like are sports. One of my favorite sports is softball. In softball you need to have hand-eye cordination, this will help you swing at the ball more accuratly. When a pitcher throws the ball you have to had the bat at the right angle and watch the ball to know when to swing if kids used computers and become good at hand-eye cordination, then possibly more kids would join a local sports team, and possibly even join travel team. Do you like to travel? I do, and are why I learn about places before I go is by looking that particular place up on the internet. About three years ago I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. I wanted to know what it was like there because I had never gone before, so when I looked it up I found out that they had many torist attractions and ""packages"" that let you swim with dolphins, I was very excited to go and when I did, I had a biast, and to think if I didn't look it up I would not have known what kinds of fun things they had! No wonder so many people like computers! One of the biggest reasons why I like computers is because I can chat with my friends online one main attraction online is @CAPS2, everybody, primarily, has one. Some people have one because they like to look at pictures. I have one because I like to chat with my friends. One night I was chatting with a friend we were laughing having a great time, and then she reminded me that we had science homework due the very next day! I thanked her and then completed my work. You see if kids chat online their friends can remind them of important nescesitys such of homework. This could impove grades by @PERCENT1! So you now see why society needs computers and if you have forgotten let me remind you: computers teach you hand-eye cordiantion, let's you learn about faraway places and people, and now allows you to chat online. Just think what would society be like with no computers. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing various aspects of society, from education and communication to entertainment and coordination, ultimately contributing to a more interconnected and informed world."
1184	1187	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,   Computers have become an integral part of society, benefiting people all over the world by making them smarter and more advanced. With the ability to access vast amounts of information, stay connected with loved ones, and even develop new theories, computers have truly revolutionized the way we live our lives.   One of the most significant advantages of computers is their role in education. Through various websites and online tools, people can easily access information that helps them learn and grow. For example, search engines and dictionaries enable users to explore a wealth of knowledge at their fingertips. This accessibility to information has allowed us to advance in many aspects of our lives.  Additionally, computers provide a means for people to stay connected with family and friends, no matter where they are in the world. Social media platforms like Facebook and MySpace have made it easier than ever to maintain relationships and keep in touch with loved ones. Many people, like myself, have found that these platforms are a great way to stay connected with friends from the past.  While it is true that computers can be addictive, it ultimately comes down to personal responsibility. If individuals are able to make wise decisions about their computer usage, then there is no harm in spending time in front of a screen. It is important to recognize the benefits that computers bring to our lives and use them in a way that enhances our overall well-being.  In conclusion, computers have had a positive impact on society, helping us learn, communicate, and innovate. While there may be concerns about addiction, when used responsibly, computers are a valuable tool that enriches our lives. Let us continue to embrace the benefits of technology and harness its power for the betterment of ourselves and our communities.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]
1185	1188	1	3	If you ask me, computers are going to soon be a big problem in our lifestyles. Computers are just another material thing everyone has and seems to be benefiting from, but they aren't. This technology is taking away people's freedom and will, and they don't even notice it. It is pretty clear to me things need to change. To begin, the computer is yet another distraction to our daily lives. I think that it is safe to admit that we don't need this. Distractions like these keep us from doing the things we need to do, such as exercise. Everyone wants to get their extra weight off, but they can't because they want to check websites or talk to their friends. So it's pretty much a lazy distraction. Would you really want to give up your health because of something so materialistic? If we keep clicking, more than 50% of the population that is fit and healthy will become obese. I think we need to reform this problem soon. Like not promoting websites on so many social networks, or having a computer shutdown week, anything that will get people to be outside enjoying life as they should.   To continue, have you ever found yourself asking your kids on how to work the computer? Don't you see how sad that is? Our future leaders are already glued to the games, email, and instant messaging of the net. It's plain to see they are already spending too much of their time online. This is a concerning fact because more and more kids each year turn in less and less school work because they have better things to do such as chat with their friends or watch funny videos online. It's a scary thought because these children are our future leaders. This is a critical point in their lives. They need to learn about things now so their futures aren't hanging by a thread. Instead of making a habit of going online every day, why not make a habit like trying to get all your homework done each night? Things in children's lives need to change before they pay for it later in life.   To sum it up, many things about our lifestyles need to change. Whether it be in schoolwork or losing weight. So I think it would be best if we took out, or lessened our computer usage to lower the distraction and focus more on in life without revolving our world around a click. Let's make the necessary changes now before it's too late.
1186	1189	1	3	Proven by @PERSON2, the best @CAPS1 major over @PERCENT1 of children either have desktops, laptops, or some type of internet access. What do you think about this? Well, I believe that computers are taking up people's time, especially children, and not allowing them to get their work done. Additionally, computers are not only used for communication with friends but also contribute to cyberbullying. Furthermore, @CAPS1 are adding to the stress of parents who have to pay for internet services. Children nowadays come home, change, and immediately log on to their computers to chat with friends and listen to music, which may seem harmless until their grades suffer. I recall a friend, @CAPS3, who spent excessive time on the computer and eventually realized she was failing her classes and gaining weight. This prompted her to reduce her computer usage, focus on homework, and improve her grades, leading me to believe that children have @CAPS1.   Proven by @PERSON3, the cyberbully, that over @PERCENT2 of children have been cyberbullied or engaged in bullying someone online. These incidents typically occur when children are unsupervised or bored and resort to picking on others. People often wonder what can be done, and @PERSON1 suggests removing access to computers. I once read about a young girl who was cyberbullied on news channels.com, illustrating how children worldwide are susceptible to cyberbullying at any moment.
1187	1190	1	3	Dear local newspaper,   Computers are often seen as a valuable tool in today's society, but some believe they are simply a waste of time. While it is true that computers can be a source of distraction and can lead to sedentary lifestyles, it is important to consider the benefits they provide as well.   One argument against computers is that they hinder face-to-face communication and can be a breeding ground for misinformation. However, it is also important to acknowledge that computers have revolutionized the way we connect with others, especially during times when physical interaction may not be possible.   Furthermore, the accessibility to vast amounts of information through the internet can be invaluable for research purposes. While it is true that not all information online may be accurate, the same can be said for printed materials. It is ultimately up to the individual to discern reliable sources from unreliable ones.   In terms of physical health, it is crucial for individuals to balance their computer usage with physical activity. Encouraging children to engage in outdoor activities is essential for their overall well-being.   While it is important to be mindful of the potential negative impacts of excessive computer use, it is also crucial to recognize the many advantages that computers offer in terms of communication, research, and productivity. Finding a balance between technology and real-world interactions is key to a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.   In conclusion, while it is easy to dismiss computers as a waste of time, it is important to consider the ways in which they have enhanced our lives. By being conscious of how we use technology and incorporating physical activity into our daily routines, we can enjoy the benefits of computers while maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
1188	1191	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editors,  In today's age, the debate surrounding the effects of computers on individuals, particularly children, is gaining momentum. While some argue that computers have positive effects, I firmly believe that they have detrimental impacts. One major concern is the amount of time people, especially children, spend on computers rather than engaging in physical activities. This sedentary behavior contributes to a lack of exercise, leading to various health issues like obesity. It is essential for individuals to prioritize physical activity over screen time.  Furthermore, proponents of computer use often highlight the hand-eye coordination it can improve. However, sports and outdoor activities also offer opportunities to enhance this skill while promoting overall physical health. By choosing outdoor activities over screen time, individuals can develop hand-eye coordination in a more holistic and beneficial manner.  Lastly, the argument that computers aid in learning about distant places and people overlooks the fact that books provide a similar, if not more reliable, source of information. Books offer a tangible and credible way to explore different cultures and regions without the risk of misinformation that can be found online. Relying on books for knowledge ensures accuracy and depth of understanding.  In conclusion, computers may have their uses, but the negative effects of excessive screen time cannot be ignored. It is crucial for individuals, especially children, to prioritize physical activity, seek alternative ways to improve skills like hand-eye coordination, and utilize reliable sources like books for knowledge. Let us encourage a balanced approach to technology use for a healthier and more enriching lifestyle.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
1189	1192	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I'm writing to express my view on the positive effects of computers on individuals. In my opinion, computers have a beneficial impact on people for several reasons. Firstly, they provide easy access to information about various individuals and locations worldwide, enhancing learning opportunities. Additionally, computers promote unity by connecting individuals across nations through social networks and communication platforms. Lastly, computers are essential in the modern job market, aiding in organization and increasing employment opportunities. Overall, computers play a significant role in improving knowledge, communication, and professional development in our society.
1190	1193	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, Computers have often been criticized as a distraction and unnecessary tool in today's society. However, I believe that they offer numerous benefits that enhance our lives and help us understand complex subjects like never before. While some argue that computers promote laziness and physical inactivity, it ultimately depends on how individuals choose to use them. They can easily opt to engage in physical activities or spend quality time with family and friends instead.  Computers have become essential for learning and accessing information, making it more convenient than ever before. Communication, in particular, has been revolutionized by computers, with websites facilitating easy and instant interaction. They have also become indispensable in various industries, playing a crucial role in tasks ranging from research and data analysis to the creation of innovative technologies.  Despite concerns about time consumption and negative health impacts, it is important to remember that using a computer is a personal choice. Taking breaks from technology and engaging in offline activities can help maintain a healthy balance. In educational settings like schools, computers are invaluable tools for enhancing learning experiences, from conducting research to completing assignments and projects.  The power of computers in enabling communication through platforms like social media, news websites, and email cannot be overstated. They have transformed how we connect with others, access information, and stay informed about current events. In conclusion, computers are a valuable and integral part of modern life, offering endless possibilities for learning, communication, and productivity when used mindfully and purposefully.
1191	1194	1	3	"I disagree with the notion that computers could have negative effects on people, as some ""experts"" claim. The argument that you socialize less with family and friends because of computers is weak. Social networking sites like Facebook or Instagram allow you to stay connected with all your friends, and online games help you meet new people from different parts of the world. Twitter is great for quick updates, and YouTube provides a platform to interact with friends through comments and subscriptions, offering endless entertainment without any cost. Computers also offer a wide range of fun games to keep users engaged. Games like RuneScape, one of the most popular online multiplayer games, provide quests and challenges for players of all ages. Other notable games like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, and Fortnite offer exciting gameplay experiences. The idea that computers hinder exercising is a personal choice, as it ultimately depends on one's willpower and determination. With the right mindset, individuals can easily balance computer use with physical activities like sports or going to the gym. In conclusion, computers offer a plethora of entertainment options and do not necessarily impede socialization or physical exercise. It all comes down to personal choices and responsible decision-making to maintain a healthy balance between screen time and other activities."
1192	1195	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 having everything known to man at your fingertips. @CAPS4 having an endless source of information in your own home. Wouldnít you want all of this all the time? The question then is, do computers have positive effects on people? I strongly believe computers do benefit society. Firstly, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. The main way is by typing. When you type, you start of looking at the keys but eventually you memorize all the locations of the keys. Also, computer games teach hand-eye coordination. If you weren't looking at the screen, would it be possible to win the game? When computers teach you hand-eye coordination, you can use it for other things too. For example, you definitely need it in sports or more. Specifically, baseball. If you didn't have good hand-eye coordination, you wouldn't be able to catch the ball or be able to hit the ball when you swing. Hand-eye coordination very important. Secondly, computers give people the ability to form about places and people. When people are deciding when to get vacation, they go in the internet. What there is in do. Why would you travel in a place is you back. Many use the internet in research other countries. When the eight grade did reports their information. Eighty seven percent the internet. Finally; some people say computers take away from interaction with family and friends, but computers actually allow you to tell with other family and friends around the world. Wouldn't it be wonderful to with your loved ones in a different state of country? The main way of online communication is @CAPS5-mail or @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These allow you to send someone a message faster and easier. It is much easier in remember someone @CAPS5-mail address than it is a phone settle for just talking, when you can actually see the person? It would be like them being in the room with you. Computers are a great way to talk to someone. Why wait any longer? Computers are a great way to refine your hand-eye coordination skills. You can research Faraway people and places to see what life is like around the globe. Most importantly, you can communicate with family and friends online through @CAPS8, @CAPS5-mail, or @CAPS10. Definitely, computers benefit society. So go and share this information with other people to convince them that computers are positive. Additionally, computers have revolutionized the way we work, learn, and connect with others. They have become an essential tool in our daily lives, enhancing our productivity and efficiency. In conclusion, computers have a multitude of positive effects on people and society, making them a valuable asset in the modern world.
1193	1196	1	3	Computers have a positive impact on people's lives by keeping them connected with family and friends, aiding in school work, providing entertainment through video games and movies, and offering access to a wide range of music.

Additionally, computers are valuable tools for education, assisting students in research, writing papers, and accessing online resources for learning. Furthermore, computers offer a variety of entertainment options, from watching movies to playing video games and discovering new music. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing communication, learning, and entertainment in people's lives.
1194	1197	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,   Encouraging people to spend more time outdoors with their family and friends is a great way to promote a healthier lifestyle. Getting exercise and enjoying nature can have numerous benefits for both physical and mental well-being. While technology has its advantages, it is important to find a balance and not let it consume all our time.  It is essential for individuals, especially teens, to prioritize activities that promote physical activity and social interaction. Spending too much time on computers or laptops can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can have negative effects on health in the long run. By going outside and engaging in physical activities with loved ones, people can improve their overall health and well-being.

1195	1198	1	3	Dear to whom it may concern,  I understand that some people may not see the value in using computers, but I believe that computers offer many advantages over traditional methods like newspapers. While newspapers provide news and information, computers offer a virtual platform where we can access a wide range of content such as weather updates, real estate listings, TV schedules, job opportunities, and more.   Computers have the potential to benefit society in various ways. They can teach important skills like reading, writing, typing, and learning. Additionally, they allow us to connect with others, view photos of people we know, research topics online, and navigate using tools like MapQuest.  However, it is essential to acknowledge the negative aspects of computers, particularly when it comes to internet use. There are certain websites that may not be suitable for all ages, leading to children accessing inappropriate content. Moreover, there are risks of individuals engaging in dangerous activities online, such as meeting strangers or falling victim to scams.  If experts were to consider removing computers, many children would likely feel upset as they rely on these devices for entertainment and education. Without computers, they may resort to spending excessive time playing video games or engaging in outdoor activities. These are just some of my opinions on the matter.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits to society, it is crucial to address the potential risks associated with their use. Finding a balance between the positive and negative aspects of technology is essential to ensure a safe and productive environment for all users.  Sincerely, [Your Name]

1197	1200	1	3	Dear local newspaper, it has been brought to my attention that too many people in our community are spending excessive amounts of time indoors on their computers, rather than enjoying the beautiful weather outside. This trend is having negative effects on the physical, mental, and social well-being of our population.  One concerning issue is the high rate of obesity among children in our area, which can be attributed to the sedentary lifestyle associated with excessive computer use. Instead of engaging in physical activities that promote health and fitness, children are spending hours in front of screens, leading to weight gain and related health problems.  Furthermore, prolonged exposure to computer screens can have detrimental effects on brain health, including an increased risk of seizures and potential radiation exposure. The impact on memory and cognitive function is also a concern, as excessive computer use has been linked to memory loss and difficulty retaining information learned in school.  In addition to the physical and mental health implications, excessive computer use can also lead to social isolation. While others are out enjoying social activities, individuals glued to their screens may find themselves lacking meaningful social connections and interactions.  It is crucial for individuals to consider the long-term consequences of their computer usage and make a conscious effort to balance screen time with activities that promote physical activity, mental stimulation, and social engagement. Making healthier choices today can lead to a happier and more fulfilling life in the future.  Let us all take a moment to reflect on our screen time habits and strive to find a better balance that prioritizes our overall well-being. It is never too late to make positive changes and reap the benefits of a more balanced lifestyle.
1198	1201	1	3	Dear editor, Computers are becoming more prevalent in society, leading to people spending excessive amounts of time on them. This trend has detrimental effects on individuals and communities, as it results in decreased physical activity, limited exposure to the world, and a lack of social interaction. It is crucial for individuals to use computers in moderation and prioritize other important aspects of life.  One significant consequence of excessive computer use is the decline in physical activity among users. Research shows that computer users engage in significantly less exercise compared to non-computer users. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to various health issues, such as obesity and lethargy. Encouraging people to step away from their screens and prioritize physical activity is essential for promoting a healthier and more active society.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can prevent individuals from fully experiencing the world around them. While the internet may provide information about different cultures and places, nothing can replace the richness of firsthand experiences. Traveling to new and unfamiliar destinations allows people to immerse themselves in diverse cultures and environments, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the world. It is essential for individuals to step away from their computers and explore the wonders of the world firsthand.  Lastly, excessive computer use can hinder social interaction with family and friends. Spending too much time on screens can lead to neglecting personal relationships and missing out on valuable moments with loved ones. Meaningful interactions with others are essential for emotional well-being and overall happiness. It is important for individuals to prioritize face-to-face communication and quality time with family and friends.  In conclusion, while computers have become integral to modern life, it is crucial for individuals to use them in moderation. Excessive computer use can have negative consequences on physical health, cultural experiences, and social relationships. By striking a balance and prioritizing other aspects of life, individuals can lead healthier, more fulfilling lives.
1199	1202	1	3	Dear Newspaper,   I believe that computers have a positive impact on people for several reasons. Firstly, they facilitate communication with friends and family, making it easier to stay in touch with loved ones who may be far away. By using live chat or video calls, individuals can maintain relationships without the need for frequent travel. Additionally, computers enable individuals to research and find answers to their questions quickly and efficiently. This is especially useful for students working on assignments or individuals seeking information for work-related tasks. Furthermore, computers are essential tools for many people in the workforce, allowing them to handle finances, complete tasks, and contribute to a more environmentally friendly way of working.   In conclusion, computers play a significant role in modern society by enhancing communication, providing access to information, and facilitating work efficiency. It is evident that the positive effects of computers outweigh any perceived drawbacks, making them essential devices for individuals in today's digital age.

1200	1203	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people at my school sit on their computers after school, missing out on the joys of nature, time with family and friends, and the benefits of exercise. This sedentary behavior not only affects their physical health but also limits their opportunities for learning and social interaction.   By stepping outside, individuals can explore nature and discover new species, engage in physical activities like walking in the woods, playing sports with friends, or building structures with family members. These outdoor experiences not only provide enjoyment but also enhance knowledge, promote teamwork, and improve overall well-being.  Additionally, spending time outdoors allows for meaningful interactions with others, whether it's going to the beach with friends, visiting relatives in different states, or simply having a picnic to meet new people. These social connections contribute to personal growth and create lasting memories that cannot be replicated through screen time.  Furthermore, choosing outdoor activities over computer use encourages regular exercise, which is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing weight gain. Joining sports teams or engaging in physical challenges not only improves physical fitness but also teaches valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.  In conclusion, opting for outdoor activities over computer use offers a wide range of benefits for individuals, including physical fitness, social engagement, and personal growth. By prioritizing time spent outside, one can enjoy the wonders of nature, build meaningful relationships, and lead a healthier and happier life. So, instead of being glued to the computer, choose to explore the great outdoors and all the opportunities it has to offer.
1201	1204	1	3	To @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @MONTH1 concern: @CAPS2 I have been informed that you had the idea that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly disagree, as I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Computers can help improve hand-eye coordination, provide access to information about distant places, and facilitate communication with friends and family online.   In today's digital age, hand-eye coordination is essential, and using computers can significantly enhance this skill. Studies have shown that individuals who spend at least an hour a day on the computer have better hand-eye coordination compared to those who use computers less frequently. This improvement in coordination can have positive effects not only in computer-related tasks but also in activities such as sports, where quick reactions are crucial.  Moreover, computers enable quick and easy access to a vast amount of information, allowing individuals to learn about different cultures and places around the world. This accessibility is particularly beneficial for students working on projects or research, as it eliminates the need to spend hours in libraries searching for relevant materials.   Additionally, computers play a vital role in keeping people connected. With over @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 having friends or family living far away, the ability to communicate online through video calls or messaging platforms is invaluable. This instant communication fosters closer relationships and eliminates the long wait times associated with traditional forms of communication like letters or emails.  In conclusion, the use of computers offers numerous benefits to individuals and society as a whole. From improving hand-eye coordination to providing instant access to information and enhancing communication with loved ones, computers have become an indispensable part of modern life. Embracing technology and harnessing its potential can lead to a more connected and informed society.

That's where a computer can help you. Yes, some people do waste all their time online, but they have their issues. Computers help us with all of our school projects and research. You can reconnect with old friends that you haven't seen in years, learn many good things from the internet and computers.  First off, we would not be able to do some of the things we do without computers. For school projects, I use programs like Word and PowerPoint all the time. Our teachers prefer us to do our work on the computer instead of handwriting everything. Getting information on the computer is much faster and easier. The time it would take you to look up the word ""elephants"" in an encyclopedia is probably ten times more than it takes to do it on Google. Plus, in a matter of seconds, Google can pull up millions of websites about ""elephants.""  Another reason why computers are very beneficial is that you can reconnect with old friends you haven't seen or talked to for years. You can even meet new people using dating sites or platforms like Facebook. There are websites like Twitter where you can follow celebrities and stay connected with people. Computers and the internet provide great information for people.  Some kids take online classes that require using computers, so they don't really have a choice. In conclusion, computers can be very beneficial to lots of people. While it's not good to sit all day playing computer games, we can accomplish many things like school projects or any project. It's nice to meet up with someone you haven't talked to in a while sometimes. We have learned many great things from the internet. I hope you consider my opinion."
1203	1206	1	3	"Dear editor @ORGANIZATION2 the source, @CAPS1, I have noticed that many people have been spending too much time using their computers. This is something that needs to stop because it imports peoples health, safety and education. To open my statements, overuse @ORGANIZATION2 the computer con lead to poor health. Take my friend @PERSON1 for example. He sits at home on his computer all @DATE1 and plays games, goes on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. He rarely gets any excersize and he almost never sees daylight. @PERSON1 @LOCATION1 gained @NUM1 pounds, which lead to obeisity and heart problems. He even wears wooden teeth because his general hygene declined as well. Another common health problem that developes from excessive use @ORGANIZATION2 the computer is arthrietis. Dr. @PERSON3 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION1 told @ORGANIZATION3, ""The massive amounts @ORGANIZATION2 typing on the keyboard can lead to joint problems, arthrietis, and other joint related problems."" In fact, a study that took place from @DATE2 to @DATE3 to see the long lasting terms @ORGANIZATION2 computer overuse had some shocking results. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 the test subjects saw doctors from problems with joint pain. These health risks are a concern, but peoples safety is on bigger issue. When people excessively use the computer they put their safety and well being at risk. People have had serious injuries and scams placed on them because @ORGANIZATION2 the internet. In @DATE4, a girl named @PERSON5 was kidnapped and taken to @LOCATION2. She met a man on @CAPS4.com named @PERSON6, who persuaded her into meeting him at an airport. From their she was taken to @CAPS5 and held from ransom. Every time people use their computer, they put themselves at risk. Dr. @PERSON4 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION2 claims, ""I @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION2 internet-related kidnappings & other crimes. The victim was a person who overused the computer and frequented the internet. Safety is one @ORGANIZATION2 the most important things in life. But peoples education is also effected. When people overuse the computer they can impact their education. The internet hold false information and can be a waste @ORGANIZATION2 peoples time. When students are working on a report, they very often use the internet to get information. Websites like @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION4 are most commonly used. This can be a big problem. Did you know that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 information on the internet is wrong? Thats more than half @ORGANIZATION2 it! The internet can also be a time waster. My bro, @PERSON2, had on assignment to do @DATE1. He stood up @NUM3 hours using @CAPS2 and didn't even write his essay. He recieved a zero on that grade. In closing, overusing your computer can cause health problems, put your safety at risk, and hurt your education. Additionally, excessive screen time can also lead to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. It is crucial to find a balance between technology use and other activities to maintain overall well-being."
1204	1207	1	3	Dear editor, Have you ever used a computer? Odds are you have, which means you know how convenient and positive computers are. Did you know that 90% of all individuals use computers regularly? These technological marvels provide many ways to communicate and learn, showing computers have an extremely positive effect on people. Who hasn't ever played a game on a computer? Computers provide many forms of entertainment, such as games, music, and videos. I once had to drive 5 hours to see my grandma in another state. The only thing that kept me away from the grasp of boredom during the trip was my portable computer, that I played games and watched movies on. Critics of computers argue that people who use computers do not ever participate in physical activities. Of course, try exercising when you are crammed in a car traveling long distances, which is computers positively affect me. It was midnight on a rainy Saturday, and my mother was just about to have a baby. Unfortunately, none of my relatives were there to witness this baby coming into the world because they all live on the other side of the country, this minor setback did not prevent them from seeing the newborn baby, and thanks to computers, they didn't even have to leave their homes. This is because computers offer many ways to be social, such as social networking sites. Within a few hours after the baby was born. there were many pictures and videos up on these social networking sites that let everyone enjoy my new baby sister. Computers make life convenient for all. Last but not least, computers are not only a fine tool for school but are necessary to succeed with your education. One snowy day in January, I was assigned a research paper on a historical figure. Too bad I didn't know one thing about the person, so I asked my mom to drive me to the library to take out some books for my report but due to the snow, the library's power went out and therefore they were closed. This was not an issue, though, because I only had to spend a few minutes on a computer searching for information, instead of spending hours browsing through countless pages in a book. Thanks to computers, I received an A on my report. Overall, computers serve many helpful purposes for people. These marvelous machines can provide entertainment, socialize with people around the world, and even provide information on any topic you would like. Dear readers, now you understand why computers are positive for your lives and everyone else's. I encourage all of you to spread this message to everyone, so they know all the benefits of using computers.
1205	1208	1	3	I disagree with the idea that computers are entirely beneficial for you. Firstly, if you spend all your time doing nothing on the computer, it can have negative consequences on your health and well-being. Secondly, there is a risk of encountering bad people online who may deceive or harm you in some way. Lastly, engaging in questionable online activities can lead you into dangerous or harmful situations. Therefore, it is important to be cautious and mindful of how you use the computer to avoid potential risks and negative outcomes. Remember, excessive and irresponsible computer usage can have serious consequences, so it is essential to use it wisely and responsibly.
1206	1209	1	3	Computers have a significant impact on people in various ways. They play a crucial role in education, allowing individuals to learn about different subjects, work on projects, and explore the history of various figures. This access to information helps individuals expand their knowledge and skills.  Moreover, computers provide entertainment through a wide range of games, videos, and online activities. People can engage in multiplayer games, watch funny videos, or connect with friends and family members online. This entertainment aspect of computers offers a fun and engaging way to relax and enjoy leisure time.  Additionally, computers aid individuals in finding jobs or improving their current job performance. They can learn about job expectations, search for employment opportunities, and enhance their skills through online resources. This support from computers can significantly benefit individuals in their professional growth and development.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by enhancing education, providing entertainment, and aiding in job-related activities. The versatility and accessibility of computers make them valuable tools for personal and professional growth in today's digital age.
1207	1210	1	3	These have been many advancements in computer technology, with some people supporting them and others opposing them. Those against it argue that excessive computer use can lead to less time spent on exercising, enjoying nature, and being with friends and family.   Firstly, spending less time exercising due to excessive computer use can result in weight gain and health risks. It is important to prioritize physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent health issues that may arise from a sedentary lifestyle.  Secondly, by spending less time enjoying nature, individuals miss out on the beauty of the natural world. With environmental concerns on the rise, it is crucial to appreciate and protect nature for future generations to enjoy.  Lastly, neglecting time with friends and family can have significant negative impacts on relationships. Building and maintaining connections with loved ones is essential for emotional well-being and overall happiness.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is important to strike a balance and not let them consume all our time. Prioritizing exercise, nature, and quality time with loved ones are essential for a fulfilling and healthy life.
1208	1211	1	3	Dear editor: Did you know that 80% of people in the United States have computers? These computers are definitely benefiting society. People need computers to stay updated on important issues, contact others, and learn new information. Computers have become essential in our everyday lives. It is crucial for news to spread quickly, and computers play a key role in achieving this. Average individuals like you and me need to stay informed about the weather, global events, and various other significant topics. By using a computer to access this information, we can stay informed immediately. For instance, instead of waiting for the weather forecast on television, we can find out the weather in our local area within seconds. In times of natural disasters like the recent earthquake in Japan where millions lost their lives, it is vital for people to be informed, and computers provide a reliable means for updates. Not only do computers help us receive important global updates, but they also serve as a great tool for contacting others. Personally, I use email to communicate with relatives who live far away, as long-distance phone calls can be expensive. Statistics show that 70% of people contact distant friends and family through email. Additionally, social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram offer a platform for friends to connect with each other. Human interaction is essential, and the internet provides a convenient way to achieve this. Furthermore, computers are valuable for acquiring new knowledge. Children can easily find information for school projects or essays by conducting online searches. Adults can also benefit from computers when seeking to learn something new. It is much simpler to search for information online rather than going to a library to find a book. Did you know that most adults use an online dictionary to look up word definitions? Computers provide answers to all our questions. In conclusion, computers are truly benefiting society by keeping us informed on important issues, facilitating communication, and aiding in the acquisition of new information. These technological advancements are enhancing human society in significant ways.
1209	1212	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, having a home computer has numerous benefits. One key advantage is the ability to access information about different countries and cultures, enhancing our knowledge and understanding of the world. Additionally, computers help save paper by allowing us to type and store documents digitally, reducing our reliance on physical copies. Furthermore, computers enable easy communication with individuals near and far, through email, messaging, and video calls, eliminating the need for expensive phone calls or postage. Moreover, computers have revolutionized research processes, making it quicker and more efficient to gather information for academic or personal purposes. Overall, owning a home computer not only saves time and money but also contributes to a more connected and informed society.
1210	1213	1	3	In my opinion I agree that it benefits society. The reasons that support my decision are lots of businesses use computers to work, fast food restaurants use computers, and schools use computers. Computers are all needed just for those reasons. My first reason is businesses use computers to work. Workers use computers for designing, filing people's names, and to type papers and essays. People in the designing industry don't use paper and pencil anymore because they use designing software to work. Instead of filing in a cabinet, people and workers use computers to put their patients, clients, and workers. Computers can hold more information and files than cabinets can. People also type papers and essays for work. For example, news reporters have to write a report and type it for their company in order to get it to publish. If workers in businesses were to need to use computers to file, type, and design clothes and games. My second reason is that fast food restaurants or even restaurants use computers, instead of using cash registers. For example, McDonald's or Burger King use technology to type in people's orders and amount they pay. Back then they used to use cash registers, to get money out they need to click a button, but now they have all locked up using computers. Every restaurant has at least a touch screen computer in it to use. So restaurants need computers to survive the world. My third reason is schools need computers for students and teachers to write reports, file the students' names and grades into it. Students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work. Teachers need computers to file the students' names, grades, and information, instead of using a cabinet. Teachers also use computers to make homework pages and they need to print stuff off of word. So schools use and need computers for students and teachers use. In conclusion, I agree that computers benefit society because businesses need them to work, design, and file, fast food restaurants use them to take people's orders, and schools rely on them for students and teachers to use. So that's why it benefits society.
1211	1214	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, Computers are necessary and benefit our community in numerous ways. They play a crucial role in connecting people, spreading news, and powering everyday objects. Businesses rely heavily on computers for communication and operations, allowing them to connect with customers and branches worldwide. Social networking sites like @CAPS1 and messaging platforms like @CAPS2 facilitate connections between individuals, bridging distances effortlessly. Moreover, computers are essential for broadcasting news, ensuring that people stay informed about global events such as natural disasters like the earthquake in @LOCATION3. Additionally, advancements in technology have integrated computers into various devices, from smartphones to cars, enhancing their functionality. Without computers, our world would be drastically different, highlighting the indispensable role they play in modern society. Life without computers would be unimaginable, given their pervasive impact on our daily lives.
1212	1215	1	3	Having a computer at home can have its drawbacks, especially when it comes to children. One of the main concerns is the potential for addiction. Children can become so engrossed in games or online activities that they have a hard time disconnecting, leading to arguments and tantrums when it's time to turn off the computer. This can create a cycle of dependence that is difficult to break.  Furthermore, the internet can be a dangerous place for young minds. Inappropriate content such as explicit images or videos can easily be accessed, leading to premature exposure to adult themes. Parents may struggle to monitor and control their child's online activities, increasing the risk of encountering harmful content.  Lastly, the financial aspect of owning a computer cannot be overlooked. Repairs, upgrades, and purchasing new software can quickly add up, putting a strain on the family budget. In addition, children may inadvertently damage the computer, leading to costly repairs or replacements.  While computers offer convenience and entertainment, it is essential to weigh the potential risks and drawbacks, especially when it comes to children. It is crucial for parents to set boundaries, monitor usage, and educate their children about safe internet practices to mitigate these challenges.
1213	1216	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are indeed a crucial tool in today's modern age, offering a multitude of benefits to individuals and society as a whole. They play a significant role in enhancing hand-eye coordination, facilitating easy access to information about distant places and cultures, and enabling seamless communication with others online. These advantages clearly demonstrate the positive impact that computers have on people's lives.  In terms of hand-eye coordination, computers provide a practical platform for individuals, especially children, to develop and refine this essential skill. By requiring users to coordinate their finger movements with what they see on the screen, computers effectively enhance motor skills and precision. This not only aids in activities like typing but also translates into improved performance in sports and other physical endeavors.  Moreover, computers serve as a gateway to a wealth of knowledge about various regions, people, and topics around the world. In the past, obtaining information required significant time and effort, but with computers, a vast array of resources is just a few clicks away. Whether it's troubleshooting a household issue or researching a complex subject, the accessibility offered by computers simplifies the learning process and empowers individuals to expand their understanding effortlessly.  Additionally, computers facilitate communication on a global scale, allowing individuals to stay connected with friends and colleagues regardless of geographical barriers. This level of connectivity is invaluable for maintaining relationships, conducting business operations, and fostering collaboration across different industries. As highlighted by experts like @PERSON1, the use of computers has become indispensable in today's business landscape, demonstrating the crucial role they play in ensuring efficiency and success.  In conclusion, the numerous advantages that computers offer in terms of hand-eye coordination, access to information, and communication clearly indicate their positive influence on society. As such, it is evident that computers are not only beneficial but essential in enhancing the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us. Thank you for considering these viewpoints on the importance of computers in our daily lives.

Furthermore, computers enable communication with friends through various platforms. They offer entertainment through a wide range of games and provide access to images. Additionally, computers are essential for completing school assignments efficiently. Overall, the utility of computers in our daily lives emphasizes their importance and necessity.
1215	1218	1	3	There are over 500 students at XYZ High School. Out of these students, 300 have computers. Computers have a positive effect on people. Students who use computers are more skilled than kids who don't, as they learn all the software and how to be safe online. Computers also teach kids hand-eye coordination, which can be useful in sports. Additionally, computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. They also allow people to communicate online with others.   Hand-eye coordination is essential for sports and many jobs. Using computers can help individuals develop this coordination, which is beneficial in various aspects of life. Learning about different places and people is made easier with computers. Through websites and online resources, individuals can explore different cultures and locations. Planning trips and obtaining information about specific places is also simplified with the use of computers.

1216	1219	1	3	Dear editor,   I have read your past article about how computers can take too much time out of someone's life, time that could be used to exercise or socialize. However, I believe that computers actually benefit society in many ways. The internet provides a fast and simple way to shorten the time spent on activities we would already do. Instead of sending a letter to invite someone to an event, you could just email them, saving weeks and potential lost mail. You can easily reschedule and buy tickets online if a movie is sold out or canceled. In urgent situations, you can quickly check the news online instead of waiting for TV reports to finish. Additionally, you can easily reconnect with old friends through social media platforms like Facebook. If you're feeling lonely, dating sites can help you find the perfect match.   Not only does the internet save time and connect you to others, but it can also improve your physical health. Research shows that using computers for at least 20 minutes a day can increase hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and accuracy. Contrary to popular belief, using computers does not harm your eyes, as confirmed by experts in the field.   In conclusion, computers and the internet have revolutionized the way we live, saving time, connecting people, and even improving physical health. Embracing technology can enhance our lives in numerous ways.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
1217	1220	1	3	To whom it may concern: I will agree that computers have caused many people to spend less time outside. However, it has kept kids inside instead of on the streets causing trouble. Computers have become a part of our everyday life. Some use it to stay connected with family or to reconnect with old friends. Experts say it's bad but the school gives us a computer class in which we learn keyboarding skills, research techniques, and how to research any topic. The school itself has influenced computer use. If we could travel back in time, we would most likely see kids hanging around the streets. Now-a-days, kids spend a lot of time inside, on the computers. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I bet you, or your parents, or maybe even your grandparents used to hear about gangs or fights going on in the streets. Now that computers have become an important item in many people's lives you don't hear those types of things as much. I'm not saying they don't happen but you don't hear your child come home and talk about gangs and fights. Therefore, being on the computer isn't that bad. In history you probably learned about immigrants coming over to America to get away from their ruler. Well, not everyone was able to come. Some people have family in another country. Due to time difference, it is hard to stay in touch. My mother came over here when she was young. The rest of her family still lives in another country. To stay in touch they email or chat. The five hour time difference makes it difficult to know when to call. The invention of computers has made it easier to catch up with family! Most importantly, the use of computers is influenced in schools. My school, has a computer class, where we learn how to skillfully type. We are also taught how to correctly cite and research work. This is helpful because if we don't know this information we could plagiarize and plagiarism is illegal. Frequently, teachers give us projects that ask for computer use. Either we have to look something up for specific, accurate information or we have to type a document. As well as using the the online textbook instead of taking it home. After reading all the facts, I'm sure you will agree that computers can benefit society. Students stay off the streets and only cause trouble with siblings at home. People won't feel like they've left or lost their family. Schools influence computer use to help us learn. Certainly you cannot disagree with me!
1218	1221	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 people believe that computers are harmful to our society because people spend more time on such technology. I believe that this is not the reason our society is falling today although I agree that people spend too much time on the computer. Computers are actually helpful in our society because they are an advance in communication. People have found ways to communicate with others through webcams and microphones. Computers not only facilitate communication but also help us gain information on modern society, such as news to stay up-to-date. Additionally, computers can save files and documents by typing them in so that they can be easily accessed later. One common activity people engage in with modern technology is talking to faraway friends and family during spare time. Legal websites enable individuals to inform friends and family about events like incidents or upcoming gatherings. However, some experts, like @PERSON1, suggest that excessive computer usage contributes to obesity and prevents people from meeting others in person or engaging in physical exercise. Despite this concern, I believe that using computers to stay informed is crucial in our society. Accessing information, such as news and weather reports, online helps individuals keep up with the world and make informed decisions. Moreover, computers can transfer data conveniently, preventing the loss of important files and documents. Many individuals have saved themselves from job-related mishaps by utilizing computers to store and manage data. Additionally, computers can hold and store multimedia files, enabling users to access them from any device. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in modern society by facilitating communication, providing access to information, and aiding in the organization of important data. It is essential to recognize the benefits of computers and utilize them effectively for personal and professional purposes.
1219	1222	1	3	Computers have become a ubiquitous presence in modern society, with many individuals relying on them for various tasks. However, excessive use of computers can have negative effects on individuals, such as sleep deprivation from staying up late and straining the eyes from staring at screens for extended periods. This can lead to reliance on energy drinks to stay awake, which is not a healthy practice.  While the convenience of computers is undeniable, there is still value in traditional methods of writing on paper. Writing by hand can improve hand-eye coordination and cognitive abilities, which may be lacking when using computers exclusively. Additionally, not everyone has access to the internet or computers, making paper a more accessible and practical medium for many individuals.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is important to recognize the drawbacks of excessive use and the value of handwritten work. Finding a balance between the two methods can lead to a more well-rounded and healthier approach to technology use.
1220	1223	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, computers have a positive impact on people in various ways. They provide easy access to information and news, saving time for individuals who are busy with work or other commitments. Computers also facilitate communication and connection, allowing people to interact with others around the world through video calls and messaging. Additionally, computers serve as a valuable tool for learning, offering endless opportunities for acquiring knowledge and skills. Moreover, technology, including computers, plays a crucial role in today's society, helping individuals in their daily lives and providing essential resources. Overall, I believe that computers are a beneficial and essential part of modern life.
1221	1224	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 a world without computers would be a chaotic and challenging place. Without computers, obtaining information would be difficult, and we would have to rely on traditional sources like television or magazines, which may not always provide accurate or up-to-date information. Additionally, tasks such as work reports or homework would be much more time-consuming and challenging without the efficiency of computers.  One significant impact of computers is their role in improving typing skills, which can enhance hand-eye coordination and overall cognitive abilities. Moreover, computers allow us to connect with people and places worldwide, providing opportunities for education and communication that were previously unimaginable. Online education, in particular, has revolutionized learning and has the potential to positively impact the economy by providing access to education for individuals who may not have had the opportunity otherwise.  Furthermore, the ability to type proficiently is becoming increasingly important in today's digital age, as demonstrated by the study showing that a high percentage of children are already proficient typists at a young age. This skill not only aids in typing accuracy but also improves spelling and overall communication abilities.  In times of crisis, such as natural disasters, computers play a crucial role in providing information and connecting people with necessary resources. They are a vital tool for staying informed and understanding the world around us.  Moreover, computers have the power to bring families closer together through online education opportunities that allow for flexibility and increased time spent together. The convenience of studying from home can create a stronger bond among family members while pursuing educational goals.  In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, impacting us in various positive ways. From improving typing skills to connecting us with the world and enhancing family relationships, the influence of computers is undeniable. Without computers, our lives would be drastically different, and we would not have the same opportunities for learning, communication, and growth that we enjoy today.
1222	1225	1	3	Dear local Newspaper,   I believe that we should continue to improve technology on computers despite some concerns about people spending too much time indoors. The computer plays a crucial role in our lives for various reasons.   One significant advantage of the computer is its ability to provide information about places around the world that may not be easily accessible to everyone. Through the internet, individuals can learn about different cultures, landmarks, and destinations, allowing them to broaden their knowledge and understanding of the world.  Moreover, the computer is an invaluable tool for research purposes, especially for students working on assignments or projects. It offers a vast amount of information that can be accessed quickly and efficiently, making the research process more convenient and effective.  Additionally, communication has been greatly enhanced by the use of computers. People can connect with friends and family members who are far away through various online platforms, ensuring that relationships remain strong despite physical distance. The ability to share photos, videos, and messages effortlessly has revolutionized the way we stay in touch with loved ones.  In conclusion, while it is essential to strike a balance between screen time and outdoor activities, the computer remains a crucial tool that enhances our lives in numerous ways. By continuing to improve technology, we can further harness the benefits of the internet for education, communication, and exploration. The computer is not just a means of keeping us indoors but a valuable resource that enriches our daily experiences.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
1223	1226	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I personally believe that new technology is a great thing. Thatís why I think that computers have positive effects on our society. Some of these effects include developing skills to help people for present or future, getting a better education and helping people to become more social. Computers can help people in so many ways you just have to realize it. So come and see why computers are a good choice to have and use. My first reason of why I feel computers have positive effects on people is because they can help develop skills that one has and might not realize. For example, a teenager might discover a passion for writing while typing a paper and could potentially become a successful journalist. Another example could be a man applying for a job that requires knowledge of a specific software, and he can easily learn it by searching online tutorials. Computers can help individuals build skills that are beneficial for their current and future endeavors. My second reason for believing that computers have positive effects is that they can help individuals obtain a better education. Adults who haven't attended college can take online classes to earn a degree, while children can research various topics to expand their knowledge. The accessibility of information through computers makes learning easier and more convenient. Lastly, computers can help people become more social by providing various platforms to connect with others. Whether through email, instant messaging, or social networking sites like Facebook, individuals can easily communicate and stay in touch with friends and family. Computers play a significant role in enhancing social skills and relationships. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits to society by assisting in skill development, providing access to education, and facilitating social connections. It is evident that computers have a positive impact on people's lives in various aspects.
1224	1227	1	3	Many new technologies have been released in today's society, with the computer being one of the most popular and widely used. The ability to access and search for information with just a few clicks has revolutionized the way we live our lives. However, some people have become so addicted to technology that it is affecting their health and physical activity.  Websites like Facebook, Myspace, and YouTube have become highly addictive for many individuals. The use of these platforms has increased dramatically over the years, leading to a rise in stress levels and a lack of physical activity. Dr. @DR1 warns that this online behavior must be moderated, as people are risking their health and well-being by spending excessive amounts of time on the internet.  While the internet can be a valuable tool for communication and information, it should not be used excessively to the detriment of one's health. It is essential to find a balance between online activities and physical exercise to maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid the dangers of internet addiction.

Well, if you believe that the impact is negative, I am here to show you why it is actually very positive. First and foremost, computers play a crucial role in teaching and improving hand-eye coordination. Whether it is clicking on a desired link or typing a document without looking at the keyboard, using computers helps in enhancing this important skill.

In today's society, technology plays a crucial role in enhancing communication, access to information, and overall convenience. It has truly become an essential part of our daily lives.
1228	1231	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers have good effects on people such as letting people talk to family or friends that live far away. Computers also let you learn about different places and people around the world. My first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world. This helps you if you are going on vacation to a foreign country you can learn where the best historical sights are and you can also learn where the best hotels are. If you have a project due on a foreign country, you can search it up and it will give you all the data you need about it. My second reason is that computers let you talk to family or friends that live far away. This helps you keep in touch so it doesn't seem like you don't know them anymore. Computers can also let you talk to your friends that live far away, and if you want to hang out, it would let you discuss which days are good for you and them. Additionally, computers provide a platform for online learning and education, offering a wealth of knowledge at your fingertips. Whether you want to learn a new skill, language, or simply expand your knowledge on various topics, computers enable easy access to a vast amount of educational resources. In conclusion, computers have undoubtedly brought numerous positive impacts on people's lives, facilitating communication, learning, and connection with the world.
1229	1232	1	3	Advancements in technology have greatly benefited people by improving hand-eye coordination, facilitating learning about various subjects, and enabling instant communication with others. Computers play a crucial role in enhancing hand-eye coordination through activities like typing, which require individuals to focus on both the screen and keyboard simultaneously. This skill is essential for performing daily tasks efficiently. Additionally, computers serve as valuable educational tools, allowing users to access information on diverse topics from around the world. This access to knowledge enhances learning and broadens perspectives. Furthermore, computers enable instant communication through methods like messaging and video calls. These communication tools help people stay connected with others regardless of their geographical locations. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing coordination, learning, and communication, making them indispensable tools in today's society.
1230	1233	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I hear you are whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. In my opinion, i think that, yes, they do have a positive effect on people. I think this because computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures. Computers are often helpful to those with special needs. The computer allows you to connect with people who live faraway without having to travel to them. I really enjoy learning about foreign places and culture. I know that from my own experience that the more knowledgeable you are about foreign places and culture, the smarter you become overall. Without the computer, many people would not be able to explore these places and learn about them. The computer is basically a big encyclopedia that supplies important information to those who are unable to travel across the world and visit these places. Without computers, people would be less educated about the people, cultures, and the world we live in. Places such as the pyramids in Egypt, and many others. In my school there are several students with special needs. I, personally, can't even begin to imagine how difficult it must be for them to learn. But one thing I do know is that the computer is a very helpful resource to them. The computer supplies pictures, sounds, and interactive activities that really help kids out. Since some of the kids in my school who have special needs have a hard time reading. The computer helps by reading it aloud to them. Where would those children be if they didn't have computers? I love keeping in touch with my distant family and friends. It used to be that it would take days and days to send and receive a letter from a relative. Now, because of the computer, hard tasks can be done with a simple click of the mouse. Besides sending virtual email to people, because of the computer, you see them face to face! Some computers have webcams that allow you to see someone through the screen of your computer, isn't that great?! So, why waste money flying to see someone to deliver a simple message when you can deliver it personally in almost less than a minute? Because of the computer, people talk more and are often brought closer together. So, as you can see there are many important positive effects that computers have on people. Thank you for listening.
1231	1234	1	3	More and more people use computers everyday. Computers are a great help for projects, email, vacation spots, and so on. However, some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer instead of exercising, or taking a walk. I think that computers are an important part of a person's life because the information found on a computer is very useful. It can be useful to you when you have a report coming up. What if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow? What are you going to do, you don't have time to go to the library. I would go on the computer and get all the information I need. I would also use a computer to learn about far away places, or even famous people in history. I also could look up where I'm going on vacation and then I could learn more information about it. Like, you could find where the best restaurant locations are, the best hotels, and even the best tourist spots. Computers are also helpful for chatting. My grandparents moved so I don't talk to them that much anymore, but since I have a computer I can send a quick e-mail saying hi, or asking how they're doing. Also imagine going to work and not having a computer! That's a lot of work to write down! At some works, the work consists of emailing other work members about the problems they are having, and about meetings. By using a computer you can keep up to date on everything that's going on. Also computers are helpful because if you had a test to study for, and you forgot your notes at school, you can look up online what you are studying. Then you can study from the computer. So then the next day you won't fail the science test. Computers can be a nice little break after all your homework is done. If you want to go on the computer to talk to your friends, it should be an incentive to get all your homework done first. Sometimes people need some downtime after all their homework is over with. Playing games on the computer can be a nice way to relax. Computers are a great help for reports, vacations, chatting, information to help you study for a test. Also to play games on. A lot of people use computers to do work on for their jobs. I think computers are an important part of a person's daily life. Ultimately, it is clear that computers serve a vital role in modern society, providing essential tools for communication, research, and leisure activities.
1232	1236	1	3	In my opinion, computers are a great addition to our world. They help with schoolwork, communication, and provide safe entertainment for people around the globe.   Computers play a crucial role in assisting students with their schoolwork. They offer easy access to a vast amount of information on the internet, which can be beneficial for research projects and assignments. Additionally, students can conveniently retrieve and print out homework assignments from school websites. Typing essays on computers also ensures neatness, which is often expected by teachers.  Furthermore, computers facilitate communication by enabling quick and efficient correspondence between individuals. Whether it is emailing documents to colleagues or instant messaging friends, computers make staying in touch effortless. They also aid in scheduling appointments and meetings, such as when a teacher emails a parent to set up a conference.  Moreover, computers provide a safe and enjoyable form of entertainment. Kid-friendly websites offer educational activities that engage children in a fun and constructive manner. Research has shown that children who engage with such websites perform better academically, indicating the positive impact of computers on learning.  In conclusion, computers have a significant impact on people worldwide, enhancing productivity, communication, and leisure activities. They have become an indispensable tool in various aspects of life, making them a valuable addition to our society.
1233	1237	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people think that computers are used too much, and are helping people become overweight and even obese. This may be true, but computers also have many positive effects on people. One of the benefits of computers is that they help teach hand-eye coordination. Playing games on computers requires users to watch the screen and interact with it using their hands, which in turn improves coordination skills. Studies have shown that people who use computers for at least 10 hours a week have better coordination compared to those who do not own a computer.  Furthermore, computers provide valuable information about the world. Through the internet, people can learn about different cultures, current events, and global issues happening in other countries. This exposure to diverse perspectives fosters understanding and empathy among individuals. Additionally, computers facilitate communication by enabling people to connect with others regardless of their physical location. Platforms like Skype allow for video calls, making it possible to maintain relationships with loved ones who are far away.  In conclusion, while computers do have some drawbacks, their positive impact cannot be overlooked. They enhance hand-eye coordination, offer access to information from around the world, and enable seamless communication between individuals. Overall, computers play a vital role in enhancing our daily lives and connecting us with the global community.
1234	1238	1	3	Dear our local newspaper, Computers have a significant impact on people in a negative way, affecting their lifestyle dramatically. One of the main reasons for this negative influence is the fact that individuals who spend excessive amounts of time on computers often neglect physical exercise. This lack of physical activity can lead to health issues, such as obesity, which is a prevalent concern in the United States. It is crucial for individuals to prioritize their health and well-being by engaging in regular exercise and maintaining a balanced lifestyle.  Additionally, excessive use of computers can also hinder social interaction and communication skills. People who spend too much time on computers may become isolated and disconnected from their friends and family, leading to feelings of loneliness and social anxiety. It is essential for individuals to prioritize real-life relationships and interactions over virtual connections to ensure a sense of belonging and connection with others.  In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits and conveniences, it is important for individuals to strike a balance between technology use and real-life experiences. Prioritizing physical exercise, social interactions, and time spent in nature can help mitigate the negative effects of excessive computer usage on our overall well-being. It is crucial for individuals to be mindful of their screen time and make an effort to engage in activities that promote physical, mental, and emotional health.
1235	1239	1	3	Dear editor of @LOCATION2 @CAPS1, @LOCATION3's society is indeed facing challenges due to the increasing prevalence of computers. These devices are not only consuming excessive amounts of people's time but also impacting their physical health and social interactions. The convenience of computers has led to a sedentary lifestyle, with individuals spending less time outdoors and engaging in physical activities. This trend is concerning, especially when considering the rising rates of obesity in @LOCATION3.  Moreover, the excessive use of computers is reducing the time people spend with their families and friends. Instead of meaningful face-to-face interactions, individuals are often glued to their screens, communicating through online platforms or social media. This lack of real human connection can have detrimental effects on relationships and overall well-being.  It is crucial for us to address these issues before they escalate further. Encouraging a balanced approach to technology usage, promoting physical activity, and fostering strong interpersonal relationships are essential steps in combating the negative impact of computers on our society. By prioritizing human connection, health, and outdoor experiences, we can create a more vibrant and fulfilling community in @LOCATION3. Let us strive to find a healthy balance between the benefits of technology and the importance of real-world interactions. Our future generations deserve a society that values both progress and human connection. Thank you for considering these important issues.
1236	1240	1	3	I believe that while computers are incredibly useful tools for education, work, and leisure, it is essential to find a balance in how much time we spend on them. Schools are increasingly incorporating computers into their curriculum, making it easier for students to access assignments and grades online. Additionally, computers have opened up new avenues for entertainment and communication, allowing us to connect with family and friends who may be far away.  However, it is crucial to be mindful of how much time we spend on computers. It is easy to become too engrossed in social media or online videos, neglecting other important aspects of life. It is essential to remember the value of outdoor activities, reading, and other forms of entertainment that do not involve screens. Finding a balance between technology and other activities is key to leading a well-rounded and fulfilling life.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential to use them in moderation. Finding a healthy balance between screen time and other activities will help us lead a more balanced and enjoyable life.
1237	1241	1	3	Do you like computers? Do you use the internet to help you? Do you use it every day? Well, this article gives you information about all of this. First, a lot of people don't like computers because they say they're too confusing. Actually, computers aren't that hard to work; you just have to be patient and take some time to get used to it. Also, computers can make things easier, like typing. Why should you write by hand when you have the option to use a computer, which lets you write faster than you could on normal paper?  Secondly, the internet is much easier than books. All you have to do is go to Google or any other search engine, type what you're looking for, and in a split second, you have all the information in the world on that topic. Also, if you're planning a vacation, the internet can help. You can purchase plane tickets online, and sometimes there are special discounts available on the web. You can also book hotels and look at live pictures to ensure you have a good vacation.  Finally, you can purchase anything with a click of a button. Almost every website offers discounts. I remember the time when I bought a pair of shoes online for a great price. It usually ships to your house in a couple of days. Going on the computer a lot isn't bad. I go on the computer almost every day but also go outside too. I can do this because at night when no one can go outside, I go on the computer for school or for fun. You can also talk to your friends or family over the internet. If your mom or dad went on a weeks-long business trip, you could use your webcam and talk to them and see them as if you were in the same room. So, is going on the computer really so bad? I don't think so; it is helpful and easy to work with.
1238	1242	1	3	Dear newspaper company,  More and more people are using computers every day, sparking a debate about whether they truly benefit society. While some argue that excessive computer use leads to a lack of physical activity and can strain the eyes, I believe that the advantages of computers far outweigh the drawbacks.  One of the main benefits of computers is their ability to improve hand-eye coordination and provide access to information from around the world. Through computers, people can book hotels, watch movies, play games, and even communicate with individuals from different countries. In addition, computers play a crucial role in solving crimes by enabling law enforcement to track criminals and their records.  Despite these benefits, there are also negative aspects associated with computer use. Cyberbullying is a significant issue, with individuals being targeted and harassed online. Plagiarism is another concern, as some people may take credit for work that is not their own. Furthermore, the illegal downloading of music through platforms like LimeWire deprives artists of their rightful earnings.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous advantages, it is essential to be cautious of the potential negative consequences they can bring. By using computers responsibly and ethically, we can harness their benefits while minimizing their drawbacks.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1239	1243	1	3	Dear all computer lovers, I do believe that spending too much time on the computer can be detrimental to your overall well-being. While it is important to utilize the computer for learning and entertainment, it is equally important to engage in activities that promote physical and mental health.  One such activity is enjoying nature. Spending time outdoors can provide a much-needed break from the digital world and allow you to appreciate the beauty of the natural environment. Whether it's taking a walk in the park, hiking in the mountains, or simply sitting outside and breathing in the fresh air, connecting with nature can be a rejuvenating experience.  Furthermore, spending quality time with family and friends is essential for building strong relationships and creating lasting memories. Family gatherings, parties, and outings with friends can bring joy, laughter, and a sense of belonging that cannot be replicated online. These interpersonal connections are vital for emotional well-being and overall happiness.  Lastly, incorporating regular exercise into your routine is crucial for maintaining physical health and mental clarity. Whether it's going for a run, practicing yoga, or playing a sport, physical activity is essential for staying fit, reducing stress, and improving overall quality of life.  In conclusion, while the computer is a valuable tool, it is important to balance screen time with activities that promote physical activity, social connections, and a connection with nature. By finding a healthy balance between technology and real-life experiences, you can lead a more fulfilling and well-rounded life.
1240	1244	1	3	Deear Newspaper, I think that the effects that computers are having on people is a negative thing because most people just sit at the computers all day long. In this letter I am going to talk about the effects of computers on people, what we could be doing instead, and what people are doing on the computer. First thing is that computers are having a negative effect on people and their lives. Computers are making people just sit inside on their computers all day and do nothing. They just sit there playing games, and about 75% of the people who are spending too much time on the computer are probably not exercising enough, which may contribute to weight gain. Most of the people who spend all of their time on the computer are in their teens or twenties, some are in their thirties or forties. Just sitting there on the computer will not help you progress in life. It will not give you a job or school education. By spending too much time on the computer, you will not be able to do things outside. If people were not on the computer all the time, they could be outside playing sports, riding bikes, swimming, running, and more. They could also get a job, make money, go to college, or simply enjoy nature. There is no need to be on the computer for more than an hour or an hour and a half. Kids and teenagers should only go on the computer for homework and spend the rest of the time doing something else. Children in elementary school should go out and play with their toys, while those in middle school and high school should hang out with friends, go to the mall, watch a movie, or have a sleepover. Additionally, everyone should interact with their families more often and have gatherings or parties. The activities that people engage in on the computer include using social media platforms like Facebook, Google, playing games, searching for information, emailing, watching videos on YouTube, and listening to music. Overall, I believe that people should engage in activities other than just sitting at home on the computer. People who spend too much time on computers may become inactive and risk gaining excess weight. Therefore, the effect of computers on people is negative.
1241	1245	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently heard over @CAPS2 @NUM1 @CAPS3 that people believe computers have different effects on people. In the past, computers have caused problems with the human body. Many individuals are becoming too reliant on computers. So, in my opinion, I believe computers have a negative impact.   First of all, computers have caused people to not exercise and become unhealthy. A significant number of individuals have admitted that they are spending too much time on the computer. It is crucial to realize that sitting on a computer for extended periods is a danger to one's health, leading to potential eye problems. It is important not only to use the computer for work but also to engage in physical activities and exercise for a well-balanced health.   @PERSON1 mentioned, ""@CAPS4 technology increases the more and more people we have given glasses to."" Therefore, changes in computer usage habits are essential to prevent health issues. Additionally, people who spend excessive time on computers may neglect spending time with family and friends. Interactions within families decrease due to excessive computer use, potentially leading to strained relationships.   Moreover, individuals may not be enjoying nature as much as before due to their computer usage. Spending time in nature provides a chance to relax, think, and express thoughts freely. Many individuals need time to reflect on life events, which may not be possible if they are constantly engaged with technology.   In conclusion, computers have a significant negative effect on people, leading to decreased physical activity, reduced social interactions, and less time spent enjoying nature. It is crucial for individuals to find a balance in their computer usage to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle."
1242	1246	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, @CAPS1 my name is @PERSON1. I'm go to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1. I'm in @NUM1 grade. I'm writing this letter to you to tell you my opinion if technology believe that technology have positive effect on people. My opinial is that computer are good. Keep reading to change people lifes in <@NUM2 @LOCATION1</@CAPS2>. My first reason is computer teach you hand eye coordination. For example when I was in @NUM3 grade I would go to the libary in my @ORGANIZATION1. She had a website named @CAPS3 To learn. It to help you to learn how to learn without looking at the keyboard. My second reason compute give people ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example when I was in @NUM4 grade in @CAPS4 @CAPS5 I had to write about @CAPS6. And I want on @ORGANIZATION2. I found wonderful pictures of @CAPS7. And I saw how they live. I watched a @CAPS8 specail like @NUM5 weeks ago it said @PERCENT1 of people would use @ORGANIZATION2 to look up people number and mor personal things. My third reason give people the ability to learn about faraway place and people. For example when want to talk to my cousin that live in @LOCATION3. I would go on the internet and talk to them on webcam. I clould talk to them. I read in a artice like a month ago. That @PERCENT1 of people use the computer to chart with people. In conclustion, some people might say some experts are concerned people are spending to much time and less exercing enjoying friends and family. However, being on the computer is way sdfyer than go outside. More kids or people would be salfy. Next you should post this out on you news paper.
1243	1247	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on computers is that they are the most helpful thing in our society and it benefits us greatly. Lets say if I wanted to see what across the world looks like, or even what the surface of the moon, mars, venus, jupiter, etc. I could just go onto a computer, open or download a program, and there it is. Computers also help people express their creativity by using programs that allow you to draw or build. I bet they even help young children become smarter by building things on the computer. Another thing computers do is open lots of jobs and in a bad economy, people need all the help they can get. With a computer, you can keep people alive and breathing, find broken bones or tumors, build bridges, homes by making blueprints. The last thing computers help us do is the most important, and that is to help people learn. By making simulations of the Titanic, space ships, or the ocean floor, they help us find information, even about people. You can see people on a computer with a camera, or save a life by finding where they crashed in their plane. That's why computers are the most helpful thing we have today, and we should keep learning and progressing to make us more advanced and smarter.
1244	1248	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people for various reasons. One significant benefit is the ability to learn new things through online resources and educational programs. Many individuals, including students and adults, utilize computers to expand their knowledge on a wide range of topics. This not only enhances personal growth but also promotes continuous learning in a convenient and accessible way. Additionally, computers facilitate communication by enabling individuals to connect with others through messaging, video calls, and social media platforms. This is especially valuable for maintaining relationships with loved ones who are geographically distant. Moreover, computers streamline financial tasks such as paying bills and managing finances online. This convenience saves time and effort for adults, allowing them to handle their financial obligations efficiently. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing learning, communication, and financial management for people of all ages. The positive effects of computers on individuals are undeniable, making them essential tools in today's digital age.
1245	1249	1	3	Dear local newspaper, do you keep in touch and do computers affect your job? Some people are using computers too often and aren't able to enjoy the outside world. Some use computers for things other than productive tasks. However, I believe that computers have a strong positive effect on people. They allow us to keep in touch with others, learn new things, and have fun.   Computers play a significant role in our society, enabling us to communicate with relatives, friends, and even people in different countries or states through email, social media platforms like Facebook, and video call services like Skype. These tools facilitate sharing important life events and staying connected with loved ones, regardless of physical distance.   Furthermore, computers are essential for learning. Educational websites and online resources help teachers, students, and parents acquire new knowledge and skills. Platforms like Quiz.com provide interactive learning experiences, making education more engaging and accessible. Busy individuals can also benefit from online courses and remote work opportunities, enhancing their personal and professional growth.  In addition to communication and education, computers offer entertainment options such as online games, music downloads, shopping, and social networking. These activities provide relaxation and enjoyment, serving as a way to unwind and have fun. Moreover, online platforms have become a popular way to meet new people and form meaningful connections, as seen in success stories like online dating leading to marriage.  Overall, computers have a positive impact on society by facilitating communication, learning, and entertainment. They are essential tools that enhance our daily lives and contribute to personal growth and social connections. Embracing technology responsibly can lead to a fulfilling and enriching experience for individuals in today's digital age.
1246	1250	1	3	"Dear The @CAPS1 newspaper, @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 @CAPS1 after @CAPS1. Oh, how much you want to just relax in the natural free air, but with all the advances in technology you feel it's your job to always be updated. I believe that advances in technology have had a negative affect on people. People aren't exercising interacting with family and friends in person, or having the ability to enjoy nature. Exercising means getting your hear to pound, your body to sweat and me because of endorprimes that ultimately make you feel better. @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 all @CAPS1 does not support you with the natural urge to exercise. People who support advances in technology say, ""@CAPS3 are able to teach you hand-eye coordination."" @CAPS4, coordination is important but your body as a whole should also be put with account as well @PERSON1, voted # @NUM1 cardiologist in world says, ""more and more people are suffering from heart disease & attacks every year!"" be goes on to say, ""many links have been theorized to this on going problem, But none seem to up as well as my theory.

Statistics show that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people say tennis have actually made them more confident. This is because when people are able to have the determination to lose weight and head healthier , they feel they can can over the world. Isn't this the attitude everyone needs? Nature is all over and helps us are even if @CAPS4 don't notice. Like trees, they take in @NUM4) and release oxygen. Oxygen is key to life. Trees also are home to many living organisms.

Nature is a beautiful thing that over @PERCENT3 of peoploe say they enjoy relaxing outside, listening to birds singing morningsongs or a dear minding their own business feeding with their young watching.

Technology needs a power source, google, for example states to the press that,"" our business surely enjoys nature but needs to also run their corporation"". They go on to say.""we get our energy from oil and coal"" @CAPS5 according, to scientists like boy say that , oil primary source for big corporations. It is for but they don't keep in mind the fact over a million each year because . And ! that deplleats me protection we get from our ozone layer. Speeding the development of climate change.

I thank you for reading this article and I hope you are now experiencing the other side of the debate children need to interact with their families more, enjoy nature and start exercising. This is impossible to do with the advances of technologe. Advances in technology may offer convenience"
1247	1251	1	3	There are all kinds of computers, but they all serve the same purpose - to assist people in various tasks. Computers offer a wide range of benefits, from facilitating online communication and shopping to providing access to educational resources and aiding in homework completion. The convenience of online college courses allows individuals with busy schedules to further their education. Additionally, connecting with friends through online platforms offers a convenient way to stay in touch when in-person meetings are not possible. The vast amount of information available on the internet makes learning about different topics and cultures easily accessible to anyone. Whether it's buying and selling goods, completing homework assignments, or simply enjoying a computer game, computers cater to the diverse needs and interests of people worldwide. In essence, computers have become an indispensable tool that enhances various aspects of our lives.
1248	1252	1	3	To whom it may concern,   My name is @PERSON1. I have written in response to the letter sent to me on the topic of electronics, specifically computers. Computers, in my opinion, have both positive and negative aspects. While they can be helpful, I find them to be extremely problematic.   One of the main issues I have with computers is their cost. Companies like Dell and others sell computers at high prices, and even when purchased on sale, they often come with malfunctions and problems that require expensive repairs. This cycle of spending money on faulty technology is frustrating and unsustainable.   Furthermore, prolonged use of computers can have negative effects on health. Staring at a screen for extended periods can lead to eye strain and other health problems. Instead of sitting in front of a computer, it is important to stay active and engage in physical activities for overall well-being.   Lastly, I believe that excessive reliance on computers can hinder learning and critical thinking skills. Using computers to find easy answers to homework assignments can prevent students from truly understanding and retaining information. This could potentially lead to a generation of individuals who struggle to think for themselves.   In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, the drawbacks such as high costs, health implications, and negative impact on learning should not be ignored. It is essential to find a balance and not let technology dictate our lives. Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.  Sincerely, @PERSON1
1249	1253	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that excessive computer use can have negative consequences. People may neglect their homework and become addicted to computers, leading to potential dangers. Engaging with strangers online can be risky, akin to having a MySpace account where malicious individuals may lurk. Caution is vital as some people use computers to spread harmful content. It's crucial to be mindful of the risks and prioritize safety when using computers.
1250	1254	1	3	I do not agree that computers benefit society. There are three big reasons why computers are bad for society. Firstly, people are getting too attached to their computers and are neglecting spending time with their families. This can lead to isolation and strained relationships within the family unit. Additionally, excessive computer use can contribute to health issues such as weight gain and a lack of physical activity. People who spend too much time on computers may not prioritize exercise and outdoor activities, leading to a sedentary lifestyle that can result in various health problems. Moreover, prolonged computer use can have negative effects on mental health, as individuals may become addicted to computer games and experience feelings of loneliness and depression. It is important for individuals to strike a balance between computer use and real-world interactions to maintain overall well-being. In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is essential to be mindful of the potential negative impacts they can have on individuals and society as a whole. Finding a healthy balance in computer use is key to ensuring a positive impact on society.
1251	1255	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I read an article in the paper @DATE1 debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Even though, I love my computer, I know that computers can have a bad effect on people. Computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise, lack of family and friend time, and lack of enjoying nature. Although, computers can help people in so many ways, they can also make things worse for people. In @LOCATION1 the obesity rate has reached an all-time high of @PERCENT1. A computer is a non-active activity, so if you use it, you get no exercise. One time I played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds. Your health is also very important. When you become overweight, you are at risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabetes, and now he regrets all the time he gave to his computer.   Lastly, people @MONTH1 say that computers create great hand-eye coordination. Computers might do that, but is the hand-eye coordination ever used? No, because that person is too busy playing on the computer. Can you see how computers can affect your health? Eighty-eight percent of @CAPS1 voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends. The other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it. Not spending time with your family and friends is an awful thing to do. When my mom lost contact with one of her new friends, @CAPS2 regretted not spending so much time with them. Also, if you do not spend time with people, it could lead to socializing problems. If the only thing you do is talk to people on the computer, you develop speech problems. My neighbor, who I have never talked to, never really came out of his house as he always seemed to be on his computer, and no one ever came over. One day someone came over, and they started talking outside. When I overheard a little of their conversation, I could hear the words he had trouble saying, and he did not have a good vocabulary. Lastly, you can also develop relationship problems. Not being able to see a real relationship. That is why computers can have a negative effect not only on you but on your family and friends too.  In our daily lives, we observe nature and its beauty. Spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful. For example, if I were not to go outside for a whole day and got to spend my time on the computer, I would be miserable. Nature is a gift that should be given to everybody. Also, the @CAPS3 air is good for your body. Without @CAPS3 air, you would be taking in chemically changed air, which is not good for your body. Lastly, everyone reads on the internet about @CAPS4 warming, but why do we not take action? If you spend your time on the computer, you would not be able to help nature. I remember when I read about @CAPS4 warming on the computer, so I took action and cleaned our lakes. That is why computers have a negative effect on people. Computers can be great in so many ways, but it is how much time you give to your computer that is bad. That is why computers have a negative effect on our society.
1252	1256	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1, the world has changed dramatically for the better. Technological advancements have revolutionized the way we live, with computers playing a crucial role in enhancing communication. The ability to connect with family members, friends, and even strangers from different parts of the world has become much easier and more convenient thanks to the internet. As the saying goes, ""communication is key,"" and computers have truly unlocked a world of possibilities in this regard.  Gone are the days when communication was limited to letters or face-to-face interactions. With the click of a button, we can now send emails or instant messages to anyone, anywhere, at any time. This instantaneous form of communication not only bridges the gap between people but also allows for quicker and more efficient exchange of information. The days of waiting for a letter to arrive or hoping someone answers the phone are long gone, replaced by the convenience of digital communication.  Moreover, computers have the power to reconnect us with long-lost family members and friends. Through social networking sites and online platforms, we can easily locate and reach out to loved ones we may have lost touch with over the years. This ability to reconnect with our past and strengthen relationships that may have faded over time is truly invaluable, and computers have made it all possible with just a few clicks.  Additionally, the internet opens up a whole new world of opportunities to meet and connect with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures. By engaging with individuals who may live in different states or countries, we not only broaden our horizons but also gain valuable insights into different perspectives and ways of life. The world wide web serves as a platform for cultural exchange and mutual understanding, fostering connections that transcend geographical boundaries.  In conclusion, the advent of computers and the internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, allowing us to connect with others more efficiently and effectively. Whether it's rekindling old friendships, forging new connections, or learning about different cultures, computers have become essential tools for enhancing human interaction in today's interconnected world. Embracing technology and utilizing it to its full potential can truly enrich our lives and bring us closer together as a global community."
1253	1257	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers have become an integral part of our society, offering numerous benefits to individuals of all ages. From enhancing our knowledge of technology to improving our typing skills, computers play a crucial role in our daily lives. By utilizing computers, we have the opportunity to learn about various subjects that interest us, as well as communicate with people from around the globe. Furthermore, computers can serve as educational tools for children, helping them learn and develop essential skills even before starting preschool.  Both children and adults can benefit from using computers for entertainment, learning, and work purposes. Whether it's exploring new interests, researching for meetings, or staying in touch with loved ones, computers facilitate communication and information sharing in a convenient and efficient manner. The widespread use of social media platforms further emphasizes the significance of computers in fostering connections and relationships in today's society.  In conclusion, computers have revolutionized the way we learn, communicate, and work, making them invaluable tools for personal and professional growth. Embracing technology and harnessing the power of computers can undoubtedly lead to success and advancement in various aspects of our lives.
1254	1258	1	3	Dear readers, On the current debate of the effects of computers, I believe they strongly benefit all people. For example, on some computers, a business software can be incorporated, allowing a meeting to be held over the computers. Not only is it convenient, but this saves money. Also, computers come with built-in programs that can help keep track of your expenses. These are simple and save lots of time. Plus, computers also help you stay in touch with friends. Even if they are miles away, you can click a button and have a live video chat!  First off, the business software on new computers is out of this world. You can make a brochure of sales and expenses, all with an easy stroke on the mouse. This is a cheaper and greener way of presenting ideas. Furthermore, on the computer, you and all your clients can hold a conference call. Doing this allows you to relax and multitask while your computer is feeding you coverage of the call in crystal-clear sound. Normally a phone would have to be glued to your ear, but now you are hands-free.  Another time where computers are handy is at tax time. Tired of running around your house to find your car bill from three months ago? Well, with a spreadsheet software like Excel, taxes can be calculated along with their name, so when you take the taxes to a tax consultant, everything is organized. Using these tools cuts down on stress and leaves you less frustrated. And even better, you can buy a tax program for your computer, so you never have to leave your couch! Think about it, paying somebody to count your taxes year after year, when you can save a fortune and do it yourself.  Above all, computers help you connect with old friends who have moved away or parted ways earlier in life. Now, the internet contains many social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, where you can reunite with lost pals. These networks also offer access to photosharing and chat, so everybody can see how your family is and vice versa. Along with this is video chatting, where you can have face-to-face conversations with somebody even on the other side of the world. This is totally private, so it isn't dangerous to say names of family members or their locations. The internet truly is an amazing tool!  To conclude, the internet holds a very strong role in our daily lives. Not only can we see who won the latest sports game, but it also has interactive business software as well. Never again will work be so difficult. Also, the computer has programs to help you manage expenses, keeping you on top of your game. Finally, it is also helpful for all the tools that can be used to interact with friends thousands of miles away. I believe the computer is critical for success and happiness in life. It's a new age, let's adapt to it.
1255	1259	1	3	To whomever this may concern, imagine your life without a laptop or a desktop computer. It would be hectic, right? How would you keep up with your email or type up articles for this newspaper? While some may argue that computers detract from exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with loved ones, the positive impacts of computers cannot be ignored.  One significant benefit of computers is the ability to communicate with people in different states or countries. In the past, pen pals required lengthy letters and weeks of waiting for a response. With computers, emails can be exchanged within days, bridging distances and fostering connections more efficiently.  Moreover, learning from websites can be far more engaging than traditional textbooks. Many students find textbooks dull, but the interactive nature of the internet can enhance their learning experience. Whether it's through educational videos, games, or online articles, computers offer a diverse range of resources to enrich one's knowledge.  Additionally, the future is inevitably moving towards computerization. With advancements in technology, various aspects of our lives will become computerized. Embracing computers now can help individuals adapt to the changing landscape and stay ahead in an increasingly digital world.  So, the choice is yours. Embrace the benefits of computers or risk being left behind in a world that is rapidly evolving. Consider the efficiency of communication, the engaging learning opportunities, and the inevitable shift towards computerization. Computers are not just tools; they are essential companions in navigating the modern world. Thank you.
1256	1260	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my name is John Doe and I am in the 5th grade at Sunnydale Elementary School in Los Angeles. I'm writing to you because I heard that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In my opinion, I think it benefits society. If you keep reading, I will explain why.  My first reason is that computers have a positive effect on people. For example, when I see my older brother using the computer, he looks much smarter on it. Almost everyone in my family learns things from the computer. My second reason is that it teaches hand-eye coordination. When I play games on the computer, my hands are the ones doing everything for me. Research shows that most people who play games on the computer improve their hand-eye coordination.  My third reason is that it gives people the ability to learn. When I use the computer, I learn so much that I spend most of my time on it. Many students study on computers and learn about things they never knew before. Some people argue that people spend too much time on their computers, but I believe that computers help people learn about what is happening in the world.  In conclusion, in my opinion, computers benefit society. They have a positive effect, teach hand-eye coordination, and give people the ability to learn. I think we should all support the use of computers in society.
1257	1261	1	3	Having a computer allows people to stay connected with friends and family who have moved away. Through email, instant messaging, and video chat, individuals can easily communicate and share updates with their loved ones. Additionally, computers provide access to a wealth of information, allowing users to learn about different places, cultures, and topics. Whether it's for school research or planning a vacation, the internet offers a vast amount of resources at the fingertips of users. Furthermore, computers make tasks like paying taxes easier with online platforms like TurboTax, streamlining the process and ensuring accuracy. In today's digital age, computers have become essential tools for communication, education, and organization, making them a valuable asset for individuals in various aspects of their lives.
1258	1262	1	3	Dear local newspaper,  Have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptops or computers? When people spend excessive time on the web, they often neglect physical exercise. This behavior can lead to negative consequences such as illness, memory loss, and a limited future.  Firstly, spending too much time on computers can result in health issues. Sedentary lifestyles coupled with continuous snacking while browsing the internet can contribute to obesity. People may search for quick fixes online, like surgeries, instead of opting for healthier alternatives such as regular exercise.  Furthermore, excessive screen time can impair memory and cognitive function. Individuals engrossed in their digital devices may forget important details, including personal relationships and daily tasks. This can lead to a disconnect from reality and a lack of engagement in the world around them.  Lastly, a future solely dependent on computer usage can be limiting. While some jobs can be done remotely through computers, these individuals may miss out on valuable experiences and opportunities that come with physical interaction and engagement. Dependency on technology can hinder personal growth and development.  In conclusion, it is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between screen time and physical activity to maintain good health, cognitive function, and a fulfilling future. By prioritizing exercise and reducing excessive computer usage, people can lead healthier and more enriching lives.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1259	1263	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that more individuals should embrace the use of computers in their daily lives. Computers offer a plethora of benefits that traditional pen and paper methods cannot match. Firstly, computers provide a gateway to knowledge beyond what is taught in schools. They allow users to stay updated on current events, delve into the history of our nation, and gain insights into how our government functions. While some may argue that news can be obtained through newspapers or television, computers offer a more interactive and visually engaging experience, with the ability to present information in various formats.   Secondly, computers facilitate communication with friends and loved ones through online platforms. This is particularly valuable for maintaining relationships with individuals who may have moved away or attend different schools. For instance, I was able to reconnect with a friend who had relocated to Pittsburgh by using a social media platform. This digital communication tool enables us to bridge physical distances and stay connected regardless of our locations.  Lastly, computers serve as a centralized hub for storing important files, such as photos, videos, documents, and contacts. This organizational feature is beneficial for individuals like me, who struggle with keeping track of physical papers and materials. By utilizing a computer, I can easily access and share my work with others, whether it be emailing an assignment to a teacher or sharing notes with a friend who missed a day of school.  In conclusion, the versatility and convenience offered by computers make them essential tools for modern living. From expanding knowledge horizons to maintaining relationships and enhancing organization, computers have become indispensable in today's digital age. Therefore, I strongly advocate for more people to embrace the use of computers in their daily routines.
1260	1264	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers do not have a positive effect on people. Thanks to computers, individuals are not as active as they used to be, neglecting opportunities to engage with nature, and reducing face-to-face interactions with family and friends. One reason for this is the decrease in physical activity as people spend more time playing on computers instead of engaging in sports or outdoor activities. This sedentary behavior contributes to weight gain and overall health issues, exacerbating existing problems in @LOCATION1. Before the prevalence of computers, people managed to stay active without relying on technology. Additionally, computers hinder individuals from enjoying nature as they spend excessive amounts of time indoors browsing through virtual landscapes instead of exploring the beauty of the natural world firsthand. By stepping outside and immersing themselves in the environment, individuals can discover the wonders of wildlife and landscapes around them, fostering a deeper connection with nature. Moreover, the overreliance on computers has led to a decline in personal interactions, as people substitute face-to-face communication with online platforms such as social media and messaging apps. This shift not only limits meaningful connections but also poses potential risks in terms of privacy and security. Instead of solely relying on digital communication, individuals should prioritize in-person interactions to foster genuine relationships and strengthen social bonds. In conclusion, computers detract from physical activity, nature appreciation, and interpersonal communication, ultimately diminishing their positive impact on individuals. It is essential to strike a balance between technology use and real-world experiences to lead a fulfilling and healthy lifestyle.
1261	1265	1	3	Dear editors, I was planning on taking a trip to @LOCATION1. I found directions within a second using a computer. Computers are great, people-friendly pieces of equipment, but as technology evolves, people are beginning to rely on their computers for entertainment. Some people @MONTH1 disagree, but there are many outdoor activities that are more healthy than sitting around on the computer all day such as socializing, the great outdoors, and other sports. Familiar with @CAPS1 is a great program for socializing, but there are many stronger dangers. Did you know that anybody can view your profile which contains personal info? You don't always have to chat online. Call up a friend and hang out at maybe a local movie theatre. Many people, and I agree, think seeing a movie with their pals is a lot more entertaining than playing online chess or any other virtual game with a friend. A fan of movies? No problem! Go on a walk or a bike ride or walk your dog while riding a bike! There are so many. @ORGANIZATION1 park. What an amazing place to spend your vacation camp outs at @TIME1, bikes during the day, it's a wonderful part of nature and the best part of you a park anywhere in the world! Camp out on the weekend place to become closer with your family and friends. Hiking is a popular part of parks and can be performed by all ages, so go out and spend a weekend in the great outdoors! Not looking at a computer screen. Soccer, baseball, basketball, and lacrosse. These are just some of the many fun sports out there, and yes, they are certainly fun and healthy. Every town I know about has sport fields where many kids and adults of all ages use. It is also a great way to make friends! Get to know them in person and not over the internet. Daily exercise while having fun beats just having fun on a computer. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this article and go out and meet new friends. Visit a local park or play a sport for fun. If I were to name everything to do other than use a computer, it wouldn't fit in this entire newspaper. So go explore!  Remember, the real world has so much to offer beyond the digital realm. Embrace the opportunities for socializing, outdoor adventures, and sports that await you outside of the screen. Start today and enrich your life with meaningful experiences and connections.
1262	1266	1	3	Guess what! I love using computers, and I believe they benefit society in several ways. One reason is that they allow us to easily access information and stay updated on current events. Instead of relying solely on traditional media like newspapers and TV, we can use the internet to stay informed. Another benefit is the ability to connect with people all over the world, whether it's friends and family or new acquaintances. By chatting online, we can maintain relationships and make new connections. Additionally, computers provide a gateway to exploring new topics and learning about different cultures. Finally, with online education, individuals can further their knowledge and skills without leaving their homes, potentially reducing the likelihood of getting into trouble. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing communication, knowledge, and education in society.
1263	1267	1	3	In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people as they facilitate communication with individuals worldwide, enable faster access to information, and enhance job opportunities. With computers, it is easier to connect with someone in a different location, like @LOCATION1, through various online platforms. Teachers can engage students in penpal activities effortlessly, fostering global connections. Moreover, researching specific topics, such as information about Florida, is more convenient on a computer compared to sifting through numerous books. Additionally, the multimedia capabilities of computers, including images and videos, enhance learning experiences. The demand for computer skills in the workforce also highlights the importance of technology proficiency. Furthermore, computers offer entertainment through games and the creation of animated content, making learning enjoyable. Overall, computers play a crucial role in advancing society and improving various aspects of life.
1264	1268	1	3	People in @LOCATION1 use computers every day for various reasons, such as staying connected with family and friends, searching for jobs, and conducting business tasks. The use of webcams allows for face-to-face interactions with loved ones, while businesses rely on computers for document management and communication with international partners. Students in @LOCATION1 utilize computers for research and completing projects, while parents may use them for household management and job searches. It is important to respect individuals' choices in how they spend their time, as everyone has different priorities and responsibilities. Encouraging a balanced lifestyle that includes exercise is important, but ultimately, it is up to each individual to make choices that align with their own well-being. Excessive computer use may have negative effects, such as eye strain, so it is essential for individuals to practice moderation and self-care in their daily routines.
1265	1269	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my attention that many individuals are voicing concerns about the negative impacts of the technology boom and excessive computer usage. I firmly believe that technological advancements are doing more harm than good to our society. The prevalence of email and social media platforms has led to a decline in our interpersonal communication skills. People are spending less time engaging in physical activities outdoors, as they are increasingly glued to their screens, bombarded with inaccurate information. This overreliance on technology is detrimental to our well-being and overall development.  It is disheartening to see the younger generation growing up with poor communication skills, resorting to using slang and informal language even in formal settings. The erosion of proper grammar and language proficiency is a concerning trend that needs to be addressed. Instead of fostering meaningful connections and improving our communication abilities, technology is isolating us and diminishing our capacity to engage effectively with others.  Moreover, the sedentary lifestyle that often accompanies excessive computer usage contributes to the rising rates of obesity and other health issues. People are sacrificing physical activity and outdoor experiences for the sake of convenience and instant gratification provided by technology. This shift in priorities is alarming and has long-term consequences for our physical and mental well-being.  In addition, the abundance of unreliable information on the internet is leading people astray and hindering their ability to discern fact from fiction. The ease of access to information does not always equate to accuracy or credibility. Students, in particular, are falling prey to the allure of online resources without critically evaluating their validity. This reliance on unverified sources is detrimental to their academic performance and overall knowledge acquisition.  In conclusion, the detrimental effects of excessive computer usage and technology dependency are becoming increasingly evident in our society. It is imperative that we strike a balance between embracing technological advancements and preserving essential aspects of human interaction, physical activity, and critical thinking. Let us not lose sight of the beauty and benefits of nature, and prioritize our well-being over the allure of digital distractions.
1266	1270	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have a significant impact on people. They help develop hand-eye coordination, enable learning about different cultures, and facilitate communication through email and instant messaging. Having computer skills is essential in today's job market, making it crucial to start developing these skills early. Hand-eye coordination is a valuable skill in various professions, such as sports and office work. The ability to type quickly and accurately is essential in many job settings. Websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram allow people to connect with others around the world, making it easier to stay in touch with friends and family. Overall, computers play a vital role in modern life, enhancing our ability to communicate, learn, and work efficiently. I believe that embracing technology is key to success in today's world.
1267	1271	1	3	The computer has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we access information and perform tasks efficiently. However, its widespread use has led to some negative consequences for individuals. One major issue is the lack of physical activity as people spend extended hours in front of screens, neglecting their health. Additionally, excessive internet usage has hampered social interactions, leading to a dull and isolated life for many. The rise of online dating poses risks as individuals may not develop proper social skills, impacting their real-life relationships. Moreover, the internet exposes users to various threats like cyberbullying and privacy breaches. To mitigate these negative effects, individuals need to strike a balance between screen time and real-world interactions, prioritize physical activity, and practice caution while navigating the online realm. Embracing a healthier lifestyle and being mindful of online activities can help individuals lead a more fulfilling and secure life in the digital age.
1268	1272	1	3	Have you ever owned a computer? Exploring the internet can be a fun experience, providing a wealth of information on various topics. However, it is important not to become consumed by the virtual world and neglect other crucial aspects of life. Exercise, socializing, and homework should not be overlooked in favor of spending hours on the computer.  Regular exercise is essential for maintaining physical health and preventing weight gain. Socializing with friends and family is important for emotional well-being and developing meaningful relationships. Additionally, prioritizing homework and education is crucial for future success and career prospects.  Excessive use of the computer can lead to negative consequences, such as poor grades and social isolation. It is important to strike a balance between utilizing technology and engaging in real-life experiences. Setting boundaries and limits on computer usage can help prevent negative effects on one's overall well-being.  Parents should monitor their children's computer usage and implement safeguards, such as setting passwords and blocking inappropriate content. Ultimately, it is essential to prioritize real-life interactions and responsibilities over excessive screen time. Education, socializing, and physical activity are key components of a well-rounded and fulfilling life.
1269	1273	1	3	"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 the fresh air that cools your skin and the wind blowing through your hair while you are running side by side next to your best friend. And you think about the millions of people who spend their time chatting on the computer. You also wonder about the amount of exercise those people would have, and would they be able to interact with friends and family members. Just think about your current lifestyle is it occupied with computers or is it free and wild? When you think about chatting to people do you think communicating in person or communicating by aim? I have surveyed friends and resulted with five out of ten go home and chat to friends online. This upset me because this half mainly had kids that did not play sports but yet they were very talkative, so in aim a problem I still have yet to find out. I asked question like ""what do you do at home?"", ""are you a computer geek?"". (@CAPS2 questions were only used to support my survey) The next time you are asked to chat online please decline before you to become obsessed with the computer. The amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is. There are some who live on their computers like the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 (a comcast commercial) and some who don't know what a computer is (not commenting). I am here to teach about the benefits of exercising and not the unnatural ways of a computer. Did you know people can lose weight by exercising? If you just pick up that old curling weight one curl is ten times as better then a click of a computer mouse don't believe me try it. Interacting with people is a big part of our life its how we get, give orders and its a lot faster type of communication than sending an email. Without interacting with one another we can suffer from depression. Depression can make people sick for example, my father, when @CAPS5 was divorced the depression affected his body and mind. At the age of @NUM1 @CAPS5 got a rip in his small intestine that grew infected and could have ended his life. I believe this was from lack of communication and this happens every day to everyone just open your eyes and realize what a computer can do to a man or woman. (@CAPS5 was remarried to Bonnie and now carries a scar on his belly). This is a movement that should change the opinion of many, do people spend too much time on computers? Just get outside and talk to your neighbor see what they think. I really hope you consider my argument. Remember, balance is key. Finding a healthy balance between technology and real-world interactions can greatly impact our overall well-being and relationships. Let's prioritize human connection and physical activity for a happier, healthier life."
1270	1274	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, some people do spend most of the day on the computers, but not everyone. Not all people take advantage of the computer. Scientists, banks, and schools rely on computers to function efficiently in their respective fields. These computers play a crucial role in our daily lives, providing us with essential tools and information. Without them, we would be at a loss in many aspects of modern society.  However, there are individuals who misuse computers, particularly in activities like child pornography. This heinous crime is a significant issue worldwide, often linked to kidnappings or, in rare cases, perpetrated by parents themselves. Addressing these challenges is crucial to creating a peaceful online environment once again.  It is essential to recognize the dual nature of computers - they can be powerful tools for progress and innovation, but also platforms for criminal activities. By tackling issues like child pornography, we can strive towards a safer and more secure digital world for all.
1271	1275	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that experts are saying people are spending too much time on computers and I agree. I'm writing to you today to share my opinion on the effects of computer usage on people's time management, activities, and the concept of ""computer dead.""  Computers have become an integral part of our lives, but excessive usage can have detrimental effects. Setting a limit on computer time, such as one hour, can help individuals prioritize other activities like exercise, which is essential for overall health.  Parents play a crucial role in influencing their children's behavior. By setting a good example and limiting their own computer usage, they can encourage their children to spend more time outdoors and engage in social activities rather than being glued to screens.  ""Computer dead"" refers to the state where individuals become overly reliant on computers, leading to withdrawal symptoms and a lack of balance in their lives. It's important to maintain a healthy relationship with technology to prevent it from taking over our lives completely.  In conclusion, managing our time effectively, promoting healthy computer usage habits, and avoiding becoming ""computer dead"" are essential for maintaining a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle. Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter."
1272	1276	1	3	Dear editor, I agree that people do spend too much time on their computers. And if you read this, you would see my reasons why. One of them will be about exercising. The two others will be about your friends and family. So read my reasons, and by the end, I hope I made my point.  First, let's talk about the lack of exercise because of always being on the computer. Did you know that from being on the computer all the time, you lose focus on exercising? If you're not exercising and eating unhealthy because you're worried about the computer, the weight that you put on just doesn't burn off by itself. By not burning off that fat, you just keep gaining and gaining. Before you know it, you'll be overweight and wish you didn't spend all that time on the computer.  Now, let's discuss how being on the computer affects your relationships with your family. For example, your family may want to go out, but you say no because of the computer. Your parents would feel neglected because of your lack of communication with the family.  Lastly, being addicted to the computer not only affects your relationships with family but also with friends. You might have quit activities like basketball, softball, and more teams because you thought it took too much of your computer time. In the end, you could lose a lot of friendships, and even your boyfriend or girlfriend might dump you.  Now that you have read this, I hope I have emphasized the negative impact that excessive computer use can have on your health, family relationships, and friendships. It's essential to find a balance and prioritize real-life connections over screen time.
1273	1277	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to emphasize the significant benefits that computers bring to society. Computers play a crucial role in enabling individuals to learn about different places they wish to visit. By accessing information online, people can research and plan their travel adventures with ease and convenience. Furthermore, as technology continues to advance, it is evident that the future will revolve around computers and the internet. Education, entertainment, and communication will predominantly be conducted through digital platforms, emphasizing the increasing importance of computers in our daily lives.   Moreover, computers greatly contribute to simplifying various tasks, making life more efficient and convenient. Instead of traditional methods, such as making phone calls or visiting in person, individuals can effortlessly connect with others through online platforms and instant messaging services. This streamlined communication enhances productivity and connectivity in today's fast-paced world.   In conclusion, the advantages of computers in society are undeniable. From facilitating travel planning to shaping the future of digital interactions, computers have become indispensable tools that enhance our lives in numerous ways. As we embrace the technological advancements, it is clear that computers will continue to play a vital role in shaping the way we learn, communicate, and navigate the world around us. Thank you for considering the positive impact that computers have on society.
1274	1278	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, my opinion on the effects computers have on people is that I think the computer is good for people, not great but it's good for many reasons. For now, I have three reasons why it's good.   Firstly, computers allow people to search for new places and meet new people. With the help of search engines like Google, individuals can explore different locations and connect with others who share their interests. This opens up a world of possibilities and can lead to meaningful relationships that extend beyond the digital realm.  Secondly, computers provide entertainment for people when they have nothing to do. Whether it's watching movies online or playing games, computers offer a variety of options to keep individuals occupied and engaged. This can be a great way to unwind and relax without having to leave the comfort of one's home.  Lastly, teenagers, in particular, have become dependent on computers for various activities. From socializing with friends to completing school assignments, technology plays a crucial role in their daily lives. While it's important for young people to have a balance between screen time and other activities, the computer can be a valuable tool for learning and communication.  Overall, while there are some drawbacks to excessive computer use, I believe that the benefits outweigh the negatives. Computers have the potential to enrich people's lives in many ways and should be viewed as a valuable resource rather than a hindrance.
1275	1279	1	3	Computers have revolutionized society, particularly in the realm of social interaction. Through the internet, people can connect with individuals from all corners of the globe, fostering friendships and expanding their social circles. Platforms like Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter have become integral parts of daily life for many, with a significant percentage of the population maintaining accounts on these sites. Additionally, the advent of live video gaming has made gaming a more social experience, allowing players to engage with friends in real-time.  Moreover, computers can also enhance hand-eye coordination, a crucial skill used in various activities, including sports. By engaging in activities that require hand-eye coordination, such as playing video games or typing, individuals can improve their skills and dexterity. This improvement can have practical applications, such as increased speed in tasks like note-taking or copying information.  Furthermore, computers offer a wealth of educational opportunities through online learning. Whether researching destinations for vacations, studying historical figures, learning new recipes, or honing sports techniques, the internet provides a vast repository of information and resources. This accessibility to knowledge has empowered individuals to pursue their interests and expand their horizons in ways previously unimaginable.  In conclusion, computers have had a profound impact on society, facilitating social connections, enhancing skills like hand-eye coordination, and providing avenues for learning and personal growth. As technology continues to evolve, the benefits of computers in various aspects of life will only continue to expand, shaping the way we interact, learn, and thrive in the modern world.
1276	1280	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  I believe that computers greatly benefit society for three main reasons. Firstly, computers serve as a limitless source of knowledge. Whether it is for work or education, people of all ages can access vast amounts of information with just a few clicks. This accessibility is crucial in today's fast-paced world.   Secondly, computers provide platforms for online communities. These websites allow individuals to connect with like-minded people, share ideas, and form friendships. While there are risks associated with online interactions, proper precautions can ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for users.  Lastly, computers offer entertainment and relaxation. After a long day at school or work, many people find solace in playing games or exploring new interests on their computers. This recreational aspect of computers is essential for mental well-being and stress relief.  In conclusion, the endless knowledge, online communities, and entertainment value provided by computers make them invaluable assets to society. Their impact extends far beyond individual use, shaping the way we learn, communicate, and unwind.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
1277	1281	1	3	Computers definitely benefit society in various ways. They provide children with access to a wealth of knowledge that they may not have been able to obtain otherwise. By using search engines like Google, kids can easily find answers to their questions and learn about different topics. Additionally, computers offer entertainment options that can help boost a child's self-esteem and provide a positive outlet for their free time. Moreover, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter allow children to interact with others and make new friends, expanding their social circle beyond their immediate surroundings. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing education, entertainment, and social connections, making them valuable assets to society.
1278	1282	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, 40% of individuals in our community have and use computers daily. However, the excessive use of computers is becoming detrimental to our society. Many parents and children spend significant amounts of time on computers, either for work or entertainment. Unfortunately, the abundance of violent and addictive games on the internet is concerning. Children as young as five years old are exposed to games featuring guns and other inappropriate content, leading to a lack of physical activity and fresh air, contributing to the already high rate of obesity in our population. Additionally, the misuse of computers for criminal activities such as hacking, fraud, and accessing illicit content poses a serious threat to our community's safety and well-being. Moreover, the excessive screen time can have severe health consequences, such as seizures and mental health issues. Parents often struggle to control their children's computer use, resorting to drastic measures that can have devastating effects on their children's mental state. It is clear that computers are causing a myriad of problems in our society, ranging from health issues to criminal behavior and mental health concerns. If we want to preserve the well-being of our community, it is imperative that we address and combat this growing computer addiction promptly.
1279	1283	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, In a recent poll, it was determined that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have used or come in contact with computers. @PERCENT2 of those said @CAPS2 use computers daily, not just for work. This extensive use of technology creates a lack in their exercising habits, @CAPS4, they enjoy nature much less. Furthermore, people spend less time interacting with family and friends. These are damaging effects on our society. ""The biggest reason why people don't exercise,"" says health professor @PERSON1, ""is because they just don't have time."" This problem can be directly attributed to the statistic that, on average, @CAPS2 spend @NUM1 and a half hours a day on the computer. You can argue that they @MONTH1 be learning new things or broadening their horizons. However, none of which help these people get or stay healthy and in shape. Being on the computer does no good for the body. Click the next link and watch as a beautiful hummingbird swarms across the screen of your desktop. You can clearly see its wonder, but can you feel it? Can you smell the fresh air it flies around? The computer can only show you nature, but you must log off and find it for yourself to truly appreciate it firsthand. Society will only cheat itself of the world's splendor while watching it on the screen. Fans of computers will argue that they help you interact with people around the world, but what about the people in the next room? Computers @MONTH1 bring you to people globally but distance you from people at your job, school, or home. As humans, they need contact with the outside world. Why limit themselves to typing to people when they can talk to them? In conclusion, extensive computer use does not benefit society. People will spend less time staying active. Moreover, people will enjoy nature on a desktop instead of in person. Finally, society will not spend as much time communicating with family and friends in person. The time has come to take a stance. It should be clear that computers are a danger to society."
1280	1284	1	3	"I think that the advances of technology to the computer are great and more beneficial than bad. Say you struggle at school and need serious help, you can turn to a computer for help, say you have a dear friends that a week ago moved to Florida, you can use the computer to contact them. And finally if you want to learn about the world, great! Google search places to learn about. These are just a few reasons why the computer is helpful as opposed to bad! School one of many students least favorite activities, yet you can use the internet to help you out, @CAPS1! say you are in geometry and it is kicking you're butt, got to @PERSON1 academy for informational videos. Maybe you are a third grade teacher and the little kids are driving you nuts, go to @LOCATION1, an educational and fun website. Maybe you just want to relax and learn, plug in earphones and listen to math help. These are merely a few ways that the internet helps with schooling. What if it is a really rainy rainy day and you are tired and want to learn about faraway places in a logical person's head, the internet pops into their head. Think of the computer as a big easy to access library, type something into a search engine and it pops up. What if you are in Germany and you are hungry, oh no! Everything is in @CAPS2! open your laptop for easy translation. All of these things support that the internet makes learning about foreign places easy. And finally, communication is really easy, with the internet because, there use emails, Skypes, chatrooms etc. internet's middle name is communication. What if your phone is gone and there is an emergency, you can get the email! What if a burglar cuts the phone lines and sneaking your house e-mail @NUM1. And finally internet can be used to call @PERSON2 and tell him, ""don't forget the red bull"" as he leaves. Those are some of the reasons the internet is good for communication. Go let's recap on this paper. Internet is great for communication. Also help with learning about far away places. And finally help with schooling. These are the reasons I think internet is valuable in this day in age. The internet truly serves as a versatile tool that enhances learning, communication, and access to information, making it an invaluable asset in our modern world."
1281	1285	1	3	The effects of computers on individuals are undeniably positive. One of the key advantages is the ability to learn about distant places. For instance, a family planning a vacation to a foreign location can easily research and book accommodations online. Secondly, computers assist in education by providing access to vast amounts of information not found in traditional textbooks, facilitating research for school projects. Furthermore, they simplify tasks like filing taxes, as individuals can use online platforms such as TurboTax to complete their taxes efficiently. Lastly, computers enable communication with distant friends and family, allowing for reconnecting and staying in touch with loved ones. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in modern society, aiding in communication, education, and information access, making them indispensable tools for everyday life.
1282	1286	1	3	Dear newspaper, Have you ever grabbed a nice cold cake and sat at your computer desk? I have, and computers do benefit society. One way computers benefit society is by saving people the time and effort of standing in a bookstore or library for hours on end. Instead, with just a few minutes on the computer, you can easily find any information you need. Another way computers benefit society is by allowing people to connect and chat with others from all over the world, breaking down barriers and fostering communication. Lastly, computers also help improve hand-eye coordination, as studies have shown that regular computer use can enhance this skill. Overall, computers play a crucial role in society by making information more accessible, promoting global communication, and enhancing cognitive abilities.
1283	1287	1	3	To begin with, the learning ability people get from it has improved. The @CAPS1 source is very helpful to many people. The communication is much easier than talking on the phone. I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills. It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice. They are great ways to help learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benifit someone. They are helpful for getting your local weather. In the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and excel spread sheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @CAPS2. They are useful ways to make life easier. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work using facebook, aim, myspace, and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. It's a way to get back and forth to eachother. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benifit. It helps learn, communicate, and most of all do the important things that we need.
1284	1288	1	3	I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers enhance our hand-eye coordination, allowing us to focus on the screen while typing on the keyboard, which is essential for various activities such as sports and work. Additionally, computers provide us with the ability to research and gather information on any topic through the internet, enabling us to learn and grow. For instance, during a research project on a specific country, the vast resources available online were instrumental in expanding my knowledge. Moreover, computers facilitate communication with loved ones who are far away, fostering connections through video chats and instant messaging. This is particularly valuable for staying in touch with family members or friends who live in distant locations or are serving in the military. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in improving hand-eye coordination, expanding our knowledge through research, and strengthening relationships through communication, ultimately benefiting individuals in various aspects of their lives.
1285	1289	1	3	The effect people shouldn't be on the computers that much because you need exercising to keep you healthy. You wouldn't be learn anything if you play games on it all day. Your brain will be focusing on the computers than school. You would be a bored kid or adult if you keep doing this. It will be sad if you throw your life away just because of a computer. The effect on people on the computer by not knowing technology is some people think that technology is dumb because you have a brain instead of a computer have information in your brain if you are smart. Some people are poor and never had a computer or never heard technology and country some of them don't even have technology or electricity because they can't afford for a computer. The effect that they don't know technology is they can find location and no cellphone you can call your friend go online and listen to music, play games chat to friend and family. Play games with each other. And watch movies. Another effect is learning about computers and how to use it step one turn it on. Click on internet explorer and search on a website to go on it's kind of hard to use the keyboard and typing it fast. The last effect is talking to people that you don't know from online. Is playing the game with a different player you can chat with that person. Conclusion this is all my reason why I agree with the effect of a computer have positive reason for a lot of people. This is why I agree with the effect of the computer.
1286	1290	1	3	Personally, I believe that computers have a positive influence on people. They are one of the greatest inventions of our time. Computers allow us to listen to music, watch videos, conduct research for projects, and have a good time. They help individuals create, listen to, watch, and make music and videos. Additionally, computers facilitate the process of finding information quickly and efficiently, whether it's for academic projects or personal curiosity. Furthermore, computers enable socializing and entertainment, offering platforms for connecting with others and playing games. Despite some drawbacks, such as potential for increased laziness, the benefits of computers in simplifying our lives, expanding knowledge, and enhancing social interactions outweigh any negatives. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing our daily lives and promoting creativity, communication, and productivity.
1287	1291	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper, do you believe the claims being made about computers being a health risk? I hope not. The so-called experts are blaming computers for people not exercising enough, but I believe the responsibility lies with the users. It's up to individuals to know when to take a break and prioritize their health. When it comes to family interaction, parents should be setting limits on screen time. Computers are incredibly convenient for accessing information quickly, and blaming them for lack of exercise or family time is misguided. People should have the ambition to exercise, and parents should be monitoring their children's computer usage. Computers are a valuable tool, and it's unfair to place all the blame on them. In conclusion, computers are not the problem - it's about personal responsibility and balance. I hope you share my viewpoint on this matter.
1288	1292	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I have some arguments to tell you how computers aren't all bad. One you can use them to get information for a project, talk to your friends, or learn about something you have never known before. My first argument is that most people use their computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. For example, they could need information for a country like France, Japan, or Australia. There are many ways you can get this information. So if you didn't have a computer where could you get all this information. If you get it from a library, it might not have what you are looking for your project. Computers have a bigger range of knowledge than libraries. My second example is you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. There are many ways you can do this on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or Yahoo. You could also make new friends online. It is always better to talk to a family member. I know it is a lot better to talk to family because they already know you. Finally, it is always better to find out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. You could always go on Google, Ask, or Wikipedia. They can all help you find the answers you have been looking for. But that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. Books are full of answers and ideas that can help you. In conclusion, you can always find ways to get the answers you need. But that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside or playing with your friends. Nothing is better than spending your time outside. So use the time on the computer wisely, then go outside and enjoy the outdoors.
1289	1293	1	3	Dear local newspapers,  People spending time on the computer is not a bad thing. In fact, it can be quite beneficial. Being on the computer can help improve hand-eye coordination, allow for learning about new and exciting topics, and facilitate communication with friends.   One important benefit of being on the computer is the improvement of hand-eye coordination. This skill can be crucial in various situations, such as in sports or even potentially life-threatening scenarios like the military. For instance, individuals with good hand-eye coordination, possibly developed through computer use, may be able to react quickly and effectively in dangerous situations, potentially saving lives.  Furthermore, the internet provides a vast amount of information that can be used for learning. By exploring different topics online, individuals can expand their knowledge and engage in conversations with others. This continuous learning process not only enhances one's understanding of the world but also boosts self-esteem and confidence.  Lastly, being on the computer allows individuals to communicate with friends and loved ones. This social interaction can have a positive impact on mental well-being and help individuals feel connected to others. Additionally, studies have shown that online communication can improve academic performance, as it encourages collaboration and sharing of ideas.  In conclusion, spending time on the computer can have numerous benefits, including improving hand-eye coordination, facilitating learning, and promoting social connections. Rather than being seen as a negative activity, being on the computer should be viewed as a valuable tool for personal growth and development.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1290	1294	1	3	"Imagine our beautiful town filled with unhealthy, lazy, noninteracting, and addicted people. The issue to grapple with is should you, the local people, spend more time on computers or not. I believe that we should not spend all of our time on computers. It can ruin your eyesight, you don't enjoy nature while interacting with people, and most importantly, it makes you very unhealthy. Can you picture a person in your town blind and having glasses or even going to the eye doctor? Just ask eye doctors, ""Every year I get more and more people coming to the eye doctors. You might say that it is good for me, but it is not good for you. When you are always on the computer, it erodes your eyesight over time."" Indeed, many people wear glasses now more than ever. In a recent article in the local newspaper, they had a chart showing how many people ruined their eyesight over the years from computers. It went up almost 10% from last year and 15% from the year before. Almost everyone that has a computer and is addicted to it has glasses.  Have you looked outside lately? Have you noticed that spring is coming and there are leaves on the trees now? If you were one of the people glued to the monitor of your computer, then I doubt you were. Computers and technology ruin your time with your family. Many jobs on the computer are not a real job. In that time, you could be spending time with your precious little girl or even your best friend outside in nature having fun. I remember a time when I wanted to play catch with my dad, but he was on his old computer. I didn't want to play alone, so I just stayed inside and went on my computer for the day. Do you want that to happen to every person every day? I wouldn't.  Yes, people would rather be couch potatoes and chat online, eating bags of unhealthy chips instead of going out and interacting while staying fit, but now it is important that you do. Just picture lazy, obese people sitting on their couch all day with their eyes bloodshot from staring at the monitor for hours. But why do you then you ask? It is because they never come outside. They never go for a jog or eat healthy foods. That is very unhealthy and can increase your chances of getting different cancers. Just ask the hospital staff, ""Last year, one guy was rushed to the hospital because of a very common cancer that you get from unhealthy living, he passed away two days later. It was very sad.""  I strongly believe that being on the computer for too long is a very bad idea. It can ruin your eyesight, you never get to see nature and interact. But most importantly, it is very unhealthy. It is now or never. You would never know if you could be that man in the hospital with that cancer. So take a jog, eat a healthy snack, and limit your time on the computer. Stay fit, healthy, and happy."
1291	1295	1	3	More and more people use computers, as they provide access to information and connect individuals across the world. Computers have become an essential part of daily life for many, allowing for communication with friends and family through platforms like Myspace. While some may spend excessive amounts of time on their computers, the benefits of these devices cannot be denied. In today's society, it is difficult to imagine a world without the convenience and connectivity that computers offer.
1292	1296	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,   I have some opinions on how technology is advancing and how some people are hesitant towards further progress due to concerns about it disconnecting individuals from their families and the world around them. While I understand these worries, I believe that technological advancements offer numerous benefits and opportunities for individuals.   Despite a reported decline in recreational activities, people are finding new ways to engage with the world, especially with the growing focus on environmental activism. Technology can actually encourage people to explore the outdoors, whether through joining environmental groups or participating in new activities inspired by media.   Furthermore, the music industry has been revolutionized by technology, providing listeners with innovative ways to enjoy music. Although some artists may exploit recording studios, the advancements in technology have also brought about a golden age of music consumption. Investing in the music industry can not only provide entertainment but also stimulate economic growth.   Additionally, advancements in hardware, such as cell phones, have driven innovation and growth in various industries. These upgrades are not only beneficial for businesses but also contribute to the overall enjoyment and convenience of everyday life.   Ultimately, the purpose of life is to find joy, and technology has enhanced our ability to relax and unwind with entertainment like television. The evolution of television has allowed us to learn, explore different cultures, and stay informed about current events. It serves as a valuable tool for both relaxation and education.   In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the impact of technology on society, it is essential to recognize the numerous benefits and opportunities that advancements bring. Embracing technology can lead to personal growth, economic prosperity, and enhanced enjoyment of life.
1293	1297	1	3	Dear @CAPS1-republican, @CAPS2 do benefit society in a positive way, but they also have a negative effect. Computers allow people to chat/voice chat/video chat with family members in other countries that would be very expensive or impossible over the phone. They also provide learning experiences with many resources at your fingertips. One positive effect of computers is that they allow you to connect with people around the world. Programs like Skype and allow you to video/voice/chat to people around the world at no cost. Doing such on the phone would be very expensive. It gives you the opportunity to see family members you rarely see. Another positive effect of using computers is the resource and information provides to you. The internet has just about every piece of information possible. Doing a research paper go to Wikipedia and topics you'll find information. The internet can prove to be helpful. The @CAPS2 offers you many good mind/puzzle games that you could not ordinarily do. There are a lot of good things on the internet. Many things that help get your mind flowing. Can't afford the newspaper? Read articles and stories right on the internet. The last reason I believe @CAPS2 have a positive effect on people is because it replaces. Many people, instead of going to the @CAPS3 will go to the @CAPS2. No matter what you are doing, you are usually doing more on the @CAPS2 than on the @ORGANIZATION1. That is why I think computers make a positive effect on people. Computers are sure to be our future. You can play games, voice/video chat and even read the newspaper. In conclusion, while computers have their drawbacks, the positive impacts they have on society cannot be ignored.
1294	1298	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently discovered that you are debating the computeres have on people. In my opinion I would think they have a neutral effect on people. In this day and age computers are used for many things. Research, communication act. maybe the reason young people so much time in the computure is because they have a lot of home work on the computer, ""@CAPS2 this"", ""@CAPS2 that"", people don't relize to pass we have to go on the computure. And for adults when you work with big companies you work with people all around the world. Instead of fixing to all these meetings you can simply do it over webcam. Yes, I see your concern that people spend too much time inside on their computure but what about people who love to read or play music, they could spend hours upon hours practicing or reading. What is the difference? And you never know maybe being on the computure for someone is lik a sport for another. Computoras are just about anywhere houses, schools and even crime & medical labs. Computure or a prime source of the data base, of @CAPS4, criminal records and so much more. With out computures how could catch the bad guy or catch the cancer before it's too late. Computure are key in many things. in the end you could go all day about the pros & cons of computures. But there so key in major aspects today, the pros out weigh the cons.  Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, serving essential functions in various aspects such as research, communication, and data storage. While some may argue that excessive computer use can have negative effects on individuals, it is important to acknowledge the numerous benefits that computers bring. From facilitating global communication to aiding in medical research and crime prevention, computers play a vital role in modern society. Ultimately, the advantages of computers far outweigh any potential drawbacks, making them indispensable tools in today's world."
1295	1299	1	3	"Dear @PERSON2, Have you ever noticed how different our society is today, even from just ten years ago? That's because of computers. Yes, it is true that computers give us advantages like messaging and information, but they also take away from some of the greater aspects of life: staying fit, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. Without those, life would be horribly unbeneficial. While surfing the web may be fun, it has been proven unhealthy. ""If a person was to spend more than two and a half hours on the computer every day for about a month they would see a sudden increase in their weight. And if they kept the behavior up, they could gain up to one third of their initial body weight until medical help was provided,"" say specialists in obesity. Also, a significant percentage of all computer users snack while online, which only increases weight gain even more. Unfortunately, those that spend a lot of time on the computer are not usually okay with exercising either. Instead of putting down just a half an hour out of their computer time to play with the dog, take a jog, or try some aerobics, computer lovers usually just stay in front of the screen. That's too bad because it causes health problems for them and maybe even the generations after them. Nature is being ignored more than ever. Trails and forests are becoming emptier as more people opt to stay indoors with their computers. The beauty of nature is being almost completely passed by due to today's new technologies, especially computers. Some worry if it will fade entirely, and instead of trying to maintain what's left, we may just let it go. Doctors and people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life. Family interactions are decreasing as individuals become more engrossed in their screens. Setting a little time aside daily to observe the aspects of life outside of computers can help ensure that life with computers will be beneficial after all. Let's make an effort to balance our digital lives with real-world experiences to maintain a healthy lifestyle and connections with nature and loved ones."
1296	1300	1	3	Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, especially for children who use them for learning and entertainment. While computers offer many benefits such as access to vast amounts of information and educational resources, there are also drawbacks that need to be considered.  One major concern is the amount of time children spend on computers, which can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity. This can result in health issues such as obesity and a lack of interest in outdoor activities. Additionally, children may become addicted to computer games, prioritizing them over schoolwork and other important tasks.  Another issue with computers is the potential for online predators to target children. It is easy for individuals to create fake identities and deceive children into revealing personal information. This poses a significant risk to their safety and privacy.  Moreover, computers are susceptible to viruses and technical problems that can result in the loss of important files and data. This can be frustrating and time-consuming, affecting productivity and causing inconvenience to users.  In conclusion, while computers offer valuable learning opportunities and access to information, it is important to be mindful of the negative impact they can have on children. It is essential for parents and educators to monitor and regulate children's computer usage to ensure a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
1297	1301	1	3	Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that there is a debate surrounding the impact of computers on society. While some argue that computers have a positive effect on people, I believe that the excessive use of computers is becoming a concerning issue. Many individuals are spending an excessive amount of time on computers, often just playing games and engaging in unproductive activities.   Although computers can be a useful tool for tasks such as paying bills and staying connected with others, the misuse of technology is evident. People are taking advantage of the anonymity provided by computers to engage in negative behaviors, such as cyberbullying and online threats. This misuse of technology can lead to harmful consequences, including conflicts and potential dangers.  Furthermore, the internet poses various risks, especially for teenagers. Social media platforms like MySpace and Twitter can expose individuals to predators who may pose as someone they are not. This can lead to dangerous situations where individuals are lured into meeting strangers in person. Additionally, the prevalence of hacking presents a significant threat to personal privacy. Hackers can gain access to webcams and private information, putting individuals at risk of invasion of privacy and identity theft.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, the negative effects of excessive computer usage and online dangers cannot be overlooked. It is essential for individuals to use technology responsibly and be aware of the potential risks associated with it. Measures must be taken to address these issues and ensure the safe and responsible use of computers in society.
1298	1302	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. However, I believe that there are more positive effects than negative. Some of these positive effects include the essential role they play in education, their ability to facilitate communication, and the fun activities they offer.  One major advantage of computers is their educational value. They provide access to a vast amount of information, making research easier and more efficient. Additionally, computers allow students to type their papers, ensuring legibility and neatness. Furthermore, individuals can work from home when sick or on vacation, thanks to the convenience of emailing documents to colleagues or teachers.  Communication is another significant benefit of computers. They offer various channels for staying connected, such as email, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and video chatting services like Skype. These tools make it easy to communicate with others regardless of distance, enhancing social interactions and relationships.  Moreover, computers provide entertainment and leisure options. Users can purchase or download games, both for leisure and educational purposes. Additionally, free online games are readily available, offering a quick and enjoyable way to pass the time. While excessive gaming can be addictive, moderation can make it a harmless and fun activity.  In conclusion, despite some negative aspects, computers offer numerous positive effects on individuals. They serve as valuable educational tools, enhance communication capabilities, and provide entertainment options. Embracing the positive aspects of computers can lead to a more productive and enjoyable experience with technology.
1299	1303	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  When it comes to the topic of computers and their pros and cons, there are valid points on both sides of the argument. As a student, I believe that computers play a crucial role in our daily lives. They provide us with access to a vast amount of information that can aid us in our assignments and studies. Instead of spending time searching for books in a library, we can quickly find the information we need online. Additionally, using computers helps to improve our hand-eye coordination through typing, which can be a valuable skill in today's digital age.  While computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential to maintain a balance in their usage. Just like with caffeine, too much reliance on computers can have negative consequences. It is crucial to remember the importance of face-to-face interactions with friends and family, as well as spending time outdoors to connect with nature. Striking a balance between using computers for productivity and enjoying other aspects of life is key to a healthy lifestyle.  In today's society, it is nearly impossible to avoid the use of computers completely. They have become an integral part of our daily routines and are essential tools in many aspects of life. Instead of advocating for the elimination of computers, it is more practical to encourage individuals to find a healthy balance in their usage. By recognizing the benefits of computers while also being mindful of their potential drawbacks, we can make the most of these technological advancements without losing sight of what truly matters in life.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1300	1304	1	3	Would you like to discover new things and explore amazing mysteries around the world? Do you love to have friends overseas? Do you want to relax and do something fun after school? Advanced technology today allows you to do almost everything that would have been considered impossible decades ago. We need to decide whether computers have a positive or negative effect on people. I firmly believe computers give society many benefits and opportunities.  Who would disagree that computers are devoted to educational purposes? Computer experts have invented countless programs that make school tasks easier for kids. For example, Microsoft Word helps you with essays and reports. With this program, teachers wouldn't hurt their eyes trying to read sloppy handwritten compositions from students. Excel helps you organize and calculate, and PowerPoint gives you the ability to create dynamic presentations. Many schools have a computer lab for students to complete their assignments. Schools have also acquired convenient-sized laptops to help students do their projects and take tests, saving a lot of paper and trees. Furthermore, many colleges offer their courses online, allowing students to obtain a college degree right from their homes. Education has never been so easy, thanks to our advanced network and computers.  It is essential to mention the entertainment benefits of computers. Many teens play cool games on the internet, greatly enjoying this opportunity. It is an ideal way to relax after a stressful day by getting on the computer and listening to the newest songs. Some websites offer downloadable songs for free, so you don't need to worry about the financial aspect. Moreover, you can watch movies online anytime, from a wide selection such as horror, romance, comedy, fantasy, or even children's films. No more movie tickets, no more driving to the theater. Without a doubt, computers can put a smile on everyone's face with its entertainment benefits.  Many people feel that computers isolate kids and adults from their social life, but actually, computers give them a chance to communicate with people around the world. Ten years ago, who would have thought that they could chat and talk directly with someone a thousand miles away, with no mail or telephone? I am currently in a different country. I am extremely grateful to computers because I can keep in touch with my friends and relatives by sending them pictures of the snowy winter sceneries here in just a minute. How much easier could it get? Computers definitely improve communication and bring people closer.  Let's not wait any longer. Computers have endless positive effects and should be popularized. They help you learn, have fun, and communicate with people far away. Beyond all that, new technology makes the earth a greener place by saving paper and trees. Don't sit and wait; educate people about the benefits of computers today.
1301	1305	1	3	Dear @CAPS1: A @CAPS2. Can you believe that this tiny piece of technology is influencing our everyday life? The question upon many people is, do computers give a positive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, although computers help with certain aspects of everyday life, I think that they also have some negative effects. I have many reasons for this belief, but the three most important are going to be stated.  First of all, people are so busy on their computers that they spend less time engaging in physical activities. People are becoming more sedentary, opting to spend hours in front of screens rather than being active. This can have detrimental effects on their health in the long run, leading to issues like obesity and other health problems.  Secondly, the excessive use of computers and technology can lead to a disconnect from nature. People are spending less and less time outdoors, appreciating the beauty of the natural world. Instead, they are glued to their screens, missing out on the wonders of the environment around them. This can have negative effects on mental health and overall well-being.  Lastly, the prevalence of technology can also lead to a decline in face-to-face interactions with friends and family. People are often more focused on their devices than on building and maintaining relationships with those around them. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, as genuine human connections are replaced by virtual interactions.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is important for people to find a balance between technology and real-life experiences. It is crucial to prioritize physical activity, time spent in nature, and meaningful interactions with loved ones. By finding this balance, we can ensure that technology enhances our lives rather than detracts from them.
1302	1306	1	3	Dear editor, I believe that computers are an essential addition to any household due to their practicality and entertainment value. One significant benefit of having a computer at home is the ease of staying connected with distant friends and family members. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Skype make communication effortless, allowing individuals to bridge the gap of physical distance. Not only does this foster stronger relationships, but studies have shown that it significantly improves family connections. Moreover, computers serve as valuable educational tools, especially for children. Interactive computer games can effectively prepare young learners for school, proving to be more engaging and effective than traditional textbooks. Additionally, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options for individuals of all ages. From playing online games to watching videos on platforms like YouTube, there is no shortage of ways to enjoy leisure time on a computer. In essence, the multifaceted benefits of computers make them an indispensable asset in modern homes. My personal experience and that of my family members underscore the importance of having a computer in the household, as it enhances communication, learning, and entertainment opportunities. In conclusion, the role of computers in our daily lives cannot be overstated, making them a valuable addition to any household.
1303	1307	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1,   @CAPS1's position on the computer controversy is that computers are essential and beneficial in today's world. They serve as a vital tool for communication, information retrieval, and business operations.   Computers enable individuals to communicate with others through various channels such as email, social media, and online messaging platforms. They also provide a platform for networking and connecting with like-minded individuals. In addition, computers allow for quick access to information through search engines like Google, facilitating research and learning.   Moreover, computers play a crucial role in business environments by facilitating communication, creating presentations, and conducting marketing campaigns. Many companies rely on computers and the internet for advertising and promoting their products.   In conclusion, computers are not overused but rather serve as a necessary tool for communication, information access, and business operations in today's digital age.   Thank you.
1304	1308	1	3	I think that computers have a positive effect on people because you can communicate with different places around the world, store things on them, and use them for entertainment. Computers have a positive effect because you can communicate with other people around the world. This is good because instead of calling people you can go on the computer and talk to them for free. Long-distance phone calls cost a lot, but if you can just go on your computer and talk to them, there's going to be no charge. Being able to talk to other people over the internet is very useful and fun. If there wasn't a computer, people would be talking to as many people, and their social life would be bad, making their life not as exciting. This is one reason why I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Another reason why computers give a positive effect on people is if you have a lot of paperwork that is just lying around and in the way. Well, if you have a computer, there are features that you're able to store things and be much more organized. Being more organized means there is less stress once you start to feel better about losing things and being able to find them. This is why I think that computers are very great and useful. The last reason why I think that computers have a positive effect on people is that people can use them for entertainment. Computers can do many things like play games, listen to music, watch videos, and chat with your friends. Being able to play games for free on your computer is awesome. If you can't afford to get a game system, then you are able to go on your computer and play pretty much whatever game or something close to the game that you want to play. A computer can also play music. You can have playlists and download music to something or go to websites that have music on them. Also, you can do video chats with your friends if they live far away. I hope that I convinced you to like computers more and think that they are great and have a positive effect on people. Being able to play games, store things, and chat with other people is pretty amazing. In conclusion, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate, store information, and entertain ourselves, making them essential and beneficial tools in our daily lives.
1305	1309	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, do you have a computer at home? Do your kids spend hours on it, chatting with people or scrolling through social media sites? While using the computer can be fun and engaging, excessive screen time can have negative effects on one's health and overall well-being.  Spending too much time on the computer can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, as individuals may neglect exercise and outdoor activities. This lack of physical activity can result in various health issues, such as obesity and poor cardiovascular health. Furthermore, excessive screen time can impact one's social life, as individuals may become isolated and disconnected from family and friends.  I have personally experienced the negative consequences of spending too much time on the computer. I found myself skipping out on social events and neglecting my responsibilities at home and school. It wasn't until my mom confronted me about my excessive screen time that I realized the detrimental effects it was having on my life.  Research shows that children who spend a significant amount of time on the computer are more likely to struggle academically and face disciplinary issues. It is crucial for individuals to find a balance between using the computer for leisure and engaging in other activities that promote physical, mental, and social well-being.  In conclusion, while computers are valuable tools for information and communication, it is essential to limit screen time and prioritize activities that promote a healthy and balanced lifestyle. By finding a healthy balance between screen time and other activities, individuals can ensure they are taking care of both their physical and mental well-being.
1306	1310	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you about how technology affects people. My argument is that some people think that Computers are taking too much of people's time, I will tell you how technology keeps people from exercising and gaining life experiences. Now I will explain in further detail. My first reason for saying computers affect people is that they can't get exercise when their face is glued to a computer screen all day. Especially with the number of kids playing video games or using the computer, the childhood obesity rate will slowly rise due to them not getting exercise or becoming weak. That is why computers have a negative effect on people by not letting them get the exercise they need. My second reason for saying computers have a negative effect on people is that they won't be able to gain life experience. I say this because when someone asks you, ""What did you do today?"" your only answer could be, ""Can we change the question to what did I not do today?"" When you are on the computer all day, you won't be able to explore and observe nature. Even when parents ask if you want to go for a walk, you should do it. You could learn something or see something you wouldn't be able to see on a daily basis. That is why computers have a negative effect on people when their face is glued to a computer. So now I am going to close this letter, and I hope you see that exercise and gaining life experiences will change your life forever."
1307	1311	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: @CAPS4 people are skeptic on whether or not computers benefit people. I strongly believe that computers do indeed benefit humanity for it allows people to talk online with loved ones and friends across the globe, and learn about those foreign places. Computers don't take away from lifes, but shows it through fascinating synthetics. Computers allow people of all ages to interact with others over the world-wide web. Sometimes it's better to meet with people in person, but that isn't always the case. What @CAPS5 you have relatives or friends in a different country? The internet is the best way to contact those people. Also, what @CAPS5 you are in a band or a group, and need to contact them while you are out of town? Social sites like Facebook or MySpace allow the group members to talk and discuss matters at the hotel or wherever he @MONTH1 be. In addition to both of these reasons, students can obtain missing work and email the teacher from his household. This allows the pupil to obtain his lesson and catch up on anything he or she has missed. The technological breakthrough of the @DATE1 known as computers allow interaction with other people as well as learn of distant lands. @CAPS4 people including myself, want some culture in their lives, and wander about this lively planet we call earth and find out what's out there, but can not achieve said goal. The computer saves us time and money to do these things. All we have to do is open a search bar, type in a word, and boom, we are looking at @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, or even the fields of @LOCATION1. Any place you want is at your. In addition to this, @CAPS5 a new tourist attraction comes to be, whether it is an amusement park, a monument, or a historical find, the internet can show us this. We can see things we would be seeing @CAPS5 we were present at the place, but instead on a monitor in your home. The computer allows you to do @CAPS4 things without actually encountering their happenings. In conclusion, computers are helpful for they allow us to perform things we could not do under certain circumstances, like talking to people over the internet, or learning of foreign countries. Not everyone can do these things, but everyone who has a computer can. Additionally, computers facilitate access to vast amounts of information, enabling users to expand their knowledge on a variety of subjects. This easy access to information can aid in research, education, and personal growth. Computers truly enhance our lives by connecting us to the world and providing endless opportunities for learning and communication.

1309	1313	1	3	Dear local Newspaper,   Why waste your time learning at home when that's what schools are for? Many individuals are expressing concerns about the excessive amount of time people are spending on their computers. This trend is leading to a decrease in outdoor activities, exercise, and overall enjoyment of nature. People need to prioritize spending time with their families and engaging in real-life interactions rather than being glued to their screens.  Excessive computer use can have negative effects on individuals. For instance, I once stayed up all night on the internet after my mom had bought a new computer. The next morning, I felt exhausted and unmotivated to attend school. This experience made me realize the detrimental impact of spending too much time online.  Statistics show that a significant number of people in our community are devoting excessive hours to their computers. This results in a lack of outdoor exploration, social interactions, and physical activity. Instead of connecting with friends or family in person, individuals are opting to communicate through social media platforms like Myspace.  It is essential to strike a balance between technology use and real-world experiences. Engaging in outdoor activities, spending time with family, and participating in recreational pursuits are vital for overall well-being. By reducing computer usage and investing time in meaningful activities, individuals can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.  In conclusion, it is crucial to address the issue of excessive computer time. As a newspaper editor, I urge you to consider raising the prices of computers to encourage people to prioritize other activities over screen time. Let's work together to promote a healthier lifestyle that emphasizes outdoor enjoyment, family interactions, and overall well-being. Thank you for considering these perspectives.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1310	1314	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever truly marveled at the computers in our generation today? Have you seen all the interesting and amazing things that computers allow us to explore? Computers have been thought to advance our society because of their ability to show websites containing vast and diverse research. However, let me ask you this - have you ever wondered if computers actually ruin someone's life? People who use computers are often engrossed in them, neglecting the necessary physical activities one can engage in outdoors. Furthermore, individuals spending excessive time in front of a computer screen tend to interact less with friends and family, impacting their relationships. Another significant concern is the potential threat that children and teens face online from individuals seeking to harm them. To safeguard the well-being of individuals, it is crucial to acknowledge the negative effects of excessive computer usage.  If you were to visit a park or a field, you would likely encounter individuals enjoying outdoor activities like soccer, frisbee, or simply relishing the fresh air. Engaging in such physical endeavors helps maintain a healthy body, unlike sedentary computer use. Embracing outdoor activities not only promotes physical health but also uplifts one's spirits, transitioning from a state of passivity to feeling alive and invigorated. Moreover, spending time outdoors fosters strong family bonds and social connections, which are essential for overall well-being.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can lead to isolation within families, as individuals retreat into a digital world, hindering meaningful interactions. Research indicates that individuals spend an average of five hours on computers daily, limiting quality time spent with loved ones. Additionally, the online realm poses risks, with a percentage of children encountering dangerous individuals known as ""child predators."" Protecting children and teens from such threats is paramount in ensuring their safety and well-being.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential to recognize and address the negative impacts they can have on individuals and their lives. Encouraging a balance between digital engagement and outdoor activities, fostering strong family connections, and safeguarding children from online dangers are vital steps in promoting a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. Let us strive to harness the positive aspects of technology while mitigating its adverse effects to cultivate a harmonious and thriving society."
1311	1315	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 this ever happened to you? ""@PERSON3, did you do your research?"" ""@CAPS3, my computer crashed."" ""@PERSON1 did you practice typing @TIME1."" ""@CAPS3, my computer crashed."" ""@CAPS5, why weren't you online @TIME1? I really needed that sales report!"" ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, my computer crashed."" @CAPS6 it @CAPS2, you have realized that computers do benefit people. Whether it's doing a class project, practicing for a computers class, or exchanging business ideas, computers are a big help to society.  First of all, computers are a big help when it comes to a computer class at your school. There might be a certain speed that a person types, and to pass the class, the teacher could assign practice on your own home computer. It is a fact that 80% of kids that have some kind of personal computer at home get A's in their computer class. In my computers class, our teacher stresses the importance of practicing at home to increase typing speed. Every time I would practice, but one time my computer crashed, and I could not practice for the whole week. As a result, when the final exam came, instead of getting an A or A+, I got a B+. I blame that grade on not having a computer at home.  Secondly, computers can be used for learning about different things as well. Instead of running over to the library and wasting time with a book, you could just open up your laptop and look it up on the internet. By using computers, you can not only learn about your own country but also learn about foreign ones. Furthermore, by using computers, you can look up the customs of a foreign country, or look up programs that could help you learn a new language.   Lastly, computers can enhance many skills needed in the modern business world, such as socialization skills, communication skills, and learning about the younger generation. People must be able to communicate, and if people do not communicate with each other, we will all be lost in the headlights. In conclusion, computers have a significant impact on people, from helping in computer classes to researching foreign affairs and enhancing communication skills. Thank you for reading."
1312	1316	1	3	Dear local newspaper,   Supporters of technological advancements believe that computers have a positive impact on society, a sentiment I wholeheartedly agree with. Computers serve as powerful tools for learning and communication, allowing individuals of all ages to expand their knowledge and connect with others.

While traditional books have their place, the internet offers a wealth of up-to-date information in various formats, including images and videos. This accessibility makes learning more engaging and relevant.   Moreover, communication has been greatly enhanced by technology. Whether it's staying in touch with loved ones across the globe or collaborating with colleagues, computers provide multiple avenues for social interaction.

1313	1317	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, do you love computers but fear that you or your loved ones spend way too much time on them? If so, then maybe we should consider something. Many people have issues with their vision due to staring at computers for too long. Additionally, people miss out on other outdoor activities. Finally, if people are working off of computers for their jobs, they may be missing out on important aspects of life such as interacting with family and friends, enjoying the outdoors, or simply spending time with loved ones.  In my opinion, people should be enjoying things and not spending most of their time on computers. People who are dependent on computers may experience vision problems from staring at bright screens all day. Being indoors and on a computer all day can lead to missing out on outdoor activities like sports, nature walks, or bike rides.  If you find yourself too busy to spend time with loved ones because you are on the computer all day, it's time to make a change. Take the initiative to get up and have some fun with your family. Whether it's going on a hike or riding a bike, engaging in physical activities can not only improve your health but also strengthen your relationships with others.  So, the choice is yours. Do you want to continue being glued to a computer screen all day, or do you want to live an energized, pain-free life while spending quality time with family and friends? Getting up and getting active may just be the best decision you make for your overall well-being. So, seize the opportunity to make a change, and start enjoying a more vibrant and fulfilling life today.
1314	1318	1	3	Dear editor, I agree with having computers in our homes. I think that computers are good because of these reasons. The computer has a lot of information that you can look up. Also, the computer can save a lot of important things you need. Then you can communicate with people far away. I think that a computer is a really good thing because you can look up various things like something about someone's life that was important. You can look up a website that tells you about a word or a car that you need to learn about for school or work. You can look up something that happened a long time ago or a date that was important. Then you could look up your family tree and send out who you are related to and how your family was in the past. You could look up your book account or your email on the computer too. So, this is one reason that I think a computer is good for. Another reason why I think that a computer is a good thing for anyone is that it can save a lot of important things. Some you could save are important from your past. Also, you need to save your reports for your school or work. Then you can save pictures from when you were on vacation. You could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it anytime you want to. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. One last reason why I think that computers are a good thing is because you can communicate with people far away. You can have family that just went on and you can keep in touch with them through your email, MySpace, Facebook, etc. You could video chat with your friends or family that live in a different place. You could go in chats with your co-workers or your boss for a meeting. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. So as you can see, this is why I think computers are a good thing because you can look up things, how you can save important things also because you can go and communicate with your friends. So this is why I think computers are a good thing.
1315	1319	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effect of computers are that, it depends on how much you use the computer. But I think the computer has a positive effect on people. Why because it has made us kids' homework easier to do, and fun sites you can check out. Even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it on the computer.  First reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it makes our homework easier, instead of getting it from a book I can get it from the computer. Trust me it's much easier than reading all those types of books when you have a computer. Then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you. For example, when you have an essay to write about a historical figure. All you have to do is go to Google.com and all types of past information would show up. Then you go to search and put in the person's name then all this information of him comes out. So you get the right information that's an easy A+ for you.  Second reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is all the sites you can go on and play games or go on YouTube, or MySpace. It's a lot of things you can do on a computer to have some fun. For example, say you don't want to play your game or watch TV, or go outside. What do you do, get on your computer. So you can check your MySpace page or watch funny videos or maybe talk to some of your friends online. Think about it, you can't do none of those things on your TV or your game and especially not outside so that's why I think a computer has a positive effect on people.  Lastly, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers. Half of every adult's job has a computer that they have to use either to cash a check on a computer or teachers to put in grades and scientists to look up different experiments. For example, a teacher always has to use their computer to put in grades or see what us kids need help on or how far we got and how far behind we are. So it makes it easy on adults as well.  In conclusion, those were the reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people.
1316	1320	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, a majority of the @ORGANIZATION1 population will use any type of computer at least once a day. Our society has been around computers so often that some people will find it hard to even live without them. Computers have become something that people depend on. This, however, is something to take as a concern. When people are dependent on computers too much, they lose valuable skills that they once possessed and they spend less time outside exercising while also losing touch with family and friends.   It has become clear that computers have become a long part of people's lives. Computers possess the ability to do certain human tasks that seem hard for us to do. Before the computer age, it was a lot more difficult to find information on a topic or place. We used to have to use encyclopedias or find books on those topics. Sometimes we would even have to travel to a place and learn about it. Today, however, people use technology to find this information.   You may be thinking, ""Well, how is this a bad thing?"". The reason it is a problem is that people have begun to lose the ability to use books like encyclopedias and atlases or even simple maps. Once, most of the population could use these tools to help find their way through information or a place. I know from experience that I can barely look at a map and find where I am. We have become too dependent on GPS and computers, which in turn makes us forget valuable information.   Additionally, people all around the world have become addicted to the internet. Facebook, Twitter, and even online gaming have become an addicting activity that people consume all of their time with. When people begin to spend the majority of their time on these websites, they will in turn get less exercise and become more distant from family and friends. Mostly teenagers have this problem. If you took a survey of the number of students who have a Facebook account or Twitter, you would probably get the majority. Having an account like this is said to be addicting.   America is one of the leading nations with obesity. Has anyone stopped to think that maybe people spend too much time on these websites to get any exercise? If the internet wasn't such a big thing as it is now, I bet there would be fewer overweight people. But not only do people become overweight, they will end up more and more distant from family and friends.   Computers are an addicting thing that can cause less exercising and less communication, which is proven to support a healthy lifestyle. Also, when people use computers too much, they lose valuable skills. Remember this next time you or someone you know sits down at a computer for a long time. You can help them. Let's strive to find a balance in our computer usage to maintain our physical health and relationships with those around us."

My cousins saw an article about @LOCATION3 once and they thought it was amazing they learned a lot about the culture there and actually took a trip there! Furthermore, vacations.com says that computers are the #@NUM1 cause of people traveling, because they see pictures and articles about places.

Also, expert computer teacher, @PERSON1, says, ìComputers are geat inf you can't meet someone, you just talk onlineî. Have you ever needed to cancel a meeting? Computer are really beneficial to busy people. Now readers, @CAPS1, your sitting on that same couch you look at the @CAPS2 to see @LOCATION1, you quickly type it into your laptop and an article right in front of you read more about it learning something new in every paragraph. All of a sudden you lose your grip, but you catch your laptop just in time, what hand-eye coordination!

So what are you doing readers? Get out there and get a computer.
1318	1322	1	3	Dear local newspaper, have you ever thought about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer? Computers offer numerous benefits such as improving hand-eye coordination, facilitating learning, and enabling communication with friends and family online. While some may argue that excessive computer use can lead to physical inactivity, it is important to recognize that computers can also aid in physical development through activities that promote hand-eye coordination. Parents often express concerns about their children spending too much time on the computer, but with proper guidance and limitations, kids can still learn and stay active by balancing their screen time with outdoor play. In today's digital age, computers play a crucial role in education, providing access to information and resources that may not be readily available through traditional means like books or school. Additionally, computers help individuals stay connected with others, regardless of their geographical location, through platforms like social media and online forums. As technology continues to advance, it is evident that computers have become an integral part of our lives, offering a wide range of benefits that contribute to personal growth and societal progress.
1319	1323	1	3	Dear @CAPS1-@ORGANIZATION1 Computers... they are sometimes bad and sometimes good they're like people. Computers are helpful on finding information, making your work less difficult. But at the same time there not so healthy to you and your family. Computers have so much information that the news paper in the future will no longer be known. Newspaper will no longer be thrown at your front porch. Because of computers instead of getting info of what happen yesterday in what area you live with the computer you can find out what intersting things happen yesterday in the whole world. But thanks to computers life is one step easier if someone had a science project. About as an example cells and with that computer it will help a lot more than you think no need to write all slopy just type of cell's were you can find in the internet, print done it just makes life way easier than just writing drawing finding info of cells in book that waste good time to go outside and play with friends and family. Computer like I said are sometimes bad like people and it also like a drug. Because look at computers when people go on website like, myspace, twitter, facebook, communicating website or game website, theres whay to much to name. Its a drug cause you to stay on it day from night you'll get stuck to it and can't get enough of it and some people won't stop and it hurts there family, friend and especially health, like drugs they cause all the same thing. I think I proved my point of why computers are sometimes bad and sometimes good like people.  Additionally, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate and connect with others around the world. With the click of a button, we can instantly message someone on the other side of the globe, making the world feel smaller and more interconnected. This level of connectivity has its benefits, allowing us to share ideas, collaborate on projects, and stay in touch with loved ones no matter where they are. However, this constant access to technology can also lead to a sense of isolation and disconnection from the real world. It's important to strike a balance between our virtual lives and our physical ones to ensure we are living a well-rounded and fulfilling life. In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly transformed our lives for the better, it's essential to be mindful of the potential negative impacts they can have on our health, relationships, and overall well-being. By using technology responsibly and in moderation, we can harness its power for good while minimizing its harmful effects.
1320	1324	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I believe that the use of computers has a positive effect on society. Computers allow people to communicate with individuals worldwide, helping them stay connected with loved ones and enabling quick and efficient communication for business and government purposes. Additionally, computers aid in organization by allowing for easy file management and scheduling, which is especially beneficial for businesses and educators. Furthermore, computers facilitate the creation of informative and visually engaging materials such as presentations and brochures, enhancing learning experiences and advertising efforts. Overall, computers play a crucial role in modern society by promoting connectivity, organization, and productivity.
1321	1325	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has been a topic of debate in @LOCATION1 for years. The question of whether computers have a positive impact on society continues to divide opinions. In my view, computers offer numerous benefits to individuals. They enhance hand-eye coordination, provide access to diverse cultural knowledge, and facilitate communication between people. Hand-eye coordination is a skill that can be developed over time, and computers play a crucial role in honing this ability. Research by biologist @PERSON1 suggests that a significant percentage of individuals who regularly use @ORGANIZATION1 show improved coordination, leading to better performance in activities like sports. This not only enhances recreational pursuits but also potentially opens doors to professional opportunities. Additionally, using computers can improve focus and concentration, as highlighted in a report by ""Time"" magazine. This increased focus can translate into academic success, creating pathways to lucrative career prospects. Moreover, computers serve as valuable tools for acquiring information about different cultures worldwide. For instance, students can easily research and learn about various countries for school projects, enhancing their understanding of global diversity. The convenience of accessing vast amounts of information online also saves time and enables individuals to balance extracurricular activities, like sports, with academic responsibilities. Furthermore, online platforms such as Facebook offer new avenues for communication and connection. According to @LOCATION2 @ORGANIZATION1 expert, a significant percentage of people utilize computers for communication purposes, whether it be discussing homework assignments or catching up with distant friends. This highlights the role of computers in fostering social interactions and maintaining relationships. In conclusion, the benefits of computers, including improved hand-eye coordination, access to information, and enhanced communication, outweigh any perceived drawbacks. Computers have become indispensable tools that contribute positively to society, enriching lives and expanding opportunities for individuals. Imagine a world without them – it's clear that computers play a vital role in shaping our modern way of life."
1322	1326	1	3	Dear trained readers, don't you agree that more and more people use computers? Well, I do because it gives us the information we want to see. Recently, it has been brought to my attention that some people agree that some individuals themselves don't really use computers. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that people who don't use computers should start using them. However, I can understand why some people don't use computers. Maybe they don't know how to use one, have better things to do, or can't afford one.  Firstly, some individuals don't know how to use a computer. I remember when my friend was over, and he mentioned that some people don't know how to use a computer. I was surprised and offered to teach him. Since then, all my friend does is go on the computer. This is one of the reasons why some people don't use computers.  Secondly, some people have better things to do. For example, they may have a game or practice to attend, leaving them exhausted when they get home. In such cases, they prefer to rest rather than use a computer. This could be a significant reason why people choose not to use computers.  Thirdly, some individuals simply can't afford a computer. Not everyone has the financial means to purchase one, as they prioritize basic needs over luxury items like computers. It's essential to consider the financial constraints that some people face when discussing computer usage.  In conclusion, the reasons why some people don't use computers vary from a lack of knowledge on how to operate one, having other priorities, to financial constraints. It's important to acknowledge these factors and understand that not everyone has the same access to technology.
1323	1327	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to express my opinion on computers benefit to society. I believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication, but people today overuse that power. While computers have undoubtedly revolutionized the way we work, communicate, and learn, excessive use can lead to negative consequences.   One of the main drawbacks of spending too much time on computers is the impact it can have on our social lives. People who are constantly glued to their screens often neglect spending quality time with family and friends. This lack of face-to-face interaction can weaken relationships and lead to feelings of isolation. Additionally, excessive computer use can limit opportunities for physical activity and time spent outdoors.   It is important to strike a balance when using computers. While they offer numerous benefits, it is crucial to ensure that they do not consume all our time and attention. By using computers in moderation and prioritizing real-life interactions, we can enjoy the benefits of technology while also maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Remember, computers are tools to enhance our lives, not to replace the experiences and connections that make life meaningful.
1324	1328	1	3	I believe computers are a good thing for several reasons. Three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. You can also use them to meet new people. Finally you can also use them for planning. My first reason why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. My parents use e-mail all the time. They talk to my grandparents, their friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. They use it for various purposes, like learning about magazine subscriptions and making purchases. My favorite part is when they use e-mail to discuss my birthday presents with my grandparents.  My second reason why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to meet new people. There are numerous websites that connect individuals based on shared interests and activities. Additionally, you can use e-mail to communicate with friends, potentially leading to in-person meetings. Whether through chat websites or social media platforms like Facebook or MySpace, there are countless opportunities to make new connections.  Lastly, computers are valuable for planning purposes. For instance, my family utilized our computer to make reservations for a vacation in @LOCATION1. Many people rely on computers to book accommodations and dining options while traveling. Without computers, tasks like managing bills and taxes would be much more time-consuming and complex, requiring manual calculations and paperwork.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in modern society by facilitating communication, enabling new connections, and streamlining planning processes. Their absence would result in significant challenges and inefficiencies in various aspects of daily life.
1325	1329	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe computers do not benefit society. I feel this way due to the lack of email skills, the decrease in physical activity, and the addictive nature of technology.  Spending excessive amounts of time on the computer can hinder the development of essential social skills. Communication online is often different from face-to-face interactions, leading to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. This disconnect can make it challenging to build meaningful relationships and navigate real-world conversations effectively.  Furthermore, the sedentary nature of computer use contributes to a decrease in physical activity. Instead of enjoying the outdoors or engaging in physical exercise, individuals may find themselves glued to their screens for hours on end. This lack of movement can have detrimental effects on both physical health and mental well-being in the long run.  Moreover, the addictive nature of technology can be concerning. Many people, especially teenagers, are drawn to the instant gratification and endless entertainment that computers provide. This can lead to a neglect of other important activities, such as studying or socializing in person. Setting boundaries and limiting screen time is crucial to maintaining a healthy balance in life.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential to be mindful of the potential drawbacks they bring. By recognizing the impact on social skills, physical health, and addictive tendencies, individuals can make conscious choices to use technology in moderation and prioritize other aspects of their lives. Let us strive for a harmonious relationship with technology that enhances rather than detracts from our overall well-being.
1326	1330	1	3	Dear editor of the @LOCATION1, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION3 own computers? Imagine a life without them! Computers truly benefit society in numerous ways. Personally, I cannot recall the last day I went without using a computer. Amidst the debate on whether computers are detrimental to society, it is evident that they play a crucial role. For instance, computers are advantageous for developing motor skills. Typing and using a mouse enhance hand-eye coordination, which is essential for activities like playing sports. Additionally, computers aid in school work. In situations where homework logs are forgotten, online access to teachers' web pages or textbooks simplifies the process. Research for projects becomes more accessible, covering topics from ants to @LOCATION2. Moreover, computers facilitate social interactions through networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, enabling communication and information sharing. Online news platforms offer news updates for those unable to watch television. The social benefits of computers are undeniable, emphasizing their positive impact on society. Let's unite to showcase that computers contribute to motor skills, academic tasks, and social networking, proving their significance in our daily lives.
1327	1331	1	3	Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering a wide range of benefits to society. One of the key advantages of computers is their ability to improve hand-eye coordination. By engaging in activities such as typing and playing games, individuals can enhance their reflexes and reaction times. This development is crucial in a world where technology plays an increasingly significant role. Additionally, computers have revolutionized the way we conduct research. Instead of spending hours in libraries, individuals can now access vast amounts of information with just a few clicks. This accessibility not only streamlines the research process but also ensures that information is up to date and relevant. Furthermore, computers have transformed communication by providing instant access to individuals around the world. Platforms such as email and video calls allow people to stay connected regardless of geographical distance. This level of connectivity fosters relationships and facilitates collaboration on a global scale. In conclusion, the benefits of computers, including improved hand-eye coordination, efficient research capabilities, and enhanced communication tools, make them an invaluable asset to society. As technology continues to advance, computers will play an even more critical role in shaping our future.
1328	1332	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you to let you know my opinion on computers and technologies. Computers have now become part of our society and culture and are very important for several reasons. One of the key advantages of computers is that they allow you to surf online anytime and anywhere. This is particularly beneficial for individuals who may not have easy access to a physical library, like Jane who lives far away from her town library. With the internet, she can conduct research conveniently from the comfort of her home. Additionally, online resources provide a wealth of information that may not be available in traditional libraries, making computers a valuable tool for academic pursuits.  Furthermore, computers enable people to communicate with others both near and far through online platforms and video chats. For individuals like myself who live far from family, the ability to connect virtually is a lifeline that helps bridge the distance. It is not just for personal connections; educational purposes also benefit from online communication, as evidenced by the millions of people who use video chat for learning purposes.  While some may argue that excessive computer use detracts from physical activity and time spent with family, studies have shown that a significant portion of computer users maintain a healthy balance in their lives. The convenience and connectivity offered by computers enhance our daily lives without necessarily diminishing the value of personal interactions.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in our culture by facilitating online research and communication, ultimately enriching our lives in various ways. Despite concerns about their potential drawbacks, the benefits of computer technology are undeniable in today's society.
1329	1333	1	3	Computers have become an essential tool in our daily lives, offering a wide range of conveniences and services. Online shopping has revolutionized the way we shop, allowing us to purchase items from the comfort of our own homes. Delivery services like People offer convenience for those without transportation. Social networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram have become popular platforms for communication and staying connected with others. Chatting and video calling have made communication easier and more efficient. Additionally, online streaming services like Netflix and Hulu have made it possible to watch our favorite shows and movies anytime, anywhere. The convenience and accessibility provided by computers make them an indispensable part of modern life.
1330	1334	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an amazing piece of technology, but some people are beginning to abuse them. There are many benefits to having a computer. In my opinion, computers help people out a lot, such as looking up directions or even chatting with old friends. However, many people are abusing the technology and not knowing when to get off. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to missing out on family activities, hanging out with friends, and being less physically active.  I believe that there should be a time limit for everyone when using the computer. If there were a feature that automatically shuts off the computer after a certain period but saves everything, people would be encouraged to go out more and engage in other activities. Even though the computer can be a useful tool for learning and staying connected, it is important to know when to take breaks and not spend excessive time in front of the screen.  There are also websites available where people can watch exercise videos or purchase exercise equipment, encouraging a healthier lifestyle. While computers can be handy, it is essential to set limits on usage to maintain a balance between screen time and other activities. Having a computer can be beneficial, but it is crucial to use it in moderation and prioritize physical and social interactions.
1331	1335	1	3	Dear Local newspaper @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1, and I am a member of the middle community. I recently read in the local newspaper about the debate surrounding the benefits of computers in society. In my opinion, computers offer numerous advantages that benefit society as a whole.   One significant advantage is the ability to work from anywhere. With the advent of smartphones, tablets, and laptops, individuals can access necessary work tools and resources remotely. This flexibility allows for increased productivity and efficiency, ultimately benefiting both individuals and companies.   Additionally, computers enable people to connect with family members who may live far away. Through various communication platforms and social media channels, individuals can maintain strong relationships with loved ones regardless of geographical barriers. This fosters a sense of unity and closeness among families spread across different locations.   Moreover, computers provide a gateway to learning about different places and cultures. By accessing photos, information, and websites online, individuals can broaden their horizons and gain insights into diverse perspectives. This exposure to new ideas and experiences can promote understanding and empathy within society.   In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing society by offering opportunities for remote work, facilitating connections with loved ones, and promoting cultural awareness. These benefits contribute to a more interconnected and informed community. Thank you for considering my perspective. Have a wonderful day.
1332	1336	1	3	Dear local newspaper,   A question that has been circulating is whether people are spending too much time on computers, and whether this is a positive trend. I believe that computers are a valuable tool to have, as they aid in learning and help individuals stay connected with others, even those in different countries.   Computers play a crucial role in education by providing access to vast amounts of information. Students can easily search for answers to their questions online, expanding their knowledge and understanding. Unlike in the past, where individuals had to rely solely on the knowledge of those around them, computers offer a wealth of information at one's fingertips.   Moreover, computers facilitate communication with friends and family, regardless of geographical barriers. Various programs and platforms, such as email, social media, and messaging apps, allow people to stay in touch and maintain relationships. This is particularly important in today's globalized world, where individuals may be separated by great distances.   Additionally, computers contribute to organization and efficiency. With the ability to create folders and store information digitally, individuals can keep their workspaces clean and tidy. This not only enhances productivity but also promotes a sense of orderliness and professionalism.   In conclusion, computers are valuable tools that offer numerous benefits, from aiding in learning and communication to promoting organization and efficiency. It is evident that computers play a significant role in modern society and are essential for personal and professional success.   Thank you for considering these viewpoints for publication in our newspaper.
1333	1337	1	3	People today are spending too much time on computers, which can have negative effects on their health, social life, and education. One major concern is the lack of physical activity that comes with prolonged computer use, leading to potential weight gain and a decrease in overall fitness. Additionally, spending excessive time on a computer can result in poor dietary habits, as individuals may prioritize screen time over preparing and consuming nutritious meals.   Furthermore, excessive computer use can also impact social interactions, as individuals may forego face-to-face communication in favor of online interactions. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, as well as a lack of meaningful connections with others.   In terms of education, spending too much time on a computer can be detrimental to academic performance. Students may become distracted by non-educational content online, leading to a decrease in productivity and focus on their studies. This can ultimately result in lower grades and a lack of academic success.   Overall, it is important for individuals to balance their computer usage with other activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle, strong social connections, and academic success. Finding a healthy balance between screen time and other aspects of life is essential for overall well-being.
1334	1338	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers have a positive effect on people because they help students as well as many others study, they allow you to access stores by shopping online, and computers allow people to communicate.  The first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help students as well as many other people study. If you have a test or quiz, you can go on your computer and print out practice sheets or find study materials easily. Computers are a valuable studying tool that many students find effective and efficient.  Secondly, computers have a positive effect on people because they save time by allowing shopping online. Online shopping has become a convenient way to purchase items without the hassle of traveling to physical stores. Many individuals have found online shopping to be a time-saving and stress-free experience.  The last important reason why computers have a positive impact on people is because they facilitate communication. Instant messaging, email, and other communication tools make it easy for people to stay connected with others. Computers have revolutionized the way we communicate and have made it simpler to interact with friends, family, and colleagues.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by aiding in studying, saving time through online shopping, and enabling seamless communication. With the numerous benefits that computers provide, it is clear that they play a significant role in improving the lives of individuals. Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.
1335	1339	1	3	Computers have a positive effect on people because they allow individuals to easily access information, connect with others, and make informed decisions. For example, individuals can quickly learn about places they want to visit, find necessary information in minutes, and stay in touch with friends online. This convenience and efficiency demonstrate the beneficial impact of computers on people's lives.
1336	1340	1	3	Computers play a crucial role in our daily lives, providing us with easy access to information, communication with others, and efficient writing tools. Through the use of search engines, we can stay updated on global events and interesting facts. Websites like Facebook and chatme.com offer safe platforms for connecting with friends and family, including video chat options. These digital tools promote interaction and maintain relationships regardless of physical distance. Additionally, computer programs such as Microsoft Word enable us to write effectively, with features like spell check and editing capabilities. Overall, computers are valuable assets that enhance our productivity, connectivity, and knowledge in today's society.
1337	1341	1	3	"Today, wherever you go, there is technology being used. The most common, computers are widely used by a majority of people, but are computers really beneficial to society? Computers are beneficial to society because it is a way to connect with the world, a way to increase responsibility, and helpful for education. Computers are beneficial because they help people connect with the world. You can use a computer to find anything that is on the web, so you can find information about places that interest you or places that you would like to visit. According to the @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people check the internet for places to @ORGANIZATION1 to before they actually go. @CAPS1, it is a way to connect with faraway friends. One of my friends moved to @LOCATION1 when we were in @NUM3 grade, but we still e-mail each other, and are still friends. The computer is @CAPS1 one of the fastest ways you can learn about current events. All you have to do is go to a news website. All of these connections will widen people's views of the world. Computers are a way to increase responsibility, too. When the people use the computer, there are many choices that they have to make, like what websites to go to and what to download or watch. Having these individual chances will help people think of what the right choice is. Even if you choose the wrong choice, you will learn from your mistake. Second, the computer is a very fragile machine and it takes a lot of to handle. For example, you can't have any liquid nearby and must not throw objects near or on the computer. Thinking of this and making sure not to damage the computer are ways to increase responsibility. Lastly, computers are beneficial because they help education. Teachers can use the computer to make lessons more interesting. For example, they can create points and presentation to providea @CAPS1, students can on what they learned at school. @CAPS1, you can make for the students, which provide them with their homework and information about the classes one of my friends once said ""@CAPS2 the I would definitely be failing"". Nobody wants to talk and a great way to present this. Lastly, if you want information on a particular school, you can just search it online and find its website. School websites have information about classes, events, and clubs. They provide the information that you need to think about going to that school in an easy, convenient way, while finding the website for the school take no more than @NUM2 minutes, actually going to that school for information can take more than just @NUM2 minutes, and even hours. According to @ORGANIZATION2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students choose what college to go to first by checking its website. The computer is an easy, convenient way to get information. Now, no one should be doubting the benefits of a computer. They are a connection to the world, like places, and people. They increase responsibility by giving you many choices. They help education by providing information about and for schools. This is why computers are beneficial to the society."
1338	1342	1	3	I think that people do spend too much time on the computer. Kids and adults alike are often glued to their screens, whether it's for social media, gaming, or other activities. This excessive screen time can have negative effects on their social interactions, physical health, and family relationships.  It's important for people to go outside more and engage in physical activities. Spending time in nature and getting fresh air can have numerous benefits for both physical and mental well-being. By constantly staying indoors on the computer, individuals miss out on the joys of outdoor activities and the opportunity to connect with nature.  Furthermore, interacting with real people is crucial for developing social skills and forming meaningful relationships. Virtual friendships can never replace the warmth and authenticity of face-to-face interactions. People who spend all their time online may struggle to communicate effectively in real-life situations and may find it challenging to make genuine connections with others.  Lastly, family time is precious and should not be sacrificed for screen time. Building strong relationships with family members is essential for emotional support, bonding, and creating lasting memories. Neglecting family time in favor of the computer can lead to feelings of isolation and regret, especially when loved ones are no longer around.  In conclusion, while technology has its benefits, it's important to strike a balance and not let it consume all our time. Going outside, interacting with real people, and spending quality time with family are essential for a fulfilling and well-rounded life. So, it's crucial to prioritize these aspects of life over excessive screen time on the computer.
1339	1343	1	3	Many people use computers for various purposes. While some may argue that excessive computer usage can have negative effects on society, I believe that computers bring numerous benefits to our lives.

I believe computers have a positive effect on people because they can be used to learn, communicate, and entertain. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it can be educational. Many people believe computers are good for nothing. Even though they can be use for many things like research! For example, if you are a student you @MONTH1 need to do a project. Computers would be easier for you to collect research than a book. Another reason why computers are educational is because you can use them to read. You can buy virtual books that you can read right on your computer. Not only is that education but that also helps the environment because you would be saving paper. Sometimes you @MONTH1 simply be curious about something, your computer will be right their for you to use. Computers also have another positive effect on people, they can be used for communication. Nobody likes a distant family, but with a computer you can communicate with family and friends from all over the world! This effect is positive because it helps everyone stay in touch.

So, instead those people could just quickly and easily send a email no instant message to who ever they need to talk to. Some experts are concerned that people too much time on the computer and less time excercising, enjoying nature and interacting both friends and family. These experts don't realize that you can use a computer to instead with friends and family. A computer many family thing.

This not only enhances social interactions but also reduces the cost of international communication. Additionally, using computers improves hand-eye coordination, which is essential for tasks like completing projects efficiently. This development can lead to better productivity and time management, leaving more time for leisure activities. Furthermore, computers enable online shopping, offering convenience and accessibility to a wide range of products. Overall, the advantages of using computers, such as communication, coordination, and online shopping, demonstrate their positive impact on society.

1344	1348	1	3	Who would have thought computers could have such a profound impact on people's lives. People all over the world use computers daily to learn new things. Of course, everyone benefits from the vast amount of information available on the internet. There are also fun activities to do on computers, such as watching music videos or chatting with friends and family. Social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter have made it easier to stay connected with loved ones. However, it is essential to remember that while computers are great for learning and entertainment, it is important to take breaks and spend time outdoors. Exercise and fresh air are vital for overall well-being. So, while computers are valuable tools, it is crucial to strike a balance between screen time and real-world experiences.
1345	1349	1	3	To the Newspaper, Computers are obviously needed in society. They can be used as a valuable learning tool, help communication, and teach skills that will be used for life. Students like myself of often use computers for many reasons. Our teacher also encourage us to use computers. All projects require research.

1346	1350	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, With computers being so popular right now, it's easy to think that they are helpful and have a positive effect on the people that use them. However, I believe that computers have more harmful effects than good ones on the people they are used by. I believe this for several reasons. One reason is that they take away from spending time with real people, as individuals may prioritize online interactions over face-to-face relationships with family and friends. This can lead to a sense of isolation and disconnection from those who care for them. Additionally, spending excessive time on computers often results in less physical activity, contributing to a sedentary lifestyle that can have negative impacts on overall health. Studies have shown a decrease in physical activity among young people since the widespread use of computers. Furthermore, computers can be highly distracting and lead to time wastage. It is easy to get sidetracked by entertaining websites or social media platforms, causing individuals to neglect important tasks or responsibilities. In my own experience, I have fallen victim to these distractions, resulting in lower productivity and missed deadlines. Overall, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential to be mindful of their potential negative effects on social interactions, physical well-being, and time management. It is important to strike a balance and prioritize real-world connections and physical activity to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.
1347	1351	1	3	Dear local community,   People have been using computers for years, but is it good for their health? We need to consider the power that teens have with the internet. If information is needed, there are plenty of great books available. Communication can easily be achieved through phones. It is essential to go outside and engage in physical exercise. Could the computer be another reason why America is becoming obese?   Firstly, the internet allows teens to engage in harmful activities that can have detrimental effects on themselves and others. Platforms like Facebook and MySpace have become prevalent among American teens, leading to issues like cyberbullying. Individuals have been humiliated online, and there is a risk of giving away too much personal information, potentially leading to dangerous situations such as kidnappings. The internet is a powerful tool, but the question remains: can teens handle this level of power responsibly?  Moreover, while computers offer convenience, it is important not to overlook the value of books. Information found online may not always be accurate, making books a reliable source of knowledge. People in the past lived without computers, relying solely on books for information. Have we become too lazy to pick up a book and do some reading?  Lastly, if communication is the goal, why not opt for a simple text or phone call instead of spending excessive time online? Turning on a computer and navigating through various pages just to chat online seems unnecessary. Our dependency on devices like computers may be contributing to a sedentary lifestyle, ultimately leading to health issues like obesity. We need to prioritize physical activity, social interactions, and outdoor pursuits over screen time.  In conclusion, the computer may not be as beneficial as we initially thought. From the risks associated with social media to the reliability of information and the impact on our health, it is essential to reevaluate our relationship with technology. Let's not forget the value of books, the importance of real-world interactions, and the need for a healthy balance between screen time and physical activity. Is the computer truly worth all the consequences it brings? Perhaps not.
1348	1352	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Over the years, the streets have become less crowded with people interacting, exercising, and enjoying nature. Is this good or bad? Technology has advanced so far that it might be better to stay home and on the computer than taking a walk in the park. Computers do have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage exercise, advertisements that encourage travel and enjoying nature, and computers allow people to interact from anywhere in the world. Firstly, computers are full of great advertisements. Some advertisements talk about joining a gym and exercising. Studies show that 70% of kids without computers do not get enough exercise, whereas only 30% of kids with computers do not get enough exercise. These statistics show that computers are better for people's health than they are thought to be. Next, computers have even more advertisements that encourage people to travel around the world. By doing this, people's intelligence will increase because they will learn new facts about new places. Also, people will be happier because they enjoy travel. Lastly, people's jobs will benefit if their business depends on the advertisements they post on the internet. Finally, the technology used in computers today allows people to talk to friends from nearly anywhere in the world on a computer. Social sites such as Facebook allow people to see pictures from where their friends have traveled. Webcams allow people to talk face to face up close about the new gym they joined. 40% of people say they have a better social life online than out in the open when their friends might not be there to talk. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage people to exercise, encourage travel, and computers allow people to talk from anywhere in the world. Technology is there to make the world a happier, healthier, and more social place. That is why computers have a very positive effect on people around the world.

Whether it's researching monarch butterflies or simply asking a friend a question, computers offer a wealth of knowledge that is easily accessible.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in preserving our environment, improving efficiency, and providing us with a wealth of information. Their eco-friendly nature, speed, and vast resources make them essential tools for a sustainable future.
1350	1354	1	3	Dear Newspaper,   I believe that computers have a positive impact on society. They help us learn about faraway places, communicate with friends and family globally, and provide entertainment.   Learning about distant locations, their history, and landscapes through computers allows us to plan vacations, aid in school projects, and discover our heritage. Communication is made easier with computers, connecting us with loved ones worldwide. Additionally, computers offer endless entertainment options such as gaming, web surfing, and watching videos.  Overall, computers play a crucial role in society by facilitating learning, communication, and entertainment. Their benefits are widespread and contribute positively to our daily lives.
1351	1355	1	3	I don't think computers benefit society as much as people believe. Spending excessive time on computers can lead to a lack of family time, reduced physical activity, and potential dangers from meeting strangers online. It is crucial for families to spend quality time together, engage in activities, and have meaningful interactions. Furthermore, prolonged computer use without exercise can contribute to obesity and health issues. Additionally, meeting unknown individuals from social media platforms like Facebook or Myspace can pose serious risks, such as falling victim to criminals. In essence, these factors highlight the negative impacts of excessive computer use on individuals and society as a whole. It is essential to strike a balance between utilizing technology and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to ensure overall well-being and safety.
1352	1356	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,   Computers have become an integral part of modern society, offering entertainment, convenience, and vast sources of information. While many argue for the benefits of computers, I hold the belief that they are not entirely positive for society.   One of the main advantages of computers is their efficiency in tasks such as typing, which is faster and neater than handwriting. Additionally, the internet provides a platform for communication, online shopping, and global connections. However, the presence of computers has led to a detrimental impact on human behavior and society as a whole.  The overreliance on computers has resulted in people becoming too dependent on technology for simple tasks, such as writing reports or making physical purchases. Furthermore, the storage of personal information on computers poses a risk of being hacked, leading to privacy breaches and potential security threats. Cyberbullying, a negative consequence of online interactions, has also become a prevalent issue in today's digital age.  Moreover, the addictive nature of online games has contributed to a sedentary lifestyle and a rise in obesity rates. Individuals can easily become consumed by these games, neglecting physical activity and real-world interactions.   In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential to acknowledge the negative impact they can have on society. It is crucial for individuals to maintain a balance between utilizing technology and engaging in offline activities to lead a fulfilling and healthy life. Let us approach the use of computers with caution and mindfulness to prevent their adverse effects on our well-being.   Sincerely,   [Your Name]
1353	1357	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 editor, I have recently seen on the channel @NUM1 news that you want to know about the impact computers have on people. In the past, everyone has computers and gets knowledge from them. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 surveyed at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 agree computers are helpful to us. In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people.  The first reason is computers teach hand-eye coordination. Without this coordination, people would not survive. The users be over very quickly. The computer makes us use these muscles so we can live happily. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 recently took a survey at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, agree computers are the main source of hand-eye coordination. Dr. @DR1 expert in relationship to humans said, ""People without computers can't do what others can. They are unable to have fast reaction time."" To sum it up computers help with hand-eye coordination.  The second reason is computers allow us to learn about far away places. When you can't look up and learn about places, you are not about them. You're lucky if you know when in the world they are. Computers allow you to look up those places. You can look into going there for vacation or doing a report. @PERCENT2 of the adults who surveyed at the public library said the computers help. They are full of so much more information than books. To sum it up, computers allow you to learn about far away places.  The third reason is computers allow you to talk online to people. This extends your friendships with people. You can talk on the computer, not just at school. It also allows you meet new and different people. You can talk to people in @LOCATION1 that you couldn't talk to without computers. Computers allow you to open up the to all people. @PERCENT1 of parents who took a poll in @ORGANIZATION1 say they want their children to learn about different cultures. They need the computer for that task. To sum it up, computers allow you to talk online to people.  In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons are to teach hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk to people online. I strongly urge you to look at any point of view closely. This decision is now up to you."
1354	1358	1	3	@CITY1 @CAPS1, Computers are indeed indispensable devices that have revolutionized the way we communicate, learn, and find information. They have become an essential part of our daily lives, offering convenience, connectivity, and endless possibilities.   One of the most significant advantages of computers is their ability to keep us connected with family and friends. Through various applications like @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, we can easily communicate with loved ones regardless of their location. These platforms enable us to video chat, send instant messages, and connect with people from all over the world, fostering relationships and bridging distances.   Moreover, computers play a crucial role in education by providing access to school websites where students can find homework assignments, class schedules, and resources shared by teachers. This makes it easier for students to stay organized, catch up on missed work, and communicate with educators when needed. The convenience of having all this information in one place enhances the learning experience and promotes academic success.   Furthermore, search engines like Google have become invaluable tools for finding answers to questions, conducting research, and exploring a wide range of topics. These platforms offer a wealth of information at our fingertips, making it easier to learn, discover, and stay informed. Whether it's for school projects, language translations, or simply satisfying our curiosity, search engines empower us to access knowledge quickly and efficiently.   In conclusion, computers have had a profound impact on society by enhancing communication, education, and information retrieval. Their versatility, ease of use, and efficiency make them indispensable tools in our modern world. As we continue to rely on computers for various tasks and activities, it's clear that their influence on people will only continue to grow in the future.
1355	1359	1	3	Computers have revolutionized society in numerous ways, impacting communication, learning, and shopping. In today's digital age, it is almost unimaginable to picture a world without these technological marvels. Communication has been greatly enhanced through social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, enabling people to connect with others regardless of geographical barriers. The internet has also become a valuable tool for learning, providing access to a wealth of information that was previously unimaginable. Researching for school projects, learning about different cultures, and even video chatting with people from around the world have all been made possible thanks to computers and the internet. Additionally, shopping has been transformed by e-commerce, making it easier for people to purchase goods with just a click of a mouse. Online shopping has not only made the process more convenient but has also opened up a world of opportunities for entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses. Overall, computers have had a profound impact on society, making everyday tasks simpler and more efficient. As we continue to embrace technology, it is clear that computers will play an increasingly important role in shaping our future.
1356	1360	1	3	I support the advance in technology especially in computers. Using the computer can teach hand-eye coordination, give you the ability to learn about faraway places or people, and give you the opportunity to talk online with other people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill to have. it quickens reflexes during everyday life. Hand-eye coordination is needed especially for sports like baseball, football, or basketball. Without computers, many people would lack hand-eye coordination. If you are driving a car on the highway, when suddenly a car swerves onto the wrong side of the road and is heading toward you, you need to react fast. Without hand-eye, you could die. Using computers could possibly save your life one day. If somebody wants to go to a foreign country, but doesn't know anything about it, he could lost it we on the internet. The internet is a major part in having computers. Without it, people probably wouldn't be able to research a country with ease or learn about other people. Some people @MONTH1 think that using the computer too much restricts people from getting exercise, which is true in some cases, but the computer is very useful to have if you want to know about something. Like who won the election, or who won the sports championship. The computers is almost a neccesity in every home. The computer gives people the opportunity to chat online with other people. Some they @MONTH1 know in real life, or some they met online. It expands peoples interactive life, helping them make new friends. Though this is great thing to have acces to, it is still important to socialize with people in person, rather than socializing online. Some people have trouble talking to people in person and more comfortable chatting over the computer. Maybe this person could make a friend, and one day meet them in real life. This @MONTH1 be dangerous for younger people, so be careful. I support the advancement in computer technology because it gives people greater reflexs, gives people the opportuniyt to research faraway places, and gives people access to the internet to chat with people online. These are three huge advantages than using computers give people.   Using computers not only improves hand-eye coordination but also provides a gateway to endless knowledge and opportunities for social interaction. The benefits of computer technology are vast and essential in today's fast-paced world.
1357	1361	1	3	"In modern society, it is rare that you come across someone who doesn't know how to basicly operate a computer. According to the statistics project known on youtube as ""shift happens"", most children in the United States, 95% in facts, have used a computer by age four. While it can be debated that computers are bad, I firmly disagree. Computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made. They have helped education, reconnecting, and are even at times good for the environment. I wonder why people disagree, and I hope that after reading this, you will too. At my school, there are three computer labs, each with about twenty-five computers, a library with twenty computers, and each teacher has two computers in their classroom. When I look at these amounts and add it to what I know about computers in other American schools, it is clear to me that computers have helped the education system. Many teachers can have students research projects with the click of a button. There are websites where students who were out from school can get their assignments for the next day. Also, teachers can put their grade books in their hard drive. This saves paper and ensures accuracy in the final grade. As a student, I think that computers have greatly improved schools in many ways, but mostly in those above. At one point or another in life, we are all older and want to reconnect with our old friends. Thanks to computers, the process of reconnecting is much easier. There are social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, that are valuable for finding your friend from summer camp. Let's say you have been connected with someone, and you've just found out that you got a promotion. You want to call, but you don't know the phone number, but you know the email address. Email messages send instantly to anywhere. (And while you're at it, ask for a phone number!) It's always great to talk with old friends. Computers have helped Americans make that easier. My friend recently purchased a Sony laptop. She liked not only the features, but that it was an Energy Star, or eco-friendly. Nowadays, computers have been made green in the battle for the environment. Paper is saved with online encyclopedias, newspapers, journals, etc. Not only that but computers are needing less and less electricity. You save green and are green! Today's society is helping mother nature not only in our actions, but in computers too. In my opinion, computers are helping Americans, not hurting Americans. They have assisted education, social reconnecting, and the environment. We must look kindly upon the advancement and miracle invention known as the computer."
1358	1362	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, don't you agree that computers should be limited or not used often? Computers have been shown to have a negative effect on society. I firmly believe that computers should be a hobby, not an addiction. Many people spend too much time on their computers, leading to less exercise and interaction with family and friends.  Cyberbullying is a significant issue that arises from excessive computer usage. Teenagers, in particular, are prone to cyberbullying, which can have serious consequences. Additionally, spending too much time on computers can lead to a decrease in physical activity. This sedentary lifestyle can result in weight gain and other health problems.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can also lead to a lack of interaction with loved ones. Instead of engaging with family and friends, individuals may choose to spend their time online, building relationships with strangers. This can create a disconnect within families and weaken bonds between loved ones.  In conclusion, it is clear that spending too much time on computers can have detrimental effects on individuals and society as a whole. It is important to limit computer usage and prioritize real-life interactions and physical activity. Let's work towards finding a balance between technology and personal relationships.
1359	1363	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, it has come to our attention that there is a debate on whether computers benefit society. In my opinion, computers are indeed beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, computers provide entertainment, especially on rainy days when outdoor activities may not be feasible. They also help motivate children to complete tasks, such as homework, by offering computer time as a reward. Additionally, computers facilitate social interactions for teenagers and adults through various online platforms.   Secondly, computers are valuable sources of information. With just a few clicks, one can access a wealth of knowledge from around the world. This enables individuals to learn about new topics and share their findings with others, promoting the spread of information and ideas.   Lastly, computers make life less stressful by streamlining tasks and improving organization. For example, typing documents is far more efficient than handwriting them, and computer systems allow for easy file management. This reduces the time and effort required to locate specific information or documents.   Overall, computers play a crucial role in our lives by providing entertainment, information, and organization. It is hard to imagine a world without computers, given the many benefits they offer to society.
1360	1364	1	3	I agree with the many people that computers benefit society. Computers can be used as a learning tool, allowing individuals to access educational websites and programs to enhance their knowledge and productivity. Additionally, computers provide a means of communication with distant family and friends through email, social networking sites, and video calls. Furthermore, computers offer a source of entertainment, such as playing games or watching videos, to help individuals pass their free time. Overall, computers play a crucial role in improving learning, communication, and leisure activities, making them a valuable asset to society.
1361	1365	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that the use of computers can have both positive and negative impacts on individuals. While computers can be valuable tools for education, work, and connecting with others, excessive use can lead to negative consequences such as social isolation and physical health issues. It is important for individuals to find a balance in their computer usage and prioritize activities that promote physical activity and social interaction. By being mindful of how we use computers, we can harness their benefits while mitigating potential risks. Thank you for considering these perspectives.
1362	1366	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, I think that computers have a bad effect on people because they will have no time to exercise, less time with friends and family, and it could give a younger child a bad influence. The most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy. For example my mom runs 5 miles everyday and still has time to go on the computer. If you use the computer excessively it's bad, but if you use it in moderation then it's a little better. People are always talking about obesity, and computers are one way it's happening to kids and adults. They just sit there on the computer and do nothing while on the other hand they could be outside. The next most important thing is that kids and adults won't have time to spend with their families and share memories with them. My mom always tells me the best part of your childhood is making memories with the people you love. My friends and I love to be outside and go to playgrounds and act like little kids, but it makes us laugh and people say that laughing keeps you happy and healthy. The last most important reason is it can give a younger child the wrong ideas. For example I have two younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids. One website could be harmful because bad people post videos and the little children could see them and get the wrong idea. In conclusion, I think computers have a bad effect on people because they spend less time staying healthy, less time with friends and family, and it gives kids the wrong idea. I hope I got my point across that they are bad.
1363	1367	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I would like to inform the public that using computers isn't so bad. One reason computers are beneficial is the ability to connect with people from all over the world through platforms such as @CAPS2, Yahoo, @ORGANIZATION1, or Gmail. Meeting someone from @LOCATION1 can provide valuable insight into different cultures and beliefs. Additionally, computers serve as a valuable source of information, especially for those who may not have access to newspapers or television. Websites like NBC.com or Fox.com allow individuals to stay informed about global events. In conclusion, computers offer a multitude of benefits, from connecting people to providing access to important news and information.
1364	1368	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Around 50% of people all over the world believe that computers have a positive impact on their lives. They view computers as a great tool for communication, allowing them to connect with friends, family, and people from different parts of the globe through platforms like Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace. These communication channels not only facilitate social interactions but also help individuals maintain relationships with loved ones who may be geographically distant. Moreover, computers play a crucial role in enhancing hand-eye coordination for both adults and students. By engaging with various digital programs and applications, individuals can improve their cognitive abilities and dexterity. Additionally, computers serve as valuable educational resources in schools and workplaces, enabling users to access a wealth of information and enhance their learning experience. Overall, the widespread use of computers has undoubtedly brought numerous benefits to individuals worldwide, making them an indispensable tool in today's society.
1365	1369	1	3	When you use a computer, the possibilities are endless. The internet connects millions of users worldwide, making communication and access to information easier than ever. You can chat with someone on the other side of the world, research any topic, and even see distant friends and family through video chat. The convenience of the internet has revolutionized the way we learn and stay connected. While some may argue that excessive screen time is a concern, the benefits of the internet in terms of learning, communication, and bringing people together are undeniable. In a world where information is readily available at our fingertips, we are fortunate to live in an age where the internet plays such a pivotal role in our daily lives.
1366	1370	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 post, I know that people are spending way too much time on computers instead of being outside. People are becoming addicted to computers. People are spending way too much time on computers because they are addicted to them, overweight, and not getting any exercise. I am telling you we need to address this matter. People have become addicted to computers. @PERSON1 says that in @DATE1 there were @NUM1 people using computers, and in @DATE2 there are nearly @NUM2 million people using computers, a significant increase in the last couple of years. People are becoming more addicted because of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Yale says that in @DATE3 the number of people on Facebook was only @NUM3 thousand, and in @DATE4 there are over @NUM4 million people using Facebook. People are getting tremendously overweight. One cause of this is the addiction to computers; people sit in front of their computers, eating excessively, leading to being overweight and unhealthy. Dr. @PERSON2 mentions that in the last @NUM5 years, the average weight of a person has increased by @NUM6 pounds due to excessive computer use and overeating. Lack of exercise is a key issue in staying healthy. Sitting in front of a computer and eating prevent people from getting the necessary exercise, resulting in weight gain. Dr. @PERSON3 emphasizes the importance of addressing this problem and highlights a @PERCENT1 decrease in exercise levels over the last @NUM7 years, mainly attributed to excessive computer use. It is crucial to raise awareness and take action to combat this issue. People must find a balance between computer use, physical activity, and healthy eating habits to lead a more fulfilling and healthier lifestyle. Let's work together to encourage a more active and balanced approach to technology use.
1367	1371	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I feel that the negative effects of computers on people far outweigh the positive effects. Computers have significantly contributed to the rising obesity rates in our community, with over a third of the population now classified as obese. This sedentary lifestyle often leads to poor dietary choices and a lack of physical activity, exacerbating the issue.  Moreover, computers can be incredibly time-consuming, with individuals spending countless hours in front of screens, neglecting other important aspects of their lives such as spending time with family, exercising, or pursuing meaningful relationships. This excessive screen time not only hinders personal growth but also contributes to a sense of isolation and disconnection from the real world.  Additionally, the dangers associated with computers, especially for children, cannot be overlooked. Cyberbullying, exposure to explicit content, and online predators pose serious risks to the safety and well-being of young individuals. These threats can have lasting negative effects on a child's mental and emotional health, leading to tragic consequences such as suicide or poor academic performance.  Considering the detrimental impact that computers have on our society, I believe that stricter regulations should be in place to limit screen time, promote healthy lifestyles, and ensure the safety of individuals, especially children. It is crucial to address these issues and prioritize the well-being of our community members over the convenience and entertainment that computers provide. In conclusion, the negative effects of computers on people cannot be ignored, and urgent action is needed to mitigate these harmful consequences.
1368	1372	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, I heard that you were concerned about people spending too much time on computers. While I understand the importance of balancing screen time with other activities, I believe that computers have many valuable uses. They are essential for research, schoolwork, and even planning vacations. However, it is crucial to remember that spending excessive hours on the computer can be detrimental to social interactions and overall well-being. Therefore, it is important to enjoy the benefits of technology while also engaging in offline activities like spending time with friends and family. Finding a healthy balance between using computers and unplugging is key to leading a well-rounded life. Thank you for considering these perspectives.
1369	1373	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think computers are beneficial to society even though some people don't because they give us a means of communication, computers give us the ability to learn about foreign people or places, and computers help businesses in so many ways. Computers are a must-have in society.  Computers provide us with a means of communication, such as @CAPS4, @CAPS5, e-mail, and much more. Without computers, families living far away from each other wouldn't be able to talk with just a push of a button. @CAPS5 allows us to chat with our friends after school and plan our activities for the night. Long-distance calls are costly, but with computers, communication has become easier and more affordable.  Moreover, computers enable us to look up facts about foreign places and people in just minutes. We can learn about historical figures or distant lands with a simple search. This expands our learning capabilities and allows us to gain knowledge that would otherwise be inaccessible.   Lastly, computers play a crucial role in helping businesses store and manage data efficiently. They streamline work processes, facilitate communication between different branches of a company, and make tasks much more manageable. In today's world, technology has revolutionized the way businesses operate, making processes more efficient and effective.  In conclusion, computers are undeniably beneficial to society. They enhance communication, facilitate learning, and optimize business operations. Without computers, our lives would be far more complex and less connected.
1370	1374	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think we should have computers for great purposes. One reason is because there is a lot more information on the internet. Another reason is because there is some history on many different websites. My last reason is because you can send messages to a faraway place by using e-mail. My frist reason states that there is a lot more information on the internet. For example, if youn don't have the newspaper with you, but you have you laptop, you can get information that way. Did you know, over @NUM1, @NUM2 people use their laptops for information and not games. Another example is if we get the newspaper everyday but it doesn't have the article that we are looking for, we use the internet. When we look for information on the internet, you would use yahoo, google, and other informational websites that you need. My second reason states that there is some history on many different websites. For instance, you can go on a websites and learn about history everyday, insted of going to a museum about history everyday! One day, I had to make a project about the @CAPS4 and I had four days to do it, you know what I did, I went on a historical website about the @CAPS4. I got an A+ for my project. When people need history, it's always all around them on the internet. My very last reason states that insted of texting people from faraway places, why not just use an e-mail address. For example, you don't have to pay for an e-mail address. It's actually free and did you know, more than @NUM3 million people around the world use an e-mail address insted of texting other people. When you don't have an e-mail address, it's very quick to make one. You don't have to waste money to text someone halfway around the globe. In conclusion, I think that we should have computers. One reason is that we have a lot more information on the internet. Another reason is because there is some history on some websites. And my last reason is because you can send messages to a far away place by using e-mail. Thank you for reading this article.  Total word count: 369

Additionally, computers serve as a valuable source of knowledge, offering quick access to information for school assignments or staying updated on current events through news websites. Furthermore, computers aid in organization, with various programs available to assist in document creation, data management, and work-related tasks. In fact, a large percentage of the workforce relies on computers to perform their jobs efficiently and effectively. Overall, the convenience and functionality of computers make them an indispensable tool in modern society, contributing to increased productivity and connectivity. Without a doubt, computers play a crucial role in shaping the world we live in today, emphasizing their essential role in benefiting society as a whole.
1372	1376	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, I am writing to express my concerns about the negative impact that computers have on the average American. One major issue is that people are spending less time outside, which can have detrimental effects on both their health and the environment. With the rise of technology, many individuals are opting to stay indoors and engage in sedentary activities on their computers, leading to a lack of exercise. This can result in various health problems and a decreased sense of well-being.  Furthermore, the excessive use of computers can also lead to a decline in family interactions. Instead of spending quality time together, family members may be glued to their screens, missing out on valuable opportunities to connect and bond. Building strong relationships with loved ones is essential for overall happiness and well-being.  In conclusion, it is important to find a balance between technology use and other activities that promote physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Encouraging people to spend more time outdoors, engage in regular exercise, and prioritize family interactions can help mitigate the negative effects of excessive computer use. Let's strive to create a healthier and more connected society by finding ways to incorporate these important aspects into our daily lives.
1373	1377	1	3	Computers play a crucial role in our society by providing numerous benefits such as efficient work processing, internet access, communication tools, and entertainment options. They simplify tasks, connect us with others, and offer a wide range of possibilities. While some may argue that excessive computer usage can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, the advantages they bring far outweigh the potential drawbacks. Therefore, embracing computer technology is essential for the progress and convenience of our society. It is evident that computers have become an integral part of our daily lives and using them wisely can greatly enhance our quality of life.
1374	1378	1	3	Dear newspaper, do you have a computer? Of course you do, that's where you get all the information you need. Computers are essential and everyone should have one. They allow you to learn new things and search for any information you may need. Additionally, computers enable communication with family, friends, or anyone else you need to stay in touch with. They also provide the opportunity to stay informed about global events and gain a better understanding of the world. In today's digital age, having a computer is a necessity that offers numerous benefits.  Computers are invaluable tools for research, whether for school projects or work assignments. They provide quick and easy access to a vast amount of information, saving time and effort compared to traditional methods like searching through books. Moreover, computers facilitate communication, allowing for seamless interaction with loved ones through video calls, emails, and other forms of online communication. This is particularly useful for maintaining connections with those who are far away or in different countries.  Furthermore, computers are excellent resources for staying informed about events around the world. By accessing news websites, individuals can learn about disasters, developments, and important occurrences in different regions. This helps broaden knowledge and awareness of global issues, fostering a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of the world. Additionally, computers can be used to explore new places, whether for travel planning or simply to satisfy curiosity about different cultures and destinations.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in our lives by enabling learning, communication, and global awareness. They are versatile tools that offer numerous advantages and enhance various aspects of daily life. Whether for academic, personal, or professional purposes, having a computer is a valuable asset that opens up a world of possibilities. Embracing technology and making the most of its benefits can greatly enrich our experiences and connections in today's interconnected world.
1375	1379	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, it has come to my attention that more and more people are using computers for excessive amounts of time. A recent study confirmed this, reporting that a significant percentage of @LOCATION2's population uses a computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day. This trend is concerning as it leads to individuals having less time to exercise, enjoy nature, and socialize.  The benefits of computers are outweighed by the problems that arise from excessive use. Spending too much time on computers can deteriorate a person's health, both physically and socially. For example, individuals like @LOCATION3, who spend hours on the computer each day, may neglect physical activities like playing sports, leading to weight gain and health issues.  Moreover, the excessive use of computers can lead people to spend less time in nature, affecting their connection to the environment. Instead of enjoying the outdoors, individuals are choosing to surf the web, causing them to care less about the planet and its natural beauty.  Additionally, prolonged computer use can hinder social interactions within families. Children and teens may prioritize screen time over spending quality moments with their loved ones, impacting family dynamics negatively.  In conclusion, it is crucial for individuals spending significant time on computers to prioritize activities like exercise, nature exploration, and socializing. Computers, when used excessively, can harm society by isolating individuals from physical activities, nature, and familial bonds. It is essential for individuals to find a balance and engage in activities that promote overall well-being and meaningful connections with others.
1376	1380	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that many of us disagree on whether computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I believe that computers do not benefit society. Many people in today's modern world spend way too much time on the computer when they could be exercising, spending time with family and friends, and enjoying nature. Read on and I am sure you will agree. First of all, computers are becoming a problem in society because they interfere with our physical well-being. The rate of obesity is continually growing in our population. According to a recent survey, one out of every three people in the United States is overweight or obese. ""The main culprit of the high percent of obesity is not overeating; it is actually electronics, especially things like computers,"" said a surgeon at a local hospital, after dealing with a severe case of obesity. Obesity is not a hard thing to get rid of. All we have to do is instead of sitting for hours staring at a screen, America needs to get outside! It can be as simple as riding a bike or taking your dog for a walk. Whatever you do, just get off your computer and go outside or to the gym for exercise! Secondly, computers interfere with family and friends. I know from personal experience that parents hate it when their kids will miss family dinner or won't go out with their friends because they ""need"" to finish the next level on their game or they ""need"" to look something up on the internet. Family and friends should be a very important thing in your life, but unfortunately, for most people, it is not. Psychologist has discovered that overall, having family and friends that you can count on beside you will make you a much happier and more enjoyable person. By eliminating computers from our lives, we will create a happy and more pleasant society for the people of the United States. Doing everyone a favor. Furthermore, if we cut back on our hours on the computer, we will have a better chance to experience the wonders mother nature has to offer us. Most people don't realize how much they are missing by not going outside. There are amazing things, right in your own backyard, that you will probably never get to experience because you are too addicted to playing on the computer. Years ago, people were able to function fine without computers, so we should be able to, too. Seventy-five percent of people have never even been camping! So next time you feel like spending another few hours on the computer, take a walk, and I'm sure you will be amazed at what you find outdoors. In conclusion, computers do not benefit society. They just keep people away from going outside, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. I hope I have convinced you to see my side of the argument, and thank you for your time."
1377	1381	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have a negative effect on people. One reason I think this is because people need exercise. They shouldn't be sitting at a desk all day playing games on the computer. Especially kids should be outside playing and exercising. More and more people will become obese if all they do is sit at a computer all day and eat junk food. If more people exercise, more people will start eating the right food, and many people will be much healthier and live healthier and happier lives.   My second reason why I think computers are negative is some kids get cyberbullied. This is when someone gets bullied online. Kids do this so they don't have to say it in person and they could say anything they want, and the other person may not even know who it is. Another thing is kids may meet someone they don't know and think is nice, but you don't know who he really is. He could make you, by tricking you, do stuff that normally you wouldn't do because you think he's your age or he likes you. Many girls have gotten taken because of this.  My last reason is people could miss out on fun activities with family or friends like going swimming in the summer or sledding in the winter. If you're home at the computer, you can't do fun activities outside and exercise while doing it. These are my reasons I think computers have a negative effect on people. In conclusion, it is essential to find a balance between computer use and engaging in physical activities to ensure a healthy and happy lifestyle.
1378	1382	1	3	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I belive that computers offer a lot more pros than they do cons. Computers offer another way to learn things about the world. Computers @MONTH1 also act as a research, tool. If a child, or anyone @CAPS3 on the computer and a family member thinks it @CAPS3 just an issue between the person and his or her family. Many people @MONTH1 argue and say, ""look in the encyclipedea to learn about the world, ""but a computer @CAPS3 faster, easier more time efficient to use. In fact, most people in the newest generation of families probably don't have an encylipea set. For example, if I were to want to learn more about @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 of searching in a dictionary or encyclipea, I could go on the computer, type in @LOCATION1 and a whole slew of liks and opportunities are found. Some people @MONTH1 like the old ways, but personally. I like the freedom and easiness of a computer. Have you ever had to research for a project or report? Many people either in school or in the work field will most likely need to research something to get a better understanding. Yes, a dictionary @CAPS3 helpful. Yes a thesauris @CAPS3 helpful but there are separate things. Compared to a computer those classic research tools are still usefull, but could be a hassle. My point @CAPS3 a computer has a dictionary thesauris, encyclipedea...ect all in @NUM1! So next time you have to research something try reaching for the keyboard @CAPS4 of the bookshelf! To me, the problem of someone being on the computer too much sounds more like a Family problem than a social problem. Technology has changed our world! Ever since computers were invented not only have they downsized, but became more and more useful. The computer has opened more doors for our scociety, without computers, space travel for example would not be the normality it seems to be in this generation. All im trying to say @CAPS3, I don't think computers hurt our society, but are pretty much the building blocks for our world. While reading this paper I hope you noticed the pros of having computers in this world. A computer @CAPS3 a help learning tool, the king of all reaserch tools and a big part of our society today.If you could learn one thing from reading this paper, I would want you to think, ""@CAPS5 would we, as a world be without computers?""Supplement appropriate details based on the existing information in the original text. Do not make significant expansions or extrapolations, and ensure smooth connection with the original text. The main idea, core viewpoints, and basic structure of the original text must not be altered. The word count difference between the expanded version and the original text must be controlled within 10%."
1379	1383	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 register, I am writing to emphasize the positive impact that computers have on people. Computers play a crucial role in providing direction, boosting the economy, and enabling instant communication.  One significant advantage of computers is their ability to provide accurate directions. In situations where individuals are unfamiliar with a location or lack a GPS system, computers serve as a reliable source for navigation. For example, when I was traveling to a remote area without access to a map, I turned to the internet for guidance. Through a simple search on Google Maps, I was able to find my way without any hassle.  Furthermore, computers contribute to the economy by promoting online transactions and reducing unnecessary expenses. By allowing people to pay their bills online, businesses can save money on resources like gas for commuting and maintenance costs. For instance, I observed a gas station near my residence undergoing costly renovations due to pipeline issues. This expense could have been avoided if more customers utilized online payment methods, thus conserving financial resources.  Moreover, instant messaging through computers facilitates quick and efficient communication, especially in urgent situations. In the absence of a phone or other means of contact, instant messaging offers a reliable way to relay important information to family and friends. I recall an incident where a friend alerted me about a potential break-in at her home through instant messaging. This prompt communication enabled me to notify her family immediately, potentially averting a dangerous situation.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in modern society by providing direction, supporting the economy, and enabling instant communication. Their versatile capabilities make them indispensable tools for personal and professional use, ultimately enhancing efficiency and convenience in various aspects of life.
1380	1384	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, In my own opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. Online, you can go on any website and talk to people. Most of the time, you @MONTH1 not even know who it is your speaking with. Plus not all information you @MONTH1 find is true. Computers also take time away from doing something productive, like playing outside. In the next few pragraphs, I'll show you my point. First off, online websites have many different ways to contact people (chat rooms, blogs, email etc.) @CAPS2, do you really know if the people you're talking to are who they say they are? Back then, it was rare someone got caught when trying to kidnap a child by pretending to be someone online; @CAPS3 a days more and more people are getting caught. You @MONTH1 think this won't happen to your child, but my friend was being stalked online by someone what they haven't caught. We never thought something like that would happen, @CAPS2 it did. Also, once it's online it never goes away. So watch what you put online, there is always some way to find what you had posted even once deleted. Plus not every bit of information found online is ture. I professionals say that @PERCENT1 of kids have researched a project online then used a print source and found that information to be false. On websites like wikipedia any one has the ability to change what is written on the page. Most websites @PERCENT2 give the ability for anyone to do so. Also post and pictures on the internet @MONTH1 not always be appropriate. There's certain criteria we keep children from seeing for a reson. Lastly, computers keep you from doing anything productive. It @MONTH1 teach hand-eye coordination however it does not keep you fit and healthy. Already, @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 alone are over weight and that's alot of people. Dr. @DR1 says that online games keep kids from getting much needed exsersize and fresh air, that every growing child needs. In conclusion the internet keeps children from going outside to play. Also, not everything found is what is true or right. Lastly, not everyone you find is the person they portray themselves. This is why I think that comperters aren't positive in society.  Computers have become a pervasive part of our daily lives, but it is essential to consider the potential drawbacks they bring. The anonymity of online interactions can lead to dangerous situations, misinformation is abundant, and excessive computer usage can hinder physical activity. It is crucial to be mindful of these negative effects and strive for a balanced approach to technology use.
1381	1385	1	3	"Did you know that in a recent poll in the US, 90% of adults use computers everyday? Computers have a very positive effect on people, such as informing them on news, traffic, and weather right away, interacting with others, and learning new facts. Can you even imagine how difficult life would be without computers? They are a daily tool that millions of people use positively. One way that people use computers positively is by using it to be informed by news, traffic, and weather. For example, say there are signs of a hurricane going to hit near their homes. they would know right away just by clicking on the internet. Another example is if there was a shooting nearby. People would be well aware of the facts by reading an article online. Computers help by informing people about danger so they and their families are not harmed not only does computers help inform people about any danger through news and weather, but also in their daily lifestyle. My father drives into work every morning, and is always looking online for any traffic updates so he can avoid them and get to work on time and safely, without computers people would be unable to know directly the harms and difficulties they may face. Another positive affect computers have on people, is letting them interact with others, such as video chatting and instant messaging. 80% of the world video chats and instant messages. It helps to make people more social, by chatting with their friends. Another example is, say you haven't seen a close family member or friend in a long time. Video chatting and instant messaging will help you catch up and develop a stronger relationship nobody wants to waste time in life not speaking for a long period of time to a close friend or family member, right? Computers help people by interacting with others throughout their daily lifestyle. A third positive effect computers have on people is teaching them new things. Students' main source for education is through the computer on the internet. Teachers from various schools said, ""Computers are what helps my students grow. I have them use computers everyday for reports and to extend their learning"". They are very helpful to students because the internet now contains textbooks they use in class. That way, the won't need to lug around heavy books, and stress out for forgetting them, plus, if the student doesn't understand material learned in class, they can look online for extra help and guidance, making their knowledge grow further. Without computers, lives wouldn't be the same in a negative way. Computers help people know news, traffic weather directly, interact with people, and learn new things. Therefore, computers are very positive, since 90% of adults use them now positively, why stop?"
1382	1386	1	3	"Dear Harold,   More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advancements in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. But computers can also have negative consequences. They can prevent children from exercising, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends.  Firstly, computers can discourage children from exercising. A high school student mentioned, ""I can never get outside after school, because I'm checking my email."" A recent study revealed that nearly half of the students at a middle school immediately go on the computer when they come home, depriving themselves of physical activity.  Secondly, some children are spending more time indoors than outdoors. A middle school student expressed, ""I spend most of my time breathing in air conditioning (or heat) than fresh air."" This lack of outdoor time can have detrimental effects on a child's overall well-being.  Finally, computers can disrupt a child's time spent with family or friends. An elementary student admitted, ""I spend an entire evening at a family party on the computer."" With computers present in the majority of households and being used by children, there is a risk of decreased interaction within families and friends.  In conclusion, it is important to monitor and limit children's computer usage to ensure they have a balance of physical activity, outdoor experiences, and quality time with loved ones. Computers can be valuable tools, but they should not overshadow the importance of real-world interactions and health.   Best regards,   [Your Name]"
1383	1387	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 we all know more and more people are using computers. Some believe that this would be a concern because it affects peoples health. I believe that with the advances in technology it would give us positive effects on people. Here are three reasons why, first would be that with advances in tech. It would teach us to be more intelligent. Second would be it it would give us the ability to have access to intresting things we can't get at the library like biographics and finally access to communicate online. My first reason @CAPS2 I mentioned before was it would give us intelligence. If we have questions to something we dont know we could search on the computer and find our answer. We would learn this and would be able to teach others. The computer can give us alot of useful information that can benefit us in the future. My second reason is that advance in tech. would help us because it give us access to helpful website that teaches us. Not all information is found in the library the computer has access to biographics educational website and most important the access to educational advances for example online tutoring for students with difficulties in school. My third and final reason why advance in tech. would and could benefit us is that it gives us access to online communication. Some people will have e-mail for good reason for example teachers have e-mail for educational cause if a student is having problem in work, the student simply send the teacher a e-mail of the what the students difficulty is and what the student can do. That is all I have to say for now. I hope you think about this.
1384	1388	1	3	Computers play a crucial role in our lives, offering numerous benefits and opportunities. They are essential tools that teach us valuable skills, such as computer literacy and hand-eye coordination, which are fundamental in today's technology-driven world. Additionally, computers provide us with quick and easy access to information, making tasks like research and writing reports more efficient. Without computers, our daily activities would be significantly more challenging and time-consuming.  Moreover, computers help us stay connected with our loved ones, especially when they are far away. Social media platforms and communication tools enable us to share updates, photos, and messages instantly, bridging the gap created by physical distance. This constant connection helps maintain relationships and prevents them from deteriorating over time.  Overall, computers have a positive impact on our lives by enhancing our skills, facilitating tasks, and strengthening relationships. They are indispensable tools that have revolutionized the way we live and communicate. In a world without computers, we would struggle to adapt to the demands of modern society and maintain meaningful connections with others.
1385	1389	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, there is a growing concern about the addiction to computers among people, especially children. Many individuals are spending excessive amounts of time on computers, whether it be for work, education, or gaming. Unfortunately, this addiction can have negative consequences.  Children, in particular, are highly susceptible to computer addiction, with a significant percentage being hooked on computer games. This addiction can harm their education and social development. Additionally, the use of computers at home can lead to increased electricity bills, adding to the financial burden of families.  Moreover, computers can pose a serious threat to individuals' safety. Cases of teenagers meeting strangers online and falling victim to violence are not uncommon. The tragic story of a couple who lost their lives due to online interactions serves as a grim reminder of the dangers associated with excessive computer use.  In light of these issues, it is important to reconsider the necessity of having computers at home. While computers can be useful tools, their negative impacts cannot be ignored. Encouraging families to engage in activities that promote bonding and physical health, such as spending time outdoors or going on vacation, may be a more beneficial alternative to excessive computer use.  It is time for individuals to reassess their relationship with computers and prioritize real-life experiences over virtual interactions. By reducing reliance on computers and focusing on meaningful activities with loved ones, we can lead healthier and happier lives.
1386	1390	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a negative impact on society. I say this because it allows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day, it takes away from their exercise, and it gives them less time to study and do school work. Overall, I think that talking is the main use for a computer. But, sometimes it is used in the wrong way. Experts say that a large number of kids have access to the internet, but unfortunately, many of them are bullied online. In fact, reports show that half of the kids who use computers have experienced online bullying. The accessibility of computers also leads to a decrease in physical activity among children. Many experts believe that the rise in obesity rates among kids is due to the sedentary lifestyle facilitated by excessive computer use. Additionally, the excessive time spent on computers is affecting students' academic performance. Teachers report that a significant portion of students do not perform well academically because they spend too much time on computers and not enough time studying or doing homework. It is concerning to see how computers, originally intended for learning and storing information, are now being misused for harmful purposes, contributing to laziness and hindering educational progress. In conclusion, it is essential to address the negative impacts of computer usage on society, especially among children, to ensure a healthier and more productive future.
1387	1391	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I understand you think computers donít have an effect on people. Computers do have an effect on people. For one reason the computer helps people find out information about anything. Also, it helps people do work. Plus, you can comunicate with anyone you want. Dont make any decitions before thinking about these effects on people. First of all, computers helps people find information quicly. To find information everybody uses either google or ask and many more. The information that people find would probably help them find were a store is or a number for a restaurant. Not just that but, you can find at how much something is at a store and if it is on sale or not. These are just some of the great effects computers have on people. However, work is a really large effect computers have on people. For example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because their are many stores you get to choose from. To go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on word if its for a report for work or an essay in school. Maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper. Yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is comunicate with their friends. Most kids either use facebook, @CAPS2, or oovoo to comunicate. Having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. Plus, one thing good about these programs are if you have family that live very far away from you, you can always talk to them at any time. I understand why you think computer dont have an effect on people. Computers do have many effects on people. Thats not all, computers help people find what their looking for. It also helps you with your work. Never the less computers are a great way to comunicate with friends or family. Think long and hard about what decition that you want to make. In conclusion, the impact of computers on people cannot be underestimated. From facilitating quick access to information, aiding in work tasks, to enabling communication with loved ones, computers play a significant role in our daily lives. It is essential to consider these effects before making any decisions.
1388	1392	1	3	I think that computers have a positive impact on people. They are not used for long periods of time, and they provide access to new technology that helps individuals connect with others around the world. Computers are valuable for tasks such as schoolwork, researching information, and communication. They enhance productivity and offer convenient solutions to various challenges. Overall, computers play a beneficial role in modern society and contribute to personal and professional growth.
1389	1393	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as: hand-eye cordination, learning and being able to talk online. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology. The computer teaches hand-eye cordination when people don't even realize @CAPS5, through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you. The hand-eye cordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. @PERSON3, a @NUM1 years old tennis player, said, ""I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped use with my favorite sport."" Hand-eye cordination is very useful, for many things our surveyed @NUM2 people and @NUM3 of these people say that hand-eye cordination is a very important still and that everyday activities, such as computers, help them improve. Typing is very comonly used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you comunicate. When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast, such as email welcoms aim, facebook and many more. @CAPS5 is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live on @LOCATION1 and her sister, @PERSON4, she is very close to, lives in @LOCATION3. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money. They also can't fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in-touch until webcams come out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, ""I was considering flying to @LOCATION3, but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money."" People @MONTH1 argue that you can just sent letters to each other, but, you can't send your baby boys first steps that you just video taped, or a youtube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you @MONTH1 not've seen normally and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other. Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing whether @CAPS5's what means or the earthquake in @LOCATION4. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. @PERSON2, a @NUM4 @CAPS3 teacher at @LOCATION2, says, ""@CAPS4, we are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so use don't waste paper and will trees."" @CAPS5 is true, about @PERCENT1 of the homework of @NUM5 graders is online, whether @CAPS5 is to look up the equation for photosynthesis on to find out what year @CAPS6 died in being online does help the environment @CAPS5 is important to be able to have computers in schools because @CAPS5 gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like @NUM6 graders have a math class online, off hey math. @CAPS5 gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientists' expierement or a paparatzi's take on @PERSON1' new boyfriend. The computer has changed society a lot, for the better. Now, in the @DATE1, computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit. With better hand-eye cordination, being able to talk your friends, and being able to learn the computer benefits society. Additionally, the accessibility of information online has expanded knowledge and understanding, leading to a more informed and connected society. The integration of technology in education has enhanced learning experiences and provided students with valuable resources. Overall, the advancements in technology, particularly the computer, have significantly improved various aspects of society and continue to shape a brighter future for all."
1390	1394	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  In my opinion, computers are taking away time from exercising and enjoying nature. People are spending so much time on their screens that they are not getting outside and being active. This sedentary lifestyle is contributing to the obesity problem in our community, with one in five children being obese.  The computer addiction is affecting families and friendships as well. Instead of spending quality time together, people are glued to their screens, missing out on creating memories and bonding with loved ones. This is a concerning trend that needs to be addressed.  It is important for people to find a balance with their computer usage. While technology can be beneficial in many ways, it should not come at the expense of our health, relationships, and connection to the natural world. By making a conscious effort to limit screen time and prioritize physical activity and outdoor experiences, we can work towards a healthier and happier community.  Sincerely, [Your Name]

1392	1396	1	3	People are spending too much time on computers and the internet, neglecting the outdoors and personal interactions. A local newspaper survey found that many people feel better when they go outside instead of staying cooped up inside on their computers. The sedentary lifestyle associated with excessive computer use contributes to obesity and a lack of physical activity. Furthermore, online communication may lead to a decline in face-to-face social skills and manners. While some argue that technology offers alternative ways to communicate, the risks of online interactions cannot be overlooked. It's time for society to reevaluate their excessive computer usage and prioritize real-world interactions and outdoor activities for a healthier and more balanced lifestyle.
1393	1397	1	3	My is people should go only on the computer if they really have to do something such as type a reports, check your e-mail etc. Whats the point of going on the computers if all your going to do is play games that gets boring to me. I go on the computer to to my friends and check email and stuff and then i go outside to play. You should only be on the computer for @NUM1 minutes a day then go get some exercise. If you stay on the computer all day you will smell, get fat, get lazy, and no one wents these things. These are the things you should have. You can play basketball, go on a bike ride, with some friends, go swimming, I do this type of stuff every day and I am in good shape because of it. I stay healthy and fit I dont sit on the computer all day on a sunny day. You become more if you go more it gives you a chance to hang out with some neighborhood kids. When I get home every day I do my homework then I go outside and play, then later I go on the computer for @NUM1 minutes then @CAPS1 done and I go to bed and the same thing the next day. So everyone agree with me because you knew I am right.  Remember, balance is key. It's important to find a healthy equilibrium between computer use and physical activity to maintain a well-rounded and active lifestyle.
1394	1398	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Some people say that computers are fun, smart, and do no harm. Is that true though? Do computers make harm? Well, for one thing, I know that computers can take up a lot of peoples' time. For example, many people don't go outside as much because they are usually on their computers. What are they doing on the computer you ask; well let's find out.  There are many things a person can do on a computer. It can be fun chatting, educational, or hardworking. Many people use the computer for fun, such as chatting with friends or playing games. However, these activities can be so engaging that they consume a lot of time and prevent individuals from going outdoors. Computer games, in particular, can be highly addictive and lead to neglect of responsibilities such as schoolwork or job duties.  On the other hand, computers are also essential for work and school tasks. They enable people to complete work faster and more efficiently, whether it's typing up documents or programming robots. While this is beneficial, excessive computer use can have negative effects on health, as spending too much time indoors can lead to sickness.  It is crucial for individuals to take breaks from their computers and spend time outside. Engaging in outdoor activities, exercising, and getting fresh air are vital for overall well-being. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between computer use and outdoor activities. Remember to enjoy nature and make the most of your time outside. Thank you for your time.
1395	1399	1	3	Computers have a negative impact on people in various ways. Firstly, individuals may not get enough exercise if they spend all their time in front of a screen. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to serious health issues such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and heart problems. Additionally, prolonged computer use can result in back injuries due to lack of physical activity. Moreover, constant computer usage can significantly increase electricity bills, causing financial strain on families. The excessive consumption of energy can lead to high bills that may become unmanageable. Furthermore, computers can also disrupt everyday life by isolating individuals and affecting their social interactions. Excessive screen time may cause friends to feel neglected and lead to a decline in social relationships. Ultimately, the negative effects of computers on health, finances, and social life highlight the detrimental impact of excessive screen time on individuals.
1396	1400	1	3	Would you like to be on the computer and throw away your life? Well, some people already are throwing their lives away. If you spend too much time on the computer, you can become obese, lose the ability to interact with friends and family, and miss out on exploring the world around you. It's important to consider if you want to waste your life over a computer. Using your computer excessively can put you at risk of becoming obese for several reasons. You're not moving or exercising while sitting, leading to weight gain. Additionally, constant snacking while on the computer can contribute to obesity. This sedentary lifestyle can also affect your ability to walk. Furthermore, spending too much time on the computer can lead to a lack of interaction with your loved ones. You may miss out on important moments with your children and push away friends who seek your company. Ultimately, you could end up feeling isolated and alone. Instead of being glued to your screen, consider exploring the world around you. There are so many exciting things happening outside of your computer, from local events to natural wonders waiting to be discovered. Don't let your life pass you by while you're busy staring at a screen. In conclusion, wasting your life on the computer can have detrimental effects on your health, relationships, and overall well-being. It's essential to find a balance and prioritize real-world experiences over screen time. Make the choice to live a fulfilling life beyond the confines of your computer.
1397	1401	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I'm sure you love kicking back and surfing the web. After all, the internet is an amazing invention. However, the truth of the matter is that some people spend way too much time on the computer. We miss out on all the other important things in life, just because of too much time on our laptops. Excessive use of the internet can lead to not enough exercise. It can cause us to be anti-social, And lastly, not allow us to enjoy the beautiful nature that surrounds us. Do you know that a very high cause of obesity is? Electronics, kids sit on the computer all day long, while they should be out exercising and keeping fit. Sure, it is still okay to surf the web. You just have to keep the time minimum we could ensure this rule by having a time limit set at home. I myself love to use the computer, but i make sure to get off after about an hour. The whole idea of the ""internet"" is such a broad topic. That leaves us with so much to explore, we just have to keep an eye on the clock. There are so many forms of chat on the internet; @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc. Many people are always on one of those, instead of talking in person. We can eventually become anti-social due to so much time spent on the computer. Although yes, you can be talking over the internet, it is necessary to be talking to people face to face, it is as if we become glued to the computer. Websites such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are also causes of this. People get addicted and are on them constantly, @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5"" websites actually take away time that could be spent with friends. So instead of having a chat over the computer screen, plan a meeting in person. Don't allow the computer to let you lose the social skills that you have built up. I love going outside each season to see the beautiful nature that surrounds us if you spend too much time on the computer, you won't have time to enjoy it. There are so many things that you would be missing out on. Take time out of your day that you would normally spend on the computer to take a walk outside. Things other are so much prettier than your computer screen, trust me. Once you cut down your computer time little by little, you will realize all the other things that are more worth your time. So the next time you think about going to surf the web or play that new computer game, I hope you think about my opinions I presented to you. Too much time on the computer causes us to not get enough exercise, and we can become anti-social. We won't be able to enjoy the nature around us. Computer time is fine in moderation, you just have to be aware of how much time you spend on it. Hopefully, my supported reasons have given you another view on surfing the web. Remember, balance is key in everything we do."
1398	1402	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers are both a good and a bad thing. Computers allow us to play games and learn about almost anything, but they cannot simulate fresh air and exercise. Computers provide a wide variety of games, from chess to solitaire, and countless online games that attract hundreds of thousands of players daily. They also enable easy access to information on any topic, making research faster and more convenient. However, excessive computer use can have negative effects, such as reduced physical activity and potential health issues. It is important for both adults and children to be aware of the benefits and drawbacks of computer usage. In conclusion, while computers bring many advantages to society, it is crucial to find a balance between screen time and outdoor activities to maintain overall well-being.
1399	1403	1	3	Have you ever spent a long time on the computer, engrossed in the virtual world it offers? While it can be entertaining and convenient, excessive computer use can have negative impacts on our health. Many people find themselves so immersed in their screens that they neglect physical activity altogether. It is crucial to remember the importance of exercise – aim for at least 30 minutes a day to keep your body healthy and strong.   Children, in particular, are spending more time indoors on computers and video games, missing out on the benefits of outdoor activities. Experts recommend that kids get at least 60 minutes of exercise daily to maintain their well-being. Additionally, sunlight exposure is essential for obtaining vital vitamins, with a minimum of 30 minutes recommended each day.   While computers provide a platform for communication, nothing can truly replace the value of face-to-face interactions. Spending quality time with friends and family, engaging in outdoor adventures, and enjoying the beauty of nature are irreplaceable experiences that enrich our lives. Rather than being glued to screens, make an effort to prioritize physical activity, outdoor time, and personal connections. By making these small changes, we can improve our overall health and well-being. It's time to step away from the computer and embrace a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.
1400	1404	1	3	Readers, imagine a world without computers. Communication would be more challenging, schoolwork would be significantly harder, and we would lose a source of entertainment. Do we really want to live in a world like that? The benefits of computers far outweigh the drawbacks.   Computers have revolutionized the way we communicate with people around the world. Through email, instant messaging, and video conferencing, we can easily connect with others regardless of distance. This has made communication more efficient and convenient. For example, students can collaborate on school projects, seek help from peers, and stay in touch with friends and family with just a few clicks.   In terms of education, computers have made learning more accessible and engaging. Tools like Microsoft Word make it easier to complete assignments, while online resources like encyclopedias and educational websites provide valuable information for students. Additionally, online tutors and help sites offer support to students whenever they need it. With computers, learning has become more interactive and dynamic.   Furthermore, computers provide a wealth of entertainment options. From streaming movies and TV shows to online gaming, there are endless ways to have fun on the internet. You can stay updated on the latest episodes of your favorite shows, play games with people from around the world, or watch historical videos on platforms like YouTube. Additionally, computers allow you to browse the news and stay informed about current events.   In conclusion, computers have had a profoundly positive impact on society. They have enhanced communication, facilitated learning, and provided endless opportunities for entertainment. Whether you're connecting with loved ones, completing school assignments, learning something new, or simply relaxing, computers have made life easier and more enjoyable. Embracing technology has truly enriched our lives in countless ways.
1401	1405	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have heard that some people do not agree that computers benefit our society. Well, in this letter I am going to give you three reasons how computers do benefit our society. Those reasons are people have friends and family in other states, some people use them to stay organized, and computers help you learn more. I hope that by the end of this letter you will see that computers do benefit our society.   First of all, I think that computers benefit our society because it lets people stay in contact with family and friends in other states. This is true that you could use the phone and call them but you have to pay for long distance. You don't have to pay anything to email somebody. I know from experience because I have friends and family in a lot of states and computers help me stay in contact with my family all over. Many people use the computer to contact loved ones every day. Some people even use them to stay in touch with family members at war.   Next, I believe that computers benefit society because it keeps people organized. I know this may not seem like a big deal, but a lot of people use computers to keep things organized so they know how everything is. What would happen if we didn't have computers to keep all of our appointments in? Well, all appointments would end up overlapping, giving you things you already got. ""I rely on my computer to stay organized,"" said one person.   Lastly, I strongly believe that computers benefit our society because they help people learn more. Yes, it is true that not everybody goes on the computers to learn, but that doesn't mean they don't learn. For example, computers let you learn song lyrics, dance moves, and more. They also allow you to learn about what other people like, don't like, and so on. Additionally, platforms like Facebook let you see what people are doing that day. ""People learn everything from the computer,"" said another person.   Now I hope you see that if computers don't benefit our society, then that is your opinion. I hope you see what I see now."
1402	1406	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion, computers have a positive impact on people's lives. They facilitate communication, learning, and online shopping. Communicating on the computer is cost-effective, as it eliminates the need for phone bills. Companies also benefit from using emails to communicate internally, increasing safety and efficiency. Social networking sites contribute to improving mental health and self-esteem by connecting people. The abundance of information available online aids in learning and research, with programs allowing for easy data visualization. Access to free databases and quick information retrieval save time and money. Online shopping offers convenience, time-saving, cost-efficiency, and product reviews. In conclusion, computers have transformed how people communicate, learn, and shop, enhancing their daily lives significantly.
1403	1407	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers are indeed a remarkable invention with numerous positive effects on people. One significant benefit is their ability to enhance hand-eye coordination. By using a computer, individuals can improve their coordination skills by looking at the screen while operating the mouse, without needing to constantly glance down at their hand. This can have practical applications in various activities, such as playing sports, where hand-eye coordination is crucial.  Furthermore, computers offer a wealth of knowledge and information about different cultures, people, and places. For instance, you can easily access recipes from around the world, allowing you to explore and appreciate diverse cuisines. Additionally, computers provide a platform for communication and connection with others. Social networking sites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 enable you to interact with friends, share opinions, and even reconnect with old acquaintances.  Moreover, the advent of webcam technology has revolutionized communication, allowing individuals to see and talk to each other in real time, regardless of their physical location. This fosters a sense of closeness and connection, bridging the gap between people separated by distance. In essence, computers have a profound impact on people's lives, not by replacing human interaction but by enhancing and facilitating it.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in improving hand-eye coordination, expanding knowledge of different cultures, and facilitating communication with others. They are a valuable tool that enriches people's lives and fosters connections across the globe. Embracing the wonders of technology can lead to a world of endless possibilities and opportunities for growth and learning.
1404	1408	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is a lot of technology including the biggest hit, the computer. I say that computers have a more positive effect on people. Some reasons include that computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and even give you the ability to talk online with other people. Where would we be without computers? First of all, is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. People that type slower usually have poorer hand-eye coordination. Of course with faster typers, they have better hand-eye coordination. @PERCENT1 of people including teachers agree with this. Is this why @CAPS1 is typing ""lessons"" in computer classes in elementary school? The answer is most likely going to be a yes. Second of all, is that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places. Computers give you more resources than a book. Using the computer to go on multiple websites, is actually easier. Using these websites, people can have a higher education. One teacher said, ""using websites is so much easier for everyone. Using them for homework and having the students take notes is a lot less difficult."" And to that I agree entirely. Finally, computers give people the ability to talk to other people online. Using things like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3-mail, and video chat. All of these, and more give you the opportunity to chat with friends living far away. That way friendships are never really lost. People never want to lose relationships. Losing one can be very sad. I know this from personal experience. In conclusion, this is why I think that computers are a positive effect on people. From learning to chatting, computers are a great way to chat with friends and even do homework. Hand-eye coordination included. All of these are positive effects don't you think? I think so and this is why I believe that computers are a more positive effect than a negative effect on people."
1405	1409	1	3	Computers have truly revolutionized the way we live and work. They have made communication with distant family members easier through email and video chat. Additionally, computers have streamlined work processes, allowing tasks to be completed more efficiently. Furthermore, online education has become more accessible thanks to computers, enabling individuals to pursue their academic goals without having to physically attend a college campus. Overall, computers have become an essential tool in our daily lives, enhancing our ability to connect, work, and learn effectively.
1406	1410	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, The use of computers is not beneficial to our society. I fear that many kids will suffer from childhood obesity due to the inactivity caused by spending excessive time in front of screens. Instead of enjoying the outdoors and staying active, teenagers are opting to engage in sedentary activities. Research has shown that this lack of physical activity is often linked to the use of social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter, where cyberbullying is prevalent. These online platforms also pose risks of encountering predators and other dangerous individuals, putting young people in harm's way.  To combat these dangers, it is important for individuals to prioritize staying active and spending time with family. Engaging in outdoor activities and exercise can not only improve physical health but also reduce the risks associated with excessive screen time. Additionally, building strong family bonds through shared activities and meals can provide a support system and encourage healthy lifestyle choices.  By making these simple adjustments, such as staying active, limiting screen time, and prioritizing family interactions, individuals can lead healthier and safer lives. It is crucial to be mindful of the negative impacts of excessive computer use and take steps to prioritize physical activity and meaningful connections with loved ones.
1407	1411	1	3	Dear Newspaper,   I believe computers are a valuable tool that have greatly impacted our lives in a positive way. They offer a wealth of knowledge and information through the internet, allowing us to learn about different cultures and access historical records with ease. In the workplace, computers have streamlined processes and made tasks more efficient, such as in the field of design where house plans can be easily modified. Additionally, computers play a significant role in social interactions, enabling us to connect with friends, share memories, and enjoy entertainment together. Overall, computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, providing convenience, connectivity, and endless possibilities for learning and growth.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1408	1412	1	3	Dear Readers, Some of you might think people spend too much time on computers, neglecting physical activity, family interactions, and pet companionship. While there may be some truth to that, it's important to acknowledge the positive aspects of using computers. By utilizing the internet, individuals can expand their knowledge by learning about different cultures, places, and even taking online classes to improve their academic skills. Additionally, socializing is not limited to face-to-face interactions as there are various platforms like social media, video calls, and chat rooms that enable people to connect with others. Furthermore, computers can also aid in promoting health by providing information on healthy eating habits, exercise routines, and improving hand-eye coordination. Ultimately, computers offer a wealth of opportunities for learning, socializing, and improving overall well-being. So, it's essential to recognize the benefits that technology brings to our lives.
1409	1413	1	3	Computers have definitely had a significant impact on society, changing the way people interact and access information. While the convenience and speed of communication facilitated by computers are undeniable, there are also negative aspects to consider. Some individuals may become too dependent on computers, seeking solace in the anonymity of the internet when faced with real-life problems. This can lead to a lack of genuine human connection, as online communication may not fully satisfy the need for personal interaction. Additionally, the abundance of information available on the internet can be overwhelming, potentially inflating egos and fostering ignorance. However, computers can also be a valuable tool for creativity, allowing individuals to explore and share their artistic endeavors with a wide audience. In moderation, computers can be a positive addition to society, but it is essential to be mindful of the potential pitfalls of excessive reliance on technology.
1410	1414	1	3	Computers offer numerous benefits to society, allowing people to learn about faraway places and cultures, connect with others online, and even play educational games that can assist with schoolwork. By using the internet, individuals can easily explore different cultures, traditions, and lifestyles from around the world. For example, by searching on websites like Google, one can discover the unique practices of people in distant countries, such as how they eat and socialize. This exposure to diversity fosters a greater understanding and appreciation for the global community.  Moreover, computers facilitate communication and interaction with others, enabling individuals to stay connected with friends and family members regardless of geographical barriers.

1411	1415	1	3	"Dear computer experts, consider this: A family of four is sitting in a small dark room, not talking, not laughing, just sitting lazily in their chairs, hunched over & bored. They arenít communicating with any of their friends, and arenít really doing anything at all. They sit there like lumps. This would happen if we banned computers! Computers definitely have a positive effect on people because they feed you a constant stream of knowledge, they develop good hand-eye coordination, and they enable the people who use them to communicate with others. Clearly, they are a positive addition to our world. To begin, computers bring you a constant stream of knowledge. My close friend recently told me that she is sometimes sitting at home, doing her homework, and she needs to look up something. She simply grabs her computer, and the information is delivered to her with the click of a button. If she didn't have a computer, she'd never obtain such knowledge. Second, in a survey, 80% of total computer usage is looking up information and gaining knowledge. This statistic shows that computers definitely help when looking for information. Also, a recent article on computer usage states that if people didn't have computers, half of the worldís discoveries would not be around today. You can tell that the amount of knowledge that computers give us is very important! Next, using computers builds hand-eye coordination as well. Childrenís specialist says, ""Kids need to be able to play video games, even though they are usually discouraged, they build fantastic hand-eye coordination, and help with many things including sports."" If there were no computers, this hand-eye coordination could never develop! Additionally, limiting computer use can have negative effects, as shown by a school where all sports teams had losing records due to a lack of hand-eye coordination. Lastly, using computers allows people to communicate with each other through email and other social networks. After a poll, we have discovered that millions of users use the computer and social media to communicate every day. We wouldn't want to deny them of this, would we? Furthermore, a recent article by a teen specialist says that when people donít have computers and can't communicate or talk to the outside world, they are more prone to diseases and sickness like depression or anorexia. This definitely shows that communicating with computers is very important. Now, picture this: The same family as before is sitting in a bright, sunny room with their computer screens flashing merrily. One of the boys calls out, ""Hey, look at this!"" and the rest of his family rushes to his side. Their faces aglow with this new information. You can see that computers have a positive effect on people because they bring new information, build hand-eye coordination, and allow you to communicate with others. So, computer specialists, what are you waiting for? Go to your computers right now and learn some new things!"

1413	1417	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, Technology has made great improvements in the past years. Computers have now found a home in almost every business and home in @LOCATION1! Everyone thinks computers are wonderful and can only positively affect you, but do they really consider both sides? Most likely not. That is why I am here. Computers discourage exercise, cut down the number of hours spent bonding with your family, and are a waste of money and space. I believe computers should be re-examined, and people should stop depending on them so much.   Which country has more than @NUM1 million fast-food restaurants currently functioning? The answer is the @LOCATION2. With over @PERCENT1 of the population being obese, something needs to be changed. According to studies by the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS2), @PERCENT2 of people spend over @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. Of those @PERCENT2, @PERCENT3 are overweight or obese. There is an obvious pattern. Exercising makes your muscles stronger, improves lung function, and helps burn off unnecessary calories. People need to get off the computer and exercise more.   Spending time with your family can be great fun. Playing outdoors in team games brings out your competitive side, while board games challenge your mind. ""@CAPS3 who spend time with their family are @PERCENT4 more likely to do better in school,"" says @PERSON2. So what's stopping them? Computers. Kids now find many internet sites online more interesting than hanging out with family and friends. We need to turn off the computers, bring out the board games, and keep families together!   ""In this economy, people cannot afford to waste money they don't have,"" says economist @PERSON1. And she is absolutely right! But what are @PERCENT5 wasting money on? You guessed it; computers. The average bill per month is @MONEY2. In a whole year, you're paying @MONEY1 for something you don't need! Computers also waste space. Along with needing a place to house your monitor, you have to find room to cram a printer, the hard drive, and all those wires. Who can find enough room?!   Although technology, namely computers, can be a wonderful thing, we need to look at the downside. @CAPS6 continue to gain weight, families fall apart, and the economy collapses, all because of computers. We need to stop the problems and turn off the computers. Let's make a change for the better."
1414	1418	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I am writing to you today because I believe that computers have a negative impact on people. When individuals spend too much time on the internet, they tend to neglect physical exercise, which can lead to poor health and low grades. Moreover, the internet can be a dangerous place, as there are individuals with malicious intentions who may harm unsuspecting users, especially children. It is crucial to limit screen time and prioritize real-life interactions and activities. By striking a balance between technology use and other aspects of life, individuals can maintain a healthy lifestyle and protect themselves from potential dangers.

1415	1419	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have reason to believe that computers and other modern technologies are negatively impacting our society. The prevalence of computers has led to a decrease in physical activity, a lack of family interaction, and potential harm to mental health. In @LOCATION1, the rise of obesity can be directly linked to the increase in computer usage. In the past, families had only one computer, if any, while today, it is common for families to have multiple devices. This shift has contributed to a significant increase in obesity rates due to a lack of exercise. Moreover, the use of computers has led to a decline in communication within families, resulting in higher divorce rates. The overreliance on technology has also affected the cognitive development of children, as they spend more time on screens than engaging in meaningful activities. While computers can be educational, the majority of individuals, including children and adults, do not utilize them for such purposes. It is crucial for families to limit screen time and prioritize physical activity and quality time together to safeguard the well-being of future generations. By making these adjustments, parents can promote a healthier lifestyle for their children and strengthen family bonds. It is essential to recognize the harmful effects of excessive computer usage and take proactive steps to mitigate its impact on families and society as a whole.
1416	1420	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  It has come to my attention that there is a massive increase in people using computers in society. While this can have its positive effects, too much of it isn't a good thing. Using computers helps people with various tasks like business, communication with family and friends, and entertainment. However, some negative effects include hindering physical activity, limiting time spent in nature, and the risk of addiction.  To address this concern, it is important to find a balance between computer use and other activities. Encouraging people to use their computers to connect with others for outdoor exercise and socializing can be a beneficial approach.

By promoting a balanced approach and setting boundaries, individuals can enjoy the advantages of technology while also engaging in other activities.  In conclusion, addressing the concerns surrounding excessive computer use requires a thoughtful approach that encourages moderation and a well-rounded lifestyle. By finding a balance between screen time and other activities, individuals can enjoy the benefits of technology without sacrificing their physical and mental well-being.  Sincerely, [Your Name]

While computers can be beneficial for tasks like typing and research, they can also lead to excessive screen time and neglect of responsibilities. Many individuals, both parents and children, spend a significant amount of time on computers, sometimes at the expense of important activities like homework or family bonding. Research has shown that this can lead to issues like lack of sleep and decreased quality time spent with loved ones.

Computers help improve skills like hand-eye coordination and focus, while also providing access to a vast amount of information that can enhance our knowledge. Tasks like job applications, taxes, and even simple activities like grocery shopping are made easier and more efficient with the use of computers. Additionally, interacting with family members who are far away through computers can help strengthen relationships and provide a sense of connection. Despite concerns about excessive screen time, there are still ways to enjoy nature and exercise the mind while using computers. Overall, computers have become an essential tool in modern society, enabling us to accomplish tasks more effectively and stay connected with others. They are indeed a positive and valuable asset in our lives.
1425	1429	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world and you can even shop online. Without contact with your loved ones is sad because if you wanna talk to them you can email them to see how they are doing. With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can see what other people are playing games with you. If you are on Facebook or Myspace you can add people as your friends so you can make new friends. Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at stores because if you shopping for clothes and there's a long line then you'll start to get frustrated, that's why there is online shopping so that we can have a more convenient way of shopping. In conclusion, computers are a very useful tool that allows us to talk to our relatives from far away places, interact with people from different parts of the world, and shop without the hassle of waiting in line. Computers truly enhance our communication and convenience in various aspects of our lives.
1426	1430	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, do you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, I would say that computers have negative effects on us. This is because we would get less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and less interaction with family and friends.  If you are on the computer most of the time at home, how would you get your exercise? You wouldn't because the whole time you would be stuck sitting down at the desktop. This lack of physical activity can lead to obesity and worsen health conditions for those who need exercise for their well-being.  Being glued to the computer screen also means missing out on enjoying nature. Instead of spending time outdoors in the warm weather, people are confined to their screens at home. It is important to appreciate the beauty of nature and engage in outdoor activities for both physical and mental health.  Furthermore, spending too much time on the computer can lead to neglecting family and friends. It is essential to maintain strong relationships by being present and actively engaging with loved ones. Missing out on family gatherings or neglecting friends can have a detrimental impact on personal relationships.  In conclusion, the negative effects of computers, such as reduced exercise, limited time in nature, and diminished interaction with family and friends, highlight the importance of finding a balance between screen time and real-world experiences. It is crucial to prioritize physical activity, outdoor enjoyment, and meaningful connections with loved ones to maintain a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.
1427	1431	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, Technology is ever-evolving, and more people are using computers, which in turn benefits society.

This connectivity fosters a sense of togetherness and strengthens bonds, even across great distances.  In conclusion, computers undeniably benefit society by serving as a valuable tool for education, providing easy access to information, and enabling seamless communication with others. The positive impact of computers on individuals and society as a whole is unmistakable. Thank you for considering these points.
1437	1441	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I have recently come across the debate surrounding the productivity of computers. While it is true that computers allow us to access information and communicate online, there are concerns about their misuse. One of the main issues is the prevalence of online chatting, which can be harmful if not used responsibly. Many children engage in conversations with strangers online, putting themselves at risk. Additionally, plagiarism has become a common problem as people easily copy and paste information from the internet without proper credit. This unethical practice can have serious consequences, including legal action. To address these issues, it is important for individuals to use the internet responsibly and avoid plagiarism by generating original content. While computers and technology are valuable tools, it is essential to use them ethically to prevent negative consequences. By being mindful of how we use technology, we can mitigate the risks associated with online communication and plagiarism. Let us strive to make responsible choices in our digital interactions to create a safer and more ethical online environment for all.
1438	1442	1	3	@CAPS1's should use computers in the classroom to help themselves. Computers provide a faster and more efficient way to take notes, as typing is quicker than writing by hand. Additionally, students can easily look up information on a computer, which is especially helpful for research projects or assignments. For example, if a student needs to find information on a giraffe, they can simply search for it online. Furthermore, computers allow students to easily access and include images in their projects, saving time and effort. Overall, integrating computers into the classroom can greatly benefit @CAPS1's in their learning process.
1439	1443	1	3	Computers have been one of technology's greatest advances, and yet one of society's downfalls. Originally intended to spread ideas and connect people, computers have instead become a source of harm for many, especially young, wholesome kids. The increasing number of adolescent users spending hours on computers every day is stealing the pleasures of childhood like reading, exercising, and spending time with family. This sedentary lifestyle has contributed to a rise in obesity and antisocial behavior among teenagers. Moreover, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by computers has been linked to serious health issues such as brain tumors and leukemia, particularly in children who spend excessive time in front of screens. Additionally, the online world facilitated by computers has become a hunting ground for predators seeking to exploit vulnerable children. Removing computers from society may help prevent these negative consequences and create a safer environment for children to thrive without the dangers posed by technology. By taking this step, society can work towards a healthier and more secure future for the next generation.
1440	1444	1	3	A large number of people use computers on a daily basis, and while there are some who argue that this technology does not benefit society, I believe that computers have a positive impact on our lives. Computers provide a quick and easy way to access and share information, making tasks more efficient. For example, when compared to traditional methods like using books for research, computers allow individuals to find information much faster. This was evident in a project where I completed my research in a few days using a computer, while my cousin took a whole week using books.  Additionally, computers play a crucial role in communication by enabling people to connect with others around the world through platforms like email, chat rooms, and social media websites. These tools are not only useful for personal interactions but also for professional purposes. Business meetings can now be conducted online through video conferencing, saving time and resources. In fact, a significant percentage of business meetings are now held over the internet, leading to improved work efficiency.  In conclusion, computers have revolutionized the way we access information, communicate, and conduct business. Embracing this technology can greatly benefit individuals in various aspects of their lives. Whether it is for research, staying in touch with loved ones, or conducting business, computers have become an indispensable tool in today's society.
1441	1445	1	3	Every computer in the world should have access to the internet, as it serves as a valuable tool for various purposes. The internet allows individuals to do their homework, communicate with friends through emails or social media platforms, and even play games. Teachers benefit from using computers to easily access information for their lessons, while students can utilize them for research projects. Microsoft Word is a useful tool found on computers, enabling users to write and edit documents efficiently. Some schools provide students with their own computers, allowing them to complete assignments and communicate with teachers conveniently. Computers have vast storage capacity for information, surpassing that of traditional books. Websites like Facebook and Myspace offer platforms for social interaction and entertainment. Overall, computers are essential in education and daily life for accessing information, communication, and leisure activities.
1442	1446	1	3	Dear local newspaper, many people believe that computers are essential for educating individuals for the future, but I have a different perspective. In my opinion, computers can actually have a detrimental impact on both children and adults.   One major concern is the sedentary lifestyle that computer usage promotes, especially among children. With the prevalence of computer games, kids often spend countless hours indoors, neglecting physical activity. This lack of exercise can lead to obesity and other health issues, affecting both children and their parents who may also be spending excessive time on computers.   Furthermore, the excessive use of computers can disconnect individuals from nature and the environment. Children may lack basic knowledge about the natural world because they are too engrossed in digital activities. Understanding and appreciating nature is crucial for fostering a sense of environmental responsibility, which is essential for the well-being of our planet.   Moreover, excessive computer use can also hinder family interactions. Instead of spending quality time together, family members may be preoccupied with their screens, missing out on valuable bonding opportunities. It is important for families to prioritize spending time together without the distractions of technology.   In conclusion, reducing computer usage can have numerous benefits, including promoting physical health, enhancing environmental awareness, and strengthening family relationships. By striking a balance and limiting screen time, individuals can lead healthier, more connected lives.
1443	1447	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, computers are a wonderful tool that has had a significant positive impact on society. One major benefit of computers is the various forms of communication they have enabled. For instance, instant messaging allows people to converse with others from around the world in real-time, while webcams make it possible to see and interact with loved ones regardless of distance. Additionally, social media platforms like Facebook have revolutionized the way we connect and share information.  Furthermore, computers have revolutionized research by providing easy access to vast amounts of information. Search engines like Google have made it simple to find relevant data quickly, and online resources have become invaluable for academic and professional pursuits. The abundance of online content has made learning more accessible and convenient for people of all ages.  Moreover, computers offer a plethora of entertainment options. Platforms like YouTube provide a space for users to enjoy music videos and creative content, while gaming websites offer a range of free games for leisure. Additionally, websites featuring humorous stories and videos can provide a much-needed source of laughter and relaxation.  In conclusion, computers have brought about significant advancements in communication, research, and entertainment. Their impact on society is undeniable, and they continue to play a crucial role in shaping our daily lives. Join me in celebrating the incredible strength and versatility of computers in enhancing various aspects of human existence.
1444	1448	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Have you ever stopped to think about what modern-day technology has brought us? A great example is computers. Many people use this device to book vacations, communicate with others, and discover new ideas. The convenience and efficiency of computers have revolutionized the way we live our lives.

With just a few clicks, you can research hotels, flights, and activities, making the whole planning process seamless and hassle-free. This accessibility has opened up a world of possibilities for travelers, allowing them to explore new places and create unforgettable memories.  Furthermore, the use of computers for communication has connected people from all over the world. With social media platforms and messaging apps, staying in touch with family and friends has never been easier. Distance is no longer a barrier, as you can instantly connect with loved ones regardless of where they are located. This has strengthened relationships and fostered a sense of community among individuals.  While there are concerns about the negative impact of excessive screen time, the benefits of using computers for communication and research cannot be overlooked. By setting boundaries and practicing moderation, individuals can reap the rewards of modern technology while also prioritizing their health and well-being.  In conclusion, the advancements in computer technology have transformed the way we live, work, and interact with others. From booking vacations to staying connected with loved ones, computers have become an essential tool in our daily lives. Embracing these technological innovations while also being mindful of their effects is key to harnessing the full potential of modern-day technology.
1445	1449	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have undoubtedly revolutionized the way we interact with others, learn, and develop crucial skills like hand-eye coordination. The impact of computers on society is profound and far-reaching.   One significant benefit of computers is the opportunity they provide for people to chat and connect with others. With countless websites and online chat rooms available, individuals can engage in conversations with people from all over the world. This not only helps in building friendships but also allows for a diverse exchange of ideas and perspectives.   Moreover, school websites have become invaluable tools for students. They offer a platform for accessing educational resources, assignments, and even interactive learning materials. Students can enhance their understanding of various subjects and stay organized with their schoolwork through the use of computers.   In addition to facilitating communication and learning, computers also play a role in improving hand-eye coordination. Whether through gaming or other activities, using a computer requires precise movements and visual focus. This helps individuals develop and refine their motor skills, which can be beneficial in various aspects of life.   In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of our society, offering numerous advantages that impact individuals in various ways.

Embracing technology and its capabilities can lead to further advancements and innovations that benefit society as a whole.
1446	1450	1	3	Click click, another information page opens up on your handy computer. These trusty, smart, and easy-to-use devices are always an object to have. Although some people argue that spending too much time on computers is bad for your well-being, I strongly believe that computers have numerous benefits that cannot be overlooked.  Computers serve as a great entertainment system, offering access to family movies, music, and even the opportunity to create your own content. The internet provides a vast source of information through websites like Google and Wikipedia, making learning about different topics quick and easy. Additionally, computers enable socialization with friends and family members through platforms like Skype, Facebook, and MySpace, allowing for connections with people from all over the world.  In my personal experience, the internet has allowed me to stay in touch with family members who live far away, enhancing my social life and relationships. Overall, the internet offers a wide range of benefits, from entertainment to information and socialization, making it an essential tool in today's modern world. Next time someone criticizes the use of computers, remember the countless advantages they bring to our daily lives.
1447	1451	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps them learn about foreign places, it allows them to connect with family and friends that live far away, and it helps them with their jobs. Computers help people learn about foreign places. Before my uncle went to @LOCATION4, he wanted to learn about their culture. He went on the computer and researched @CAPS1 culture, so that he can be prepared. How would you feel if you went another country and knew nothing about it? What if you were to go to that country and do something that was disrespectful to their culture, but you didn't know because you didn't do research on it? I know I would feel bad. Now some people might say that you can read a book on that country, but not everyone has time to sit and read a book. Computers make the world a little smaller and helps us learn about each other. I think that's pretty positive. Don't you? People connect with each other through the computer. More than @PERCENT1 of people who move away from their family and friends reconnect with them through computers. Nowadays there are social networking sites, like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4, that gives people the chance to contact a family or friend that lives far away. When I moved to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2, I thought that I was never going to see my best friend again. But then, I got a @CAPS3 and found her on there. I was very estatic. We swapped numbers and addresses. Now everyday I talk to her on the computer. Also, the only way I talk to my aunty, who lives in @LOCATION3, is by the computer. I can't talk to her on the phone because that would run my phone bill up. Another reason that computers are positive is that is helps people find their biological parents or siblings. It brings them together and helps them reconnect with each other. Computers help people with their job. Anybody who is a @CAPS6 of a company has a laptop. It helps them store data, files, and important information. Computers are essential to these people. Also, it helps them keep track of their company if they go on a vacation. How would you feel if you owned a company and went on a vacation, but you couldn't keep track of it because you didn't have a computer. Computers have a positive effect on people because it helps learn about places, talk to their family, and keep track of their job. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in connecting people, facilitating communication, and enhancing productivity in various aspects of life. Their positive impact cannot be understated in today's interconnected world.
1448	1452	1	3	"Dear @PERSON4, I strongly believe that use of computer is beneficial to the community. One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1. Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did @CAPS5, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. These games also make you more intelligent. The @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE2 study reports that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after use of computers. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. @CAPS5 is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like @CAPS5 really helps us communicate."" Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in separate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. In fact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinaire @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them! In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, ""@CAPS5's a powerful resource that more people should use. Al @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!"" @CAPS5 is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other places. Thank you for your time, and I hope you take what I have said into consideration. @CAPS5 is for all of these reasons I strongly believe computers are beneficial to the community."
1449	1453	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I have recently seen that you believe people are spending too much time on computers instead of exercising or socializing with friends and family. However, I respectfully disagree with this opinion. Computers play a vital role in facilitating social interaction, providing access to valuable information, and helping individuals secure employment and support their families.  In today's digital age, a significant percentage of the population actively engages with others through social media platforms such as Facebook, MySpace, and Skype. These online channels enable people to connect with individuals from all over the world, fostering new relationships and sharing experiences. Additionally, through online forums and communities, individuals can stay informed about local events, news, and important issues affecting their communities.  Moreover, computers serve as valuable tools for research, offering a wealth of information at the click of a button. Whether it's exploring distant lands, delving into academic subjects, or learning about current events, the internet provides a vast repository of knowledge that can enrich and educate users. For instance, when faced with a school project on teen mothers, I was able to access a plethora of resources online that enhanced my understanding of the topic.  Furthermore, computers play a crucial role in helping individuals find employment and generate income to support themselves and their families. Online job portals and websites offer a convenient platform for job seekers to explore various opportunities, submit applications, and connect with potential employers. Additionally, the flexibility of remote work allows individuals to balance their professional responsibilities with personal commitments, such as childcare.  In conclusion, the widespread use of computers has revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and pursue career opportunities. Contrary to the belief that excessive computer usage detracts from physical activity and social interactions, technology has become an integral part of modern life, offering countless benefits to individuals in various aspects of their daily routines. Ultimately, computers have proven to be indispensable tools that empower individuals to connect, learn, and thrive in today's interconnected world.
1450	1454	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1's small world after all - and growing smaller as computer usage becomes more and more widespread. Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips. I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelmingly positive. For one thing, they increase hand-eye coordination. For another, they are a great means of communication. Finally, they are a very powerful research tool.  Some @MONTH1 say that computers are lessening time with family and friends, but I don't agree. Computers help us stay more connected than ever! The computer is not evil - quite the opposite! First of all, computers are great for increasing hand-eye coordination. In a recent study by @PERSON1, he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 when they used educational computer programs such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for just half an hour, once a day. Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate. Hand-eye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death, and should be encouraged as much as possible. I know that @CAPS1 greatly helps me in my daily life - and probably you in yours as well - from the most basic tasks of eating and brushing my teeth to typing, drawing, and playing piano. As you can see, hand-eye coordination is very important.  Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids. People can't always be reached by phone. An email could be waiting for them online whenever - and wherever - they check @CAPS1. Also, documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process. Revolutionary video-conferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 can even allow us to talk to people around the world, practically eye to eye. I use @CAPS1 to keep in touch with family on the @LOCATION2. How about you?  Last - but (at the risk of sounding clichéd) definitely not the least - computers are very powerful research tools. Everything from the schedule of the local zoo (thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find @CAPS1 closed) to the average lifespan of the @CAPS4 elephant (@NUM3 years). Rather than skimming book after book for a single piece of information, plug your query into any of many search engines, from @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5, and find answers instantly. Find about @LOCATION3 without the expense of a plane ticket. See photos of @LOCATION1 - a sight most people would never get to see without the internet. The computer can take us anywhere.  In conclusion, computers are a great resource that is often wrongly portrayed in a bad light. Computers teach and improve valuable hand-eye coordination. Also, they help greatly with communication. And finally, they are a powerful research device. Computers are often shown as the bane of society. This is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for all ages. Technology is not our enemy. Don't treat @CAPS1 like one.
1451	1455	1	3	To whom this may concern: I heard that people are having a debate on whether computers benefit us or are bad for us. I firmly believe that computers are a great asset to society. They enable us to communicate with people all over the world, providing us with endless opportunities to connect and share ideas. Additionally, computers serve as valuable tools for learning, offering a vast amount of information at our fingertips. Furthermore, computers help us save money by allowing us to access resources and services online, eliminating the need for costly alternatives. In conclusion, the benefits of computers are undeniable, as they enhance communication, facilitate learning, and contribute to financial savings. Thank you for considering the positive impact that computers have on our lives.
1452	1456	1	3	Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers, neglecting exercise, nature, and real-life interactions. However, computers can actually enhance our lives in many ways. For instance, they can help us with schoolwork by providing information and resources online. Communication is also facilitated through messaging, video calls, and emails, allowing us to stay connected with others. Additionally, computers offer entertainment options like watching videos, playing games, and listening to music, which can alleviate boredom. In conclusion, computers have the potential to improve our academic performance, social connections, and overall quality of life, making them valuable tools rather than distractions.
1453	1457	1	3	Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers do not have a negative effect on people because they actually provide numerous benefits to individuals and society as a whole. Computers are not just for entertainment; they play a crucial role in various aspects of our lives, such as education, work, research, and communication.   In the workplace, computers help people perform their jobs more efficiently. For example, lawyers rely on computers to draft legal documents accurately and access important information when needed. Without the use of computers, individuals with poor handwriting may struggle to decipher their own notes, leading to potential errors and delays in their work.   Furthermore, computers are essential for students who require access to information for their studies. In some cases, individuals may not have access to libraries or other resources, making the internet a valuable tool for research and completing assignments.   Additionally, computers enable individuals to connect with others from different parts of the world. Through social media platforms and online communities, people can learn about different cultures, lifestyles, and perspectives, expanding their knowledge and understanding of the world.   In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits to individuals and society, ranging from improving work efficiency to facilitating global connections. Rather than having a negative impact, computers enhance our lives in various ways, making them an essential tool in today's modern world. Thank you for considering these points.
1454	1458	1	3	Due to an ongoing debate about whether or not computers benefit society, I am writing to inform you of my opinion on this matter. I believe that computers have more benefits than drawbacks. Computers bring about online communication, advance and enhance learning, and also advance employment.  Online communication includes social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, as well as email and blogs. These inventions allow for long-distance communication, bringing people closer together. For example, my uncle lives in another state, and through Facebook, my mother can easily communicate with him and stay connected with other relatives. Online communication is essential in today's world.  Computers also improve learning by speeding up the flow of information. Students can access school websites for important updates and assignments. For example, I use my school's website to check homework assignments and announcements for the next day. Teachers can also provide helpful hints and detailed explanations of assignments online. Additionally, computers assist with research projects by providing a wide range of resources. For instance, in my health class, we gathered information for a drug project using brochures and online sources.  In conclusion, computers have numerous benefits for society, including improving communication, enhancing learning, and advancing employment opportunities. Despite some drawbacks, the overall impact of computers on society is positive and continues to drive progress and innovation in various fields.
1455	1459	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Some people @MONTH1 think that computers are helping our society, but I disagree. People who spend too much time on computers are missing out on essential aspects of life. Sitting for extended periods in front of a screen can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in health issues like obesity. It's vital to prioritize physical activity to stay fit and healthy, rather than being glued to a computer.  Additionally, excessive computer use can lead to social isolation as individuals may neglect spending time with friends and family. These personal connections are crucial for emotional well-being and support during challenging times. Being present in the real world and engaging with loved ones is far more enriching than staring at a screen.  Furthermore, while computers offer information and entertainment, they cannot replicate the beauty of nature. The vibrant colors, sounds, and scents of the outdoors provide a sensory experience that cannot be matched virtually. Taking the time to appreciate nature with friends and family can create lasting memories and strengthen relationships.  In conclusion, it is essential to find a balance between technology and real-life experiences. Prioritizing physical activity, social interactions, and time spent in nature can lead to a more fulfilling and healthy lifestyle. So, step away from the computer, go outside, and enjoy the wonders of the world around you.
1456	1460	1	3	I have realized that there is a disagreement about the effects of computers on people, with some arguing that the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones. However, in my opinion, I believe that computers have more negative effects on individuals. People are spending excessive amounts of time on computers, neglecting physical exercise, quality time with family and friends, and the benefits of being outdoors. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to various health issues, including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Additionally, being glued to the screen can hinder communication and bonding with loved ones, as individuals may ignore conversations and lose track of time. It is crucial for people to strike a balance between using computers and engaging in outdoor activities, spending time with family and friends, and prioritizing physical exercise. By making these adjustments, individuals can lead healthier, more fulfilling lives.
1457	1461	1	3	I would agree because computers do help people with other things like vacations sights, jobs, presents and shopping. So many uses for the computer. But creators of the computer are worried that people are spending too much time on the computer. Mainly it's about concerns and users; most of those people complain that they're having no time with their family and friends. You never know if the users are looking up vacation trips for both friends and family. The things that concerns don't get is that the computer can teach you a lot of things, history, mathematics, science experiments, and many more. Computers are also used in schools to help students with their work; even teachers use the computer for grades. It is true about people not going outside, getting some fresh air, or even taking a walk in the park. They can't keep themselves on the computer for like @NUM1 hours; it's just crazy. So I would go with both sides. It's just better to enjoy life than just look up things that you don't really need to. You should only need to go on like paying bills and furniture for your house. That's why the computer was invented.  Computers have undoubtedly revolutionized the way we live and work, offering a plethora of benefits and conveniences. However, it is essential to strike a balance and not let excessive screen time hinder our relationships and overall well-being. While computers can be powerful tools for learning and productivity, it is crucial to step away from the screen and enjoy the beauty of the world around us. Finding a healthy equilibrium between utilizing technology for practical purposes and engaging in real-life experiences is key to leading a fulfilling and balanced life.
1458	1462	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, In a world where the unemployment rate rises significantly, people can't communicate or learn as fast, and everyone is stressed out. That's what the world would be like if computers just disappeared. I think computers are more beneficial to society than some people realize. They teach us new things and help us with hand-eye coordination. Many jobs are involved with computers, such as an accountant. Computer games and social media help take the edge off after a hard day. Schools are the backbone of society. They teach kids and teens how to become successful adults. Computers have helped greatly in speeding up the teaching process. Teachers can now access grades in a heartbeat. My computer helps me research, communicate with others, and stay organized. Without computers, our world would be a much different and more challenging place to live in. Let's appreciate the role that computers play in our daily lives.
1459	1463	1	3	Dear Newspaper:   I have just read your recent article on whether computers are helping or wrecking society. I believe that they are helping, as they provide valuable information and resources that can improve our lives. For example, I have learned how to clear a clogged drain properly thanks to the internet, which would have taken much longer to learn through traditional methods. Doing this task incorrectly could have serious consequences, but with the help of the internet, I was able to learn the right way to do it quickly and effectively.  Additionally, computers and the internet can be crucial in emergency situations where your family is counting on you. Instead of panicking and letting everyone down, you can turn to the internet for guidance and potentially save the day. While it is true that the internet can impact how people exercise, it can also provide valuable resources on how to adopt healthier and more effective workout routines.  Despite some drawbacks such as the temptation to lead a sedentary lifestyle, the benefits of utilizing the internet for health and wellness purposes far outweigh the negatives. By making informed choices and utilizing the vast array of resources available online, individuals can lead healthier and happier lives. In conclusion, embracing the right tools and information can lead to improved well-being and overall health.
1460	1464	1	3	Dear Readers at @ORGANIZATION1, the @LOCATION3, in this age where technology dominates almost every aspect of our lives, it's important to consider if we are losing touch with the simple joys of life. With advancements moving so rapidly, are we forgetting to take a moment to appreciate the beauty around us? People are spending more time indoors, glued to screens, rather than enjoying the outdoors or engaging in physical activities like sports or games.  In @LOCATION5, health issues have become prevalent, and one of the contributing factors is the sedentary lifestyle brought on by excessive screen time. The rise in obesity rates is alarming, with more households owning multiple computers than ever before. Studies have shown a significant increase in conditions like diabetes, likely linked to the lack of physical activity and excessive screen time.  Children, in particular, are spending less time playing outside and more time on computers or gaming consoles. As someone who has enjoyed sports for many years, I fear that this trend will only continue, leading to a generation that prioritizes screen time over physical activity.  As we navigate this digital age, it's crucial to remember the importance of maintaining a balance and prioritizing our health. Let's not lose sight of the value of outdoor activities and physical exercise, as they are essential for our well-being. The future of our society, especially our children, depends on finding this balance and ensuring a healthy lifestyle. Let's strive to create a future where everyone can enjoy good health and a well-rounded life, both on and off the screen. Thank you for your time.
1461	1465	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, I am on the side of computers. You @MONTH1 think I'm only saying that because I'm @NUM1 years old and it is basically what I do for fun. Computers do benefit society because they are fun, a source of communication, good for schooling and education, and for work. Computers are not just the @CAPS1 but also @CAPS6 processor and @ORGANIZATION1 and everything like that. Computers provide games for everyone from ages @NUM2 to @NUM3. When it is raining outside your parents are at work and you are by yourself and have nothing to do, turn on the computer. Play a game. There are many fun websites made for everyone. Computers also provide an excellent source of communication. There are all different kinds of @CAPS2-mail. @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and many other sites are excellent for talking to friends. Not everyone has a cell phone so when you talk to them via @CAPS5 or any of the others it is nice to chat. Computers provide an excellent source of education.

1462	1466	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, minute man, people are complaining about how computers interfere with their family and life. However, computers also have many benefits. They provide opportunities for learning and exploration. When using a computer, you can search for information on a wide range of topics, from history to current events. For example, I once learned how to fix a PlayStation controller by searching online. Computers also allow for social interaction, weather updates, and homework assistance. They can teach new skills and help with schoolwork. Despite some negative perceptions, computers can be incredibly useful tools that enrich our lives. Therefore, I believe that everyone should have access to a computer for both practical and enjoyable purposes.
1463	1467	1	3	Almost everyone in @LOCATION1 utilizes computers at some point in their lives, benefiting from various educational and entertainment programs. Computers aid in the development of hand-eye coordination through typing exercises and interactive games. The internet serves as a valuable resource for researching distant cultures and personal interests.

1464	1468	1	3	Did you know that four out of five households have a computer? But why so many? It's because computers have a positive effect on people. With computers, you can contact people in different parts of the world. You can search up different information over the internet. Computers also benefit other electronic inventions. What do New York, Paris, Tokyo, and Sydney all have in common? You can contact the people there with computers! While talking to people around the world, you can learn something about a culture or lifestyle that you didn't know before. You just might make a new friend along the way.

1465	1469	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 you believe people spend way too much time on computers? In a survey, a high percentage of people prefer to be on the computer rather than taking a walk in nature. This excessive computer usage leads to a lack of exercise, appreciation for nature, and interaction with friends and family. People are choosing to spend their time in front of a screen rather than engaging in physical activity, enjoying the beauty of the outdoors, or connecting with loved ones. Computers can have a negative impact on individuals, as they become engrossed in virtual worlds and neglect important aspects of their physical and social well-being. It is crucial to find a balance between technology and real-life experiences in order to lead a healthy and fulfilling life.
1466	1470	1	3	Dear local newspaper, do you enjoy having control over what you see and where you go? If so, then the computer is the perfect tool for you. Computers have a positive impact on society for several reasons, such as connecting people, providing real-time updates on current events, and serving as a valuable learning resource.  One significant way computers benefit society is through online social networks like Facebook and Myspace, where millions of users can stay connected with friends and stay informed about global news. These platforms offer a fun and engaging way to interact with others and stay updated on the latest happenings.  Additionally, computers play a crucial role in delivering world news and important events to the public. News channels have websites that provide in-depth coverage, photos, and videos of breaking news stories, allowing people to stay informed about local and international events.  Moreover, computers serve as a valuable educational tool, offering a wealth of information on a wide range of topics. Whether it's seeking help with homework or conducting research, the internet provides access to a vast amount of knowledge that can help students succeed in their studies.  In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on society by connecting people, providing real-time updates on current events, and offering a valuable learning resource. Embracing technology can lead to a more informed and connected community, making computers a valuable asset in today's world.
1467	1471	1	3	Dear local newspaper, computers have undoubtedly become an integral part of our society, offering numerous benefits. One of the key advantages is the ability to communicate with friends online through platforms like Facebook, which is used by a significant percentage of the population. This allows people to stay connected with old friends and make new ones by discussing common interests such as games or TV shows.  Moreover, computers provide a wealth of information about different cultures and places around the world, making it easier to learn and explore without having to travel. This can also help in planning trips and gaining a better understanding of the history and customs of various regions. Additionally, using computers can improve hand-eye coordination, especially through activities like typing essays and other projects, which can help increase typing speed and accuracy.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in enhancing communication, knowledge acquisition, and skill development in our society. Embracing technology and utilizing it effectively can lead to numerous benefits that contribute to personal growth and connectivity in an increasingly digital world.
1468	1472	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, The computers that are being used have a positive effect on people in various ways.

Moreover, the internet serves as a valuable resource for enhancing learning experiences, enabling students to access a wide range of educational materials and information. Overall, computers play a significant role in enhancing communication, knowledge acquisition, and overall convenience in our daily lives.
1469	1473	1	3	Dear local news paper, This paper is going to be about the reason computers are bad. Frist, computers are bad cause people wouldn't have time to enjoy the nature when its nice and warm out. Second reason is cause they won't spend time with there familys at all or there friends and the only time they would get off the computer is to pay the bill and buy a game for the computer. The third reason is that how are going to get a job cause they wouldn't want to get up to look for a job cause there having to much fun intill they cut off the light then he would do dum things to pay is bell se he can start to play again and thats going to make hin do it over and over again. That's why it's bad to have a computer. But now where is people going go in life cause some people love to play games on the computer and some don't that's why some computers are bad for some people. And this is just my opinion there's alot more people might think so to. And thank you for having time to read this. In conclusion, while computers can be detrimental in certain aspects of life, it ultimately depends on an individual's self-control and priorities to determine if they are a negative influence.
1470	1474	1	3	The reason why computers are beneficial is because they allow people to efficiently complete tasks, such as work assignments or playing games. Additionally, adults find computers useful for conducting their jobs online. Overall, owning a computer brings happiness as it enables individuals to engage in a variety of activities like gaming and accessing social media platforms. In conclusion, computers serve as valuable tools that facilitate a wide range of activities for users.
1471	1475	1	3	It is my opinion that computers are not completely bad for people; in fact, computers can also be good for people. For example, computers allow people to communicate in seconds from around the world, opening up new information to anyone. However, a major disadvantage is that people spend so much time on the computer that they don't get enough exercise. Firstly, computers are a good thing because they allow news and information to reach the whole world in seconds. During the war in @LOCATION1, news reporters were restricted from certain areas, but social media platforms like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 brought real-time updates through user-generated content. Secondly, computers enable people to access knowledge on any topic within minutes. Whether it's information about a country or a recipe for a dessert, everything is just a click away. Lastly, the argument against computers is that people don't get adequate exercise due to excessive screen time. However, studies show that the majority of heavy computer users still manage to maintain a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, while there are drawbacks to excessive computer use, the benefits of communication, access to information, and efficiency outweigh the concerns. It is essential for individuals to find a balance between computer use and physical activity to lead a well-rounded life.
1472	1476	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I am aware that more people are using computers every day, and I believe that this trend has a positive impact on both adults and children. Computers provide us with easy access to information from around the world, allowing us to learn about different countries, states, and towns. This can broaden our knowledge and understanding of the world. Additionally, computers can be valuable tools for children when it comes to school homework. Typing assignments on a computer can make the work neater and more organized, ultimately helping students perform better academically. Furthermore, computers enable us to stay connected with friends and family members who may live far away. By using the internet, we can easily communicate with loved ones regardless of the distance between us. While some may have concerns about excessive screen time, I believe that with proper balance, computers can enhance our lives by facilitating communication, learning, and connectivity. In conclusion, I am a strong advocate for the positive impact of computers on individuals and society as a whole.
1473	1477	1	3	I believe that computers have various effects on people, such as on their eyes, body, and mind. Sitting too close to a computer screen can harm the eyes, potentially leading to vision problems. Additionally, spending excessive time on the computer without exercise can result in weight gain and physical health issues. Moreover, constantly engaging with digital content can consume the mind, leading to distractions and forgetfulness in other areas of life. It is important to find a balance between computer use and other activities like exercise, socializing, and schoolwork to maintain a healthy and fulfilling life. It is crucial for everyone to prioritize their well-being and avoid excessive screen time to ensure a good quality of life.
1474	1478	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, have computers ever hurt anyone? I believe the effects of computers on people are positive ones. For one, computers let people talk and socialize, even if they are on different sides of the planet. Another effect they have is letting people work faster in businesses and other jobs that require mathematics. Lastly, computers allow people to see far away places and learn about almost anything with a click of a button. Because of the internet, people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors. Let's say a friend or family member had to move to another country or state. They could be apart for months or even years. They would miss each other constantly. But with computers, they can talk to each other like they were still neighbors.  Computers also have some more ""practical"" uses. They make it easier to see their stocks, their income, and even see sale trends. Let's say you needed to make a change to the price of your goods but your car broke down and the incorrect price was miles away. You would halfway have to wait for a mechanic or run for miles to get to a phone. But with a computer, you wouldn't need to do any of that. Just log on and change the price from the luxury of your own home.  There are also educational purposes for computers. Computers let you travel the world without taking a step. You could take a trip through the safari or go on an adventure in the rainforest. You could take in the beauty of the great plains or watch the ever-changing sands of the Sahara Desert. You could learn about the Greeks, Archimedes, Ancient Egypt, or Pac-Man; with a computer, the world is your oyster. That is why I see computers as a positively amazing thing. Because they let us do things our minds usually can't, because they allow people to traverse the world in seconds, and because they allow people oceans away to talk together. So think, are computers really harmful?"
1475	1479	1	3	My opinion is that computers should be used for a variety of purposes. They are great for chatting online with friends and family, getting directions when traveling, staying connected with distant relatives, checking the weather forecast, exercising through online videos, and staying informed about current events like the news. Even though some may argue against the necessity of computers, once they experience the convenience and endless possibilities they offer, they will realize their value. Children may not need computers at a young age, but as they grow older, having access to a computer can greatly benefit their education and development. Overall, the numerous advantages of owning a computer make it a valuable tool for communication, information, and entertainment.
1476	1480	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, etc. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flies when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probably be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well, I'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, it's basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will think it's going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. Whatever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh, I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted on being on the computer. People don't realize that since their time is being wasted on the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends etc. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and it's not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.  In conclusion, it is crucial for individuals to recognize the detrimental impact excessive computer usage can have on their overall well-being. By prioritizing activities such as exercise, connecting with nature, and spending quality time with loved ones, individuals can achieve a healthier and more balanced lifestyle. It is essential to strike a harmonious balance between technology and real-life experiences to lead a fulfilling and enriching life.

It is important for individuals to reduce their screen time and prioritize in-person interactions with others. Many individuals, both young and old, are glued to their screens, whether it be for social media, gaming, or other online activities. This habit can be detrimental, as it takes away from the opportunity to engage in real-life experiences and relationships.

In conclusion, it is important for individuals to strike a balance between time spent on the computer and time spent engaging with others in the real world. Parents must take an active role in monitoring their children's online behavior to ensure their safety.

1480	1484	1	3	Over 50% of Newtown citizens own at least one computer in their house. Computers play a vital role in benefiting society by helping to save the environment and quickly disseminating important information. Additionally, they facilitate communication with friends and family through various online platforms. While some may argue that excessive screen time is a concern, the necessity of these machines for modern life is undeniable. For instance, schools in Newtown are increasingly using computers to assign homework digitally, reducing paper usage and saving trees. By transitioning to electronic communication methods like email instead of traditional mail, we can not only improve efficiency but also lessen our environmental impact. Furthermore, the use of computers can help save endangered bee populations by minimizing cellphone usage, which emits harmful waves. In times of inclement weather, such as snowstorms or hurricanes, computers provide essential updates and communication tools to ensure the safety of individuals and families. Moreover, the cost-saving benefits of utilizing computers for online communication can be significant, as seen in the amount Newtown citizens spend on phone bills each year. Overall, computers offer numerous advantages, from environmental conservation to enhanced connectivity, making them an indispensable asset in today's society. It is imperative for Newtown residents to recognize and appreciate the multifaceted benefits that computers bring and advocate for their continued integration into daily life.
1481	1485	1	3	Dear local newspaper, did you know that just about 60% of the people in the United States have computers and use them daily? I am one of those people, and I don't get how some are saying that computers are destroying our country. Sure, we may spend a little less time with family and friends, but computers play a crucial role in society.  Computers help monitor weather and natural disasters like tornadoes and hurricanes, providing vital information that can save lives. Without this technology, over 90% more people could die from these disasters due to lack of warning. Additionally, over 95% of kids in the U.S. go to school, and computers enhance their learning by providing access to information about the world and society.  Furthermore, computers are essential in teaching children hand-eye coordination and typing skills, which are increasingly important in today's digital age. As technology continues to advance, these skills will be crucial for success in various fields.  In conclusion, computers are indispensable in our society for tracking natural disasters, expanding knowledge, and preparing children for the future. It is evident that computers are a valuable asset that enriches our lives and enhances our ability to learn and communicate effectively.
1482	1486	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I understand that more and more people use computers, and that can have a good side and a bad one. Do you go on the computer for hours every day? That could be bad. I believe computers are a good thing, but only if they are used properly. Hopefully when I'm done, you'll see where I'm coming from on this matters. Everyone is on the computer these days. The problem is, many people are on way too much. They say they are working on hand-eye coordination, but in reality they are wasting away their lives on a chair. They do not communicate as much with the rest of the household and that does not make a big, happy family. They say they are getting important information, but in truth, they might just be getting false information and viruses. Bad people are out there, and one might hack into your computer and ruin your day. Things like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 could have people that want to find out all about you so they can hurt you. Yes, being on the computer definitely has a bad side. But there is a good side as well. That is, as long as you are not on too much. It does improve hand-eye coordination if you play the right games. And it can teach you things, too. Many websites have true information about places or things so you don't need to see it to know about it. You can be helpful. It is also an easy way to purchase items. You can just order them. Most importantly, you can have fun. So, what is your side on this argument? Do you think way too many people are on the computer? Or do you think computers can be great, as long as you're careful? I, for one, pick the latter one. What about you?  In conclusion, computers can be a valuable tool if used in moderation and with caution. While they offer benefits such as improving hand-eye coordination, providing educational resources, and facilitating online shopping, excessive use can lead to negative consequences like reduced family interaction, exposure to false information, and potential security risks. It is essential to strike a balance between utilizing the advantages of computers and ensuring responsible usage to maintain a healthy and productive lifestyle.
1483	1487	1	3	Studies show that a significant percentage of individuals addicted to computers do not prioritize physical fitness or engage in sports. While computers offer a means of social interaction and access to information, neglecting outdoor activities and exercise can have negative effects on overall well-being. It is essential to strike a balance between screen time and outdoor pursuits to lead a fulfilling life.  Spending excessive hours on a computer can also impact eyesight, leading to vision problems such as the need for glasses. Many individuals who spend prolonged periods in front of screens experience a decline in visual acuity, emphasizing the importance of moderation in computer usage.  Incorporating outdoor activities, such as hiking or biking, not only promotes physical health but also allows individuals to connect with nature and appreciate its beauty. Breathing in fresh air and engaging in sports with friends can enhance overall quality of life and provide a sense of joy and fulfillment that cannot be replicated by online interactions.  Ultimately, the choice between excessive computer use and a more balanced lifestyle lies with each individual. By prioritizing physical activity, outdoor experiences, and limiting screen time, individuals can cultivate a healthier and more enriching life. It is essential to recognize the impact of technology on well-being and make conscious decisions to maintain a harmonious relationship between the digital world and the natural one.
1484	1488	1	3	I think that computers are very valuable and help a lot of people. I believe that computers should be used for educational purposes, such as helping students with homework or studying for tests. They are also useful for adults to look up information like directions, addresses, and prices of items. Communication is another important aspect, as computers help people stay connected with friends and make plans. However, it is crucial for individuals to limit their time on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter to prevent excessive use.   Computers can be beneficial for students who need assistance with their schoolwork, allowing them to easily access information and resources. Additionally, they can help individuals learn about topics they are struggling with, leading to better academic performance. Socially, computers provide a platform for shy individuals to interact with others and make new friends. Online shopping and obtaining directions are also common uses of computers, making tasks more convenient and saving money.  Overall, computers play a vital role in modern society and offer numerous advantages. It is important to recognize their value and use them wisely to maximize their benefits.
1485	1489	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that excessive use of computers and technology is causing harm to individuals and families in our community. Many people are becoming overweight and unhealthy because they are not getting enough exercise, with children neglecting their homework in favor of screen time. This addiction to technology is driving people apart from their loved ones, leading to missed opportunities to spend quality time together. It is alarming that a significant percentage of individuals in our area are reporting weight gain and obesity due to their reliance on computers.  One individual I spoke to, named @PERSON1, expressed their concerns that computers are taking over people's lives and becoming their worst enemy. Personally, I have experienced the negative impact of excessive computer use on my academic performance and overall well-being. Instead of focusing on my studies, I find myself spending hours on the computer, resulting in a decline in my grades.  It is crucial for parents to monitor their children's computer usage and prioritize homework and family time over screen time. By taking control of our technology habits, we can prevent the detrimental effects on our health, relationships, and overall quality of life. Let us make a conscious effort to limit our screen time and prioritize real-life interactions and activities. Say no to the negative influence of computers and reclaim control over our lives before it is too late. We have the power to make a change and live a healthier, more fulfilling life. Let us not allow something as trivial as a computer to dictate our well-being and relationships. Live your life to the fullest without the interference of excessive technology.
1486	1490	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, The effects Computers have on people is that people rely on them and that's not good because they have less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First of all, having less time exercising is not good because a high percentage of people end up fighting obesity. ""You don't want to be one of those people, trust me,"" said a concerned individual. Second, enjoying nature is a good thing to do instead of playing with a computer because you get your daily dose of fresh air by enjoying nature. ""You also have a lot of fun,"" said a resident. Lastly, interacting with family and friends is enjoyable, and who doesn't love that? ""Spending time with the family is fun because you get to go places,"" said a family member. ""Who doesn't love going out and spending time with friends on the weekends,"" said a friend. Those are my reasons why the effects computers have on people are not good. In conclusion, it is essential for individuals to balance their computer usage with physical activity, outdoor experiences, and social interactions to lead a healthy and fulfilling life."

1488	1492	1	3	Dear local newspaper,   I believe that computers can have a negative impact on people from a young age, starting at thirteen and continuing into adulthood. Many individuals spend excessive amounts of time on computers, neglecting physical activities such as exercise and outdoor pursuits. This sedentary behavior can lead to feelings of life passing by and can also have detrimental effects on posture.  Extended periods spent hunched over a computer can result in poor posture, causing strain on the back and muscles. Similar to being confined in a tight space for hours, the body becomes tense and rigid from being in one position for too long.   It is crucial to be mindful of the impact that excessive computer use can have on our physical well-being. Balancing screen time with physical activity is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing potential posture-related issues.  In conclusion, it is important to limit computer usage and prioritize physical activity to ensure overall health and well-being. Let us strive to find a balance between technology and the outdoors for a healthier lifestyle.
1489	1493	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers have a positive impact on society. They enhance social interactions through platforms like Facebook, @CAPS3, and Skype, allowing people to connect with friends and family. Personally, these tools have become a part of my daily routine, enabling me to stay in touch with loved ones and make new connections.  Moreover, computers are essential for education, enabling students to conduct research, type papers, and create graphs for projects. Without computers, the quality of education would be compromised, and students would struggle to access information efficiently.  In addition, computers are vital for businesses, helping them operate efficiently by storing data, managing expenses, and streamlining tasks. Without computers, businesses would face significant challenges in managing their operations and staying competitive in the modern world.  Overall, computers play a crucial role in society by facilitating social interactions, enhancing education, and supporting businesses. Their presence has become indispensable in our daily lives, contributing to the advancement and efficiency of the world we live in.
1490	1494	1	3	Computers are truly a remarkable invention that has revolutionized the way we live our lives. From enhancing our learning experiences to improving our hand-eye coordination, and facilitating communication with loved ones, computers have become an indispensable part of our daily routine. The ability to access a vast amount of knowledge at our fingertips, stay updated with current events, and easily connect with friends and family, all contribute to the numerous benefits that computers bring to society. As we continue to utilize this technology in our everyday tasks, it is evident that computers have greatly enriched our lives in ways we may not even realize.
1491	1495	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I agree with the experts that people spend too much time on the computer and should engage in activities like exercising, reading, or spending time with friends and family. Being sedentary and glued to screens can lead to health issues and social isolation.   Firstly, physical activity is crucial for overall well-being. Instead of being online all day, people should prioritize activities like taking walks, going to the gym, or playing sports. Without regular exercise, the risk of becoming overweight and lethargic increases significantly.  Secondly, it is essential to nurture relationships with loved ones. Spending quality time with friends and family creates strong bonds and memories. Ignoring them in favor of screen time can be detrimental to relationships and personal development.   Lastly, reading is a beneficial alternative to being online. Books stimulate the mind, improve vocabulary, and enhance cognitive abilities. Visiting the local library and immersing oneself in a good book can be more fulfilling than mindlessly scrolling through digital content.   In conclusion, reducing screen time and engaging in physical activities, social interactions, and reading can lead to a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle. Balancing online activities with real-world experiences is essential for overall happiness and well-being.
1492	1496	1	3	In conclusion, while technology has its ups and downs, the opportunities it provides for advancement and growth are undeniable. It is up to us to use it wisely and harness its power for the betterment of society. Let us continue to embrace the benefits of technology while being mindful of its potential pitfalls.
1493	1497	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editor,  Are you aware that more than 50% of families have ownership of a computer? Perhaps so, but were you informed that at least half of that percentage have family issues related to computer usage? The issue at hand is whether computers have a positive or negative effect on society. In my opinion, I believe that this invention is taking a negative toll on society.  I say this because nowadays there are inappropriate websites that children may stumble upon, taking away precious time from their families. Moreover, there is the concerning issue of children accessing adult websites. It is alarming that children as young as ten years old are logging onto such sites daily. This is unacceptable and a reason why access to computers should be restricted.  Additionally, computers can lead to a disconnect within families. I remember when my family had a computer, we rarely spent quality time together. It is evident that computers can consume a significant amount of time that could be better spent bonding with loved ones.  Furthermore, there is the pressing issue of online predators taking advantage of vulnerable individuals. I was shocked to learn that a friend request I accepted led to a dangerous situation involving drugs and prostitution. It is clear that people can exploit computers to harm others by obtaining personal information.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, such as access to information and communication, they also present serious risks. The negative effects on society, from inappropriate content to family disconnection and online predators, cannot be overlooked. It is crucial to be aware of these dangers and take appropriate measures to protect ourselves and our loved ones.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
1494	1498	1	3	Dear Newspaper editor, I would like to make a few points about the benefits of owning a computer. Computers have revolutionized the way we learn and communicate. With a computer, you can access a wealth of knowledge that was previously inaccessible. You can also connect with friends and people from all over the world through chat rooms and social media platforms.  In many developed countries, owning a computer is standard practice. However, in remote tribes and areas like @LOCATION1, the sight of a computer may seem alien at first. But once people learn how to use it, it can open up a whole new world of possibilities. For example, they can discover information about events like the moon landing that they may have never known about before.  Paying bills has also become much easier with the use of computers. You can conveniently manage your finances, pay taxes, insurance, credit cards, and other bills online. This not only saves time but also helps avoid late fees and enables you to keep track of your finances more effectively.  Socializing has also been transformed by computers. Platforms like @CAPS1, Twitter, and MySpace allow people to connect, share photos, and stay updated on what their friends are doing. Additionally, online gaming has become a popular pastime, offering both single-player and multiplayer options for entertainment.  Furthermore, computers have significantly improved the educational experience. They have made homework and research more efficient and engaging. Teachers can use computers to provide interactive lessons and show educational videos, making learning more accessible and enjoyable for students.  In conclusion, owning a computer offers numerous advantages in terms of learning, communication, financial management, socializing, and entertainment. It has become an essential tool in today's digital age, benefiting individuals, families, and educational institutions alike. I hope you will consider these points and publish them for your readers to appreciate the value of owning a computer.
1495	1499	1	3	Dear @PERSON2, your latest article on the goods and bads of computers in our society was informative, but I believe you left out a few major reasons why technology is doing more harm than good. If people don't become aware of the consequences, who knows where our world is heading? First off, I'd like to mention the health issues associated with technology in general, especially computers. Dr. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION2 states that since the popularity of the internet boomed with the invention of websites like '@CAPS3' and '@CAPS4', we've seen a drastic spike in obesity-related heart disease and diabetes. And Dr. @PERSON3 isn't exaggerating. Because of the sudden boom in electronics, more and more people prefer sitting on the couch with their brand new laptop or smartphone than go for a bike ride or play a game of fastball with friends. This sedentary lifestyle has led to a rise in heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and bone diseases that could leave individuals paralyzed for life. Is playing that online game really worth risking your health?  Next, I'd like to touch on the fact that while the internet may seem like a great place to socialize, it can actually lead to losing friends instead of making them. Sites like '@CAPS6' may help people connect, but the ease of digital communication is causing individuals to lose their social skills. Spending too much time talking to friends online instead of meeting face-to-face can cause relationships to drift apart. @PERSON4, a 25-year-old at @ORGANIZATION1, mentioned that he and his best friend now only communicate through social media and don't feel like true friends anymore. Real friendships require bonding and genuine interaction, which is difficult to achieve through a screen.  So, next time you turn on that laptop, think about the potential consequences. Is it really worth losing your friends and jeopardizing your health for the sake of technology? Instead of updating your status online, consider reaching out to a friend and spending quality time together. Trust me, you'll be glad you did. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.
1496	1500	1	3	Dear local Newspaper editor, More and more people are using computers, but not everyone thinks that is such a good idea. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Other experts disagree. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they let you learn about anything all over the world, they let you talk online with other people, and teach hand-eye coordination. I think that computers are very helpful.  Don't you love having the opportunity to research anything from any part of the world that you want to learn about? I'm sure that everyone who has a computer does. With computers, you can use search engines like Google, Yahoo, Ask, and so many more. I know that computers help me with research all the time when I do projects or write papers for school. The internet is a great, reliable source that you can go to when researching a topic for school or even just looking for an answer to a simple question.  My next reason is that computers let you talk to other people online. Things like Facebook, email, MySpace, and web-camming all let you communicate with people anywhere in the world. For example, I have an aunt that lives in another state, and on Christmas, me and my family used my cousin's webcam to see her and talk to her when we couldn't be with her on a special holiday. Also, things like Facebook and MySpace let you put up pictures and chat with friends and family all over the world.  My last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people is that playing on the computer is a good leisure time activity. There are all kinds of fun games you can play, and some even let you compete with other people around the world. For example, internet checkers is a game that lets you compete against someone else. There are so many websites that let you pick games you want to play out of a huge selection. It's obvious that computers have a positive effect on people for research, talking to friends & family, and leisure activities.  In conclusion, computers have become an essential part of our lives, offering countless benefits such as easy access to information, global communication, and enjoyable leisure activities. Embracing technology has undoubtedly enhanced our daily experiences and connectivity with others worldwide.
1497	1501	1	3	Do you think that computers are good? Well, I do. There are many reasons why I and you should think this. For example, it has a positive effect on people, it teaches hand-eye coordination, and it allows people to talk online with others. One reason why you should think that computers are good is that it has a positive effect on people. Computers can be a source of online fun and learning, contributing to overall happiness and well-being. Additionally, computers teach hand-eye coordination, which is a valuable skill in various activities such as sports. Developing this coordination can prevent accidents and enhance overall performance. Another reason is that computers enable people to interact with others online, whether through chat rooms, gaming platforms, or online dating. This connectivity helps in building relationships and finding like-minded individuals. Overall, having a computer offers numerous benefits, from skill development to social interactions, making it a valuable tool in today's digital world.
1498	1502	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that excessive computer usage can have detrimental effects on individuals. Not only can people become easily addicted to it, but computers also consume a significant amount of electricity. Additionally, prolonged sitting in front of a screen can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, resulting in health issues such as obesity.  Online activities like computer games and gambling can be particularly addictive. People can quickly find themselves spending excessive amounts of time and money on these activities, leading to financial troubles and strained relationships. In fact, a considerable percentage of individuals who engage in online poker become addicted within a short period of time.  Moreover, the amount of electricity used by computers is substantial, with a significant portion of it being allocated to these devices. In a time of economic crisis, it is essential to prioritize the use of energy for more critical purposes rather than for leisure activities on computers.  Furthermore, the sedentary nature of computer usage contributes to the rise in obesity rates. Many individuals spend hours on end sitting in front of a screen, neglecting physical activity and outdoor experiences. This lifestyle can lead to various health issues and negatively impact overall well-being.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is crucial to exercise moderation and balance in their usage. It is essential to prioritize physical activity, social interactions, and overall health over excessive screen time. By being mindful of the potential negative effects of computer addiction, electricity consumption, and sedentary behavior, individuals can lead healthier and happier lives.
1499	1503	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, I think we should have internet or computers in our houses. It would allow us to communicate with our friends and family easily, prevent boredom, and provide opportunities for learning. Having a computer is supported by many people in our school, with a majority agreeing that it is beneficial.  For instance, when a friend moved away to a distant location, I was able to stay in touch with her through social media platforms like Facebook. These online tools enable us to connect regardless of physical distance. Additionally, there are numerous educational websites available that offer valuable information. No matter our age, we can acquire new knowledge on various subjects by simply browsing the internet.  Moreover, the internet offers entertainment in the form of games and other interactive activities. This can help prevent individuals, especially children, from engaging in negative behaviors due to boredom. States like @STATE1 and @STATE2 have a high percentage of people using the internet, indicating its widespread popularity and usefulness.  In conclusion, internet access is not only enjoyable but also essential for communication, learning, and entertainment. It has become an integral part of modern life, providing countless benefits to individuals of all ages. I strongly believe that having a computer at home is a valuable asset that enhances our daily lives.
1500	1504	1	3	When people think about computers, the first thing that often comes to mind is games. However, computers serve a wide range of purposes beyond gaming. They are incredibly useful tools for various tasks, including education, research, communication, and entertainment.  One primary use of computers is in education.

The internet offers up-to-date and reliable information that can assist in various aspects of life.  Moreover, computers enable people to stay connected with friends and family. Social media platforms like @CAPS3 allow individuals to reconnect with old friends, share experiences, and engage in online games or activities together. Computers also serve as a platform for sharing memories through photos and videos, creating a sense of connection even when physically apart.  Overall, computers play a crucial role in modern society, offering a wide range of benefits beyond entertainment. Whether it's for education, research, communication, or entertainment, computers provide valuable tools and resources that enhance various aspects of our lives.
1501	1505	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 of the students and staff members of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 school find computers very important. Computers play a significant role in both educational and personal aspects of people's lives. They are essential tools that assist in various tasks, from school assignments to everyday activities.

This is particularly beneficial for students like my brother who are working on college essays, as it ensures their writing is of high quality. Additionally, computers provide access to online dictionaries, making it easy to look up unfamiliar words and expand vocabulary.  Moreover, computers enable individuals to explore distant places and cultures through the internet.

Excessive use of computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to weight gain and other health issues. It is essential for individuals to balance their computer usage with physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, spending too much time on computers can lead to a lack of communication within families, as individuals may become consumed by online activities. This can result in conflicts and disconnect among family members. It is important for individuals to prioritize spending quality time with their loved ones and engage in meaningful activities outside of the digital world. While computers can provide entertainment and information, it is crucial to use them in moderation to avoid negative consequences on physical and mental health, as well as relationships with others.
1503	1507	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 writers, @CAPS3 are an average of @NUM1 computers per house, which is quite excessive. It is concerning how much society relies on computers, as they seem to be taking over our lives. The time spent on computers not only runs up the electric bill but also contributes to health issues such as weight gain. Furthermore, excessive computer usage can lead to social isolation, as individuals may prioritize online interactions over real-life connections.   It is important to consider the financial impact of spending excessive time on computers, as it can significantly increase monthly expenses. By reducing computer usage, families can save a substantial amount of money that can be used for essential expenses like groceries or bills. Additionally, excessive computer use can hinder social interactions and limit opportunities to form meaningful relationships in real life.  Ultimately, it is crucial to strike a balance between using computers for productivity and leisure, and engaging in real-life interactions. Limiting computer usage can not only lead to cost savings but also improve overall well-being by fostering meaningful connections with others. It is time to reassess our reliance on computers and prioritize meaningful interactions in the real world.
1504	1508	1	3	Computers are a double-edged sword. While they offer entertainment and convenience, they can also lead to excessive screen time, isolating individuals from real-life interactions. Despite these drawbacks, computers play a vital role in education and social connections. They provide a wide range of games, from fun role-playing adventures to essential educational tools. These games not only entertain but also help children learn and develop crucial skills. Additionally, computers enable older adults to connect with others, fostering relationships and combating loneliness.

While technology offers convenience and entertainment, it should not replace the benefits of exercise and spending time outdoors.  Incorporating simple activities like going for a walk, doing exercise routines at home, or visiting local parks can have a positive impact on our health and well-being. By stepping away from the computer and immersing ourselves in nature, we can rejuvenate our minds and bodies, appreciate the beauty of the world around us, and improve our overall quality of life.  So, let's make a conscious effort to strike a balance between our screen time and outdoor activities.

These digital interactions contribute to strengthening relationships and fostering connections among people.  In conclusion, the benefits of computers, such as providing entertainment, easy access to daily necessities, and enhancing social interactions, greatly impact society in a positive way.

Those who spend more time outdoors and less time on computers tend to live longer and healthier lives.  It is crucial to limit screen time and prioritize activities that promote physical well-being. People who are constantly glued to their screens are at a higher risk of developing vision problems and other health issues. It is recommended to limit screen time to a few hours a week and focus on engaging in outdoor activities instead.  Overuse of screens can lead to various health issues, including eye strain and mental fatigue. It is important to take breaks and engage in physical activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle. By reducing screen time and spending more time outdoors, individuals can improve their overall well-being and quality of life.  In conclusion, moderation is key when it comes to screen time. By balancing technology use with physical activity, individuals can lead a healthier and more fulfilling life. Let's prioritize our health and well-being by limiting screen time and enjoying the outdoors.
1516	1520	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, there has been much debate on whether computers are good or bad. Personally, I believe that computers aren't as beneficial as many people think. Since the invention of computers, people have been exercising less, children are reading less, and family time is being compromised. The sedentary nature of computer use has led to a decrease in physical activity among individuals. Many kids nowadays prefer spending their time indoors, glued to a computer screen, rather than engaging in active pursuits like sports or outdoor play. This lack of exercise contributes to the rising number of overweight children globally. Additionally, the prevalence of computers has led to a decline in reading habits among children. Instead of picking up a book, many students choose to spend their free time on the computer, resulting in lower reading levels. Programs like @CAPS5 @NUM3 are implemented in schools to address this issue, but if students prioritized reading over computer use, such programs may not be necessary. Finally, the widespread use of computers has also affected family dynamics, with less time being spent together. It is rare to find families engaging in activities together without the distraction of computers. Despite occasional family gatherings, the majority of time is spent staring at screens. In essence, while computers offer numerous benefits, their negative impact on physical activity, reading habits, and family time should not be overlooked. It is important for individuals to strike a balance between computer use and other important aspects of life to lead a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.
1517	1521	1	3	I believe computers have a positive effect on people because they can help in various ways. For instance, computers allow individuals to easily communicate with friends and family across the world through email. This can help maintain relationships and stay connected regardless of physical distance. Additionally, computers are essential for accessing important information quickly, which can be beneficial for academic or professional purposes. Furthermore, computers enable individuals who may be unable to work in a traditional setting, such as due to illness or caregiving responsibilities, to work online and earn an income. In conclusion, the versatility and functionality of computers make them a valuable tool that positively impacts people's lives.
1518	1522	1	3	Dear editor of the @PERSON1, I heard you are writing a section in your newspaper about computers and I just thought I would voice my opinion. Personally, I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers are swell because you are able to learn things about faraway places, like countries on the other side of the world, from the comfort of your home. Also, the information on the internet can help with students' schoolwork. Finally, you are able to talk with other people online. These are just a few points why computers are very important, that you should include in your article.   First off, editor of the @PERSON1, I think computers are good for mankind because you are able to learn about places on the other side of the world, while sitting at home drinking hot cocoa. This is so very convenient. There are websites containing the geography, languages, and traditions of countries waiting for you to learn. For example, once my friend, @PERSON3, was planning on going to @LOCATION1 for a business trip, but had no idea how to speak the language. I recommended the website, www.Indianow.com and in two weeks she was speaking like an expert. Another time, my sister, @PERSON4, was visiting her in-laws for the first time. They were full @CAPS1 and she wanted to bake something traditional for them. She looked up a recipe on the web and everyone was satisfied with the scrumptious ravioli she made. This is just one reason the internet is so useful.   Second, computers are an amazing invention because you can find help for schoolwork easily. My brother, @PERSON5, was having problems with learning about the seasons, but with one click, he was full of knowledge. Also, nowadays they even have online tutors and online colleges! Professor @PERSON2 states that 45% of passing college students are earning their degree online. This is a fabulous point on why computers are so important.   Lastly, computers are really significant to society because you are able to talk with other people online. With video chat, chatrooms, Facebook, and @CAPS2, you are bound to make a friend who would last a lifetime. I know I did! There are even online dating sites and matchmakers. For instance, after my uncle divorced my aunt, she was devastated and couldn't date again for the longest time. I told her to try one of those online dating sites, she took my advice and found a lovely man. They have been dating for 8 months. Last week he proposed. They are now happily engaged. This is my last reason how computers can change someone's life in a positive way.   In conclusion, I think computers are a fantastic invention because you are able to learn about faraway places while staying at home, receive help with your schoolwork, and talk with other people online. I really hope you will consider my opinion for your article, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1. Thank you for your time.
1519	1523	1	3	@CAPS1 you know we all like computers and we all use them for various purposes such as chatting, working, and searching for information. However, relying too much on computers can have negative impacts on our health. One reason is that spending extended periods on a computer can lead to unhealthy snacking habits, resulting in weight gain over time. Additionally, prolonged screen time can strain your eyes and cause hand cramps, potentially leading to long-term eye and hand issues. Furthermore, excessive computer usage can cause the device to overheat, slow down, or even get viruses, leading to the need for repairs or replacements. It's important to use computers in moderation and take breaks to avoid these health risks.
1520	1524	1	3	Many people have been discussing the impact of computers in society. Networks such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS2 have expressed concerns that computers are making people lazy and unproductive. However, I believe that technological advancements are beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, computers provide people with the opportunity to learn about distant places and cultures. Additionally, they enhance hand-eye coordination skills. Are you tired of having to visit physical stores to find information for projects? With computers, you can easily access a wealth of information online without leaving your home. Moreover, computers improve overall quality of life. They streamline tasks, facilitate communication, and offer entertainment options. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in modern society by expanding knowledge, enhancing skills, and improving daily life.
1521	1525	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I was reading this article about computers. I agree with the point that kids and adults should spend more time enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. However, I also believe that computers can be helpful for searching information when needed. It is essential for kids and adults to find a balance between screen time and outdoor activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle.  It is concerning to see that children nowadays are more interested in playing video games indoors rather than playing outside. As a result, they are missing out on the benefits of physical activity and fresh air. While computers can be beneficial for educational purposes and research, excessive use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and have negative impacts on overall health.  Furthermore, the reliance on technology has also affected the way children approach their school responsibilities. Instead of taking school seriously and putting effort into their studies, some students believe that computers can provide all the necessary information. It is important for parents and educators to emphasize the importance of a balanced approach to technology and outdoor activities to ensure the well-being of children.  In conclusion, while computers have their advantages in terms of information access and educational purposes, it is crucial for kids and adults to prioritize physical activity, outdoor play, and face-to-face interactions. Finding a healthy balance between technology use and outdoor activities is key to fostering a well-rounded and healthy lifestyle for individuals of all ages.
1522	1526	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, To this day, there are many people who use telecommunication devices, like computers. Some believe that computers have a positive impact on individuals, while others are concerned about the excessive time spent on them. I believe that both perspectives hold merit. Although computer usage can lead to addictive and unhealthy habits, they offer educational value, entertainment, and environmental benefits. Computers have become an integral part of daily life for millions of people, including my family, who own four computers for various purposes. My mom uses it for work and communication, while my sister and I utilize it for research, homework, and social interaction. The convenience of the internet has replaced the need for physical books, making information readily accessible. Additionally, online platforms like Facebook and email facilitate quick and enjoyable communication while reducing paper consumption, thus benefiting the environment. However, excessive computer usage can have detrimental effects on physical and mental health. Individuals may become addicted, leading to sedentary lifestyles and potential health issues. Prolonged screen time can strain the eyes and impact brain function negatively. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to balance computer usage with outdoor activities and exercise to maintain overall well-being. In conclusion, while computers offer numerous advantages, it is essential to use them in moderation to prevent adverse health effects. Thank you for considering my viewpoint.
1523	1527	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, many people think computers are bad, but there are many reasons why they are actually good. Computers are environmentally friendly, just like @PERCENT1 of people today. They allow us to easily type assignments and important papers. Additionally, computers are not the worst @ORGANIZATION1 in terms of time consumption. While it is true that they can take away time from exercise, it is important to note that people spend more time watching @CAPS5 than using computers. A survey conducted by @PERSON2 at @ORGANIZATION1 showed that a significant percentage of people spend more time watching TV than using computers.   Furthermore, using computers for research instead of buying newspapers or magazines can help save trees. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION2 suggests that if more people switch to using computers for news, a substantial number of trees can be saved each year. Moreover, computers have made it easier for teachers to grade papers and tests, as many students have messy handwriting. By typing their work, students not only make it easier for teachers but also find it more convenient. Studies have shown that a majority of teachers prefer typed papers over handwritten ones.  In conclusion, computers are not as time-consuming as perceived by many. They aid in research, are environmentally friendly, and contribute to creating a neater and more organized world, especially for the younger generation. One click at a time, computers are positively impacting our lives and the environment.
1524	1528	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, I believe that computers can be incredibly beneficial to you in various ways. For instance, they can assist you in completing homework assignments by providing access to information that may otherwise be difficult to find. In my own experience, I was able to learn about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @NUM1 thanks to the resources available on the computer.  Furthermore, computers can help you reconnect with long-lost family members, as demonstrated by my mother who found her sister online after my grandfather passed away. Additionally, the internet can provide you with valuable knowledge about different states and regions that you may not be familiar with. This exposure to new information can expand your understanding of the world beyond what your mother or teacher may be able to teach you.  In conclusion, computers have the potential to educate you on a wide range of topics that may not be readily available through traditional means. Embracing technology can open up new opportunities for learning and discovery that can greatly enrich your life.
1525	1529	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I recently started researching the effects that computers have on people and have found some shocking facts. I do not believe computers benefit society at all. Three reasons why I believe this is because it makes people lack exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. @CAPS1 is a rising problem in @LOCATION1 and a major factor towards @CAPS1 is computers. In fact, statistics show that people who spend more time exercising than looking at electronics all day actually live longer lives. So my first reason about why computers do not benefit society is that it lets people lack exercise. People need exercise to live, and with computers, it is becoming more lacking than ever. Also, exercise gives you endorphins, a hormone that makes you happy if you live your life exercising instead of watching or doing violent things on the web that will lead to a less violent future.   My second reason is that computers cause a lack of enjoying nature. Nature is a beautiful thing filled with shimmering lakes, the beautiful scent of balsam fir, and thousands of creatures. With computers, thousands of kids are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature has in store. My parents didn't have computers when they were little, and they say that they enjoyed running around their neighborhoods playing sports and other fun activities.   Finally, computers lack in interacting with friends. Remember when you were little and you called up your friend to hang out and sleepover, well now computers have caused people not to have to call or hang out with friends. Instead, you can just text or email them, and you can have a conversation without even looking at a person!   In closing, computers cause a lack in exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. Please help and encourage others to join me in putting a stop to excessive computer usage. Thank you for your time, and I hope you learned some shocking and interesting facts from this letter.
1526	1530	1	3	To: @ORGANIZATION1  Technology is advancing rapidly, with new innovations constantly being introduced. One such invention is the computer, designed to aid people in their work. However, there is a growing concern about the excessive time individuals, especially teenagers, are spending on computers. This trend is worrying as it leads to reduced physical activity, less social interaction with friends and family, and potential dangers for teenagers. While some may not see this as a significant issue, the reality is that many individuals, both young and old, are becoming engrossed in screen time rather than engaging in outdoor activities, exercising, or simply enjoying life.  Personal experiences highlight the negative impacts of excessive computer use. For instance, a friend who used to spend time playing outside every day is now glued to the computer, which has impacted our interactions. Family gatherings have also been affected as more members are choosing to spend time on screens rather than connecting with loved ones. This shift can lead to family disconnection, which is saddening and detrimental to relationships.  Moreover, the dangers associated with online interactions cannot be ignored. Predators may pose as peers to lure unsuspecting individuals into dangerous situations, putting children at risk. It is essential to consider the potential consequences of excessive computer use, especially for vulnerable groups like teenagers.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it is crucial to acknowledge the negative impacts of excessive screen time. Encouraging a balance between technology use, outdoor activities, and quality time with family is essential for maintaining a healthy and safe lifestyle. It is vital for individuals to reflect on the consequences of prolonged computer use and prioritize real-life experiences to ensure well-being and safety.
1527	1531	1	3	"Who in the world would say a computer is useless. No one, computers are one of the most useful devices ever made. I think that computers are perfect and can help you build skills. I have reasons it builds skills, provides fast information, and is fun. Now let's get started with skills. Skills are things you need to have if you want to pursue a career. You can learn skills from books, TV, and computers. For example, I learned how to type rapidly on a keyboard from a computer game called ""Type to Learn."" After a week of playing this game, I was typing like a pro. Computers also have chess to help build strategy. Just ask my super smart English teacher, she says that chess builds character and strengthens your mind. Moving along, I want to talk about how you can get information in an instant with computers. Experts say it is the number one way to get information quickly. I agree with that, after studying for a test on Carver in my book, but one of my pages was missing. So, I used my computer and not only did I get my information quickly, but I also got more information than the book provided. The next day, I passed my test with flying colors. You see how useful a computer can be. Finally, I want to talk to you about good old-fashioned fun. As you know, computers are perfect for building skills and getting information, but you can always use a computer for fun. Do you know anyone in the world who can say that a computer is not fun? No, you can't because everyone in the world uses the computer for fun stuff like online games, videos, and talking to people. Thanks for listening to my reasons about computers building skills, providing information, and being fun."
1528	1532	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In many ways, computers have revolutionized the way we live our lives. They have become an integral part of our daily routines, helping us with tasks ranging from communication to entertainment. However, it is important to recognize the potential negative impacts of excessive computer usage.  While computers offer numerous benefits, such as connecting us with loved ones and providing valuable information, they can also lead to sedentary lifestyles. Many individuals spend hours in front of screens, neglecting physical activity and outdoor experiences. This lack of exercise can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health.  Moreover, the rise of cyberbullying is a concerning issue associated with computer use. Children and teenagers often fall victim to online harassment, leading to low self-esteem and even more severe consequences. It is crucial to address these negative aspects of computer usage and promote a balance between screen time and real-life interactions.  Despite these drawbacks, computers have undeniably made significant contributions to society. They have aided in medical research, weather forecasting, and various other fields that have improved our quality of life. It is essential to appreciate the positive impact of technology while also being mindful of its potential downsides.  In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our modern world, offering countless benefits and opportunities. However, it is crucial to maintain a healthy balance between digital and real-world experiences to ensure overall well-being. Embracing technology while also prioritizing physical activity and personal interactions is key to leading a fulfilling and balanced life. Thank you.
1529	1533	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper,   Have you ever wondered why people spend so much time on the computer? The effect of people using a computer is a topic of debate because there are both positive and negative aspects to consider. On one hand, computers allow individuals to communicate with people in faraway places, bridging distances and enabling connections that were previously impossible. For example, someone can easily chat with a friend they went on a trip with to a different location, reminiscing about shared experiences and maintaining their bond despite the distance.   However, on the flip side, excessive time spent on the computer can lead to neglecting time with family and friends in the physical world. Becoming engrossed in the digital realm can turn individuals into ""couch potatoes,"" leading to a sedentary and unhealthy lifestyle. Despite the convenience of virtual communication, face-to-face interactions are essential for building and maintaining strong relationships.   Moreover, computers can serve as a lifeline for families separated by geographical distances. For instance, if a family member moves to a different state, video calls through webcams provide a means to stay connected visually, bridging the gap created by physical distance. While traditional communication methods like letters and phone calls are valuable, they lack the visual element that can convey emotions and reactions effectively.   While some may argue that computers are a waste of time, it is important to recognize the significant role they play in modern communication and relationships. Balancing screen time with real-world interactions is key to maintaining healthy relationships and overall well-being.   In conclusion, the impact of computer usage on relationships and communication is multifaceted, with both advantages and drawbacks. Finding a balance between virtual and real-world interactions is crucial for fostering meaningful connections and maintaining a healthy lifestyle."

1536	1540	1	3	@DATE1 @CAPS1 Local Newspaper, I agree that computers can have a significant impact on people, especially children. While computers can be useful tools, excessive use can lead to laziness and inactivity. In today's digital age, children are often more inclined to spend time on social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook, rather than engaging in physical activities. This sedentary lifestyle can have negative effects on their health and well-being.  It is concerning to see children spending hours on end in front of a screen, neglecting opportunities for exercise and outdoor play. This can lead to a lack of physical fitness and social interaction, as seen in the case of your @NUM1-year-old brother. It is important for parents to monitor and limit their children's screen time to promote a balanced lifestyle.  While computers can provide a means of staying connected with friends, it is essential for children to also prioritize physical activity and real-world interactions. It is crucial to find a healthy balance between screen time and other activities to ensure overall well-being. Time is a valuable resource, and it is important not to waste it on excessive screen time. Let's encourage our children to engage in a variety of activities and experiences, both online and offline, to promote a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle.
1537	1541	1	3	Dear NewsPaper, people are spending too much time on computers. You could be outside enjoying nature, playing sports, or traveling. Some people say that you can learn about animals and plants on a computer, but there is nothing like really being outside with them. People who hike and really enjoy being outside are smarter than people who don't. I like being outside more than inside and I have straight A's. Sports are also a good way to get outside. My favorite sport is baseball and I am pretty good. Some places say that computers can help with your hand-eye-coordination, but how can a computer help you with that? Sports are what help you with hand-eye coordination. Playing sports can also help you get stronger. Baseball is why I can bench press @NUM1 pounds. @PERCENT2 of kids who play a sports are not over weight, but @PERCENT3 of kids who don't are. Traveling is also a good way to get outside. I love traveling. I am fluent in english french, and spanish. My favorite place to go is northern @CAPS1 in @LOCATION1. Computers can show you pictures of a place, but when you are actually there, it is really fascinating. A picture on a computer cannot even compare to what it is really like. You also cannot walk on a computer, or drink the water from a stream, or climb up a clift. There is really no comparison. Computers are a lot worse and a lot worse for real nature. Compared to real life and nature, there really is no comparison. Computers aren't as good as real life. You can enjoy nature play sports, and travel the world, all by just being outside. Thank you for your time. People should consider spending more time outdoors to truly appreciate all that nature has to offer.
1538	1542	1	3	Computers have revolutionized the way we learn, entertain ourselves, and pass the time during boring waits. With the advancements in technology, obtaining information for school projects has become much easier and more efficient.

From facilitating learning and providing entertainment to making waiting more enjoyable, computers have become essential tools that enhance our overall well-being and productivity.
1539	1543	1	3	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, it is important to consider that not everyone is heavily reliant on computers in this digital age. Some individuals prefer to communicate with their loved ones in person to ensure their well-being, especially in times of crisis such as the passing of a family member or friend. Additionally, some people rely on physical visits to the bank for various financial transactions, like withdrawing money or sending funds to family members.   While technology has its benefits, such as convenience and efficiency, it is crucial to strike a balance and not become overly dependent on it. Children, in particular, can be easily absorbed by games and online activities, leading to a disconnection from the real world and difficulty in tearing themselves away from screens. Encouraging outdoor activities, exercise, and quality time with family can help mitigate these issues and foster a healthier lifestyle.  By promoting a more balanced approach to technology use, individuals can reap the benefits of both the digital world and the tangible experiences that life has to offer. Thank you for shedding light on this important topic and encouraging readers to consider the impact of excessive screen time on their daily lives.
1540	1544	1	3	People need to find a balance between their time on the computer and spending time with family and friends. It is important to prioritize activities that promote physical health and social well-being. Using the computer for productive tasks such as homework, research, and work is essential. By being mindful of how we use our time on the computer, we can lead a more fulfilling and balanced life.
1541	1545	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am aware that many people are stating that individuals spend too much time on computers and not getting enough exercise. However, I believe that the use of computers is beneficial in various ways. Firstly, engaging with computers enhances learning activities through games, puzzles, and access to information. This aids in personal development and success in life. Additionally, the use of computers positively impacts students, parents, and guardians by improving educational opportunities and job prospects. Moreover, individuals do get enough exercise as they engage in daily activities that involve movement, such as going to school or work. Therefore, the argument that people spend too much time on computers is not entirely accurate. Thank you for considering these points. Remember, even your job involves using a computer.
1542	1546	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, People all over the world use computers for various reasons, making them an essential part of our daily lives. The positive impact of computers on society is undeniable. They facilitate communication with distant family members, aid children in their studies, and support adults in their professional endeavors.  In today's interconnected world, maintaining contact with relatives who are far away can be challenging. Traditional methods like phone calls and letters are not always practical. However, with the advent of email and video calling services like Skype, staying in touch with loved ones has become easier and more cost-effective.  For students, computers play a crucial role in education. Whether it's typing up assignments, conducting research, or practicing language skills, computers offer a wealth of resources to enhance learning. They provide a platform for interactive learning experiences and access to a vast array of educational materials.  In the professional realm, computers are indispensable tools for various tasks, such as sending emails, creating presentations, and managing finances. Business professionals rely on computers to streamline their workflow and communicate effectively with colleagues and clients. Additionally, online platforms simplify processes like tax filing, making everyday tasks more efficient.  In conclusion, the positive influence of computers on individuals of all ages is evident. From facilitating communication to supporting academic and professional growth, computers have become an integral part of modern life. Their role in enhancing productivity and connectivity highlights the significant impact they have on society as a whole.
1543	1547	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  Today, I am writing to express my belief in the importance of people having access to computers, especially for those who may not have them. While some may argue that spending time online detracts from physical activity, I believe that computers offer valuable benefits such as teaching hand-eye coordination, providing the opportunity to learn, and facilitating connections within communities.  Firstly, computers are not just tools for entertainment; they can also help improve hand-eye coordination. Through activities like typing lessons or interactive games, individuals can enhance their motor skills and coordination. This is particularly beneficial for children, as they can develop these essential skills at a young age.  Secondly, computers give people the ability to explore different cultures and learn about the world around them. With a vast amount of information available online, individuals can broaden their knowledge and understanding of diverse topics. This can be especially helpful for those who may not have access to traditional educational resources.  Lastly, computers enable people to connect with others and stay informed about local and global events. Whether it's checking the news, communicating with friends and family, or participating in online communities, the internet provides a platform for social interaction and engagement. This connectivity is essential for building relationships and staying connected in an increasingly digital world.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is important for people to have access to computers and be online regularly. By utilizing these technological tools, individuals can enhance their skills, expand their knowledge, and engage with others in meaningful ways. Computers have become an integral part of modern society, and it is crucial that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from the opportunities they offer.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
1544	1548	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do have an effect on people because they provide a wide range of entertainment and educational opportunities. Computers allow individuals to play games, chat with friends, watch videos, and conduct research for school projects. They also offer access to information about important figures like @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1. While some may view exercise and spending time in nature as boring, these activities are essential for physical and mental well-being. Additionally, interacting with family members and enjoying the outdoors can create lasting memories and strengthen relationships. While technology is important in today's society, it is crucial to find a balance between screen time and other activities. Developing hand-eye coordination through computer use is beneficial, but it is equally important to engage in physical activities to maintain overall health. As individuals grow older, they can continue to benefit from technology by using it for educational and professional purposes. Teaching parents how to use computers can also be a rewarding experience that fosters intergenerational learning and connection. In conclusion, while technology offers many advantages, it is essential to maintain a healthy balance between screen time and other activities to ensure overall well-being and fulfillment.
1545	1549	1	3	To whomever this concern, @ORGANIZATION1, almost everyone has them. Computers can make it easier to find certain places by using search engines such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 they are also a way of communication. I believe people using computers does benifit society because scientists use computers every day, to make the plans to send a ship into space or to keep progress of an experiment. Computers help people stay organized. A lot of teens and kids use their computers to shop and stay in touch with friends. Some people belive people spend to much time on computers. That be true, but also remember what its doing for society. When people spend less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends its a personal choice. Its not like their being obliged by the @ORGANIZATION1.  In conclusion, while it is true that excessive computer usage can have negative impacts on personal well-being, the benefits of computers in society cannot be overlooked. From aiding in scientific advancements to facilitating communication and organization, computers play a crucial role in our modern world. It is essential to strike a balance between technology use and other aspects of life, but ultimately, the positive contributions of computers to society are undeniable.
1546	1550	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, some people may argue that computers do not benefit society, but I believe that they play a crucial role in our daily lives. Computers provide easy access to information through various websites, such as Google.com, allowing individuals to quickly find the information they need for projects or research. For those without easy access to resources like a library, computers enable them to complete tasks efficiently and on time. Additionally, computers help people stay connected with loved ones, especially those who may be far away or unable to communicate through traditional means. In the business world, companies utilize computers for advertising and communication, making it easier to reach a larger audience and attract business opportunities. Overall, computers have become an essential tool in modern society, facilitating communication, research, and business operations.
1547	1551	1	3	"Dear local newspaper- I understand that computers are becoming more of a ""must have"" in people's everyday life. I believe this is a great thing! If you're on the computer you type which helps improve people's hand-eye coordination. Also, you can learn more about people, places, cultures and much more. Lastly, you can communicate online with other friends or even meet new people.  To begin, I think having computers is a good idea because it helps people improve on their hand-eye coordination. My cousin @PERSON3, who is a big-time baseball player, used to have trouble catching the ball when he was younger. He kept trying over and over again and never gave up. Then, for his birthday, his parents bought him a computer! He was so excited, but when it came to typing papers, he wasn't the best. Not only did he practice baseball but also typing. His family realized that buying him that computer was one of the best ideas. It improved his baseball career (by throwing and catching the ball) and increased his grades in school. However, @PERSON3 is not the only one that has gained hand-eye coordination from computers. A recent study from Yale College shows that @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer for at least a month gain some sort of hand-eye coordination. @PERSON1, a teacher of the computer class at high school, states, ""@CAPS1 freshmen that I get in my class tells me that computers have made their sports careers easier because they now have better hand-eye coordination."" Computers have two things in one, you learn to type and help your hand-eye coordination. Do you want your child to be lacking that positive ability in life?  In addition, computers help you learn more about people, places, and cultures. I heard a couple of nights ago that @ORGANIZATION2 had an earthquake. I also learned about the power plant explosion in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. How do I know all of this you ask? The front page on @CAPS2.com! But, I'm not the only one who has gained this knowledge from the internet, so many more have too. @ORGANIZATION1 took a poll about how many @CAPS3 use the computer to do research and @PERCENT2 answered that they did. Does society really want to take away @CAPS3 knowledge of what's going on around us and our history?  In conclusion, people can communicate with friends and relatives. This is great if you haven't seen them recently, or if you want to just stay in touch. For example, @PERSON4, my cousin, just found me on Facebook. I haven't seen her for eight years, but now I talk to her all the time. We talk about visiting each other and how our families are doing. But, you can also talk to your friends too. Studies show that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS3 between the ages of eleven and eighteen talk to their friends over Facebook on a daily basis. Dr. @PERSON2, a teen psychiatrist, says, ""I think this is a great idea for @CAPS3 to communicate with other @CAPS3 through the computer. It gives them the chance to interact in a different way."" @CAPS3 have such a good lifestyle for them, do you want to feel guilty for ruining that?  Finally, people have perfect opportunities right in front of them. Computers help improve hand-eye coordination and help you learn. It also lets people interact with others in a different way. Do you think that these golden ideas are bad for our society?"
1548	1552	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I agree with experts who say that computers should be used because they are essential in today's world. People rely on computers for fast searches and communication. Having a computer at home is crucial because it allows quick access to information that may be needed for homework or work purposes. Even though some families prefer spending time together without the distraction of technology, the reality is that computers are becoming increasingly necessary for education and employment. For example, police officers use computers in their patrol cars to access important information quickly. While it is important to balance screen time with other activities, the benefits of having a computer far outweigh the drawbacks. In conclusion, computers have become a vital tool in our daily lives and are indispensable for the future. Thank you for considering my perspective.
1549	1553	1	3	Dear local newspaper, as the local newspaper, you have the power to express your views on the impact of computers on people. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on individuals as they enhance hand-eye coordination, provide access to information about distant places, and facilitate communication with others. A majority of people agree with this perspective.   Computers play a crucial role in improving hand-eye coordination through activities like typing and researching information. For instance, my grandmother attests to the benefits of using a computer in honing her skills. She credits her proficiency in hand-eye coordination to her daily computer usage, which requires focus and precision.   Moreover, computers offer a wealth of information on faraway locations, allowing individuals to broaden their knowledge and explore new horizons. Many individuals, including a professional quoted from a reputable organization, rely on computers to gather details for work and personal interests. While some may argue about the reliability of online information, finding reputable sources can provide accurate and valuable insights.  Additionally, computers enable people to connect with others globally through online communication tools like video chat. This feature has revolutionized the way individuals stay in touch with loved ones, especially those living far away. By simply having a computer with a camera, people can bridge distances and maintain relationships effectively.  In conclusion, the benefits of using computers extend beyond mere convenience. They enhance skills, provide access to diverse information, and facilitate meaningful connections with others. As the local newspaper, I urge you to acknowledge the positive impact of computers on people's lives and promote their constructive use. Embracing technology can lead to personal growth and enriching experiences for individuals worldwide.
1550	1554	1	3	Computers are not bad for you, as they offer various benefits that can enhance your life. Firstly, they help improve hand-eye coordination through activities like typing, which can translate into better skills in other areas. Secondly, computers provide access to information about places and people that you may not have known about otherwise, enriching your knowledge and understanding of the world. Lastly, computers enable communication with distant relatives and friends, allowing you to stay connected and maintain relationships despite physical distance. Overall, computers can be valuable tools that offer numerous advantages and opportunities for personal growth and connection.
1551	1555	1	3	Computer can be used for anyting but sometimes people use it for illeagle things like music some music site are a illeagle and sometimes thing off the internet. People meet over the internet can be sometimes dangerous because some people lye about there age or put fake pictures of them. Additionally, online scams and fraud are prevalent, with individuals falling victim to phishing schemes and identity theft. It is essential to exercise caution and skepticism when engaging in online activities to protect oneself from potential harm. Overall, while the internet offers a vast array of opportunities and convenience, it is crucial to be vigilant and discerning to avoid illegal or harmful situations.
1552	1556	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers play a huge role in society, but it is important to balance their use with other activities. Spending quality time with family is crucial for building strong relationships and creating lasting memories. Instead of being glued to a screen, engaging in outdoor activities like walking, running, or hiking can help improve physical health and mental well-being. Additionally, prioritizing school work and job responsibilities over excessive computer use is essential for personal growth and success. While computers can be useful tools, they should not consume all of our time. By finding a healthy balance and focusing on other important aspects of life, we can lead a more fulfilling and well-rounded lifestyle.
1553	1557	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  I believe that people are spending too much time on the computer, leading to negative impacts on their physical health and social relationships. One major issue is the decrease in physical activity due to sedentary computer use, which can result in weight gain and even depression. For instance, a local resident shared a tragic story of a family member who became depressed and ultimately took their own life after spending excessive time on the computer. Additionally, people are missing out on the enjoyment of nature and outdoor activities by choosing to stay indoors on their computers. Another resident recalled how their mother isolated herself in a dark room, neglecting the outdoors for months while glued to the computer screen.  These examples highlight the detrimental effects of excessive computer use on individuals' well-being and quality of life. It is crucial for us to recognize the importance of balancing screen time with physical activity, outdoor experiences, and meaningful interactions with family and friends. Let us not allow technology to consume our lives and hinder our overall health and happiness.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1554	1558	1	3	@PERCENT1 of all people in the @LOCATION3 have computers. This number shows how many people enjoy the technological advancement of the computer. It helps us communicate better, get information quicker, and entertain us. Computers have a very positive effect on us. With the invention of the computer, more and more people can communicate quicker and easier. For instance, say you wanted to talk to a friend in @LOCATION1, all you have to do is go on a social networking site and talk with them. Also, if you have relatives who live across the country, you could use a webcam to talk with them. When you can talk to people from around the world, you can learn a lot more about other countries' culture and other cities' way of life. Finally, if a relative is away, you can still talk to your uncle or grandma, and the relationship just gets better.  The internet and computers are a wealth of information. With all of the search engines on the internet, you can find out how tall a maple tree is or how to lose weight. Others say that sitting down and not moving while learning is bad, but you could search about family activities, nature walks, and new and exciting exercises. When students need information on a school project, they can go online and search for it instead of going to the library. As a result of the internet, people are smarter. Because of the internet, there is basically no more boredom. Kids and adults alike are not bored. Boredom is bad because kids will do anything to stop it. When the computer came, people could play games, watch movies and do business. If you missed your favorite TV show, you can go online and watch it. If you need to mail a letter to @LOCATION2, email comes into place, and your mail will never be slow. And finally, you can play many games on the internet to keep up with that eye-hand coordination.  With all of these exceptionally great things, we can all live in a happier, better world. There's information quicker, communication is better, and entertainment is better. All the searches we make are in a very good world.
1555	1559	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  I'm @PERSON1, @CAPS2 going to tell you some positives & negatives: The truth about computers. First, I'm going to tell you some positives about computers. The internet is a virtual world at your fingertips, providing answers to the smartest questions. Everything is easier with the internet; all you need to do is use a keyboard & mouse. Computers have evolved over the years, offering popular chatting websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. However, the internet also has a dark side.  Secondly, here are some dark secrets of the computer. There have been reports in the news of teenagers taking their lives due to cyberbullying. Tragic incidents of girls and boys ending their lives because of online harassment and societal pressure have been on the rise. In a world where everyone is judged by their online presence, the consequences can be devastating.  In conclusion, computers have both positive and negative aspects. We must be cautious and aware of the potential dangers that come with the convenience of technology. It is essential to use the internet responsibly and prioritize mental well-being in the digital age.  Sincerely, @PERSON1
1556	1560	1	3	Dear newspaper, do you want people to be so mesmerized by computers that they miss out on the world around them? Do you want the kids in our community to spend hours each day on computers playing games while they could be outside getting fresh air? The question of whether computers have good or bad effects on people is a crucial one. The obvious answer is bad effects.  People who constantly use computers develop bad habits and may search for inappropriate things. If individuals are always engrossed in games on computers, they are less likely to go out for a jog. This lack of physical activity contributes to the obesity issue we see in many people in our community. Computers are not helping this situation at all. People who spend too much time on computers often neglect exercise, leading to detrimental health consequences.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can lead to the formation of bad habits. For instance, kids may start using improper grammar and writing styles from spending too much time on websites. Additionally, there are platforms where personal information can be easily shared, making it a playground for potential dangers like strangers accessing private details.  Lastly, the ease of accessing inappropriate content on the internet is a significant concern. Curiosity, especially among children, may lead to the exploration of unsuitable material without supervision. Parents may not always be aware of their children's online activities, allowing them to continue engaging in inappropriate searches.  In conclusion, computers have a predominantly negative impact on individuals, encouraging bad habits, limiting physical activity, and exposing users to inappropriate content. It is crucial to limit computer usage and monitor online activities to ensure a healthier and safer environment for all.
1557	1561	1	3	Dear Local Community,   I believe that computers are detrimental to our well-being. Instead of spending time on screens, we should prioritize outdoor activities like exercise. Excessive screen time not only affects our physical health but also hinders our ability to connect with friends and family. Furthermore, the dangers of online interactions cannot be overlooked. It is crucial to limit our dependence on computers and focus on more meaningful and fulfilling activities. Let's make a conscious effort to reduce our screen time and engage in real-life experiences for a happier and healthier lifestyle.   Sincerely,   [Your Name]
1558	1562	1	3	The importance of computers in the modern world cannot be overstated.

1559	1563	1	3	Computers are an essential part of our daily lives, but experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on them. As a teenager, I understand the importance of managing your time on the computer wisely. While I love using computers, I also recognize the value of spending time outdoors and engaging in physical activities. Instead of sitting in front of a screen for hours on end, I make sure to balance my time by enjoying activities like playing basketball, running, going to the park, or exploring new places.  Friends and family also play a crucial role in providing entertainment and social interaction. I have a close-knit group of friends whom I enjoy spending time with, whether it's hanging out at the mall or engaging in fun outdoor activities. Rather than isolating myself with a computer, I prioritize building meaningful connections with the people around me.  Ultimately, it's essential to strike a balance between technology use and real-life experiences. By stepping away from the computer and embracing the outdoors, social interactions, and physical activities, we can lead a more fulfilling and well-rounded life. So, take a break from the screen and go outside to enjoy some fun in the sun today!
1560	1564	1	3	I disagree with the notion that computers have a positive effect on people. While they may teach hand-eye coordination, they also contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, leading to obesity and health issues. In fact, a significant percentage of the population is obese, with some individuals dying each year due to being overweight. It is important to prioritize physical activity and experience the beauty of nature instead of spending excessive time on computers. Social media platforms like Myspace and Facebook can also pose dangers, with online predators targeting unsuspecting individuals. It is crucial to interact with friends and make new connections in person to truly get to know them. Using computers for meaningful purposes and avoiding unnecessary risks is essential for staying safe and healthy. Remember, excessive computer use can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental well-being, so it's important to strike a balance and prioritize real-life experiences.
1561	1565	1	3	Dear local newspaper people,  Computers have played a significant role in helping our planet in various ways. They have reduced the need for us to drive our cars for simple tasks, making our lives more convenient and helping to decrease pollution in the atmosphere. Learning has become easier for everyone with the assistance of computers, as they provide access to vast amounts of information and educational resources.   Additionally, computers have revolutionized communication, allowing us to connect with people around the world instantly.

1563	1567	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, offering numerous benefits across various aspects. Engineers are constantly working to enhance the popularity of technological devices, which play a crucial role in communication, relaxation, education, economy, and entertainment.

For instance, in many schools, including the one I attend, computers are extensively utilized for research, completing assignments, and organizing files. This not only saves time and resources for students but also aids teachers in managing their workload more efficiently.  Moreover, computers have a significant impact on the economy. With a wide range of affordable options available, more people can now access computers for various purposes.

1564	1568	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that excessive computer usage is having negative effects on people's lives. Instead of engaging in physical activities and enjoying the outdoors, many individuals spend their time indoors on the computer, playing games or chatting with friends. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to health issues such as weight gain and diabetes. To combat these issues, I recommend incorporating regular exercise into your routine and spending time outdoors with friends or family. Not only will you benefit from the physical activity and fresh air, but you will also strengthen your relationships and improve your overall well-being. By making these changes, you can boost your self-esteem, increase your energy levels, and combat feelings of loneliness or depression. Take control of your life, prioritize your health, and start enjoying all the benefits that an active lifestyle has to offer.
1565	1569	1	3	The impact of computers on individuals, especially children, is a cause for concern. Excessive use of computers can lead to eye strain and addiction. People are spending too much time on computers, neglecting their relationships with family and friends. It is important to set limits on computer usage to prevent negative effects on one's health and social life. Balancing computer time with real-life interactions is crucial for overall well-being. It is essential for people to recognize the potential harm that excessive computer use can cause and take steps to find a healthy balance in their daily lives.
1566	1570	1	3	Yes, I believe that computers benefit society because they facilitate communication, enhance learning, and play a crucial role in today's technological advancements. Computers have revolutionized the way we access information and connect with others. They serve as valuable tools for education, research, and communication. With the internet, individuals can easily find information on various topics, connect with people from different parts of the world, and stay in touch with loved ones. Additionally, computers have made tasks such as typing, editing, and sharing documents much more efficient and convenient. The evolution of technology, including smartphones and tablets, has further expanded the accessibility and functionality of computers in our daily lives. In conclusion, computers have greatly contributed to the progress of society by enabling us to learn, communicate, and adapt to the ever-changing digital landscape.
1567	1571	1	3	In my own opinion, I think that people should not spend too much time on computers and instead focus on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. When individuals are glued to their screens, they miss out on valuable experiences such as going to the park or spending quality time with loved ones. However, I also acknowledge the importance of computers in staying connected, especially when traveling to faraway places where communication is essential. Planning trips, events, or simply staying in touch with others can be made easier through the use of computers. Furthermore, computers can be a valuable tool in organizing special occasions like birthday parties or visits to distant locations. Overall, while it is important to limit screen time and prioritize real-life interactions, computers can still play a significant role in enhancing communication and planning various activities.
1568	1572	1	3	Dear to @CAPS1 this @MONTH1 concern, Computers do a whole lot now of days. You can play games, do homework, socialize but don't you think there are better things than that. Such as exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and most importantly interacting with family and friends. These are all the things that computers take away from people. Once you get onto a computer you never want to get off. If you look at it, it doesn't take much work and energy to use a computer. So if you eat and use the computer all day your not really burning any calories therefore you will gain weight. Computers make people feel lazy sometimes therefore they spend less time exercising. That is not good for your health at all. Exercising gives you energy and is good for you. Have you ever looked out the window and saw how beautiful nature is? When your on the computer chit-chatting with people and playing online friends do you think about what your missing. Everytime I use the computer I wish I could be outside playing and enjoying nature. Trees, flowers, plants, grass and lots of other things are what make up the earth, but some people don't apreciate those things. So next time your on the computer think about that. While your on the computer wasting time there is another homeless child wandering maybe looking for their family. Would you like to be that child who doesnt have a family or any type of friends? Lots of people think of their life without a family but it can happen anyday. So I believe instead of wasting time on the computer we should go and interact with family and friends. Even if its just having a conversation do it, maybe it can show them that you really care. In conclusion, I think that computers are a waste of time. I understand how people say it is used to comunicate with people but back then they didnt have computers and they communicated so we can to. Computes make you spend less time exercising, keeps you from enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family and friends. You won't go wrong if you listen to someone who uses a computer everyday.  Additionally, spending too much time on computers can lead to various health issues such as eye strain, poor posture, and even addiction. It's important to find a balance between using technology and engaging in physical activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle. So, next time you reach for your computer, consider taking a break and spending time outdoors or with loved ones. It will not only benefit your health but also enrich your life in ways that a screen cannot.
1569	1573	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 are you? As for me, I am fine. I am writing to express why I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. One reason is that computers allow individuals to connect with friends and family members from distant locations. For instance, if someone has relatives living in a different country, they can easily communicate with them through the internet. This enables people to maintain strong relationships regardless of physical distance.  Additionally, computers facilitate learning about various parts of the world. By conducting research online, individuals can expand their knowledge about different cultures, traditions, and geographical locations. This not only broadens their horizons but also promotes a greater understanding and appreciation of global diversity.  Moreover, computers play a crucial role in helping individuals navigate through life's challenges. Whether it is seeking advice on moral dilemmas or finding practical solutions to everyday problems, the internet serves as a valuable resource. For example, if someone is unsure about a certain topic, they can quickly look up information online to gain clarity and insight.  In conclusion, the ability to connect with loved ones, learn about the world, and find guidance in various aspects of life are compelling reasons to believe that computers have a positive influence on people. I urge you to consider the benefits of technology in enhancing communication, knowledge acquisition, and personal growth. Embracing the positive impact of computers can truly enrich our lives.
1570	1574	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2, I have recently learned that the paper has decided to write about computers and how they benefit society in @LOCATION1. I am writing this letter to express my agreement with the positive impact of computers on society. One key benefit is that computers facilitate education and learning. They provide quick access to information through educational websites like @ORGANIZATION1, making studying and research more efficient. Additionally, computers aid in completing homework and assignments, saving time and increasing productivity. I recall a time when I had to write a last-minute essay and using a computer made the task much quicker than handwriting it.   Moreover, computers contribute to the development of hand-eye coordination, which is essential for various activities. Online resources, such as videos on yoga and sports, help individuals improve their coordination skills. For instance, tutorials on yoga can be accessed online, enabling individuals to reduce stress and enhance their coordination. Similarly, sports enthusiasts can benefit from online videos that demonstrate techniques and strategies for different sports, enhancing their coordination abilities.  Furthermore, computers enable people to connect with others and maintain relationships through online platforms like @CAPS2-@CAPS3. Social networking sites like Myspace allow individuals to communicate with friends and family, fostering social connections. Additionally, online dating platforms provide opportunities for individuals to meet new people and potentially form romantic relationships, all from the comfort of their own homes.  In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in society by facilitating education, improving hand-eye coordination, and enabling communication with others. Their impact is vast and beneficial, making them an essential tool in today's world. As technology continues to advance, the positive effects of computers on society are likely to grow even further.
1571	1575	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you to talk about the effect computers have on people. Since I have two computers and one laptop I have to agree that every person who likes to look up stuff should have a computer. Everyone should have computers, because you can look up different things, you can play games like checkers with the computer or against somebody else, and the last reason is that you can chat with people from different states and even countries, because I know everybody likes to talk to one another. Everyone should have computers, because you can search different things. You can search places and people. Basically, you can search anything on the internet if you are on the right website. One time I wanted to go on the web and look to see if there was a restaurant in my town. I went to ask.com and typed in ""is there a restaurant in my town, City? It said yes, and then it showed me a lot of information about it. It told me the address, the phone number, and the name of the manager. Looking up places is sometimes very helpful. Everyone should have a computer because you can play any types of game. You could play internet games like checkers, solitaire, and even freecell. If you don't have any types of games you can always go on gaming websites. Since I use the computer every day, I try out all kinds of games. When I was six years old, we found a driving game online. Since I did not know the website, all I got to play was checkers on the computer, but one day I logged onto it and played my first driving computer game. Everyone should have a computer, because you can chat with people. Instead of always using your phone calling and texting people and raising your phone bill, why not use your computer and chat all you want without wasting minutes on your cell phone. I know everybody likes to talk and text on their cell phones. Instead of doing that, just go on the internet, find a chat room, and start chatting or blogging with your friends. One time I ran out of minutes on my phone and I didn't have internet. I asked my dad if I could use the computer. He said yes, so I went to a local chat room on the internet. My friend had an account there so it would be easy for us to talk all we wanted. I joined in and we chatted until late at night. In conclusion, I think everyone that likes to look up places, play games, and chat should have a computer."

While some may argue that computers are a waste of time, they actually offer numerous benefits. For example, computers can help individuals with tasks such as writing papers for school, playing educational games, and conducting research on the internet. Additionally, computers have features like keyboards and grammar checks that can make tasks more efficient and accurate. Overall, computers are not only helpful but also essential in today's fast-paced world.
1573	1577	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people have used computers to learn new things, such as cultures, which has had a positive impact on society. Computers have changed the way people think and view the world, influencing their behavior at home and in public. Additionally, computers have helped special needs individuals learn how to read and spell, contributing to their education and development. Many individuals have utilized computers to explore different cultures, promoting understanding and diversity in society. While some argue that computers have led to a decrease in physical activity, it is important to note that computers are also used to access information on healthy diets and exercise routines, helping people maintain their fitness and overall well-being. In today's fast-paced world, computers play a crucial role in keeping people informed and connected with the global community. The impact of computers is significant, shaping not only society but also the world as a whole.
1574	1578	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1,  I believe that while computers have brought many benefits to society, they also pose certain problems. One issue is computer addiction, where individuals spend hours in a dark room glued to their screens. This addiction can lead to various health problems, including obesity, which is a growing concern in @LOCATION2. Approximately @PERCENT1 of our youth are becoming computer junkies, spending countless hours online without any physical activity.  I have personally witnessed the effects of computer addiction on my own brother, who spends hours watching anime and neglects his health. This behavior is alarming and needs to be addressed. Moreover, online food delivery services make it easier for people to indulge in unhealthy eating habits, contributing to the obesity epidemic in our society. Popular fast-food chains like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and @LOCATION3 jade are part of the problem, enabling individuals to order food without leaving their homes.  While computers are valuable tools for learning and communication, excessive use can lead to detrimental consequences. It is crucial to raise awareness about the dangers of computer addiction and promote a balanced lifestyle that includes physical activity and healthy eating habits. By addressing these issues, we can help prevent further harm to our youth and society as a whole.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
1575	1579	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers do have a positive effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also family that live far away, they also allow you to do any kind of work that can't be done by hand and even allow people to learn about far away places and people. First of all, computers have a positive effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also families that live far away. For example half of my family live in @LOCATION1 and my mom uses the internet to communicate with them. Secondly, computers have a positive effect on people. They allow you to do homework that can't be done by hand. Such as essays that have to be typed and can't be handwritten, and projects for school. Lastly, computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I first came into this country, I didn't know much about it, so I did some research and learned great things about it. In conclusion, computers have an effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online not just your friends but also families that live far away, they also allow you to do any kind of work that can't be done by hand, and even allow people to learn about faraway places and people.
1576	1580	1	3	Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am a @ORGANIZATION2 student and I hear that some people think it is good to use computers and others think that it's a waste of time. Well, I have @NUM1 good reasons as to why computers are good technology. One reason is you can book places that you want to go or the sights you want to see. This is a good way to use the computer because you can track your route; you can even print a map and go hiking. Another reason why computers are good to use is because of online chats. Let's say that you have a family member that lives all the way out in @LOCATION1 and they have a computer and you want to talk to them but it costs you to talk, you can e-mail. This is a good way to use the computer because you can stay updated on what is going on with your family members. Another reason is learning. You can learn about many different cultures. You can learn about different people and how they live their life and their cultures. My last reason is the @CAPS1. This is a great way to use the computer because you can keep updated on the latest things like the earthquake in Haiti; or a hurricane or a @CAPS1 breaking story. Or if there is a storm headed your way. In conclusion, using the computer has great ways to be used, and sure people put some bad sites out there, but if you use it the right way, it is a good source of technology!
1577	1581	1	3	Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on computers, and I believe that they are correct. Most individuals prefer to be on the computer chatting with friends online or spending hours on social media platforms. However, this excessive screen time is detrimental to physical health and social relationships.  Spending an excessive amount of time on the computer leads to a sedentary lifestyle, which can result in weight gain and health issues. It is essential to balance screen time with physical activities like exercising, playing sports, or simply taking a walk outdoors. Engaging in these activities not only promotes physical well-being but also allows individuals to appreciate the beauty of nature that surrounds them.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can also lead to a lack of quality time spent with family and friends. It is crucial to prioritize face-to-face interactions and create lasting memories with loved ones. Building strong relationships with family and friends provides emotional support and enhances overall well-being.  While technology has its benefits, it is important not to let it overshadow the essential aspects of life such as physical health, nature, and relationships. Finding a balance between technology use and other meaningful activities is key to leading a fulfilling and healthy lifestyle. It is time to disconnect from the virtual world and reconnect with the real world around us.
1578	1582	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I wholeheartedly agree that computers bring immense benefits to society. The ability to easily interact with others online, find entertainment, and access valuable information makes computers indispensable in today's world. For example, social media platforms like Facebook allow people to connect with friends and family regardless of their physical location, fostering relationships and communication. Moreover, the vast array of online content available, from videos to articles, ensures that there is always something to watch or read for entertainment or education. Additionally, computers provide a convenient and efficient way to study or work on projects, with search engines like Google offering a wealth of information at our fingertips. The profitability of companies like Google further underscores the economic benefits that computers bring to society. In conclusion, the multifaceted advantages of computers in enhancing communication, entertainment, productivity, and economic growth make them an invaluable asset for the betterment of society. Thank you for considering these points.
1579	1583	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think it's a good thing that people spend so much time on computers. One reason for this is when you type you learn hand-eye coordination. Another reason computer time is a good time could be is it saves money on other things. The last reason is because you can do things in seconds on a computer that would normally take hours.  Hand-eye coordination is an important thing: for example you're walking down the street when a baseball flies at you, you're able to catch it because all the time you have been on the computer has taught you hand-eye coordination. There are lots of ways to get it, like playing sports, writing, or just playing with your thumbs, but learning to type is by far the best way because you'll use the skill while you're a kid and an adult.  Trouble paying your phone bill? Guess what, you don't need a phone. Why not use your computer to call people since it's free? Also, you won't really need a cell phone because you can do everything that it can do quicker on a computer anyway. Lastly, it's harder for people to steal or for you to lose a computer compared to a cell phone.  Have you ever gotten upset when trying to look for a piece of information in a book? Well, you can be done with hours of looking if you just use a computer, then you can get outside and play games. Most of the time it takes me hours to do my homework, but if I had a computer, it probably would only take me minutes to do it.  So, for hand-eye coordination, having trouble with bills, and it taking too long to look things up by other means, I think it's good that people spend time on computers, and I hope you agree.
1580	1584	1	3	Alot of people have different ideas on if they believe computers benefit society. I for one believe that computer are useful for many things. The first reason why I believe this, is because one a lot of schools will need them for students, to do projects. Second they have computer gamed to help kids learn. Third I believe its a good way to just relax. The first reason why believe computers are good is because many kids in school will need them. In school we have a lot of projects that we might need type or get a picture. If we didn't have computers there would be no way we could do that. Also if we do persuassive waiting pieces. We would need a computer to type it to make it looks better. Many people might say we could all just write it out. But I believe that typing it might be faster and neater for some people. The second reason why I believe computers are good is because they have many good games to help people I know that have many different games text not readable Computers are good is because it's a a good way to relax. Aint of people get home from work or and are very tired. But instead of just going and sitting on the couch for the whole night you could go to the computer and do a fun game for a little while. Many people say that watching tv and going on the computer is the same things. But if you play an educational game once in a while it might be ok. But then you can do something fun on the computer every so often. In conclusion I believe computers are good because one many kids need them for school second they have a lot of educational games. its a good way to relax.
1581	1585	1	3	Do the members of this well-known and captivating newspaper think that the effects of people owning a computer are good or bad? Well, if you think negatively about computers and how they affect people, I would like to politely disagree. I'm certain I could sway you to agree with me too. Computers are positive for many reasons. The internet and other resources can be used for school, work, and other questions, the computer gives people something to do when otherwise they have nothing, and it allows people to talk to others online. There are many great effects computers have on and for people. Everybody has questions, wouldn't you agree? And more often than not, people don't know the answer right off the top of their head. Research is the key to answering questions. But who has time to go to the library and spend hours searching for an answer that would take a matter of seconds to find on the computer? Not every student, employee, or other person can spend that time looking for an answer. There are far too many other things to do! The internet on the computer allows people to find an answer quickly. This can actually improve people's knowledge, and their performance at work or school. You can see here the positive effects of a computer. Have any of you ever been bored? I'm certain that you have. Everyone gets bored. Instead of sitting around doing nothing, people can go on the computer and to many activities. Contrary to some people's beliefs, this can be an excellent way to spend, not waste time. There are all sorts of educational games and mind-boggling puzzles to do on the computer. I'm certain you can see how much better these things are than sitting in front of the. The effects are positive, because your brain is challenged, and your boredom has vanished. Also, hand-eye coordination can be greatly improved by doing activities. These are so many positivities about the computers effect on people's boredom! People have friends, and it is only human to want to keep in close contact with them. But what if a close friend moves away? You don't want to lose that friendship right? People can write letters to each other, but that can be time-consuming, and show to delivery and response. And the positive effect of a computer is it allows you to keep in contact online with friends and family instant messaging and email, both great resources for talking with others. Computers can keep friends together and save families from drifting apart. It is also good for couples or parents to keep in touch with their partner or children if they are away. These are all positive effects don't you agree? As you can see, I feel strongly that the computer has positive effects on people. It's good for research, it's something to do when someone is truly bored, and it enables friends and family to stay close via online communication. I strongly urge you to change your opinion from negative to positive about the effects of computers. Everyone can choose their own opinions. but I know you'll prove wise and agree with me!
1582	1586	1	3	Dear Newspaper People,  People should use less time on the computer because it affects their lifestyle. Instead of being glued to their screens, they should prioritize activities that promote physical well-being, social connections, and environmental consciousness.  Firstly, excessive computer use can contribute to obesity due to sedentary behavior. By allocating time for exercise, individuals can combat this trend and improve their overall health. Even a simple walk can make a significant difference in reducing laziness and promoting physical activity.  Additionally, spending time in nature rather than in front of a screen can foster a greater appreciation for the environment. By going green, recycling, and minimizing electronic consumption, individuals can contribute to a greener Earth. This shift in focus can lead to a more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle.  Lastly, prioritizing quality time with family and friends over computer usage can strengthen relationships and enhance social connections. Building stronger bonds with loved ones can bring joy and fulfillment that cannot be found on the internet.  In conclusion, by reducing computer usage and focusing on exercise, nature, and social interactions, individuals can lead healthier, more balanced lives. It is essential to break away from the digital world and embrace the beauty of the real world around us. Let us strive for a harmonious existence that prioritizes well-being, relationships, and environmental stewardship.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1583	1587	1	3	Dear editor, I think that people are spending too much time on the computer. Because of this, people are getting less exercise, they are not spending enough time outdoors, and they don't spend as much time with their family and friends. Exercising is an important part of one's daily schedule. I have a friend who exercises every day. She is the healthiest person I know and rarely spends any time on the computer. But, she knows someone who is almost her complete opposite. He hardly ever exercises and spends hours on the computer each day. He has also been diagnosed with diabetes and is obese. These are the type of health problems that are faced because of lack of exercise and too much computer time. Experts say that people should get at least 30 minutes of exercise every day. But, because more and more people are spending time on computers, this is almost impossible. Studies done at a reputable organization show that 25% of kids under the age of 18 are obese or at the risk of becoming obese because they are not getting enough exercise. You don't want that number to increase, do you? There are other problems that people face because of too much time on the computer. People are spending less time outdoors and more time inside at a desk. My friend spends way too much time on her computer and not enough outside. She failed a science project because she was on her computer, rather than outside comparing the leaves from different trees. Doctor is a child psychologist and when he asked kids if they would rather play outside or be on a computer, 40% of them said computer. This shows that people on computers are not only young, but they want to be on the computer more than be outside. This is a number that, in my opinion, is too high. Lastly, there is the problem of people not spending enough time with their family and friends. By this I mean face to face time, not just video chatting with your friends on Facebook. This has caused tension in relationships. My friend didn't go to her family reunion but stayed at home on the computer, and at the next family get-together, she was ostracized because she didn't go to the reunion. High school guidance counselor says that 80% out of 90% friendships are ruined because kids don't spend enough face-to-face time with their friends but are on the computer. These are all good reasons why less time on the computer and more time exercising, outside, and with family and friends will make your life happier and healthier.
1584	1588	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 of The Local Newspaper: @CAPS2 students are promoted to higher grade levels, more teachers will require research papers. In my opinion @CAPS10 a computer helps me complete my research paper and the contents in it are the best it can be. What makes students and parents more happy to see @CAPS3's on their child's paper? Advances in technology. there should be advances in technology because they teach hand-eye coordination, it gives the ability to learn about far away places, and people, and even allows people to talk online with other people. To begin there should be advances in technology beacause it teaches hand-eye coordination. In a recent poll seen in TIME magazine, it showed that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers had a large increase in their coordination, people were not @CAPS2 clumsy and poorly coordinated. @PERSON1, a professional tennis player @CAPS4 that, ""@CAPS5 I started using a computer, I always, would play tennis for living and it was a bad choice because I was poorly coordinated. I always missed the tennis ball in matches. So I decided to stop. Then I started to use the computer more and my coordination improved. Now I barely miss any tennis balls."" @CAPS6, @CAPS10 advances in technology will improve and teach hand-eye coordination. Another reason there should be advances in technology is because it gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. @PERSON2 @CAPS7 a writer from @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 that, ""People like to research a place @CAPS5 they go on vacation or a buisness trip because they would like to know more about it."" Not knowing anything about your vacation destination is like not knowing what's for dinner tonight, it is clearly unreasonable. Recent studies show that the more a person knows about their vacation destination the more enjoyable it is. Thus, the more vacations they go one which is profitable for airplane companies. Also knowing about the different cultures of the people in far away places gives people a better perspective of the world they live in. Thus, @CAPS10 advances in technology will give the ability to learn about far away places and people. Furthermore, @CAPS10 advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people. @PERSON3 @CAPS8 the creator of @CAPS9 @CAPS4 that, ""@CAPS10 online chat programs will help people communicate with each other. @CAPS9 has been beneficial to everybody. For example, it helps people re-connect with their former friends. It is also very beneficial to students because if they forget a homework assignment they can log onto @CAPS9 and ask a classmate."" A recent article found on @ORGANIZATION2, showed that online chat programs helped people communicate with each other. @CAPS6, @CAPS10 advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people. In conclusion, @CAPS10 advances in technology will improve hand-eye coordination, teach people about far away places and people, and allows people to talk online with other people. When voting on this decision please take part and support advances in technology, it will be beneficial to everybody. Thank you for your time."
1585	1589	1	3	Dear editors of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 morning, my sister wakes me up to go to school. She uses her cell phone to set an alarm. A few years ago, my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up. Now, we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work. Most everyone has cellphone now, and it does much more than allow people to talk to one another from two different places. Now we can play games, go on the internet, and access a wealth of information. These advances in technology are making us very selfish. I, for one, do not approve. For starters, all of these new and improved gadgets are time-consuming. With all the things to do in the world, we could all be doing something helpful, fun, or productive. Don't you agree? I mean, if you consider the idea that we all could be hitting the gym or studying for school tests and quizzes, then most teenagers would be in much better shape, physically and mentally, as my aunt and former physicist, @PERSON1, mentioned. The rate at which most students and kids are growing increasingly more obese because of these new ideas involving phones and iPods is completely sickening. The more time we spend using these items, the more we oppose the idea of being active. You can clearly see how we are growing less energetic and much more careless of our time. Furthermore, the advances in today's society are pushing the boundaries of internet safety. Sure, people might claim that they can block out others, but sometimes when someone posts something on the web, they don't always hide it well enough. This lack of caution could lead to dangerous situations, as happened to one of my cousins last year. The police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence through a chain of blackmails. Do you see how important it is to spend less time on these devices that can lead us down risky paths? They can suck us into a virtual world that is sometimes violent or aggressive. My brother even learned swearing from a new and advanced fighting game. It's essential for us to limit our screen time and focus on real-life activities that will benefit us in the long run. I implore your company to consider these points and advocate for a more balanced approach to technology usage. Thank you for your valuable time and effort.
1586	1590	1	3	Dear Local Community,  I'm sitting on the couch contemplating my vacation plans, particularly wanting to indulge in some creative writing. However, my scattered notebooks and lack of organization are hindering my progress. As I glance around at the chaos of my room, I spot my solution on the highest shelf - my laptop.  Computers, especially laptops, have proven to be incredibly beneficial for those who use them regularly. They have three fantastic effects on users. Firstly, they facilitate communication and productivity, allowing individuals to easily connect with others through email and online platforms. This saves time and money, making interactions more efficient.  Secondly, computers aid in organization, which is crucial for someone like me with a multitude of notebooks and writing projects. A laptop can store vast amounts of data, making editing and managing information a breeze. This level of organization is essential for writers or anyone dealing with a large volume of content.  Lastly, computers serve as a vast resource of information, similar to a library but with the convenience of instant access. Reliable websites provide valuable and factual information, contributing to the user's knowledge and intelligence.  In conclusion, the benefits of using computers, particularly laptops, are undeniable. From enhancing communication and organization to expanding knowledge, computers play a vital role in our daily lives. As I embark on my vacation, I am grateful for the convenience and efficiency that my laptop provides for my creative writing endeavors.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1587	1591	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that you have asked people to tell their opinions on the effects computers have on people. In my opinion computers do not have a good effect. The reason I think that is because kids are on the computer instead of doing their homework, people do not exercise as much because they are always on the computer and they do not spend as much time with their family and friends, @CAPS2 are many kids that go on the computer all night and never get to doing their homework. I read an article that said, ""Computers are the number one problem for kids not doing their homework."" People get @CAPS4 distracted on the computer that they never end up doing anything else. Eight out of ten kids say that they sometimes don't do their homework because they get distracted on the computer. I interviewed a student in the @NUM1 grade and she said, ""@CAPS3 class inastly gets all homework done but sometimes we forget when we are on the computer. That is really the only reason we don't do @CAPS1."" @CAPS4 computers are not a very good electronic if kids are not getting their homework done because of @CAPS1. But that is not the only bad thing about them. Since people are always on computers they don't get out and exercise as much. Instead they sit and play games on a computer. I found this quote in an article I was reading ""@CAPS5 since I started spending a lot of time on the computer I have gained weight because I am not out exercising,"" Exercising and going outside is a very important things to do but people cannot do @CAPS1 if they are always on the computer. Nine out of ten people say that @CAPS5 since they started going on the computer a lot, they have not gone outside or exercised in a while. I interviewed a women and she said, ""I had to not go on the computer for a while because I realized that @CAPS1 was not good for me and I needed exercise."" People get @CAPS4 distracted on computers that they never go outside to exercise anymore. @CAPS2 are still some reasons why computers are not very good. Spending time with your family and friends is a very important thing to do, but with computers people to not do @CAPS1 that much anymore. In a magazine I read @CAPS1 said, ""People are not spending time with their friends and family because they are on the computer instant messaging."" Computers are keeping people from spending time together. Nine out of ten families say that they have realized they don't spent as much time together because of computers. I interviewed some kids and said, "" I don't spend a lot of time with family or friends. I am mostly on the computer instant messaging."" Computers are definitely not a good thing for families. Those are the reasons why I think computers do not have a good effect on people. Kids are on the computer and don't do their homework, people do not exercise as much and they don't spend as much time with family or friends."
1588	1592	1	3	The computers are indeed cool, and one website that stands out is @NUM1.com. However, there is a need to improve the loading time of the website. Despite this, the love for computers remains strong. Additionally, there is a call to make more environmentally friendly computers, such as the ones found on @NUM2. These green computers are essential for a sustainable future in technology.
1589	1593	1	3	As people around the world continue to rely more on computers, the positive impact of this technology becomes increasingly evident. Beyond entertainment, computers offer numerous benefits such as improving hand-eye coordination, providing access to information about distant places and cultures, and facilitating online communication with friends and family. Computers are valuable tools for education, allowing individuals of all ages to learn and explore a wide range of topics. By accessing reliable websites, users can expand their knowledge and gain insights into unfamiliar subjects. Additionally, practicing typing on a keyboard can enhance hand-eye coordination skills, promoting better dexterity and efficiency. For individuals restricted from using expensive communication devices like phones, computers offer a cost-effective alternative for staying connected with loved ones through various online platforms such as instant messaging and social media. Overall, computers have become indispensable in modern households, offering a multitude of benefits that extend beyond mere entertainment.
1590	1594	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. I came to disagree computers make our lives so much easier. We can talk to people that we have not seen in a while, we can read/see other places we thought we would never know about; And instead of having to handwrite that book we can type it up. I find these are reasons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people. Imagine you are on Facebook and you type in your best friend from high school's name, she pops up and you are connected. The next day she is on, happy you are connected. That's the kind of thing that happens every day, people reconnect, this not only happens on Facebook, but all over the internet! Reconnecting with friends and family, talking to your boss on the next door you can even send a picture of your newborn baby to your mother who lives in @CAPS2. Having computers really allows us to reconnect to those we have lost. Other are very important. But what if we know nothing about other cultures then what would life be like with computers we can instantly learn about other unlike having to go to the ad you have to do is type in the place and pick the size you want to look at all with using computers. @LOCATION1 ago people would have to write out everything word by word letter by letter. Not with computers. So don't worry about that @NUM1-page paper, you can just type it and with some software, you can even have your paper edited right on the spot. This is great for not only school, children but adults too. That dissertation proposal can be done quickly and easily with computers. Many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. But with advancing technology, life gets easier, and this gives more time for other things. There is no bad effect of computers. The effect is just helpfulness. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on our lives by facilitating communication, knowledge acquisition, and productivity.
1591	1595	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is they help make everyday life easier. First off, you can chat with people from long distances. Also, it makes homework and finding information a lot easier as well. Last but not least, when you have nothing else to do, you can play games and watch videos online. One of the best things about computers is going online and chatting with friends. Even if they are across the country, you can still chat with them for free! Also, if you can't get in touch with them, you can send them an e-mail, and as soon as they log on, they will get your message. Best of all, when you forget to write your homework down, you can go online and ask one of your friends what it was. Besides talking to people, you can do your homework on a computer as well. All you have to do is make a word document and type with the keys. Let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil. Not to mention, typing a paper is a lot neater. Also, if you are doing a report on something, all you have to do is look it up on the internet, and you'll get endless information about it, all on your computer! Last but not least, you can play games on your computer. Whenever someone is bored doing nothing they can just turn on a computer and play their favorite game. Not only is it fun, but it teaches hand-eye coordination as well. Some people say they don't have the money for games, but little do they know, there are millions of free online games that any age can play. This is great on a boring day when you have nothing else to do. In summary, the effects computers have on people is they help make everyday life easier. You can chat with people from long distances, and it even makes homework much easier to complete. Not to mention it has fun games for people to play when they're bored or have nothing to do. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people because of all the things they offer and help us with. Thank you.
1592	1596	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers have had a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, provide the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and allow individuals to communicate online with others. More individuals should recognize the benefits of computers in our lives.  Spending time on a computer can greatly enhance hand-eye coordination skills. It also helps individuals to learn how to type quickly, a crucial skill for many jobs. Schools often include typing classes to help students develop this important skill. Furthermore, using a computer requires hand-eye coordination as individuals need to keep their eyes on the screen and use their hands to navigate and interact with the device.  Computers offer the opportunity to explore and learn about distant places and different cultures. Through the internet, individuals can access images and information about important cities and landmarks worldwide. This can broaden one's horizons and foster a better understanding of the world we live in.  Moreover, computers enable people to connect with others online, regardless of their location. Social media platforms, email, and messaging apps allow for communication and interaction with friends, family, and even strangers from around the globe. This can lead to meaningful relationships and the exchange of ideas and experiences.  While some argue that excessive computer use can have negative effects, such as reducing physical activity and limiting face-to-face interactions, these concerns can be addressed by managing one's time effectively. By balancing computer use with other activities, such as exercise and spending time with loved ones, individuals can enjoy the benefits of technology without negative consequences.  In conclusion, computers have had a positive impact on society by improving hand-eye coordination, facilitating learning about different cultures, and enabling communication with others. With proper time management, individuals can fully embrace the advantages of computers in their daily lives. Thank you for considering these viewpoints.
1593	1597	1	3	North @CAPS1 courier, I would like to give you my opinion on the usage of computers. I am a person who supports the advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can benefit people in many ways. The three most important ways to me are that they help with hand-eye coordination, provide another source for retaining knowledge, and offer an alternative way for people to communicate.  Hand-eye coordination is a crucial skill to have in our society, especially in a country like @LOCATION2 that values sports. Using computers can help individuals improve their hand-eye coordination through various gaming platforms that require focus, concentration, and quick reflexes. Developing better coordination can have positive implications for sports performance and even driving skills, potentially reducing accidents and fatalities on the road.  Moreover, computers serve as valuable tools for acquiring knowledge about different cultures, places, and subjects. With access to the internet, individuals can easily search for information on any topic of interest, expanding their understanding and awareness of the world around them. This accessibility to knowledge is particularly beneficial for students working on school projects or individuals looking to enhance their general knowledge.  In addition to enhancing coordination and knowledge retention, computers also play a significant role in communication. Through various online platforms such as instant messaging, email, social media, and video calls, people can connect with others from different parts of the world. This connectivity is essential for individuals without traditional phone access or for those seeking cost-effective ways to communicate over long distances.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on society. By improving hand-eye coordination, providing access to a wealth of information, and offering diverse communication options, computers contribute to enhancing the quality of life for individuals. The benefits of technology are evident in various aspects of daily life, making it an invaluable tool for personal and professional growth.
1594	1598	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think the effects that computers have on people are bad, and should be stopped. I mean don't get me wrong computers help people, but a lot of people go on it everyday, some computers can get viruses, and there are much more activities to do other than on a computer. I hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people.  Do you know how many people use the computer? Well, according to @ORGANIZATION1 over @NUM1 billion people use a computer worldwide. The problem we are facing today is that too many people are on a computer, most of them are teens. According to @PERSON1 about @PERCENT1 of teens spend most of their time on a computer. Facebook, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 are the most common places to find teens. I would know that because I have a facebook myself. I've had one for almost a year, and you should see all the people who have one. My friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one one wanted me to get one too. So I did and then I found out that more then half of my grade had a facebook. In my own words I honestly think the computer can be addicting, especially when your on a worldwide account like facebook. There are many people on the computer and if must be stopped.  In addition, another reason is computers occasionally get viruses. According to @CAPS3.com, the average adult gets about @NUM2 to @NUM3 viruses a year. My friend @PERSON2 was on his computer typing a report, and then his computer shut down. Then @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 the computer said you have a virus. The next day @PERSON2 told me he didn't have his report because the virus wiped out all his information. About @PERCENT2 of viruses can cause a computer to shut down and it is hard to reboot it. Some places have made virus scans such as mcafee. and @CAPS5, but sometimes they can't catch the virus. @PERCENT3 of people who say that a virus was cought by the virus scan they have, their computer freezes up and you can't delete the virus, viruses must be terminated, so the computer can work properly. Thats another reason to why computers affect people in a bad way.  Furthermore, people think that the computer is their everything. They're wrong! There is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer. According to @CAPS6. Burn the average person between the ages of @NUM5 and @NUM6 spend more then @NUM7 hours on a computer. There are many other options of activities like call your friends and get together, that's why they invented the cell phone, play a sport, read a book, spend time with family for @PERSON3's @CAPS7! Don't spend all your time on the computer. About @PERCENT4 of teens who are on the computer alot tend to get into lower colleges later in life. That is my final reason of the bad effects a computer has.  In conclusion, computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses, too much time on it, and not doing other things. I hope you can see my point to this and please send me a response as soon as possible.
1595	1599	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are not necessary. Some believe that they help us learn, but I just say so do books. Some people believe @CAPS2 can help to be more hand eye coordinated, so does playing catch. Most believe that internet teaches about people in faraway places, I say why not visit those places then you'll know more than what was typed in a computer. @CAPS2 it was computers against books I definetly would conqure with whomever roots for books. A good book is healthy. To me, reading a book on the computer is one of two things, unhealthy and unethnical! You can't read a book on the computer and even @CAPS2 you could it is not as fun as turning the pages of a beautiful paperback or hard-covered book. I Believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a book, (A real book)! When you type on a computer, do all that, ""clickety, clickety""!, you say that it's learning because you learn to type without looking, hand-eye coordination. I say no! that is not natural. Why not go out side and throw a ball to one another? That's a real way to show hand-eye coordination. It's a fun game and it's easy, plus it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot, you should really just visit that place. Flip a coin heads @LOCATION3 tails @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 you pick heads, stop surfing the web to get info on that place!. go fly there and surf the totaly radical waves. Surf the real waves next the artificial ones dudes! So as I restate, computers might seem okay and i guess they aren't all bad, but they are not my cup of coffee. So take time away from that computer and go read a book or play a game of catch. You know what hows about a trip to @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION3. Who knows, it will definetly be an experience, for sure. Remember, real experiences are far more enriching than virtual ones."
1596	1600	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2,  I believe that computers are essential in today's world. They provide access to a wealth of information, educational resources, entertainment, and communication with loved ones. With a computer, you can easily learn about different topics, stay updated on current events, and connect with people from all around the world.   While some may argue that computers can be addictive and lead to a sedentary lifestyle, I believe that with moderation, these drawbacks can be minimized. Computers offer countless benefits that outweigh the potential negatives. They enhance learning, improve hand-eye coordination, and facilitate communication with others.   In conclusion, computers are powerful tools that have revolutionized the way we live and interact with the world. They offer endless opportunities for growth and connection. Embracing technology can greatly enrich our lives and expand our horizons. So, why not make the choice to embrace the benefits that computers bring to our daily lives?  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1597	1601	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1,   @CAPS1 reading your paper weekly and @CAPS2 up with local events, I was able to retrieve the information of a controversy dealing with the effects of computers. I, for one, think that the computer is one of the greatest inventions ever created. It has truly changed our society in a very positive way.   My first reason has to do with the knowledge that the computer possesses. You can practically discover anything in the blink of an eye, as opposed to a book or going to the library, which is very time-consuming. Not only does a computer take far less time to get information, but it also holds a much larger amount of information than a library can store. Computers hold knowledge on almost everything imaginable, but best of all, it's right at your fingertips.   Another great characteristic of the computer is its ability to let people @NUM1 miles apart converse freely. This might just be the greatest thing about the computer. Chatting online completely erases the hassle of @CAPS4 phone bills and carrying around cell phones. You can speak with friends halfway around the world with no cost to you, amazing!   The one thing that is faulty about the computer is its overusage by children. Although this is a significant problem, it is not the computer's fault. Kids should know the limit. There should be @ORGANIZATION1 for both being on the computer and for exercise and fun with friends. This problem has most likely influenced many to come to dislike the computer, but you must understand that the time children spend on the computer is entirely up to him/her or the parents.   In @CAPS5, I hope I have persuaded you enough to agree with my thoughts and to give the computer a chance. I'm sure you'll be satisfied.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
1598	1602	1	3	Dear editor, Computers have a good effect on humans because they allow for communication with friends and family, can be portable for outdoor use, and help in researching vacation destinations. Communication through chat rooms and other online platforms enables people like my friend @PERSON5, who had to move far away, to stay connected with loved ones. Being able to take a portable computer outside, like my cousin @PERSON2 who grades papers in nature, can improve productivity and well-being. Additionally, using computers to research vacation spots, as my aunt @PERSON3 did, can make travel planning easier and more enjoyable. Overall, computers offer valuable tools for staying connected, being productive, and exploring the world, enhancing the human experience in various ways.
1599	1603	1	3	To the local Newspaper, I believe that using computers does not have a negative effect on people; in fact, it provides numerous advantages. Technology is a tool that should be utilized to its full potential. Computers enable people to communicate, make friends, watch shows, search for information, play games, and so much more. It is essential in today's fast-paced world to adapt and embrace the benefits that technology brings. Instead of shunning computers, we should educate others on how to use them responsibly and effectively. Let's focus on the positive impact that computers have on society and continue to integrate them into our daily lives for the betterment of our community.
1600	1604	1	3	Although many people enjoy spending time on computers playing video games and engaging in cyber chats, it is important to recognize the negative impacts that excessive computer use can have. One common issue is the risk of computer overheating, which can cause the device to stop working. Prolonged screen time can also lead to physical problems such as headaches and poor vision. In addition, computer addiction can have detrimental effects on social relationships and daily routines. Children may also be exposed to inappropriate content online, which can be harmful. It is crucial to set limits on computer usage and prioritize real-life interactions to maintain a healthy balance. In conclusion, while computers provide entertainment and convenience, it is essential to be mindful of the potential drawbacks and take steps to mitigate them.
1601	1605	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think the effects of computers are good. Some reasons I think this is that we get a lot of knowledge from it, contact people you donít live near and haven't seen in a while. My first reason why I think the effects of computers are good because you can get a lot of knowledge from it. One example would be if you want to make a meal, you wouldn't find it in an ordinary cookbook you would have to look up on the internet for the recipe. Another example is if you wanted to travel to a new location by car and you didn't have a map how would you get the directions? You would go on the computer, look up directions to the location and print it out. You would have never been able to go to the location if you didn't have a map or a computer. My second reason why I think the effects of computers is good is because you can contact friends or family that you have not seen in a while. One example would be if your sister just graduated from college and you wanted to congratulate her but you were on a plane and all you had was your laptop and your luggage, you would e-mail her saying good job. These are just a few reasons why I think the effects of computers are good, and I hope the local newspaper agrees too.
1602	1606	1	3	"Do you want your child to succeed in life? This is why computers are valuable to everyday life. Computers help children get more education, they can be independent and not have anyone tell them how to use a computer, and when they get to college they can take notes quickly and not fall behind. This is why computers are important to everyday life. Computers are important because your child will get the proper education that they need. Studies show that children who use the internet for studies are the ones that will be a grade ahead of their classmates. Dr. Smith, a computer expert, says, ""I was using the computer to do research on a topic, I went on Leperdy the other day and from there I was a step ahead because I was on the computer."" As you can see, computers are valuable items used in everyday life. Computers are important to everyday life because it helps your children be more independent and learn how to use different parts of the internet. Research shows that children who use the internet are most likely to succeed in college because they know what websites to go to and how to get there. There is a high chance that the children who succeed in college will get higher paying jobs because they've learned how to use the computer effectively. Mr. Johnson, a parent, says, ""My son was very smart because he was always on the computer looking up new facts and ideas that popped into his head."" This is why computers are valuable to everyday life. Computers are important because you can look up sites that will help you eat healthy foods. Adults who eat healthy foods are most likely to live an even longer life because they are keeping their bodies in healthy conditions by eating more fruits and drinking more to keep their bones strong as they age. Using the internet can be very helpful if used in the right way. This is why using the internet will help you be the successful person that you want to be in life."
1603	1607	1	3	Dear whoever this concerns, I believe that people are spending too much time on computers, which is negatively impacting their health and relationships. The prevalence of computers has led to a decrease in physical activity, as people are more inclined to stay indoors rather than enjoy the outdoors and exercise. This sedentary lifestyle is contributing to health issues such as weight gain and overall poor health.  Furthermore, the presence of computers has also affected family and social interactions. Instead of spending quality time together, families and friends are opting to communicate through screens rather than face-to-face. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and a lack of shared experiences.  It is important to prioritize exercise, spending time with loved ones, and enjoying the beauty of nature. By reducing computer usage and focusing on these aspects of life, we can improve our overall well-being and foster stronger relationships. Let's make an effort to step away from the screens and embrace a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.
1604	1608	1	3	I think that computers can have negative health effects because prolonged use can lead to conditions like arthritis in the fingers and carpal tunnel syndrome. These issues can cause pain and limit mobility, affecting daily activities. Additionally, staring at a screen for extended periods can strain the eyes and potentially lead to partial blindness. It is important to take breaks from the computer, get fresh air, and engage in physical activity to maintain overall health and well-being. While computers can be useful tools, excessive use without proper care can have detrimental effects on one's health in the long run.
1605	1609	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, over the years, computers have advanced rapidly, becoming faster, smaller, and smarter. While these technological developments have propelled mankind forward, they have also brought about negative effects, particularly on the youth. Children today are spending more time in front of screens, which has led to a decline in outdoor activities, physical exercise, and imaginative play.  Unlike thirty years ago, when children eagerly completed their assignments to go outside and play, today's kids often use computers as a constant distraction. Instead of engaging in creative play with friends or acting out their favorite shows, they are glued to their screens, wasting hours on mindless activities. This sedentary lifestyle not only hinders physical health but also limits the development of imagination and social skills.  Parents reminisce about the days when children used their imagination to create elaborate games and stories with friends, but this is becoming increasingly rare in today's digital age. As children spend more time on computers, they are missing out on valuable experiences and opportunities for growth.  While computers are an essential part of the modern world, it is crucial to find a balance between technology and real-world activities. Encouraging children to spend time outdoors, engage in physical play, and use their imagination can help counteract the negative effects of excessive screen time. By promoting a healthy balance, we can ensure that the next generation grows up to be active, creative, and mindful individuals.  In conclusion, while computers have revolutionized the way we live and work, it is important to recognize the impact they have on children's development. Finding a balance between technology and real-world experiences is key to nurturing a well-rounded and healthy generation. Let's strive to create a future where children can enjoy the benefits of technology while also embracing the joys of outdoor play, imagination, and social interaction.
1606	1610	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I remember when I was younger my parents got two laptops for themselves. Internet use was always available, interaction of online chat. It was extremly exciting for them. On the other hand, I got to sit home and watch them have fun. I couldn't go outside, or hang out with friends just because I was stranded insided as they enjoyed the computer. I strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society. People spend too much time using the internet than exercising, nobody gets to enjoy the beauty of nature, and there is less interaction with family and friends. There are many holes being dog while computers one still being used and bought. Our society is just going downhill from here. People don't need to be sitting at home inside breathing reused air while using the computer. Proffessor @PERSON3, a health generalist, stated on @ORGANIZATION2 news that @PERCENT1 of all people around @LOCATION1 would rather be on the computer at home doing nothing than going outside and/or getting some kind of exercise. Could you imagine all of those unhealthy people not worriying about anything except their computer? the only thing computers do for us these days is abandon our free time. @CAPS2 waist @PERCENT2 of there spare time on their computer. If technology decreases there new games people play, and sites people use, it is likey for people to get out of the house and do something healthy for themselves. @PERSON1, owner of @ORGANIZATION1, said ""I have never seen in my entire life, so many people using there computers and internet. Its been quite sometimes when over one billion @CAPS2 are online on a typical weekend. "" @PERSON1 later mentions "" it's kind of depressing of how much time they spend on computers, than outside and enjoying nature."" Not only is excersicing time headed down the drain, but our used to be "" beautiful"" nature is as well. Many young kids these days are watching @CAPS3, they see computer game commercials there parents buy them the game, and all of a sudden they are on it @NUM1. Since adults aren't doing there part by idolizing these kids to persuade them to run around outside and do something healthy. The kids need to step up for a change! Did you know global warming is caused by the minimum density in the air? If we have almost to no children or adults running around outside, our world is not flowing too well. Hence our budget is low, and pollution is extremly off the wall; our nature is going from beatifu to less and lesser. @PERSON2, a government official has survey @NUM2 people from each state asking about how much time they spend weekly of just enjoying nature and roleizing the beaty of it. The survey reads one in every @NUM3 people thoughly breathe in the beauty for at least @NUM4 minuests, a week. I mean come on; that's pathetic. Maybe if we surely excluded computers and technology for a while, global warming won't be nessicary. I remember when I was about @NUM4 years old an I never once got to meet my other family besides my siblings. It was pretty sad because I'm always told I have a huge family that is very known to our town but I have no clue who they are ! this is all because technology was invented. Never once have I ever been outside and relaxed besides when I got on and off the bus for school. My parents stand me in my house as they use the computer. The other day I just found out what ""show"" is because my moms computer brake and now I am get introduced to my other family along with the freedom of going outside. Ever since my mom's computer brake she has lots of free time to spend with me. Technology ruined my childhood as a kid and without it you get to open up the real importance of life. Would you want to become obese, like through global warming, and/or to not interact with family or outside nature? Its sadi how @PERCENT3 of these reasonings are caused by the excessvive use of technology and computers. Let's just get rid of it all! Thank you for your time @CAPS1!  In conclusion, it is evident that excessive use of computers and technology is detrimental to society, leading to a decline in physical activity, limited interaction with nature, and decreased quality time spent with family and friends. It is crucial for individuals to find a balance and prioritize activities that promote overall well-being and environmental conservation. Let us strive to reduce our dependence on technology and embrace the beauty of the world around us."

1610	1614	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers play a crucial role in our society. They offer numerous benefits, such as helping individuals reconnect with lost family members and aiding law enforcement in catching criminals. Computers also provide a fast and efficient means of accessing information, particularly during natural disasters or emergencies. Additionally, computers contribute to learning and skill development, such as improving hand-eye coordination and expanding knowledge about various places around the world. While acknowledging that there are downsides and potential misuse of computers, it is essential to recognize the significant positive impact they have had on society. Overall, computers have revolutionized the way we live and interact with the world, making them an invaluable tool in today's modern age.
1611	1615	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a @ORGANIZATION1 who believes that computers have a positive effect on people for one computed help promote hand-eye coordination. @CAPS5 there is the fact that computers also help teach people about distant places and people without leaving they're home. @CAPS6 computers also allow people to talk to each other via the @CAPS3. What would we do without computer! My fist reason why I believe that computer are a good thing is hand-eye coordination. According to @PERSON1 of the @ORGANIZATION3 of the eye @CAPS4 you have to watch what keys you are using when typing, your brain builds a connection with your hand, thus better eye hand coordination, ""@CAPS5 there is the fact that millions of @LOCATION1 are in car acidents a year, wich @PERCENT1 are cause by the fact that the driver of a vehicle had to look down at the whey to make that they kept thier car. On that road, this being that they have no eye hand coordination, @CAPS6 I that it computers were in the of every person in the world there would be less acidents a year. Secondly there is the fact that a computer can transport somebody in there mind. to a distant and or person. A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT2 of people surveyed can find information on the @CAPS3 faster than they can in a @CAPS7 there is the fact that a child of any age can use a computer to find the specific information it needs in a matter of seconds. @CAPS6 I have observed that children know how to use the @CAPS3 but not a dictionary or encyclopedia, @CAPS6 there is the fact that people can contact and talk to people through the @CAPS3 for one this allows you to contact a long lost friends. @CAPS5 there is the fact that you can talk to theme @CAPS5 @CAPS6. There is the fact that you can contact someone halfway around the globe just with your @CAPS3. How cool is that @CAPS9 reading this letter and sharing it to your company I believe that you should support my cause. This is @CAPS4 computers improve hand-eye coordination, link people to other people and places and @CAPS6 allow people to talk via the @CAPS3.   In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing hand-eye coordination, connecting individuals globally, and providing access to vast amounts of information. Embracing the benefits of technology can significantly improve various aspects of our lives and promote a more interconnected world."

The impact of technology is evident in various aspects of our lives, from education to healthcare and communication. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have personally experienced the benefits of computers in completing assignments and projects. The convenience of typing essays and storing information on flash drives has streamlined the learning process. Additionally, the medical field has seen significant advancements with the aid of computers, allowing for improved diagnostics, treatments, and record-keeping. The words of @PERSON1, a prominent surgeon at @ORGANIZATION2, highlight the indispensable role of technology in modern healthcare. Furthermore, computers have bridged the gap between distant family members and friends through email and video chat, enhancing communication and connection. The economic impact of technology is also significant, with millions of jobs relying on digital communication. In conclusion, the benefits of modern technology are vast and undeniable, shaping our society in profound ways. It is crucial to recognize and promote the importance of computers in advancing our way of living for the better.
1613	1617	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I feel that the people using computers benefits our society. I feel this way because computers give people the ability to learn about far away places: and people have educational websites, and even allow people to talk online with other people. First of all computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. When I was in sixth grade I had to do a project on Abraham Lincoln and I didn't know anything about him. But, luckily we have computers so I was able to research on a computer and found a wealth of information on him and got an A+ on the project. Also, when I was in fourth grade I had to do a project on the Great Wall of China. I went on a computer, visited a reliable website and got lots of information which helped me secure an A+. The second reason computers are beneficial to society is that computers have educational websites. Computer technologist Mark Jones says, ""90% of the websites on computers are educational."" I also remember when I was in seventh grade, the whole class went on Khan Academy and were able to learn math and have fun at the same time. Lastly, computers allow people to talk with other people from around the world. Websites like Facebook and Twitter enable individuals to connect globally and share ideas. While there are drawbacks such as inappropriate websites and computer addiction, the benefits of using computers for learning and communication far outweigh the negatives. In conclusion, the use of computers in society has greatly enhanced education, communication, and access to information, making them a valuable tool for individuals in today's world."
1614	1618	1	3	Dear local newspaper,  I recently came across a letter discussing the impact of computers on people's lives, specifically highlighting the benefits of using technology for learning. I wholeheartedly agree that computers are a fantastic tool for education. They provide a new and exciting way to study, making the learning process more engaging and enjoyable.  When it comes to preparing for tests or quizzes, traditional studying methods can often be monotonous and boring. Personally, I find that using a computer to study not only makes the process more enjoyable but also helps the information stick in my mind better. While some may argue that spending too much time on the computer is not productive, I believe that as long as a significant portion of that time is dedicated to studying, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.  Furthermore, the mental aspect of learning is just as important as the physical aspect. Computers offer a wide range of resources and learning opportunities that cater to different learning styles and preferences. Whether it's accessing educational websites or connecting with friends and family through platforms like @CAPS2, Facebook, and AIM, computers allow for a multifaceted approach to learning and personal growth.  In conclusion, computers and technology play a crucial role in enhancing the learning experience and expanding one's knowledge base. They provide endless possibilities for education, communication, and personal development. I hope my perspective on this matter is taken into consideration, as I believe that embracing technology in education is key to staying relevant and competitive in today's fast-paced world.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1615	1619	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 newspaper,   I believe that computers have a positive impact on people, companies, places, and governments. One of the main reasons is the incredible learning opportunities they provide. The internet is a vast source of information where individuals can learn about a wide range of topics. Additionally, simulators and online resources allow people to acquire new skills, whether it's flying a plane or driving a car. For some, the internet serves as a platform for homeschooling, ensuring access to education regardless of their circumstances.  Apart from education, computers are essential tools in various industries. From creating special effects in movies to storing critical data for businesses, computers play a crucial role in enhancing efficiency and accuracy. They also provide entertainment through gaming, music, and videos, keeping people engaged and relaxed after a long day.  Moreover, the government relies on computers for planning, communication, and national security. In the event of a cyber attack, the consequences could be catastrophic. Lastly, the decision to use computers for fitness and well-being lies with individuals, allowing them to choose how they balance screen time with physical activity.  Overall, computers have become indispensable in our modern world, offering countless benefits to individuals, organizations, and societies. Embracing technology responsibly can lead to a more connected, informed, and efficient global community.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]
1616	1620	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, The question everyone is asking is if computers benefit society? I believe that computers don’t because you can’t get exercise if you’re always on the computers and it’s really hard to enjoy nature too. Another reason computers don't benefit society is that you aren't interacting with friends and family. Hopefully I have encouraged you to not use computers as much and go have fun with your family.  If you are always on the computer, how are you going to get exercise? It's proven that more than half of the United States is overweight. Exercising is more important than using the computer, and knowing that you could be doing something useful that you know is better, wouldn't you do it?  Interacting with people is important to do because you can meet new people, and if you don’t, then you might learn to be shy and not make as many friends as you like. It's true that you can make new friends over the computer, but it's not the same as meeting them in person. Also, if you do make ""friends"" over the internet, you don't know if they are a stalker or a murderer. I urge you to go out and meet new people and not on the internet. Knowing that you are better off not using the computer and being with the people you like, wouldn’t you do it?  Yes, you can play games on the computer, but it would be better if you play with your family. To answer the question everyone is asking, I believe that computers don't benefit society at all, and hopefully, I have encouraged you to believe this too."
1617	1621	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, if you believe that advances in technology are not beneficial for our society, you may be overlooking the positive impacts that computers have on individuals in our community. Computers play a crucial role in improving hand-eye coordination, providing access to information for learning, and facilitating communication with others online.   @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 highlights the fact that nearly @PERCENT1 of active computer users enhance their hand-eye coordination through regular computer use. This skill is essential for daily tasks, and computers can help individuals improve it effectively. Additionally, obtaining education and skills is vital for personal and professional growth, and computers offer a convenient way to earn degrees and expand knowledge in a short period of time.   Furthermore, @CAPS3 and education are closely linked to better job opportunities and higher salaries. For example, my aunt achieved a promotion at work after completing her @CAPS4 online. The accessibility of online resources benefits not only adults but also children who can utilize technology for research and homework assistance.   @PERSON2, a specialist in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings, emphasizes the appeal of technology to preteens and teenagers. By encouraging them to utilize technology for learning purposes, we can harness its potential to enhance education and skill development.   Moreover, computers facilitate communication, allowing individuals to stay connected with loved ones and conduct business efficiently. My uncle and I communicate regularly through social networks and emails, bridging the distance between us at no additional cost. Businesses also benefit from using computers to reach out to customers, manage appointments, and advertise products or services.  In conclusion, computers are indispensable tools that contribute to the development and connectivity of individuals within our communities. They enhance hand-eye coordination, enable learning and skill acquisition, and facilitate seamless communication. Embracing these technological advancements is a positive step towards progress in our society.
1618	1622	1	3	There are many reasons why computers are beneficial for the world. They provide us with the opportunity to learn about different places and cultures without leaving our homes. Additionally, they enable us to easily communicate with family and friends who are far away, bridging distances and maintaining relationships. Moreover, computers help us develop hand-eye coordination, a valuable skill necessary for various tasks in life. The speed and accuracy of computers allow us to access information quickly and stay updated on global events. Overall, computers play a vital role in facilitating learning, communication, and skill development, making them an indispensable tool in today's society.
1619	1623	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people these days rely too much on technology. Everywhere you go you usually see somebody on a phone, texting, on a computer or plugged into an ipod. These people are not necessarily bad, but they are under the control of technology. Computers, for example, are in the eyes of most people, fast, easy, and fun, but they also pose a problem. Even though it seems like everybody has a computer, not everybody does. Also, people become way too dependent on such machines that they can become addicted to them. Computers also seem like they work @PERCENT1 of the time, but they can also be very unreliable. Just off the top of your head, how many people do you know that use social media or email? A lot, I'm sure. Now multiply that number by itself for all the people they know and multiply it again and so forth. That number shows that, collectively, over millions of people use these platforms. Now, what are the chances that if you sent a friend a message on one of these programs (with the millions of people on it) that the server will be reliable and your pal receives the information they need? My point is, what if something important came up that required your friend's help, and you could not reach them because of a fault in the system? What would happen? You could be at a hospital waiting for a ride home for an hour longer than it should have taken. Another problem is, what if you needed a computer, and specifically needed them? If they did not have one, then you would have to find another way to contact them. You could try to call, but what if they are outside and engaged in other activities? Also, these days, showing gratitude by sending virtual thank you cards online has become common. However, the recipient would probably be much more touched if they received a handmade real thank you card in the mail. My final reason why computers hurt us more than they help is addiction. Like I mentioned earlier, everywhere you go, you see somebody glued to an electronic device. People no longer engage in outdoor activities like playing pretend games because now they can easily access entertainment with just a tap. I admit that I use my computer quite a bit, but I make sure to budget my time so I can also spend time outdoors playing. Obesity also stems from overuse of electronics along with various other products. It is important to strike a balance between utilizing technology for convenience and ensuring that it does not take over our lives completely.
1620	1624	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 you know that computer have been around since the @DATE1. Ever since then, many people have had a better life. Computers really help the elderly out a lot. When they need to pay a bill, they could just log in, pay it and move on. Another thing is if they need to write a letter, but their handwriting isn't that elegable anymore, they could type it, print it, and be done. This way the person receiving the letter will be able to read the letter. Computers are a fad that will never die out. Doctor @PERSON2 of the @ORGANIZATION1 in @PERSON1 said, ""The children I work with use computers everyday to build their hand to eye skills, ever since they have increased that skill @PERCENT1."" The corperate from @ORGANIZATION3 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people agree that everyone should have a computer. Computer help you out with projects and I think everyone should have one too. Are you ever sitting home with nothing to do? Well, why don't you go out and buy a computer to play with? Computers can help you do all types of things. If you like to play video games. then you'll love one of these machines. They have all types of game systems out there just for computers. They also have web sites you could go on just to play them. I'm sure most of you like to play games, so why not try it. A basic computer isn't that much if your worried about the money. So go out and buy one. There is a lot of people in college now and mostly all of them have computers. They make research easier and faster to find. Which would you rather do get ready, jump in the car, drive to the library, search for a book, stand in line, and check it out, or, get on the computer, search what your looking for and be done? You make that decision. When college students get stressed which happens all the time, they could turn on music from the computer to calm them down. Computers have changed the world in a good way, and they continue too. You should buy a computer today.  Computers have revolutionized the way we live and work, making tasks more efficient and enjoyable. From helping the elderly manage their finances to aiding students in research, computers play a vital role in our daily lives. Whether it's for gaming, research, or relaxation, owning a computer has become essential in today's fast-paced world. So why wait? Invest in a computer today and experience the countless benefits it has to offer."
1621	1625	1	3	I belive that computer technology is a positive effect on people. I think this because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and talk to people online. Here are some reasons why. My first reason is because the computer can teach you how to type faster. For example, for the use of your fast writting you can get a good job/career and can have a future in your life. Another example, is because you can type e-mails faster and don't need to type slow. Last example, is that you can improve you typeing skills and become a better typer. My second reason is because you can learn about far away places. For example, you can learn about other countries and how it's different from our country and how their alike. Another example, is you can use it for projects, get all your information and be prepare for a great project. Last example, is you can always learn something everyday from your computer, like news, weather etc. My third reason is because the computer allows you to communicate with other people. For example, you can talk to your friends and family to check in on them and see how their doing. Another example, is when your bored you can always talk to someone on the computer and have fun with it. Last example, is you can talk to your friends and plan when to hang out and go outside and get fresh air, That way you don't have to be in your house all day. That's why I think that computer technology is a good idea because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and allows you to talk to people online. I hope you agree with me also, and should think that computer technology is a good idea for everyday for lots of reasons.
1622	1626	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have come very far with technology. Computers and other gadgets have helped us go farther. But the computer is one gadget that does not benefit society. My reasons for this are when you are on a computer you could be cyberbullied. My next reason is that when you stay on too long you miss out on stuff like being with family. The last reason why computers do not benefit society is when you type on a computer the spell check on @CAPS3 checks spelling and punctuation and grammar so you don't learn from your mistakes. These reasons support me in saying computers haven't really benefited society. Firstly, my first reason for saying that computers have not benefited society is you can get cyberbullied. For instance, somebody goes home and checks their email. They get threatening emails. They are scared, what do they do? Cyberbullying, being induced by computers, is the easiest way to bully somebody. You can make them feel bad without doing anything besides typing a message. All you really have to do is find out somebody's email. Also, cyberbullying could be anybody. Someone you know or someone you don't. Computers haven't helped in society by inducing more crimes. Next, my reason is if you stay on too long you miss out on life. Between checking email accounts and updating @CAPS4, the average person spends @PERCENT1 of their day on the computer. People who spend that much time on the computer miss things. My sister always comes out asking questions in the middle of the conversation because she's following and updating on @CAPS4 while we are having a conversation. People miss things while on the computer. Lastly, when you are typing an essay or something, you don't learn anything about grammar or spelling because spell check corrects it for you. Most teenagers in @LOCATION1, when texting, don't use proper grammar or spelling. So they can write an essay in text language, and when typing it over, students choose what they mean from spell check and move on. This is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling. This is reducing students' thinking levels to just above read and click the answer. If computers did everything for us, we would be mindless slugs. In conclusion, I think computers have not benefited society. Computers inducing cyberbullying. When you type, spell check corrects your mistakes so you don't learn, and people miss stuff when on the computer. Computers have not helped society for all of these reasons and more. Computers should be used less.
1623	1627	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I believe that the use of computers has had a negative impact on modern society. Communication through text messages and emails lacks emotional depth, as it is hard to truly connect with someone when you cannot see or hear them. Additionally, spending excessive amounts of time on computers can be detrimental to one's health and privacy.  Statistics show that a large percentage of teenagers have access to and use the internet regularly, with many spending hours each day on their computers. This addiction to technology can lead to a decline in academic performance, as individuals become more focused on their screens than on their studies.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can lead to social isolation, as individuals spend more time online and less time interacting with others in person. This can have a negative impact on relationships and overall well-being.  In conclusion, while computers can be useful tools, it is important to be mindful of the amount of time spent on them and to prioritize face-to-face interactions. Finding a healthy balance between technology use and real-life experiences is essential for maintaining both physical and emotional well-being in today's digital age.
1624	1628	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are great for our society. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach to people hand-eye cordination, and about places all over the world. Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends. Computers teach people hand-eye cordination. They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. Computers are excellent for students that play the piano, like me. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand-eye cordination. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You would not be able to do it by memory, you would need facts. So you should go to the library, but no one can take you. Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. You don't have to leave your home, you can even stay in your pajamas. Computers give you the information that you need. Or if your planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, and don't know where to stay, then the internet will get you right there and give you great opptions. Another thing computers are great for is talking. How so you say, well you can got to A.I.M. online. You can have conversations with all your friends and family. This year my brother, and my closest cousin to me, went to college. Now I only see them about twice a year, it is so quiet without them, especially at my house. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and any fun places that he goes. So without computers I would practically never see my brother, or talk to him. Local newspaper please consider my opinion, I feel that computers benefit are society. They leave a positive effect on people in the community and world. Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand-eye cordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact. Computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available. The internet also keeps me closer to my brother, whose in college, because we can chat and send pictures to each other. So please take my opinion into consideration. Thank you.  Computers have become an indispensable part of modern life, playing a crucial role in education, communication, and information access. Their ability to enhance hand-eye coordination, facilitate research, and connect people across distances makes them a valuable asset to society. Embracing technology like computers can bring numerous benefits to individuals and communities, fostering growth and connectivity in an increasingly digital world.
1625	1629	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I am writing to emphasize the many benefits that more people in our society would enjoy by using computers. Computers enable us to work more efficiently, saving time and effort. Tasks that would take hours to complete manually can be done in a fraction of the time with a computer. Additionally, computers allow us to connect with others, make new friends, and stay in touch with loved ones through various communication tools such as chat and video conferencing. Furthermore, computers provide entertainment, allowing us to play games, watch videos, and enjoy other forms of digital content. In conclusion, computers are valuable tools that can enhance our productivity, social interactions, and leisure activities. We should take full advantage of the benefits that technology has to offer.
1626	1630	1	3	A computer has proven to be a valuable tool in various aspects of life, from education to communication and work. Despite some experts believing that computers do not benefit society, I strongly disagree. Computers serve as a constant source of information, enabling individuals to access a vast array of knowledge and resources at their fingertips. They also facilitate online communication, allowing people to stay connected with others regardless of their physical location. Moreover, computers play a crucial role in helping individuals with their school assignments and job tasks, providing assistance with research, writing, and organizing information. In essence, computers offer a multitude of benefits that enhance productivity and efficiency in various areas of life. Therefore, it is clear that computers are indispensable tools that greatly benefit society as a whole.
1627	1631	1	3	I believe that computers are a great invention. They allow people to interact with others from far off places, play fun games, and access information on various topics and locations. Being able to communicate with relatives who are distant is crucial for maintaining close family ties, which can increase the likelihood of children attending college. While some may blame computers for issues like childhood obesity, it is actually poor eating habits that contribute to this problem, not computer usage. In fact, computers can be a valuable tool for learning and completing important tasks, such as projects for school. By investing in a computer, you can enable your children to stay connected with family, enjoy games, and access educational resources that can ultimately help them achieve their academic goals. So, consider the benefits of having a computer at home and the positive impact it can have on your family's well-being and future success.
1628	1632	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I do believe that computers can have a positive impact on our lives. They offer a wide range of educational programs and resources that can help individuals of all ages learn and grow. Whether it's tutoring, educational games for kids, or online college courses, computers provide endless opportunities for personal and academic development. Additionally, computers can help us stay connected with loved ones who are far away through chat programs and webcams. They make it easy to communicate and interact with family and friends, bridging the distance between us. With the right approach, computers can be valuable tools for learning, communication, and staying connected with others. Let's embrace the positive aspects of technology and use it to enhance our lives. Thank you.
1629	1633	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers affect our country in a positive way. Three reasons why I think so are communication, information, entertainment, and employment. One of my favorite things to do is talk, and when one of my best friends moved away and I lost his phone number, I thought we had no way of communicating. However, thanks to social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and Skype, we have been able to stay in touch and chat regularly.  Another way computers benefit our society is by providing access to information. For example, when I do not have a television at my dad's house, I rely on the internet to keep me informed about current events. Websites like @CAPS4.com often break news stories before traditional media outlets, allowing me to stay up to date with what is happening in the world.  Moreover, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options, from watching videos and playing games to listening to music and connecting with friends. This variety of entertainment choices helps people relax and unwind after a long day.  Lastly, computers play a crucial role in employment opportunities. Many professions in our community, such as accountants, managers, software designers, and computer programmers, require computer skills. Computers make these jobs more efficient by helping to correct mistakes, providing visual aids, and facilitating typing.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on our society by enhancing communication, providing information, offering entertainment options, and creating employment opportunities. These benefits contribute to the overall advancement and development of our country.
1630	1634	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is great concern about computers and whether or not people spend too much time sitting in front of the screen. I believe that people should be more aware of the time they spend on computers. Instead of straining their eyes, they should focus on exercising, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends.   Exercise is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and neglecting it can lead to obesity. @MONTH1 obesity can result in social stigma and negative perceptions. Therefore, it is important to prioritize physical activity to stay fit and healthy.   Nature offers a beauty that cannot be replicated on a screen. Taking a walk in the woods or stargazing with a telescope can provide a sense of wonder and connection to the world around us.   Furthermore, real-life interactions are invaluable and should not be replaced by virtual communication. Talking to friends and family in person fosters stronger relationships and a sense of community.   In conclusion, it is essential to balance computer use with physical activity, nature exploration, and real-life connections. These experiences enrich our lives in ways that screens cannot replicate. Let's prioritize our health and well-being by embracing the world beyond the digital realm.
1631	1635	1	3	Computers have become an essential tool in today's society, providing easy access to information and helping to develop skills for future generations. They have revolutionized the way we search for information, saving us hours that would have been spent flipping through books. With just a few keystrokes, we can now find what we need in an instant, improving academic performance for students and making life easier for adults.   Furthermore, computers offer a platform for interactive communication, allowing people from all over the world to share opinions, ask questions, and gather statistics to make informed decisions. They also play a significant role in preparing individuals for the modern world, teaching them social, decision-making, and technical skills. Online gaming, for example, not only provides entertainment but also enhances hand-eye coordination and creativity.  In addition to all these benefits, computers bring joy and relaxation to people's lives. Whether through gaming, creating art, or simply browsing the internet, they offer a much-needed escape from the stresses of daily life. Ultimately, computers have become a necessity in today's world, helping us achieve our goals and dreams with just a little effort and proper usage.
1632	1636	1	3	It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers, individuals can access necessary information that can be used to assist them. It also allows people to communicate with friends and family around the world, and computers can be a tool for teaching individuals new things.  Students, whether at college or elementary schools, almost always turn to computers when they need to work on projects for their classes. Without computers, students may struggle to find the information they need, potentially leading to lower grades and a negative impact on their academic performance. Adults rely on computers for work and planning, and without them, many individuals would risk losing their jobs and facing financial difficulties.  Maintaining connections with friends and relatives from different parts of the world is made easier with computers. Instead of spending money on long-distance phone calls, individuals can use the internet to stay in touch with their loved ones. Moreover, computers can serve as a vital tool for checking in on family members during emergencies.  Parents are increasingly using computers to aid in teaching their children from a young age, preparing them for their future education. Additionally, schools utilize computers to educate students on essential skills and knowledge for their future endeavors, making computers an invaluable resource for learning and development.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by providing access to information, facilitating communication with loved ones globally, and serving as a tool for education. Overall, computers play a crucial role in helping individuals succeed in various aspects of their lives.
1633	1637	1	3	To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have become an indispensable asset in our society, offering numerous benefits. They play a crucial role in enhancing learning and knowledge acquisition, particularly for students. With the use of computers, tasks can be completed more efficiently and quickly. For instance, the built-in spell check feature helps in correcting spelling errors, and online dictionaries provide instant access to word definitions. Additionally, when assigned a book report, students can conveniently research and gather information online, saving time and effort compared to traditional methods like writing by hand.   Furthermore, computers have revolutionized the job market by creating new opportunities and replacing manual labor. Individuals with physical disabilities can also find employment working on computers, highlighting the inclusive nature of technology. Moreover, the environmental impact of computers is favorable compared to paper usage, as they help in reducing paper wastage and preserving trees.  In the educational realm, computers have facilitated access to online learning, allowing students to pursue higher education without the constraints of physical attendance. This flexibility enables individuals to balance their academic pursuits with other commitments, offering a convenient alternative to traditional on-campus learning.  Overall, computers have significantly improved efficiency, environmental sustainability, job creation, and educational accessibility. Investing in computers not only benefits individuals but also contributes to the advancement of society as a whole.
1634	1638	1	3	I believe that computers are helpful and useful to us. They provide us with a wealth of entertainment, enable us to communicate with one another, and even help us learn. Today, if it's raining outside or too cold to do anything, you can go on the computer, watch movies, play games, and webchat. The computer is a great machine, and health experts recommend limiting usage to about an hour or an hour and a half a day. Some people blame computers for the lack of exercise, but it's ultimately up to the individual to balance their screen time with physical activity.  In today's modern world, computers allow us to connect with others in various ways. With a webcam, you can video chat with people and send each other videos. Social networking sites like Facebook and Myspace enable us to stay in touch with friends, even when they are far away. While these online platforms are convenient, nothing can replace genuine face-to-face interactions.  Furthermore, computers play a crucial role in education by providing access to vast amounts of information. They can answer almost any question and aid in research and learning. Despite concerns about the negative effects of excessive screen time, when used wisely, computers are an invaluable part of life and offer countless benefits.  In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering entertainment, communication, and educational opportunities. It is essential to strike a balance between screen time and other activities to fully reap the benefits of technology without compromising our overall well-being.
1635	1639	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know, more and more people are starting to use computers. In my opinion, I think the computer does benefit society in many ways. One positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate. Through the computer, people are able to send messages to each other. If someone doesn't have a phone or car, they can simply go online, write a message, and click the send button. This is an easy way to communicate with someone who lives half way around the world @CAPS2 well. If you have family members who live far away, you can also send them pictures of yourself, friends/family, and places you've been to. They can receive them and also send pictures back. Another positive effect computers have on people is that they can learn new things. The internet allows you search different topics and basically has everything and anything you could ever think of. If you go on @ORGANIZATION1 and type in a word like 'dog,' you'll see a bunch of websites that will take you to other websites that are just about dogs. You can find a list naming types of dogs, how old a dog can live up to, where most dogs are found, how to care for them well, etc. The internet lets you explore new things and help find ideas. You name it; they got it. The computer also cames in handy when you have nothing to do. If you're bored and can't play outside because the weather is bad or you broke your leg, you can play computer games, listen to music online, or write your own story on a word document. Playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better, @CAPS2 well @CAPS2 keep you busy. If you want to listen to music to keep yourself entertained, you can go on @CAPS3 or other sites and find any song you want to hear. It's better than listening to the radio because sometimes you don't like the song that's giving. If you're also in the mood to write a story, you can open a word document or if you just want to type whats on your mind. @CAPS2 you can see, I think the computer is a facinating tool to use. You can communicate, learn new things, and keep yourself entertained if you're not able to do something active. Just remember, whenever you can, go out and play or hang out with friends and family. Computers truly enhance our lives in various ways, making communication, learning, and entertainment more accessible and convenient. So, embrace the technological advancements and make the most out of the opportunities they offer.
1636	1640	1	3	Dear computer and laptop owners, both of these electronic devices serve the same purpose and are essential in our daily lives. They can assist you in various tasks that may not be achievable without them. For instance, computers can help you locate long-lost relatives or individuals you have been searching for. Websites like Facebook and MySpace can be accessed through a computer to aid in this search, potentially impacting your life in a profound way by reconnecting with loved ones. However, it is crucial to be cautious when using computers due to potential risks. Online transactions can lead to financial loss if not done securely, and sharing personal information can make you vulnerable to identity theft or harm. Despite the convenience computers offer, excessive reliance on them can lead to laziness and isolation, as people prefer to stay home and shop or play games online rather than engage in physical activities. It is essential to strike a balance and use computers responsibly, recognizing both their benefits and drawbacks. In conclusion, while computers are valuable tools, it is important to be mindful of the risks they pose and to use them wisely to enhance rather than hinder our lives.
1637	1641	1	3	People, the computer is something good and cool because it helps us in many aspects of our lives. One of the main reasons why the computer is cool is that it assists us with our schoolwork, projects, and homework. By accessing the internet through a computer, we can easily find information and resources to complete our tasks efficiently. Additionally, computers can be beneficial in our personal lives, such as when we need to research car parts for repairs at home. Furthermore, computers enable us to accomplish a wide range of tasks, from writing books to communicating with others through chat platforms. Despite its numerous advantages, it is important to use the computer responsibly and not engage in inappropriate activities like viewing pornography. Overall, the computer is a fantastic tool that enhances our lives and provides endless opportunities for learning and productivity. Let us appreciate and make good use of this amazing technology.
1638	1642	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Technology is an essential aspect of modern life, particularly when it comes to computers. Without technology, our ability to learn, research, and communicate would be severely limited. Computers provide us with a wealth of information at our fingertips, allowing us to explore faraway places, cultures, and people with ease. The internet opens up a world of knowledge beyond what traditional sources like books can offer.   Moreover, computers facilitate communication, enabling us to stay connected with friends and family near and far. Whether through email or instant messaging, technology allows us to interact and share experiences with others effortlessly. For many people, especially those with penpals or loved ones in different states or countries, these digital tools are invaluable for maintaining relationships.  In essence, technology, particularly computers, plays a crucial role in enhancing our lives by expanding our knowledge and connecting us with others. Without these technological advancements, our ability to learn, research, and communicate would be severely limited. As we continue to advance in the digital age, the possibilities are endless, and our reliance on technology will only continue to grow.
1639	1643	1	3	To the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, This day in age, computer technology rules the world. It's where we get our news, music, shopping and even entertainment. Sounds great right? But there are some big downsides to this box of information. Such as, this gadget is taking over people's lives and keeping them from exercising. Nowadays, people are even losing human interaction because of these marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics, they require much upkeep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed. As you can see, although there are some great pros to computers, there are also pretty big downfalls that you haven't thought of yet. As I previously stated, computers are taking away from people exercising. We're all becoming quite lazy. People would rather stay at their computer screens playing Grand Theft Auto or Facebook stalking than going outside to play a game of soccer with friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 population goes without physical domain for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people would rather just stay at home on their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot let this continue. We must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all my reasons that computers are bad, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having less and less human interactions as computers become more popular. Now you can do everything from your computer. Soon, people will be marrying them. Oh wait, that's already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the newest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present and everything. They just recently got back from their honeymoon. This is sad! Look at what our world has become. People would rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people. We must act quickly, I don't know what will happen next. Finally, computers cost a lot of money. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer outright, but then you have all the upkeep and there is lots of upkeep. Computers are very troublesome. You just keep pouring money into it, which is just depressing. It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to lose a report you've worked on all night. For example, @DATE1 my dad had to pay @MONEY2 in order to get my @DATE1 computer unbugged. He was so reluctant to even pay it and afterwards he was annoyed all week for even paying it. It got even worse when it froze up a week later. He was freaking out. That's all you get from computers, more and more frustration. I just don't think it's worth it. In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, it's crucial to acknowledge and address the negative impacts they can have on our lives, such as reducing physical activity, diminishing human interaction, and being costly to maintain. It's important to find a balance and not let technology completely take over our lives.
1640	1644	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe computers can be bad for society. My reasons being people are spending to much time on their computers, less time exercising, and lose interacting with family and friends. My first reason why i think computers are bad for our society is people are spending to much time on them. I know when i get home from school the computer is all i can think about until i go on. It's like an addiction. People spend all their time on a social net work other then going out and meeting new people. My second reason is people spend less time exercising. Ive been over a friends house before, and all we did was play computer games instead of enjoying nature outside. Alot of @CAPS1 don't make healthy food choices, so why not go out and exercise? It's because of the computer. Ive seen my little brother spend his whole saterday eating in front of the computer and playing games. It's just unhealthy. My last and final reason is it takes time away from family and friends ive spent my whole day after school in my room on the computer. It's like when your on the computer nothing else matters because you think ""hey why not just talk to my friends over @CAPS2, or myspce, or facebook! you lose a lot of friendships like this. Also you lose friendship with you family because you badly talk to them while your on the computer. Half the time im to busy talking to someone i don't know then helping my little brother with home work, or helping my mom clean the house. In conclusion these are my three reasons why i think the computer is bad for sivilization. I really hope you take all this into consideration and really think what the computer can do to @CAPS1 I people once again those three resons are one, people are spending to much time on their computer. Two, spend less time exercising. Three, lose interactions with family and friends.   In conclusion, it is evident that excessive computer usage can have detrimental effects on individuals and society as a whole. It is crucial to find a balance between technology and real-life interactions to maintain a healthy lifestyle and meaningful relationships."
1641	1645	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @DATE1, computers are a big part of our society, but their negative effects cannot be ignored. While they offer some advantages, the drawbacks are more significant. One major issue is that computers diminish physical activity by consuming people's time, leading to health problems like high cholesterol and muscle deterioration. This lack of exercise is detrimental to overall well-being. Additionally, computers detract from family interaction, reducing quality time spent together. Family bonds weaken as communication suffers due to excessive computer use. Finally, computers isolate individuals from the real world, leading to a disconnection from nature and society. This disconnect can hinder people's ability to make informed decisions and negatively impact future generations. It is crucial for individuals to recognize these negative effects and limit their computer usage to prioritize physical activity, family relationships, and a broader understanding of the world around them.
1642	1646	1	3	Computers have a significant impact on people's lives, providing both helpful resources and distractions. While computers can assist with homework and research, they can also lead to laziness and potentially dangerous online interactions. It is essential to use computers responsibly and not spend excessive amounts of time on them. Maintaining a balance between utilizing the benefits of technology and engaging in other activities is crucial for a healthy lifestyle. Computers can enhance communication with friends and family, but it is essential to be cautious about sharing personal information online. Overall, computers can be valuable tools in daily life, but it is important to use them wisely and in moderation.
1643	1647	1	3	Dear newspaper, Technology is a double-edged sword, offering immense benefits while also posing significant drawbacks. One of the most prominent technological advancements is the computer, a versatile tool that serves multiple purposes. However, the excessive use of computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, making people lazy and sluggish. Many individuals spend hours in front of their computers, neglecting physical activity that is essential for overall well-being. This lack of movement can have detrimental effects on health and fitness levels.  Furthermore, the easy access to a vast array of websites can be both a blessing and a curse. While computers provide a platform for research, communication, and entertainment, they can also be a source of distraction and procrastination. Students, for instance, may prioritize computer activities over completing their homework, leading to academic challenges. Moreover, the temptation to browse social media or play online games can result in a significant loss of productive time.  On the positive side, computers offer convenience and efficiency in various tasks, such as bill payments, online shopping, and digital communication. The ability to access information and resources at the click of a button is undoubtedly beneficial in today's fast-paced world. Additionally, sharing memories through digital platforms, like uploading vacation photos, has become a common practice that fosters connectivity and nostalgia.  In conclusion, while computers have revolutionized the way we work, communicate, and entertain ourselves, it is essential to strike a balance in their usage. Embracing technology while also prioritizing physical activity and mindful screen time can help individuals harness the benefits of computers without succumbing to their negative effects. Let us strive to leverage technology responsibly, ensuring that it enhances our lives rather than hinders our well-being.
1644	1648	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive impact on people, offering a wide range of benefits such as access to vast amounts of information, communication with loved ones, and entertainment options. While some may view excessive computer use as harmful, it is the misuse of technology that leads to negative effects. Websites like Google provide a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips, from dictionaries to history pages. Social networking sites like Facebook allow us to connect with friends and family, though precautions must be taken to ensure online safety. Entertainment options on computers are plentiful, ranging from video-sharing websites to online gaming platforms. Online shopping has also become a convenient way to purchase goods without leaving the house. By setting limits and using computers responsibly, individuals can enjoy the many advantages technology has to offer. Embracing the opportunities for learning, communication, and entertainment that computers provide can enhance our daily lives in a positive way.
1645	1649	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers tend to have more negative effects on people, rather than positive. This is true because people may not be getting enough exercise, people may not be enjoying nature to the fullest, and lastly, because in this world, people do not spend enough time with family and friends. Computers are good to have around the house, but they should not consume all of our time.  To begin, people are spending too much time on computers. They are having more of a negative effect because while on the computer, you are not getting exercise. Obesity is a big concern in today's society, and staying on the computer does not help the situation. Any concerned person would agree that spending countless hours on the computer is not good for the health of our country.  Furthermore, people are spending too much time on computers and not enough time enjoying the beauty of nature. Many people have lost touch with the natural world because they are too engrossed in the digital world. There is so much beauty in nature waiting to be explored, and people should take the time to appreciate it. Instead of being glued to a screen, they should venture out into the forest with their loved ones and create lasting memories.  Although communication is important, instead of talking on the computer, people should make plans to spend quality time with their family and friends. Life is too short to waste it in front of a screen. Any intelligent person would realize that time spent with loved ones is far more fulfilling than time spent on a computer.  In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, they should not be allowed to dominate our lives. It is important to find a balance between technology and the real world. Get off the computer, go outside, and make lasting memories with the people you care about. Life is too precious to be wasted in front of a screen.
1646	1650	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 would a person do without a computer? Well, I believe they would be missing out on a crucial tool that not only provides entertainment but also serves as a vital source of communication, information, and organization. In today's digital age, having a computer is essential for various aspects of our lives.  One significant benefit of owning a computer is the ability to stay connected with family and friends, especially those who are far away. Through video calls and messaging apps, individuals can bridge the distance and maintain relationships with their loved ones regardless of geographic barriers. This is particularly important for individuals like me who have family members in other countries, as it enables us to see and talk to them as if we were together.  Moreover, computers play a pivotal role in accessing information about different cultures and places. For those who have a thirst for exploration but lack the time or resources to travel, a computer can serve as a window to the world. Whether it's learning about a new destination, studying a foreign language, or understanding the customs of a particular region, a computer opens up a realm of possibilities for cultural enrichment and knowledge acquisition.  Furthermore, in the professional sphere, computers are indispensable tools for work-related tasks. From researching important data to creating presentations, managing documents, and communicating with colleagues, a computer streamlines various aspects of a job and enhances productivity. In today's fast-paced work environment, having access to a computer is often synonymous with staying competitive and efficient in one's career.  Lastly, the organizational benefits of using a computer cannot be overstated. With digital storage and software tools, individuals can manage their schedules, tasks, and documents in a systematic and efficient manner. This not only reduces clutter and paperwork but also ensures that important information is easily accessible and secure.  In conclusion, computers are not just devices for entertainment or leisure; they are essential tools that facilitate communication, learning, work, and organization in our modern world. From connecting with loved ones to expanding our knowledge and enhancing our productivity, the significance of computers in our daily lives cannot be overlooked. So, the next time you ponder the question of what a person would do without a computer, remember the multitude of ways in which this technology enriches and empowers our lives.
1647	1651	1	3	Dear, @ORGANIZATION2. A computer is a very helpful resource. It helps people navigate through life, they can find jobs, do research for school. This world would be nothing without computers. But on the other hand some people do spend too much time on the computer. But surfing the web for countless hours is their choice. Computers can help students do research from the comfort of their own home. Instead of going to the local library and looking and looking for books, all they have to do is type in their research topic and voilà tons of different websites are right under their noses. A computer is the world at your fingertips. Also, a computer can help unemployed people find a job. It's easy, type in what city you want to work in, and there you go. You can even fill out a job application right then and there. Hey, some people even work from home. Stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes. Also, working from home can be a lot less stressful. It's less stressful because you don't have to deal with annoying and impatient co-workers. Did you know that 43% of employment is from the worker's home, now you know. Working from home makes another day at the office, another day at home. Computers have helped us come a long way since caveman times. Without computers this world would be nothing. We wouldn't have so many basic things like stoplights, elevators, and even blenders. We also wouldn't have the more sophisticated things like rockets and cars and planes. Imagine an airport without computers, where would they store all of their information? On paper? Where would a school store all their grades and tardies? On paper? Where would the government store their information? On paper? With those three places we already cut down half of the organization. Computers help the environment too. They will also help us to invent more technology so that one day we can live on Mars or something. I hope this essay changed your mind about computers. Let's recap: they help students research, help people find jobs, you can work from home, help the environment. Without computers we would live in caves and walk around with leaves for underwear like cavemen. The bottom line is that computers are very helpful.
1648	1652	1	3	Dear local newspaper, incorporating computers into our daily lives is undoubtedly a beneficial idea. In today's modern world, the use of computers is essential as every developed country relies heavily on them. They play a crucial role in enhancing education, facilitating communication, and are vital for commercial purposes.  Computers significantly contribute to learning by providing access to a vast amount of information. With just a click, individuals can explore various subjects, stay updated on global events, and delve into different cultures. This accessibility to knowledge broadens one's understanding of the world and fosters continuous learning.  Moreover, computers are indispensable for communication purposes. Social media platforms like Facebook enable people to connect with friends and even make new acquaintances. The ease of communication that computers offer has revolutionized how we interact and stay connected with others, regardless of geographical barriers.  From a commercial standpoint, computers are instrumental in promoting businesses and generating revenue. Small businesses can leverage the internet to reach a wider audience and compete with larger corporations. The digital landscape provides a platform for entrepreneurs to market their products and services, thus boosting economic growth.  In conclusion, the significance of computers in today's society cannot be overstated. They play a pivotal role in advancing education, enhancing communication, and driving economic prosperity. Embracing and supporting the use of computers is essential for progress and innovation in the modern world.
1649	1653	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, spending excessive time on the computer can have negative effects on your health. Not only can it strain your eyes and cause discomfort, but it can also limit your time spent outdoors, where you can get essential vitamin @CAPS3. Additionally, relying on computers for communication can hinder your face-to-face social skills. It's important to find a balance and make time for activities that don't involve screens. So, next time you're tempted to spend hours on the computer, consider stepping outside or engaging in activities that promote physical and social interaction. Your overall well-being will thank you for it.
1650	1654	1	3	Computers have become an integral part of society, but their overuse can have negative consequences. While they offer convenience and efficiency, many individuals have developed a dependence on technology. This has led to a decrease in time spent on other activities and has made people lazier. Instead of engaging in physical activities or socializing in person, individuals often opt to stay indoors and interact with their computers. This shift in behavior not only affects personal well-being but also impacts small businesses that rely on physical interactions for their success.  Furthermore, excessive computer use can have detrimental effects on health. Studies have shown that prolonged screen time can lead to obesity, vitamin deficiencies, and eye strain. These health risks are particularly concerning for children who may spend hours on computers each day. It is important to strike a balance between using computers for productivity and ensuring that one's health and well-being are not compromised.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is essential to be mindful of the potential drawbacks associated with their overuse. By limiting screen time, engaging in a variety of activities, and prioritizing health, individuals can harness the power of technology without sacrificing their overall well-being.
1651	1655	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. However, it is important to note that excessive use of computers can lead to various negative effects on both adults and children. One significant issue is the lack of physical activity that arises from spending too much time in front of a screen. This sedentary behavior can result in weight gain and other health problems. Furthermore, excessive computer use can lead to a decrease in family interaction as individuals become engrossed in their online activities rather than spending quality time with their loved ones.  Moreover, the constant use of computers can also have a detrimental effect on academic performance, particularly in children who may prioritize screen time over completing their homework assignments. It is essential for parents to monitor and regulate their children's computer usage to ensure that it does not interfere with their academic responsibilities.  In conclusion, while computers can offer numerous benefits and conveniences, it is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between their screen time and other aspects of their lives. By being mindful of their computer usage and incorporating physical activity, family time, and academic responsibilities into their daily routine, individuals can enjoy the positive aspects of technology without succumbing to its potential pitfalls.
1652	1656	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 In my opinion, the computer is a better option because of its versatility. One can play games, talk online with friends, do homework or projects, and find out information easily. One primary advantage of owning a computer is the ability to communicate online. It allows people to stay connected with friends and family who may be far away, making it easier to coordinate plans or stay in touch. Additionally, having a computer is beneficial for completing homework assignments. Whether it involves printing pictures for a report or typing up a paper, the computer streamlines the process and provides access to vast resources like online libraries. Furthermore, computers are invaluable for finding information quickly. Whether it's looking up facts about a historical figure or determining directions to a particular location, having a computer simplifies the search process. In conclusion, for those who enjoy learning new things, staying connected online, and completing tasks efficiently, owning a computer is essential.
1653	1657	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,  I believe it is true that many people use computers, and this trend is only expected to grow in the future. Computers have become an essential tool in the business world, with heavy reliance on them for various tasks. The need for internet access on cellphones has also become crucial for staying updated on stocks, shipments, and important emails. Additionally, computers are used in homes to connect with family members and quickly find necessary information.  The continuous development of computers, making them faster and more efficient, ensures their relevance and importance in our daily lives. While some individuals may spend excessive time on computers, it is essential to recognize that many people, especially those who work from home, rely on them for their livelihood. Computers are meant to simplify tasks and provide quick access to information, ultimately saving us a significant amount of time.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing our lives and should be viewed as tools that help rather than hinder us. They offer convenience, efficiency, and accessibility to a vast amount of information that would otherwise be challenging to obtain. Therefore, it is essential to embrace the positive impact of computers on our lives and utilize them effectively for our benefit.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1654	1658	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,   I believe that computers have a negative impact on people today. Computers contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, as individuals often choose to stay at home on their computers rather than engaging in physical activities outdoors. This lack of physical activity can lead to health issues such as obesity.   Moreover, communication through computers limits the ability to express emotions effectively. Conversations lack the personal touch and emotional connection that face-to-face interactions provide. It is important for people to engage in real-life interactions to truly convey their emotions and build meaningful relationships.   Additionally, excessive computer usage is a contributing factor to the rising obesity rates in our country. People spend hours sitting in front of screens, often mindlessly snacking, leading to weight gain and health problems.   To combat these negative effects, it is essential for individuals to limit their computer usage and prioritize physical activity and in-person interactions. By encouraging a balance between technology and real-life experiences, we can promote a healthier and more emotionally connected society.   In conclusion, it is crucial for people to be mindful of their computer usage and prioritize activities that promote physical health and emotional well-being. By making conscious choices to limit screen time and engage in real-life interactions, we can work towards a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle.   Thank you for considering these important points.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
1655	1659	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am here to talk about my view on computers, about how they help people, and how many people say that kids and adults are spending too much time on them. My first views on this subject is that computers are becoming more and more advanced as time goes on. These past few years, computer companies have been making enormous strides allowing people to do almost everything. This is both good and bad. A computer is a tool that is a good feature for any home. It is great for people who own a small business, you can easily go online and update something you want changed in your store, such as designing colorful posters to put on the windows of your store to increase business and to catch people's eye. You are also able to book flights weeks or even months before you even go to the airport. This is good for those who are busy and travel a lot. You can go on a website called @ORGANIZATION2 where you can go anywhere in the world and zoom in on a landmark such as the great @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, or the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in @LOCATION1. Computers can also improve your hand-eye coordination when you type. Typing is an important skill to master, if you are a good typer you can do things much more efficiently than you would on paper. Some can even memorize the keyboard and not have to even look down. Computers are also great for communication if you have relatives far away in another state or even country you can easily talk to them through @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is an online service that you use to talk to them in person. These are just some of the things you can do with computers. On the other hand, many say that people are spending too much time on computers, and not getting outside for exercise and not spending enough time with family. I do agree this is the case in some ways. I know some friends who average about six hours a day on computers which to me is too much, also parents become too busy with work that they are on computers when they should be spending time with their kids. Some kids become so addicted to computers that they might become unhealthy and obese from sitting so much, this is something that should not happen. It is important to find a balance between using computers for their benefits and not letting them consume too much of our time. In conclusion, while computers offer numerous advantages and conveniences in our daily lives, it is crucial to use them in moderation and prioritize personal interactions and physical activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
1656	1660	1	3	Hello everyone, I have heard many people saying that computers are bad because they distract us from spending time outside and with our families. However, I want to highlight the many benefits that computers bring to our lives.   Computers have revolutionized technology, allowing us to connect with people around the world, access information instantly, and share memories with loved ones. They have also enabled us to achieve incredible feats, such as space exploration and medical breakthroughs. While some may misuse computers, proper education and regulation can mitigate any negative effects.   Moreover, computers make research easier and faster, helping students learn and explore new subjects. In my own experience, computers have enhanced my math skills and even enabled me to learn a new language.   In conclusion, computers are powerful tools that have enriched our lives in countless ways. Rather than focusing on the drawbacks, we should embrace and harness the potential of technology for the betterment of society. Thank you for considering the positive impact of computers. Goodbye.
1657	1661	1	3	I remember when computers weren't as popular, and I had to rely on writing essays by hand and listening to music on the radio. However, in today's society, computers have become a vital tool for various reasons. Firstly, students heavily rely on computers for their schoolwork, making tasks such as typing essays and creating presentations much easier. Additionally, computers provide a platform for entertainment and socializing, allowing people to connect with friends and find information quickly and easily. Lastly, the accessibility of computers in various locations such as schools, homes, cafes, and even on cell phones makes them convenient and essential in our fast-paced world. In conclusion, computers have had a positive impact on society, making tasks more efficient and enhancing connectivity and accessibility for individuals in various aspects of their lives.
1658	1662	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Computers are effecting more and more people in society instead of helping. A boy named, @PERSON1 started to have many health problems after he had bought a computer. The computer that he thought was helping him wasn't any help at all. His health issues started to get worse. He soon started to be out of breath more, always had high blood pressure, and he started to become overweight. Since he had this computer, he didn't exercise or get out to spend time with his family and friends as much as he was on the internet. Computers aren't helpful; my opinion is that all they do is waste time, lose your education, and can make you unhealthy.  As you already know, computers can do a lot to help you, but there are some things that you don't know about computers. According to a health magazine, tests show that using a computer for two or three hours can make you lose @PERCENT1 of your brain cells. That's a lot of brain cells to lose when you are going to need them for your education. There is no way to get those back, either.  After walking around the streets to listen to what people think about how computers can affect people, @PERSON2, a policeman at the police department, had this to say, ""I love using a computer and going on the internet, but most of the time I am on the computer at @TIME1 and find myself getting off at @NUM1. @ORGANIZATION1 can be very unsafe and unhealthy. Computers can help you find what you're looking for or show things that you have never seen before, but it is all a waste of time. Instead of going on the computer to go on Facebook, YouTube, or MySpace, you should go outside and interact with your family and friends.""  After interviewing @PERSON3, the best female rapper so far, she had this to say, ""Computers are okay, but they are sometimes just a waste of time. Instead of being on the internet doing something pointless like playing a game, you could be studying for an upcoming test or doing your homework so that you wouldn't be doing it at the last minute.""  In conclusion, while computers can be valuable tools, it is important to be mindful of the negative effects they can have on our health, education, and social interactions. Finding a balance between utilizing technology and engaging in real-life experiences is key to maintaining a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle."
1659	1663	1	3	Dear Newspaper,   While some may argue that spending all day on computers is harmless, it's important to consider the negative consequences that can arise. One major issue is the potential for individuals to spend less time with their families. When engrossed in the digital world, it's easy to forget about the real-world relationships that matter most. This can lead to missed opportunities for quality time and bonding with loved ones.  Moreover, the risk of addiction to computer usage is a serious concern. Many individuals in various countries have become so dependent on their devices that they struggle to go a single day without engaging with them. This addiction can have severe repercussions, such as neglecting basic needs like eating, sleeping, and physical activity. In extreme cases, it can even result in detrimental health effects and, tragically, premature death.  It's essential to strike a balance between technology use and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By prioritizing real-world interactions, setting boundaries for screen time, and taking care of one's physical well-being, individuals can avoid the pitfalls of excessive computer usage. Let's remember the importance of human connection, self-care, and moderation in the digital age.   Sincerely, [Your Name]
1660	1664	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been using my computer for a long time now. I didn't have one growing up, but I got one last year. There has been people saying that the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family, it helps you learn about everything, and you can look up the news. I totally agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it than going outside. Here are my thoughts on the computer.  First of all, the computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster than you can on the television. If you want to find the news, just go to a website that you think has news. I am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that may be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities. All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse.  Secondly, the computer is like a tutor. Whether you're having trouble with homework, or you just want to know a simple fact, the computer is for you. Just search up something you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer. This may not seem that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn.  Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe. Whether it's Facebook, Myspace, AIM, you can talk to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, ""oh that's what a phone is for""? Well all of these websites are free. Yes, I said it, free. There is also Skype. Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, the wonderful world of technology.  So now you know that a computer can teach you things. It can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now you're thinking, ""People spend too much time on the computers right""? This is where independence comes in. Get off of it. It's your decision to stay on it, not the computer's. Limit your time to a half hour a day. Go outside, enjoy nature. Maybe do a little exercise.  In conclusion, while the computer offers numerous benefits such as easy access to news, educational resources, and global communication, it's essential to strike a balance and not let it consume all our time. Embracing the advantages while also appreciating the world beyond the screen is the key to harnessing the full potential of technology."
1661	1665	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacrosse. Players have to look at an incoming ball and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple everyday tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact that easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. We are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-eye coordination. Computers are the world's most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try, if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is the best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper is now made from trees, so they must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computers and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would in a whole day at school. The transition needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and social media are now primary sources of communication. If it hadn't been for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to another city two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way to communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The country should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of rainforest every year. The benefits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge, and communication. In conclusion, computers have had a significantly positive impact on society by enhancing coordination skills, facilitating learning, and fostering social connections.
1662	1666	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 press, I have recently heard about many arguments based on computers ruining society. I strongly disagree with this. I think the computer is a great way to hook up with old friends. The internet is also faster for research than looking in a book and there are many games on the internet. I believe that the internet is a great way to hook up with old friends. Some people have moved away and I haven't been able to talk to then. Now, with the internet I can able to talk again. The same case with my mom. She had friends from high school and college who she ever talked to. Now, with facebook she has re united with them. This also helps because you can email someone interested of sending a letter in the mail, which costs money, unlike email. So the internet can also be a way of saving money. It is also much faster to send someone an email than a letter. The internet is a great way to keep intouch with friends and relatives. I also believe that the use of computer is more efficient than doing to a library and researching a book. If you don't have enough time to go the to a library, you can do some research at your house. What if the library is closed if you do go, then you wasted some time. The internet never closes, it is open @NUM1. What if you go to the library and they are open, but do hot have a book on your subject? This can also be done on the internet because there is any thing you could ever ask for on the internet. If you have an over due library book you can renew the book on the internet. The internet is a great place research on any topic you have or doing what ever you want. Finally, the computer is great for playing about every game, there is that you would feel like playing. Also @CAPS1 of spending about @MONEY1 on an x-box and a game, you @MONTH1 only have to spend about @MONEY2 on a game that goes into your computer. There are also many websites that have games on them. Some websites are for specific games, and same have many games on them. Only a few of the games are interactive with other players and you can talk and make new friends. On the other hand, many games are only for one player. As a result, a computer is a great use to play games. In conclusion, I believe the computer is great need for our society. In the long run it will pay off, especially with the economics problems our country is having now, by helping us save money,. It will also allow connection with old friends, save time, and provide entertainment to all who would like.
1663	1667	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe the more interesting article title would be ""Local @CAPS1 wins three mile race on computer game."" This title highlights the impact of technology on traditional activities, making it more relevant and engaging for readers. Computers are indeed changing the way people interact and spend their time, leading to negative consequences such as cheating, reduced time with family and friends, and a lack of genuine learning experiences. If we continue down this path, our news may end up focusing on divorces and gaming achievements rather than meaningful stories that captivate our audience. It's crucial to consider the effects of technology on society and ensure that our news reflects important issues beyond the digital realm. Thank you for considering these perspectives."
1664	1668	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1; Technology seems to have a positive effect on people. But could it be a bad thing. The computer is one of the top uses by @CAPS2, but I think we spend a little to much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend to much time on it, cant interact with friends or family and you cant enjoy nature. Dont get me wrong, its nice to meet new people on the internet and learn about other places. But when are you going to get your exercise of your on it for @NUM1 hours? Sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You cant get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Instead up being blinded by the screen, you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your @CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, (than to sit) is going out for a run. Kids need about @NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs than your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishes will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all wont you miss your friends? At this age kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air. If you havent visited the park in a while it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. Your getting exercise & exploring nature too. While your at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, your buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just dont spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand. So try to get exercise, hang out with your friends & family, and enjoy nature! Remember, balance is key.
1665	1669	1	3	Dear Newspaper,  It has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and, despite what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don't like to meet face to face.  My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has near-infinite amounts of knowledge stored inside it. With a simple click of a button, you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take, for example, two students, one with a computer and one without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs on, searches for the person, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the reports, continues to use this method, graduates top of the class, goes through college, and gets a high-paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on that person are checked out. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about that. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works at a dead-end job his entire life. See how much of a difference a computer can make?  My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying social lives, they can actually build social lives. Millions of people use the internet every time and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people may argue that this is dangerous and leads to misinformation, but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to trust everything they see online. The internet also has privacy settings, and those still unsure can use specially designed sites to talk to people they know in real life only. Computers also allow for people to ask questions. Having trouble finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site, and people with firsthand experience will answer you with all the detail you need and more.  My final reason is the entertainment computers provide. You can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of watching movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your disposal. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. Computers have infinite entertainment, right at your fingertips.  In conclusion, I believe that computers have no limit to what you can do, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not hurt them, and they are doing a great job.  Thank you, [Your Name]
1666	1670	1	3	In my opinion, kids and adults should use the computer. When people are on the computer, they can learn about interesting faraway lands, natural disasters, and beautiful animals. They can also connect with family members who live in other states, making communication easier and more frequent. Additionally, using the computer can help improve hand-eye coordination, which can be beneficial for sports like baseball. Overall, while there are potential drawbacks to excessive computer use, the benefits of using this technology for learning, communication, and skill development outweigh the negatives.
1667	1671	1	3	More and more technology is being invented, and people are increasingly relying on computers for work and learning. However, excessive time spent on computers can have negative effects on individuals. One significant issue is the decline in physical activity. For example, a friend who was once a dedicated triathlete lost interest in exercise after becoming engrossed in computer use. Studies show that individuals with computers at home engage in significantly less physical activity compared to those without, leading to increased risks of obesity and related health issues. Moreover, prolonged computer use can strain eyes and even lead to vision loss. Research indicates that a considerable number of regular computer users experience vision problems within a short period. The impact on social interactions is also concerning, as individuals may become isolated and engrossed in virtual worlds at the expense of real-life relationships. This shift towards virtual interactions can have detrimental effects on social skills and overall well-being. In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is crucial to strike a balance and avoid excessive use to safeguard physical health, vision, and social connections.
1668	1672	1	3	Computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, serving various purposes such as research, work, shopping, and communication. While some may argue that excessive computer use hinders social interactions, the reality is that computers offer numerous ways to stay connected with friends and family, such as online chatting and video calls. Additionally, computers are valuable tools for conducting research, whether for school projects, job-related tasks, or personal interests. Popular websites like @CAPS1.com and @LOCATION1 provide a wealth of information at our fingertips.  Moreover, computers facilitate tasks like report writing, creating presentations, and organizing data, making them indispensable for productivity and efficiency. Having a computer at home eliminates the need for frequent trips to the library, saving both time and money. The constantly evolving technology in the computer industry offers endless possibilities for innovation and learning. In conclusion, computers are powerful tools that enhance our daily lives in various ways, making them a valuable resource in today's digital age.
1669	1673	1	3	Everyone will agree that using computers is a good choice because it allows you to meet new people and learn new things. When interacting with others online, you can broaden your knowledge and understanding of different cultures. People often enjoy engaging in conversations and getting to know others, whether it be for personal or business reasons. Additionally, using computers can help you stay updated on the latest technology trends, further enhancing your skills and knowledge in this area. Overall, utilizing computers for communication and learning purposes offers a multitude of benefits that can enrich your social and intellectual experiences.
1670	1674	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1's at the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 to @PERSON2, ""Computers have helped me further @CAPS6 research. I can search up so many things to help a patient and keep all @CAPS6 important information organized."" @CAPS3 you question a leading doctor? I agree with @PERSON3 and say that computers are good use in society today. People were already becoming lazy because of television. You can't blame it on computers. With websites such as @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, people can keep in touch. They can make plans with one another to go for a walk in the park or dancing. These things can keep people healthy, active and in tiptop shape. Computers help people keep in contact with others. ""@CAPS6 patients can email me to schedule an appointment and let me now if they think something's very wrong with them."" say's @PERSON1. With computers, you can email distant family and friends to learn if there are problems quicker. Most people tend not to pick up the phone if someone calls during a crisis. You also don't have to worry about running up your phone bill. you can just @CAPS4 chat with a bud instead of using up an hours worth of minutes. You can learn so much more information faster. How @CAPS3 feel if no one called and told you your bestfriend died or your mom, and you had to find out by reading the newspaper? You'd be extremely upset. I know I @CAPS3 be with email, you and your family can stay in touch with old, new, and now friends. So if anything bad happens and a person didn't know hoe to tell you, they could email you. It's so much easier than telling a person that their.mom died by email them by phone. To hear pain in a person's voice will make you want to cry. You feel their pain. So, now do you understand that computers are a great benefit to today's society? You can't blame computer's for people becoming lazy, since television was already doing that. If a person want's to be lazy, then that's their decision. you shouln't go around blaming pothers and things when its no one else's fault but that persons. This is a great way to keep in contact with other's. Plus, think of all the information you can learn. Not just about family and friends, but the world too. Thank you for taking the time to read @CAPS6 essay and I hope you can see things @CAPS6 way. In conclusion, computers have revolutionized communication and information access in today's society, offering numerous benefits that enhance our daily lives."
1671	1675	1	3	One evening, when I got home from school, I didn't know what homework I had. I tried calling my friend's cell phone, but she didn't pick up. I left a voicemail and then called her house phone with no luck either. The next day, she explained that she was too busy emailing people on the computer. This made me think about how excessive computer use can have negative effects.  Firstly, spending too much time on the computer can lead to a lack of exercise. Many people, around 40%, fall into this habit, which can impact their health in the long run. Adults who spend hours on the computer while consuming unhealthy snacks are setting a poor example for their children, potentially leading to a cycle of unhealthy habits.  Secondly, being glued to the computer screen often results in neglecting nature. People who prioritize screen time over outdoor activities miss out on the benefits of fresh air and sunshine. Taking a break to enjoy nature, whether through a picnic, hike, or simply socializing outside, can provide a much-needed sense of peace and connection to the natural world.  Lastly, excessive computer use can strain relationships with friends and family. Choosing the computer over spending time with loved ones can lead to feelings of neglect and isolation. Communication becomes superficial, and meaningful interactions are sacrificed for screen time.  In conclusion, it is essential to strike a balance between computer use and other activities. Prioritizing exercise, nature, and quality time with family and friends is crucial for overall well-being and maintaining healthy relationships. Remembering to disconnect from the digital world and reconnect with the real world is key to leading a fulfilling and balanced life.
1672	1676	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2,  I appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective on the debate regarding whether computers are beneficial or harmful to society. While @CAPS2 has outlined the negative aspects of computers, I would like to add that excessive use of computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, reducing physical activity and social interactions.   It is true that many individuals, including myself, have experienced the allure of computer games and online activities that consume a significant amount of time. This can lead to a lack of engagement with family and friends, as well as a neglect of outdoor activities that contribute to physical and mental well-being. The addictive nature of computers and the endless entertainment options available online can easily overshadow other important aspects of life.  While computers have undoubtedly revolutionized the way we communicate and access information, it is essential to strike a balance between digital interactions and real-world experiences. Limiting the time spent on computers and prioritizing activities that promote physical health and social connections can help mitigate the negative impact of excessive computer use on society.  In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, it is crucial for individuals to be mindful of the potential drawbacks and make conscious efforts to maintain a healthy balance in their use of technology. Finding a middle ground between the convenience of computers and the richness of real-life experiences is key to ensuring a harmonious coexistence with technology in our society.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1673	1677	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,  The use of advanced computers has increased, leading to a decrease in outdoor activities among children. This shift towards spending more time on computers has had negative effects on society, such as rising obesity rates and increased crime. Children are opting to stay indoors, glued to their screens, rather than engaging in physical activities. This sedentary lifestyle has resulted in cases of obesity among the youth, like @PERSON2, who have become disconnected from their families and friends.  Moreover, the virtual world created by computers poses dangers, especially for minors who may unknowingly interact with strangers online. Criminals can easily hide behind fake profiles and manipulate vulnerable individuals, leading to alarming incidents of abduction and violence. It is crucial for parents to monitor their children's online activities and encourage a healthy balance between screen time and real-life interactions.  By taking proactive measures, such as organizing family outings and setting limits on screen time, we can protect our children from the potential risks associated with excessive computer use. It is essential to prioritize physical activity, social engagement, and safety in the digital age. Let's ensure our children's well-being by promoting a balanced and healthy lifestyle.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1674	1678	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2: The effects computers have on people are bad because they are getting too addicted, the computers is a dangerous site to go on, and their brain is smarter then the @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, they are getting too addicting because computers @MONTH1 have a benefit of you being able to serf the internet but you'll get hooked on it too much. For example, youtube is an internet siting that about @NUM1 people go on and barely get off. The people don't turn off their computers to just go get some exercise but just sit there staring at the @CAPS5 and messing up their eyesite. These people need to learn have the will power to get off the @CAPS5. Second, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on because some people in the @LOCATION1 give somebody their @CAPS3 on the @CAPS5 to somebody they don't know about. Almost @PERCENT2 of teens get kidnapped because od giving their @CAPS3 a way to stranger and @PERCENT3 of those teens don't get found. The @CAPS5 is also a place of where a child or teen @MONTH1 get cyber bullied. Cyberbullying is harrassing children or teens on the internet, when children under or over @NUM2 get cyberbullied they sometimes suffer through a deppression and don't tell their parents about it. Six months ago at my old @CAPS4, there was a volunteer at my @CAPS4 talking about cyberbullying and how he got so depressed because of the harrassment, that he commited suicide. The @CAPS5 is not always a safe place to be on. Finally, your brain more smarter than the @CAPS5.People can have the ability to depend more on their brains than on the their computers because your brains are like computers. About @PERCENT1 of people use their brain more often than computers and they have been successful through life. The brain is like a @CAPS5 because you can store information and nobody can hack into it. So therefore, computers have bad effects on people because they are getting to addicting, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on, and your brain is smarter than tha @CAPS5. Additionally, it is important for individuals to find a balance between utilizing technology and relying on their own cognitive abilities to ensure a healthy and successful lifestyle.
1675	1679	1	3	Dear society, don't you all have some kind of computer at home or work? Imagine if your computer was suddenly taken away - how would you manage your daily tasks? These are important questions to consider in today's technology-driven world. Computers play a crucial role in our lives by enhancing hand-eye coordination, facilitating learning and communication, and enabling quick and efficient interactions.  Statistics show that a significant percentage of Americans rely on computers or cellphones with internet access for various activities. These devices not only improve hand-eye coordination but also allow for multitasking, especially in work environments. Moreover, modern computers are essential for tasks such as writing papers and reports, which are integral to academic success. Without access to computers, completing these tasks would become significantly more challenging.  In addition to productivity, computers also serve as a means of communication through platforms like Facebook and email. These channels enable quick and seamless interaction, which may not be replicated through traditional methods like phone calls. The thought of losing access to these communication tools is daunting, as they have become integral to our daily lives.  While some may argue that computers hinder face-to-face communication, they undeniably offer unique benefits that enhance our efficiency and connectivity. Removing computers from our lives would disrupt our routines and make simple tasks more complicated. Before considering the consequences of such a drastic change, society must acknowledge the vital role that computers play in modern-day living.  In conclusion, computers have become indispensable tools that aid us in various aspects of life, from education to work to leisure. They are not just devices but essential companions that enhance our capabilities and facilitate our daily interactions. Before contemplating a world without computers, society must recognize and appreciate the significant impact these devices have on our lives.
1676	1680	1	3	I believe that we are spending too much time on computers, and it's important to take a break from technology and enjoy the outdoors. While computers can be beneficial, it's crucial to balance screen time with physical activities like going to the pool, forest, lakes, or simply spending time with family and friends. It's essential to limit the time spent on devices like video games and instead engage in outdoor activities to stay active and connected with the world around us. Life is precious, so let's make the most of it by exploring the beauty of nature and creating lasting memories with our loved ones. Let's not let technology consume our lives and miss out on the wonders that await us outside. Get out there, breathe in the fresh air, and cherish every moment because life is meant to be lived to the fullest.
1677	1681	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 town. As you know, computers have become an integral part of our lives, offering both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, computers provide access to a wealth of information, allowing us to explore different parts of the world, stay updated on breaking news, and even plan our next vacation. They also enable us to connect with family and friends through various communication platforms.   However, there are negative aspects to consider as well. The cost of purchasing and maintaining a computer can be significant, and excessive use of technology can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and potential health issues like obesity. Additionally, computers consume a significant amount of energy, contributing to environmental concerns.   One of the downsides of the internet is the presence of chat rooms where interacting with strangers can pose risks. Despite these drawbacks, it is clear that computers play a crucial role in our daily lives, offering convenience and opportunities for connectivity, while also requiring us to be mindful of the potential pitfalls associated with their use.
1678	1682	1	3	"Many people think computers are bad or that we spend less time outside because of them. But are they are bad for individuals to use as people say they are. In this instance, a moderation would be helpful. When you think of computers, what comes to mind. Games? Social @CAPS1? What if computers are doing more than that? Last year, a computer helped diagnose a concussion of mine and helped figure out I've had @NUM1 others. Not to mention the computer did quicker and more efficient than a regular human. An expert says ""Computers diagnose anything, not just concussions, @PERCENT1 better than doctors."" @CAPS2 the social netwowrking has a positive aspect. This has let people, who haven't seen each other for a long time, reconnect and become good friends again. With the positive aspects there is always a negative. Computer have started to make kids obese. This is problem in the country because if we become lazy then we could ruin our country. In addition, if we become has reliant of computers @NUM2 diagnos, what happens when they get faulty? These are problems that are very real and aren't being with. If we cant deal with these problems first then computers will turn out to be a bad thing. Lastly, a moderation could be extremely helpful for us today. For example, instead of using social @CAPS1 for friends next door, go outside and play wiffle ball with them. Social @CAPS1 was made to reconnect with friends far away, not across the street. @CAPS2, instead of totally reling on computers to diagnose problems, have them and the doctor find out. Doing this will get great results and keep doctors prepared if computers, dont work. These are just a examples how moderation could be very helpful to everyone. In conclusion, having no computers wouldn't be a great idea because of how much they help society. Although, being totally dependent on them is a bad idea to because they don't have that much benefit to them. Additionally, finding a balance between utilizing computers for their advantages and engaging in physical activities can lead to a healthier lifestyle and more efficient problem-solving strategies. It is essential to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of excessive computer reliance and strive for moderation in their use to maximize their benefits while minimizing negative consequences."
1679	1683	1	3	Dear local newspaper,  Did you know that the male coqui is the only coqui that sings? Some facts are easily found on the internet, thanks to the convenience of computers. Researching has become much simpler with the use of technology, eliminating the need to lug around heavy books or constantly search through them for information.  Computers not only provide us with knowledge but also help in developing hand-eye coordination. By requiring us to focus on the screen while typing on the keyboard, computers enhance this essential skill, crucial for activities like sports that involve hand-eye coordination. This coordination is vital for excelling in sports such as baseball, basketball, and soccer, potentially leading to scholarships for higher education and better job opportunities in the future.  Furthermore, the internet allows us to learn about faraway places like @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2, making geography lessons more engaging and interactive. Gone are the days of flipping through dull textbooks; now, we can explore different cultures and landscapes with just a few clicks. The internet has revolutionized the way we access information, offering a quicker and more efficient alternative to traditional methods like visiting libraries.  In conclusion, computers and the internet have become invaluable tools in our lives, shaping the way we learn and connect with the world.

1680	1684	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 personal opinion on computer technology is that it is extremely harmful, and precautions need to be taken to protect oneself. One major concern is eye protection, as the bright screens of computers can strain and damage the eyes over time. This can lead to tiredness and even the need for glasses, which may invite unwanted attention or bullying. Additionally, virtual harassment is a serious issue that individuals need to be aware of when using the internet. Cyberbullying, sexual harassment, and interactions with sexual predators are all risks that one may encounter online. It is crucial to never disclose personal information such as addresses, phone numbers, or last names online to protect oneself from potential dangers. If encountering any form of harassment or suspicious behavior, it is important to report it immediately and prioritize one's safety. Stay safe and cautious while navigating the online world.
1681	1685	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that computers do not benefit society. I believe this because when using a computer, people spend less time exercising, which can contribute to the growing issue of obesity. Additionally, computers discourage individuals from enjoying the outdoors and connecting with nature, which is essential for mental and physical well-being. Furthermore, excessive time spent on computers results in limited interactions with family and friends, ultimately hindering the development of meaningful relationships.   It is crucial to recognize the negative impact that computers have on society, as they detract from important aspects of life such as physical activity, appreciation of nature, and social connections. Instead of relying heavily on computers, individuals should prioritize activities that promote overall health and well-being, including exercise, outdoor exploration, and spending quality time with loved ones. By reducing dependence on computers and embracing a more balanced lifestyle, society can truly thrive in all aspects of life. Thank you for considering these perspectives on the detrimental effects of computers on society.
1682	1686	1	3	Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3Ö. My name is @PERSON1 and I am concerned about the excessive use of computers by people around the world. Some computers have glitches that can cause issues, and many individuals have a MySpace account, which can contain viruses that harm your computer and slow it down or even shut it off. Additionally, hackers can access your personal information and spread it worldwide, compromising your privacy and security. Furthermore, illegal activities such as movie piracy can lead to legal consequences, resulting in imprisonment and damage to your reputation or business. It is crucial to be cautious and limit computer usage to prevent these potential risks.
1683	1687	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers have truly revolutionized society in a positive way. While there may be differing opinions, I firmly believe that computers have had a beneficial impact on our lives. One key advantage is how computers facilitate communication, making it easy to stay in touch with others through various means such as video-chatting, email, and online chat platforms like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. These tools have been instrumental in maintaining relationships, especially over long distances. Additionally, computers excel at providing quick access to information, simplifying tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming. Whether searching for definitions or directions, the internet offers a wealth of resources at our fingertips. This accessibility has proven invaluable, as highlighted by instances where individuals have found essential information swiftly, saving time and effort. Moreover, computers have streamlined the educational experience, making tasks like writing papers more efficient for students and teachers alike. Typing up assignments not only saves time but also enhances readability, benefiting both students and educators. When considering the numerous advantages computers offer, it is clear that they play a vital role in our daily lives. Despite potential drawbacks, the overall benefits of computers far outweigh any disadvantages. Without a doubt, computers have enhanced our ability to connect, access information, and navigate academic challenges. Their profound impact on society is undeniable, making them an indispensable tool in today's world.
1684	1688	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, I am concerned about the increasing trend of people spending excessive amounts of time on computers. This sedentary lifestyle is leading to a lack of exercise, minimal time spent enjoying nature, and reduced quality time with family. In my opinion, regular exercise is essential for maintaining good health and well-being. It is alarming to see individuals neglecting physical activity and opting for screen time instead. This shift towards a more technology-dependent lifestyle is resulting in people becoming lazier and more isolated.  With the convenience of computers, people are choosing to work from home or conduct tasks online, rather than engaging in traditional methods that involve physical movement. This reliance on technology has led to a decline in outdoor activities and exploration of the natural world. Instead of experiencing the beauty of nature firsthand, individuals are settling for virtual experiences through online platforms. This disconnect from the real world is concerning, as it limits opportunities for physical activity and overall health.  Furthermore, the ease of communication through online channels has impacted family relationships. Rather than spending quality time together in person, many are opting for virtual interactions through chat rooms and social media. This shift has raised concerns about privacy and security, as well as the authenticity of online relationships. It is important for individuals to prioritize face-to-face interactions with their loved ones to foster stronger bonds and ensure genuine connections.  In conclusion, the increasing reliance on computers is leading to a sedentary lifestyle, limited exposure to nature, and reduced time spent with family. It is crucial for individuals to balance their use of technology with regular exercise, outdoor activities, and quality time with loved ones. By making conscious efforts to prioritize physical health and real-world experiences, we can lead happier, healthier lives.
1685	1689	1	3	Dear The CAPS people, it is evident that the internet has become a prominent part of our daily lives. However, this increased reliance on the digital world has led to a decrease in physical activity among individuals. Many spend hours sitting in front of screens, neglecting the importance of exercise. This sedentary lifestyle can have detrimental effects on one's health, such as increased cholesterol levels and weight gain, ultimately affecting self-esteem and overall well-being.  Furthermore, the allure of online video games can be addictive, leading some individuals to prioritize virtual worlds over real-life responsibilities. Some even go to extreme lengths, resorting to violence or criminal activities in pursuit of these games. This obsession can have serious consequences, affecting mental health and relationships.  Moreover, online chat rooms can be breeding grounds for dangerous encounters. The anonymity of the internet makes it easy for predators to prey on unsuspecting individuals, leading to incidents of assault, robbery, and even death. It is crucial to exercise caution and vigilance when engaging in online interactions to protect oneself from potential harm.  In conclusion, while the internet offers endless possibilities and entertainment, it is essential to be mindful of the risks and dangers that come with it. Prioritizing physical activity, setting boundaries with online activities, and being cautious in online interactions are crucial steps to safeguarding one's well-being in the digital age. Stay safe and mindful of your online activities to avoid falling victim to the dangers that lurk in the virtual world.
1686	1690	1	3	My opinion on the effects of computers is that while they can be incredibly useful for accessing information, connecting with others, and improving skills, excessive use can have negative consequences on one's health and well-being. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, lack of physical activity, and potential health issues like obesity or musculoskeletal problems. It can also be a platform for dangerous encounters with strangers and pose risks to personal safety. However, when used in moderation and for productive purposes, computers can enhance learning, communication, and overall quality of life. It is essential to find a balance in using technology to reap its benefits without succumbing to its pitfalls.
1687	1691	1	3	Dear team at @LOCATION2, it is evident that computers play a crucial role in our daily lives. From helping us improve typing skills to keeping us connected with friends and family, computers have become an indispensable part of modern society. As we rely more on technology for work, research, and social interactions, it is clear that computers have a positive impact on people. They make tasks easier, improve communication, and enhance productivity. Without computers, many aspects of our lives would be more challenging. Therefore, it is important to recognize the value that computers bring to our society and continue to embrace their benefits. Let us continue to appreciate and utilize computers for the betterment of our daily lives.
1688	1692	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1, People have been saying that computers are not beneficial, but they are wrong. In my opinion computers are very beneficial. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about other people and faraway places, also, you can use the internet to interact with friends and family. Computers can be very useful and efficient to anybody. Did you know that computers can teach hand-eye coordination? Some computers have programs that teach you how to type. Without having to lock down at the keyboard. Even if people don't have the program they can learn how to type fact without having to look down. Many people that I know, have learned how to use the computer or type without anyone telling them hour to do so. Computers are very needed all around the world. Computers give people the ability to learn about other people and places. If you go on the internet you can go and searching person or place and the computer will find it for you. Children and adults need computers because if for example, a child get a project from schoool that need to be done about a famous person or smoking. she would most likely need to go to the internet . The game goes for adults that love jobs in offices, schools or anywhere else. Computers are essential to people all around the world. Computer can be used to comunicate with each other. People use computer to communicate with friends or family in far away places. They can communicate via e-mail, @CAPS2, video and maybe even in other web sites. Some web sites contain the ability to talk to each other through video or through messages, such as @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. People like using the computer because it is very useful when you need it most. If you ask anyone they will tell you that having a computer is very important and necessary. Why would people intend to take away something as important and useful as a computer? Computers can be used to learn hand-eye coordination, and help you move your fingers faster. They give poeple and places in the world. Finally, they can be used to communicate with one another through e-mail, message and many other ways. In my opinion, computers are one of the most important things to a person.  Computers have become an indispensable tool in today's world, offering a wide range of benefits that enhance our lives in various ways. From improving hand-eye coordination to providing access to endless information and enabling seamless communication with others, computers play a crucial role in our daily lives. Embracing the benefits of computers can greatly enhance our productivity, knowledge, and connections with the world around us.
1689	1693	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Have you noticed the increasing trend of people becoming overweight in today's society? Many attribute this to the consumption of fast food, but I believe that our sedentary lifestyles, particularly due to excessive time spent on computers, are also significant contributors. As technology advances, people are spending more time indoors, glued to screens, which not only hinders physical activity but also disconnects us from the natural world. While technology offers countless benefits, it is crucial to find a balance and limit its usage.   Excessive screen time has a direct impact on the rising obesity rates. With the allure of endless entertainment and communication at our fingertips, it's easy to neglect physical exercise. Many individuals, especially children, find it more appealing to stay indoors and interact virtually rather than go outside and engage in physical activities. By reducing screen time, we can encourage a more active lifestyle and combat the sedentary habits that contribute to obesity.  Moreover, the environmental implications of technology cannot be ignored. The energy consumption associated with electronic devices contributes to global warming, and by minimizing our dependence on these devices, we can reduce our carbon footprint. Embracing nature and spending time outdoors not only benefits our physical health but also fosters a deeper appreciation for the environment, promoting sustainability and conservation efforts.  Additionally, while social media and online platforms allow for convenient communication, they cannot replace the value of face-to-face interactions with friends and family. Personal connections enrich our lives in ways that virtual interactions cannot replicate. By prioritizing real-world relationships over digital ones, we can strengthen bonds, improve communication skills, and create lasting memories together.  In conclusion, it is essential to recognize the impact of technology on our health, environment, and relationships. By limiting screen time and embracing a more balanced lifestyle, we can promote physical activity, reconnect with nature, and nurture meaningful connections with those around us. Let's strive for a harmonious relationship with technology that enhances rather than detracts from our overall well-being.
1690	1694	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think that people spend way too much time on the computer these days. They get less exercise, don't enjoy the nature around them, and neglect interactions with their family and friends. If individuals reduce their computer usage, they can avoid various issues. Spending more time on exercising rather than on screens is crucial. Computers limit physical activity and prevent individuals from engaging fully with their surroundings. People tend to become irritable when detached from their screens, affecting their overall well-being. Additionally, excessive computer use can lead to unhealthy habits like consuming junk food and avoiding physical activities. Families should prioritize spending quality time together and go on outdoor trips to enjoy nature. Nature provides a peaceful retreat and an opportunity to bond with loved ones. It's essential to disconnect from technology and reconnect with the natural world and those closest to us. By finding a balance between screen time and real-world experiences, individuals can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives. Thank you.
1691	1695	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, as people are increasingly buying and owning computers, some experts argue that this trend is detrimental, advocating for more time spent outdoors. However, I believe that computers play a crucial role in our daily lives. Firstly, computers provide easy access to news and entertainment, enhancing our knowledge and relaxation. Whether checking news updates or streaming shows, computers offer convenience and efficiency. Additionally, computers facilitate communication, enabling connections with friends, family, and colleagues. Platforms like Skype and social media sites offer instant interaction, bridging distances and fostering relationships. Lastly, computers are indispensable for educational and professional purposes. They streamline tasks such as writing papers and conducting research, making work more manageable. In conclusion, computers are invaluable tools that enhance everyday life, communication, and productivity.
1692	1696	1	3	Wouldn't you agree that computers are essential in our lives? I certainly do. Computers play a crucial role in various aspects of society, including communication, education, and commerce. In terms of communication, computers enable individuals to connect with loved ones, friends, and colleagues, even when they are far apart. Through webcams and messaging platforms, people can maintain relationships and stay in touch easily. Additionally, computers facilitate online education, allowing students to access resources, attend virtual classes, and conduct research efficiently. This flexibility benefits those who may have other commitments or prefer a more personalized learning experience. Furthermore, computers have revolutionized the way people buy and sell products. Online marketplaces like eBay provide a platform for individuals to sell items and for buyers to browse and purchase goods conveniently. This not only enhances the shopping experience but also reduces the need for physical travel, contributing to environmental sustainability. Considering the significant impact of computers on communication, education, and commerce, it is evident that they play a vital role in benefiting society as a whole.
1693	1697	1	3	Dear local newspaper editor,   I firmly believe that spending too much time on the computer is detrimental to one's health and overall well-being.   Firstly, excessive computer use can lead to various health issues, both physical and mental. For instance, I have witnessed a friend who became consumed by her laptop, neglecting her previous active lifestyle and falling into a state of depression. It took a medical intervention for her to realize the negative impact of her computer addiction and make a change for the better.   Secondly, the friends one meets online, commonly known as cyber friends, may not be who they claim to be. The anonymity of the internet allows for deception and manipulation, making it difficult to establish genuine connections and trust. This lack of authenticity can have damaging effects on one's social skills and mental health.   Lastly, constant exposure to the internet increases the risk of encountering harmful content or falling victim to online scams and cyber attacks. This not only poses a threat to personal security but also contributes to the deterioration of the computer itself.   In conclusion, it is essential to recognize the negative consequences of excessive computer use and strive for a balanced and healthy lifestyle. Prioritizing real-life interactions and limiting screen time can greatly benefit both individuals and their relationships.   Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.
1694	1698	1	3	Computers have become an essential part of teenagers' daily routine, with many rushing to chat with friends on social media platforms as soon as they get home from school. While computers offer a wealth of information and connectivity, there are both positive and negative aspects to consider. One major concern is the rise of cyberbullying, where individuals can easily send hurtful messages without facing the consequences of saying it in person. This can have a significant impact on the mental well-being of young people.   Parents need to be vigilant and set boundaries to ensure that their children do not spend excessive amounts of time on the computer. Studies have shown that prolonged use of computers can lead to a decline in academic performance. It is crucial for teenagers to strike a balance between using the computer for learning and connecting with others, and engaging in other activities such as homework and extracurriculars. By managing their time effectively, teenagers can avoid the negative effects of excessive computer use.  Despite the drawbacks, computers offer numerous benefits, such as easy access to information and the ability to stay connected with friends and family. Platforms like Facebook and Google provide valuable resources for research and communication. However, it is essential to use these tools responsibly and not let them take over one's life. Maintaining a healthy balance between computer use and other activities is key to ensuring overall well-being.  In conclusion, while computers can be a valuable tool for learning and socializing, it is important to be mindful of their potential negative effects. By managing time effectively and setting limits on computer use, teenagers can make the most of this technology without sacrificing other important aspects of their lives.
1695	1699	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people's lives. They offer a wide range of benefits that make tasks more convenient and accessible. For instance, the internet provides a platform to explore different cultures, foods, and traditions from around the world without the need for costly travel. Additionally, playing games online can enhance hand-eye coordination skills, while also offering opportunities to socialize and make new friends. Moreover, computers enable communication through various channels such as email, chat rooms, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and video chat services. These tools allow individuals to stay connected with loved ones, regardless of geographical distances. Overall, computers have become essential in today's society, offering a plethora of resources and opportunities for learning, entertainment, and social interaction.
1696	1700	1	3	What is technology? Technology is anything that helps enhance our way of living, from our beds and houses to our televisions and chairs. However, one form of technology that has truly revolutionized modern living is the computer. The computer has had a profound impact on our society, and one of the most significant advancements it has brought about is communication through the internet. Email and instant messaging are just two examples of how the computer has transformed the way we interact with others. Email allows us to send messages instantly without the hassle of traditional mail, while instant messaging enables real-time conversations regardless of distance. These forms of communication have not only made staying in touch easier but also faster and more convenient. The internet, which powers these communication tools, has opened up endless possibilities for research, entertainment, and information. With millions of websites offering a wealth of content, the internet has become an indispensable resource in our daily lives. From playing games and listening to music to finding information and watching videos, the internet has made everything accessible at our fingertips. It has truly revolutionized the way we live, work, and connect with others. In conclusion, the computer and the internet have significantly enhanced our lives by enabling seamless communication and providing a vast array of resources and entertainment options.
1697	1701	1	3	The computer is a versatile tool that has many positive effects on people. Most households have a computer, making it as common as having a telephone. Computers help us in various aspects of life, from storing information to communicating online and finding recipes. Without computers, technological advancements would not be as rapid as they are today.  Personal experiences also highlight the benefits of computers. For instance, in times of need, such as getting lost on the way to a job interview, computers can provide directions and assistance. This demonstrates how computers can have a positive impact on everyday life.  However, some experts argue that people spend too much time on their computers, neglecting physical exercise, outdoor activities, and social interactions. While it is true that excessive computer use can be detrimental, it ultimately comes down to individual self-control. Those who prioritize their health and relationships can balance computer use with other activities.  In conclusion, computers have numerous positive effects on people, but it is essential to exercise self-control and prioritize health and social interactions. By striking a balance, individuals can enjoy the benefits of computers without experiencing negative side effects.
1698	1702	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, as a computer user, I believe that computers play a crucial role in our lives. They facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge, aid in operating various machines, assist in learning new skills, and help individuals secure employment opportunities. For instance, my brother struggled to find a job after completing his education as a mechanic. However, with the help of a computer and browsing through @CAPS1.com, he discovered a job listing that matched his qualifications, ultimately leading to his successful employment. Computers also streamline the functioning of machines, increasing productivity and efficiency. Although this advancement has its benefits, such as faster production rates, it has also led to job losses as automation replaces manual labor. Despite these challenges, it is undeniable that computers have revolutionized the way we work and interact with the world. In conclusion, computers are invaluable tools that have transformed various aspects of society, offering both opportunities and challenges that we must navigate in this digital age.
1699	1703	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, The effects computers have on people can be hurting our society or it can also be helping society. As a middle schooler growing up, I believe using computers can be beneficial at some point but it is also damaging our society. First of all, the internet is full of inappropriate content. Illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just a single click of a mouse. Anyone in the world can use the technology we have today to ""hack"" or trespass someone else's computer. Anyone can download songs or documents illegally for free, rather than paying for it themselves. In fact, not only can someone download inappropriate content right onto their screen, they can also be inflicted upon with graphic words or view a website that involves videos with drug use, criminal acts, vulgar language, and more. A recent study on internet use from the @ORGANIZATION1 for internet use includes that ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" has a history of a result of suicides or depression in teens. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a form of @CAPS5 where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings. Not only is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 an issue, however, people can now talk to strangers on the internet. Think about how awful it would be if your child had given out their private information online and a man who said they were the same age as your child received it and lied about their age, sex, appearance, and age. Now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them. Secondly, the internet can also be very unhealthy and can cause you to become less social. According to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of children or teenagers that result from internet use can create a weak relationship with friends and family members if they use the computer too much. It can be very unhealthy for someone, and not just teenagers, to use the computer for an extended amount of time than they should. People can gain the effects of laziness, little brain effort, and lose interaction with the outside world. Finally, my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be. From my own experience, I used to stay up late for hours using websites such as @CAPS9 because everyone else was using it. Sure, it can be entertaining and fun but using the internet won't be so much ""fun"" when your academic grades are at risk and you stop communicating with the outside world. Addiction can draw anyone in against their willpower. My own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for @NUM1 hours straight. You can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have. The internet can be great in moderation, however it can be inappropriate, unhealthy, and addicting. If technology becomes too powerful in our civilization, how can we learn to interact with our humanity. More and more people become involved with technology and frankly it can be quite horrendous in my opinion. In conclusion, while computers and the internet can offer many benefits, it is crucial to be aware of the negative impacts they can have on our society, including inappropriate content, decreased social interaction, and addiction. It is important to find a balance and use technology responsibly to avoid these detrimental effects on our lives and relationships."
1700	1704	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I support the advances in technology, and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I think this for simple reasons. First, you gain computer skills, which can help in other situations. Second, computers give people the chance to learn about faraway people and places. Lastly, when you have a computer, you can chat and talk to other people. When I think of a computer, I think of typing on a keyboard. After a few times of using a computer, you get faster and better at it. You gain typing skills, hand-eye coordination, and mouse skills. After just a few uses, your computer skills build up, and you soon get good at it. When you get better though, you improve quicker and more, so it all works out very well. When you are on the computer, the internet allows you to search for anything and everything. Whether it be a different culture or even schoolwork, a computer is helpful. When I am doing my homework and I don't know how to answer a question, I go on the internet. The computer allows me to get help with any homework I need help in; it's great. I can even look up something on a different culture and compare it to ours. The computer allows me to do everything I need. Have you ever felt alone, but there's no one to talk to? Well, that problem can be solved very simply - get on a computer. You can chat with people even if there is no one around. You can chat with someone halfway around the world. It's amazing that you can be anywhere, talking to anyone you want. Computers allow you to reconnect with old friends and make new ones. When you're on a computer, there is so much to do, so much you can get out of it. They are helpful and fun; you never run out of options with a computer at your side. In my opinion, there is so much to gain and learn from a computer.
1701	1705	1	3	Computers have a positive impact on people in various ways. They help improve hand-eye coordination through activities like online games and browsing the internet. Additionally, computers provide a wealth of information on different places, cultures, and current events, allowing users to expand their knowledge and understanding of the world. Moreover, computers enable people to communicate with others online, facilitating connections and collaborations that may not have been possible otherwise. Overall, computers play a crucial role in enhancing learning, communication, and overall societal interaction.
1702	1706	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers have a positive impact on people rather than a negative one. One reason for this is that computers help in relieving stress. By providing quick access to information, computers reduce the time and effort needed to search for things, thus reducing stress levels. Additionally, computers aid in the efficient completion of tasks, such as typing assignments neatly, printing pictures, and obtaining necessary information. Without the assistance of computers, these tasks would be more challenging and time-consuming. Furthermore, in industrial settings, computers play a crucial role in managing operations. Factories rely on computer systems to coordinate and control machinery, ensuring smooth and efficient production processes. Without computers, the functioning of these factories would be severely disrupted, leading to significant delays and inefficiencies. In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people by alleviating stress, enhancing productivity, and facilitating the smooth operation of essential systems.
1703	1707	1	3	Dear @CAPS1,  Have you ever wondered what it would be like to spend all your time in front of computers? Well, if you have, I believe that you should not be in front of that computer all day. As my mom says, only an hour a day is good. One reason why it is important is because you need to enjoy what life has to offer. You could do things like play catch with the dogs, walk the dog, or play at a friend's house. Yes, playing on the computer is fun, but you also need to exercise. Another reason is that you can end up somewhere you didn't even need to go to. You could make lots of new friends by going outdoors, meeting trees, animals, and enjoying beautiful scenery. The last reason is that you can get a lot out of being outdoors. You could build snowmen in the winter or watch a movie on a rainy day. In conclusion, by enjoying the outdoors, you can have a wonderful and lovely experience. So, go walk your dog, have friends over, or simply hang out with your family and friends.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1704	1708	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are an essential part of our daily lives, offering a wealth of information and entertainment at our fingertips. They serve as a gateway to knowledge, allowing us to explore various topics, conduct research, and gain a better understanding of the world around us. Just like a trip to the library, computers provide access to a vast array of information that can be stored and organized for easy retrieval.  In addition to being a valuable tool for learning, computers also offer endless entertainment options. From browsing the internet to streaming music and videos, there is no shortage of ways to stay engaged and occupied. Many people rely on their computers for work, communication, and leisure activities, making them an indispensable part of modern life.  Whether you're looking up information for a project or simply passing the time, computers have revolutionized the way we access and interact with the world. They have become a central part of our daily routines, offering convenience, connectivity, and endless possibilities. In today's digital age, it's hard to imagine life without the convenience and capabilities that computers provide.
1705	1709	1	3	Everyone loves staying on the computer. I would be surprised if one does not. I believe the whole issue is that the machine itself distracts you from other things in your life that are also as enjoyable as it is. People learn too much on it. It changes people's whole life. The computer is like a disease or a virus that controls you and gaining your freedom from it is perfectly possible. I understand that some people may not agree with me, however, I propose that my side is the best. This is horrible. How can it? It distracts people from their life. It makes them blind to enjoy nature. Spending too much time on the computer is a horrible disease. The hard part is to get your freedom is being able to know that it is controlling you. That way your door to freedom will be open. Technology keeps you away from having fun, doing homework from school, and having fun with friends. I know that you can break free from it because I once experienced the same thing. Technology is a beautiful thing indeed. It has so much information in it you won't even think a person it. I know even more than. However, it is also very foul. Once I came upon a very horrible scene on the computer. I my I can shut it. Machines have a mind that it our and anything it. Changing a person's life is not easy. You become completely new. Sometimes those changes are good, sometimes they are bad. But a machine can make you change in ten minutes. Once you see what you like on it or what you want you can change. If you see something and you want it so bad, if you can't get it then you will be forced to get it by stealing. It is a very horrible thing to learn. All you have to do is learn to control yourself. Machines are a very bad influence on people. There are books if you need information. Computers make you lazy, you don't have to read or anything it does it for you. It takes over your life. You become. It teaches you bad things, it changes your life. What path would you take to break free from this control? It's important to realize the negative impact technology can have on our lives and take steps to regain control before it's too late.
1706	1710	1	3	Wouldn't you agree that computers have a great impact on people? Three reasons why they have a positive effect on individuals are that they improve typing skills, provide educational opportunities, and assist with various tasks. Firstly, computers can enhance typing skills as users become more adept at navigating the keyboard. This proficiency can be beneficial for those considering careers involving computer work. Moreover, computers can be advantageous for the hearing impaired, as they can communicate through text on the internet. Secondly, computers offer a wealth of educational resources through websites like Ask.com, which provide quick access to information on various subjects. This can be especially helpful for school projects or research purposes. Lastly, computers are valuable tools for everyday tasks such as finding directions quickly using online maps, which can be more user-friendly than GPS devices. In conclusion, computers play a significant role in improving typing skills, offering educational opportunities, and aiding in various tasks, making them a valuable asset in today's society.
1707	1711	1	3	My experience with computers has been positive as they provide me with the ability to play games, complete homework, and listen to music. I find computers to be convenient for research and writing papers, as I can easily access the internet and copy information. My laptop, in particular, offers portability and features like a floppy disk drive, CD-ROM drive, and a built-in calculator. The mouse pad on my laptop allows for easy navigation, and the dial-up connection enables me to access the internet for free by dialing a phone number. Overall, computers and laptops have proven to be valuable tools for various tasks and activities in my daily life.
1708	1712	1	3	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 say that people are spending too much time focusing on the computer and not on their homework, or getting some fresh air outside. I say those people are wrong! Computers are a giant step into new technology. For example, you can use the computer to do research for school, communicate with friends online, and give children some downtime where they can learn about faraway places and people. If you were doing a research paper for school and you have checked out all the books on the subject of your paper, but you suddenly realize that you forgot one of the most important books! You race back to the library only to find out that it is closed. Computers then come in handy. You can google the book and find an online copy of the book, so you make the grade on that paper. Also, possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone, what do you do then? That is what computers are there for! So you can easily go to your teacher's website, and there would be the explanation of how to do that specific lesson. Children need to communicate with their friends, to some extent. Such as a homework question or just to talk for fun. Without friends, children would be nowhere. Statistics show that 90% of all children who are permitted to talk with friends, out of school, stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades. The internet was not just created for the heck of it. It was invented so people can communicate, children can do research, and for fun and exploring as well. For example - learning about faraway places, people, and culture, exploring animals, and even online shopping is now available. These are necessities for all people to have access to. Without computers, we would not know the important news when we needed to or information needed for a specific moment. Computers are the future (yes I am repetitive) we need to have computers in our lives for communication, shopping, learning purposes, teaching, research on places, animals, people, and culture. Also for email purposes and to get important news around to everyone applicable to it. This is why we need to continue forward with computers and technology for the future. So all the people of @LOCATION1 keep your computers, they are an important stepping stone needed for growth and moving onto the future of technology. Plus, who would not want a good computer game once in a while. Computers are an essential tool that enhances our daily lives and facilitates various aspects of communication, learning, and entertainment. Embracing technology is crucial for progress and staying connected in today's fast-paced world.
1709	1713	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3,   I agree that spending excessive time on the computer can have negative effects on people's overall well-being. One major concern is the lack of exercise that results from prolonged screen time. When individuals are glued to their computers, they are less likely to engage in physical activities, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. This lack of movement can have detrimental effects on their health, causing weight gain and a decrease in energy levels.  Moreover, spending too much time on the computer can hinder family interactions. Instead of spending quality time with loved ones, individuals may choose to escape into the digital world for entertainment. This can create a disconnect within the family unit and lead to a lack of meaningful connections.  Additionally, excessive computer use can prevent people from enjoying the beauty of nature. Being outdoors and engaging with the natural world can provide relaxation and rejuvenation. However, if individuals are constantly glued to their screens, they may miss out on these opportunities to appreciate the wonders of the environment.  In conclusion, it is essential for people to find a balance between computer use and other aspects of life. Prioritizing exercise, family interactions, and time spent in nature can contribute to a healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle. By reducing screen time and embracing real-world experiences, individuals can improve their overall well-being and foster stronger relationships with both themselves and others.
1710	1714	1	3	I agree that having computers is essential in today's world. With the increasing number of people using computers, it has become a necessary tool for communication, learning, and productivity. In the past, computers were not as prevalent, but now that we have access to them, we should make the most of their capabilities.  Computers allow us to learn about faraway places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and others. Through the internet, we can explore different cultures, languages, and traditions without leaving our homes. This knowledge helps us understand and appreciate the diversity of our world.  Furthermore, computers enable us to communicate with others easily. We can chat with friends online, seek help with homework, or collaborate on projects without the need for a phone call. This convenience saves time and allows for efficient communication.  Moreover, learning how to type proficiently on a computer is a valuable skill. It enhances our writing speed and accuracy, making tasks like writing stories, poems, and school assignments more manageable.

1711	1715	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The question is close too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? In my opinion, no computers definitely don't make people lazy and less interactive with others around them. First, I think that computers can sometimes make you smarter. I mean you can read about history, world news and you can research many different topics. I remember when I was younger I would love to learn about the @CAPS1. I use to search it all the time and I made a poster project for fun. Thanks to the computer I got accurate information. A survey conducted by the @CAPS2 school social studies teacher shows that @PERCENT1 of their students used the computers to find facts for school projects. @PERCENT2 out of that @PERCENT1 end up getting better grades. Famous psychologist @PERSON2 says that ""kids and students learn more when they are on the computer researching or learning new things."" I know you might be thinking that too much internet is unhealthy for people but mostly students. But at @ORGANIZATION1 it a good source of learning for them. Therefore the computer helps teach everyone facts and many stay on what's going on around the world. Second, people can interact with family and friends online. I mean there's @CAPS3 where people can socialize with their families who live out of state. I remember when I was in @NUM1 grade I made a new friend and she moved to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 after @NUM2 grade. I keep in touch with her on @CAPS3. A survey conducted by student council at that @PERCENT3 of students had someone they know and love move away out of state @PERCENT4 out of that @PERCENT3 keep in touch by email or @CAPS3. Famous scientist @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""People who keep in touch with family and friends tend to stay happy and not become depressed."" I know you might be thinking that people don't need to keep in touch with their families all the time but it makes them happier. Therefore, people need computers so they can keep in touch with their families. Third, you can learn new exercises, moves, or tricks. I mean you can do new exercises, train for dance competition or learn new magic tricks for your magic show. I remember when I wanted to learn how to twirl a balloon between my fingers I went and found a video of someone teaching step by step on how to do it. it's easier now. A survey conducted by @CAPS5 muscles @CAPS6 shows that @PERCENT5 of their @CAPS6 members get stronger and more fit by learning new exercises. Famous athlete @PERSON1 says ""Learning new exercises online helps me stay fit for my games."" I know you might be thinking that they can just go to someone to teach them BUT no one wants to pay money for something you can get free online. Therefore, learning new exercises, moves, or tricks online can help them out a lot. To conclude, does too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? No, it helps them learn, socialize with family and friends, and they can get in shape with the new exercises that they learn from how-to videos."
1712	1716	1	3	People think that using computers is beneficial, and I agree because they provide a valuable tool for language learning, work, and entertainment. In a country with diverse languages, computers can serve as language teachers, eliminating the need for a human instructor. Many individuals rely on computers for their livelihood, making them indispensable in today's world. While some may argue that excessive computer use leads to a sedentary lifestyle, many balance it with physical activities like sports. It is important to recognize the value of computers in connecting people globally through communication tools like webcams. By providing computers to underprivileged countries, we can bridge the language gap and enhance their access to technology. Overall, computers are a revolutionary invention that has transformed the way we learn, work, and communicate.
1713	1717	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I want to argue about the issue of computer use in @LOCATION1, @CAPS3. I'll tell you about the benefits of owning a computer. Then, I'll talk about the whole computer network. Finally, I'll talk about the advances in technology due to the computer. I think the use of computers in our town is very good for society. There are major benefits of using a computer. One is the fact that you can use Microsoft to write up a paper. Sixth-grader @PERSON6 says, ""I would rather type than write a paper."" Another reason to use a computer is for research. ""So many articles and facts are online about anything you need,"" says @PERSON4. The final benefit of a computer is the fact that you can know about world news in a flash. ""I would've never known about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 without seeing the article on @CAPS2 homepage,"" says @PERSON5. Those are just some of the major benefits that the kids do on their computer. Now let's talk about something that is said to be bad but really isn't; social networking. Tools like instant messenger help us connect without making a huge phone bill. ""With instant messenger, I can talk to my girlfriends,"" says @PERSON2. Also, there is Facebook, which can help us connect on a global stage. ""I can talk with my cousin in @LOCATION2,"" says @PERSON6. Those are the major social networking tools we use to talk to people around the world. One thing that is important about the computer is the advances in technology caused by it. @CAPS3, we have the laptop, which is a portable computer we can take anywhere. ""I can use my computer anywhere I like,"" says @PERSON7. Also, the memory card allows us to save data on a computer and take it to school or work. Eighth-grader @CAPS7 says, ""I can take work I didn't finish in school home with the stick."" The final major advance is the use of the printer. ""I use my printer to print off papers to bring to school,"" @PERSON3 said. Those are some of the major advances caused by the computer. That's why I think using the computer is good for us. There are many benefits to owning a computer. We can talk to people worldwide whenever we want to. The computer has even been the sole purpose for many other groundbreaking improvements in technology. @CAPS4, please help defend us kids in this case about computer use. The benefits of computer use are clear, and it plays a vital role in connecting us globally, aiding research, and driving technological advancements."
1714	1718	1	3	Losing time to computers has become a common occurrence in today's society, with both positive and negative impacts. While computers can be beneficial for businesses and schools, they can also be detrimental for individuals seeking to pass time. One major concern is the excessive use of social networking sites, where many young people unknowingly expose themselves online. Additionally, the sedentary nature of computer use contributes to the lack of physical activity, which is a growing issue in society.  Despite these drawbacks, computers offer a vast array of opportunities and information. With just a few keystrokes, one can access a wealth of knowledge and resources. However, moderation is key when it comes to computer usage. Excessive time spent on social networking sites or aimlessly browsing the web can lead to negative consequences.  It is important for individuals to find a balance between computer use and other activities such as exercise. By incorporating physical activity into their daily routine and utilizing computers for productive purposes such as homework or research, individuals can experience the benefits of technology without succumbing to its pitfalls. Ultimately, striking a balance between computer use and other activities is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
1715	1719	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Imagine a world without computers. It's a scary thought, isn't it? A world without computers means a world where people struggle to communicate and gather information independently. Computers play a vital role in our lives, offering numerous benefits that we often take for granted.  One of the key advantages of computers is their ability to facilitate communication. Whether it's staying in touch with friends and family who live far away or reconnecting with old acquaintances, computers make it easy to bridge distances and maintain relationships. Social networks like Facebook and email have become essential tools for keeping us connected in today's digital age.  Additionally, computers can help improve hand-eye coordination. By engaging in activities that require precision and quick reflexes, such as playing video games or using design software, individuals can enhance their motor skills and dexterity. This aspect is particularly beneficial for children and athletes looking to hone their coordination skills.  Furthermore, computers serve as invaluable sources of knowledge and information. Schools rely on computers for research purposes, allowing students to access a vast array of resources and broaden their understanding of various subjects. Similarly, professionals, parents, and educators use the internet to stay informed about global events, trends, and developments, enriching their knowledge and enhancing their decision-making processes.  In conclusion, the impact of computers on society is profound and multifaceted. From facilitating communication and improving coordination to enabling learning and information gathering, computers have revolutionized the way we live and interact with the world. Without computers, we would be deprived of essential tools that empower us to connect, learn, and grow. So let's cherish and appreciate the remarkable capabilities of these technological marvels that have become an integral part of our daily lives.
1716	1720	1	3	"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 in your newspaper, I read an article that sparked my interest. The article was about the negative effects computers have on the community. I couldn't help but disagree with the article, @PERSON1 because, in my opinion, computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology. I believe computers are a benefit to society because they promote hand-eye coordination, you can learn about almost anything, and you can talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand-eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate! A study made by students at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are @NUM1 dropped almost @PERCENT1 in people that use computers often. Also, the hand-eye coordination you get from typing, goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball. So if someone needs to build up their hand-eye coordination, I suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Instead of calling a number, why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer. There are so many websites that make it fast and easy. In addition, sites can teaching people how to clothings are always nearby. If you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in ""how to knit"" in your favorite search engine and there are over @NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make a great or fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends. After camp, I would always say ""oh we will keep in touch,"" but I never would be able to keep any promise. Once I found an instant messager or webcam application on the internet, it was very easy to talk to my friends. Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in @LOCATION1! Also, my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries, but now that he can use webcams to talk to his other international bosses, he is so excited about his meetings. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a benefit to the world because they help with hand-eye coordination, make it easy to get information, and talk to people. Computers are an essential tool in our modern society, enhancing our abilities and connecting us in ways that were never before possible."
1717	1721	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are beneficial for society. One reason is that children find it easier to write a @NUM1-page essay using a computer rather than writing it by hand. People use computers daily, whether it's for communication with friends, playing games, or conducting business. While I personally use a computer for email and school work, I recognize the importance of computers in our daily lives.  Computers can assist in research projects by providing quick access to information that would otherwise require searching through books. They also offer the convenience of video chatting, allowing people to connect with others in real-time, which can be particularly valuable when loved ones are far away. Additionally, computer programs like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint help in creating organized and neat documents, such as essays, grades, and charts.  The internet, accessible through computers, is a vast resource for shopping, gaming, socializing, and entertainment. Without computers, these activities would be limited, impacting both children and adults. It's essential to recognize the positive impact computers have on our daily lives and how they enhance our ability to work, learn, and connect with others. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in modern society, and their presence greatly benefits individuals of all ages.

In conclusion, computers offer a wealth of opportunities for learning, communication, and exploration. They are far from being a waste of time and can enhance our lives in countless ways.
1719	1723	1	3	Dear newspaper, do you believe that computers have a negative impact on people today? I disagree. With over half of the population owning a computer, these devices offer numerous benefits. They provide easy access to information about places and individuals, making research efficient and convenient. Instead of struggling with handwriting, individuals can type out their work, improving readability and accuracy. For sports enthusiasts, computers offer a treasure trove of information about favorite players, eliminating the need to search through libraries for specific books. Planning a family vacation becomes simpler with online resources, allowing for exploration of new destinations without the hassle of traditional research methods.

They serve as a means of staying connected with friends, providing valuable information on a wide range of topics, and aiding in the development of essential skills for the future.  In today's digital age, the internet plays a crucial role in keeping people in touch with one another. Social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, enable individuals to communicate with friends and family members near and far. This connectivity helps maintain relationships that may otherwise fade away over time, particularly in a world where people are increasingly mobile and geographically dispersed.

When utilized in moderation, computers can enhance social lives, facilitate learning, and provide access to a vast array of information.  In conclusion, computers are indispensable tools that enrich our lives in numerous ways.

1721	1725	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a world where nobody has any hand-eye coordination @CAPS6 they try to catch a ball it slips away. There are no friendships or communication with other countries. Is this really what you want? Computers do have positive effects on people. For example, they help with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers have a positive effect on people and society. First, hand-eye coordination is not something that all people have. However, you can make it better by using computers and that is a fact. Computers @CAPS4 said that computer help @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 with their hand-eye coordination. For example, my mom used to have horrible hand-eye coordination but now that she uses a computer and it is much better. Oprah said, ì @CAPS6 I was young I couldnít catch a ball but now that Iím older and using computers Iím the best.î @NUM1 out @NUM2 people agree that computer help hand-eye coordination. Next, computers help other people learn about faraway places. For example, if we didnít have computers people wouldnít travel to @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 agree that they would never travel if it werenít for computers it is a fact that people use the internet to learn about other countries for educational purposes. Www.exploretheworld.org wrote that @PERCENT2 of the people who use the website are students. Computers help other people learn about far away places. Finally, computers allow people to talk online. @PERCENT3 of people on Facebook have at least one friend who live out of this country. It is a fact that countries are better allies @CAPS6 their people get along. Www.internationalfriendships.com wrote that they have over @NUM3 users who talk with people from other countries for example, my friendís mother was born in @LOCATION2 and she talks online with many of her friends. Dr @PERSON1 said,î@CAPS8 friendships are the best kind because you learn about other cultures.î Computers are a wonderful way to talk to other people. Now @CAPS3 a world where every country got along because of online friendships. Where adults could play a game of baseball because they got their hand-eye coordination back. Where students could learn about distant places they didnít know existed. Doesn't that sound great? Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allow people to talk online. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 computers do benefit the society. Additionally, computers can assist in improving cognitive skills, providing entertainment options, and enhancing productivity levels for individuals in various fields. The integration of technology has undoubtedly brought numerous advantages to our lives, shaping a more interconnected and efficient society. Let us continue to embrace the positive impacts of computers and strive for a future filled with endless possibilities.
1722	1726	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 you know that @NUM1 in every @NUM2 @CAPS2 families own a computer? Computers can be helpful if you need to write an essay for school, but when it comes to family vs. computer the average kid will usually pick the computer. Computers are taking away family time, exercise privileges, and time spent on school work. ""@PERSON3, get off the computer and come play '@CAPS3' with us!"" @CAPS4 moms will say this to children at least once a week, the common answer being ""@CAPS5!"" Children from the ages of @NUM3 to @NUM4 would rather spend time on the computer, whether it's playing games or talking with friends.  This is an issue that needs attention. Families should start to spend more time together instead of hanging out in front of a screen. My friend @PERSON1 has a little brother who is always playing games on the computer. Whenever @PERSON1 wants to play hide and go seek with him, he always finds a way out of playing to continue on the computer. Apart from spending time with family, computers take away kids' exercise privileges. Last week, it snowed and I wanted my neighbor @PERSON2 to come outside and have a snowball fight with me, but she said she had to finish a level on a computer game, claiming it was really important. This shows that it takes away time outside and exercise.  A walk in the park with friends sounds relaxing to most people, except for teenagers who would rather talk to their friends using a computer instead of actually spending time with them. Lastly, if time is being spent staring at a screen, when does homework get done? A recent survey among eighth-graders showed that @PERCENT1 of those who don't do their homework are spending too much time on the computer.  In my science class, a boy named @CAPS7 never does his homework. When I asked him why, he said it was because he was talking to his girlfriend who also never does her homework because she always has something to do on the computer. Sacrificing time spent with family, exercise, playing outside, and missing homework assignments for ""just one more level"" on a computer game is concerning.  If we want to help children not spend so much time on the computer, it's essential to address this issue. I urge @ORGANIZATION1 to consider writing an article on this important topic in one of your newspapers and to take into account these ideas for the well-being of our children and families. Thank you for your attention to this matter."
1723	1727	1	3	"@CAPS1 you want people to be overweight? @CAPS1 you want our beautiful outdoors to be ruined? And @CAPS1 you want families to be distant because they are too preoccupied? Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of families don't talk because they are too preoccupied with computer games. The issue to grapple with is if computers have an effect on people. Yes, I think that computers have a negative effect on people based on the following reasons. People spend too much time on the computer and don't get enough exercise, they don't enjoy the nature that we have, and they don't interact with their family and friends. People spend too much time on the computer and don't get enough exercise. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of people who are overweight spend more time on the computer than on the track. I remember a time when I was overweight because I spent too much time on the computer. One day my mom took the computer and threw it out the window, and I had no choice but to go outside and get some exercise. @CAPS1 you want kids to be overweight like I was? Many people don't get to enjoy the great outdoors because they are too preoccupied with the computer. Lisa, a volunteer worker in @LOCATION1, says, ""This field used to be a vast array of plants and animal life, but now it is a wasteland because of computers. No one had the time to worry about the natural wonder because they were too busy with their computer-animated jobs and didn't care what came of it. @CAPS1 you want this to happen to our country? @PERCENT4 of high technological places are dirty with very little plant life because the workers need to tend to the computers rather than the bushes. Some families have a hard time talking about their daily lives because they spend too much time on the computer and don't spend the time to talk and get to know each other. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of divorces are related to not being able to have a conversation, and with more technology on the way, that number will grow. I remember that my parents got divorced because my dad spent more time on the computer than talking to me or my mom. Most people think that computers are good for research. Yes, but you are still cooped up in the house instead of in a big library with all the information you need. I think that computers have a negative impact on people. In conclusion, it is evident that excessive computer usage can lead to detrimental effects on individuals, including lack of physical activity, disconnection from nature, and strained relationships within families. It is crucial to find a balance and prioritize real-life interactions and experiences over virtual ones facilitated by technology."
1724	1728	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,  I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on society. They provide access to a wealth of knowledge, enable people to stay connected with loved ones, and help individuals stay informed about current events.   One key benefit of computers is their ability to connect people across long distances. Video chat platforms, such as @ORGANIZATION1, allow families and friends to communicate face-to-face, bridging the gap between physical distances. This has revolutionized how people maintain relationships and has made it easier for parents to stay in touch with their children away at college.  Moreover, computers play a crucial role in keeping individuals informed about modern life. From online news websites to e-commerce platforms, computers offer a gateway to the latest trends and developments. Companies are increasingly shifting towards online advertising and sales, and educational institutions are embracing online learning opportunities, showcasing the ever-growing importance of computers in our daily lives.  Additionally, computers provide unparalleled access to information through the internet. Websites like Wikipedia and online forums offer a plethora of knowledge on various topics, empowering individuals to learn and explore at their own pace. The internet serves as a vast repository of information, allowing users to delve deep into subjects that interest them.  In conclusion, computers are invaluable tools that enhance our lives in numerous ways. They facilitate communication, provide access to information, and keep us connected to the world around us. As technology continues to advance, the role of computers in society will only grow, shaping a more connected and informed global community.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1725	1729	1	3	Computers have become a significant source of stress in people's daily lives. Whether it's a sudden crash while working on an important document or falling victim to a virus that compromises personal information, the frustration and anxiety caused by computer-related issues can be overwhelming. Additionally, excessive time spent on computers can lead to social isolation, especially among teenagers. When individuals prioritize screen time over face-to-face interactions with friends and family, they miss out on valuable opportunities for connection and physical activity. It is crucial to recognize the negative impact that computers can have on our well-being and find a balance that promotes both productivity and personal relationships. Ultimately, being mindful of the dangers associated with computers can help us navigate the digital world more effectively and protect our mental and physical health.
1726	1730	1	3	Many people debate on whether computers have negative effects on them. Some believe computers are an asset to society because you can access almost anything. However, the abundance of content on computers can be overwhelming and harmful. Derogatory and pornographic websites can have negative effects on individuals, especially on youth. The Chinese government has taken measures to restrict access to such harmful websites. Additionally, excessive gaming on computers can lead to physical health issues, with studies showing a correlation between gaming and overweight children. Moreover, relying solely on the internet for research can lead to inaccuracies and misinformation. It is essential to consider using alternative sources like books for reliable information. From harmful content to physical health concerns and inaccurate research, computers present various challenges to society. In conclusion, computers may not be as beneficial as perceived and can pose significant issues for individuals and society as a whole.
1727	1731	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,   Do people have viruses in their heads that make them need a miracle to pry themselves away from the computer? It seems so, as excessive time spent online can be unhealthy in many ways. Not only is it a waste of time, but it can also lead to trouble that one may wish to avoid.   Take my stepfather, for example. His constant online presence is concerning, as he sits for hours on end, neglecting physical activity and proper nutrition. As we age, the sedentary lifestyle can weaken our bones and limit our mobility, leading to a host of health issues.   Imagine if the time and money spent on computers were redirected towards more productive activities. Sadly, many individuals prioritize their online life over real-world experiences, missing out on the joys of physical activity and human interaction.   While computers can be a valuable tool, it is essential not to let them control our lives. As evidenced by the recent police sirens near my home, engaging in illicit online activities can have severe consequences. I recall a time when I was reprimanded for my online behavior, a stark reminder of the potential trouble that excessive computer use can bring.   In conclusion, it is crucial to strike a balance between our virtual and real lives. Let us not allow the allure of the digital world to consume us, leading to health issues, wasted time, and potential trouble.   Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.   Sincerely, [Your Name]

1730	1734	1	3	Dear Connecticut residents, do you enjoy catching up on your favorite television shows, shopping for the latest trends, or planning get-togethers with friends? In today's world, all of these activities can be easily done on the computer. Despite the ongoing debate about the healthiest benefits of technology, I believe that computers are incredibly useful.  As a young individual with a younger brother, we both spend a significant amount of time on the computer for various reasons beyond just schoolwork. Personally, I love to shop online for discounts and sales, finding items cheaper than in physical stores. On the other hand, my brother enjoys attending concerts and purchasing the latest video games. Even our grandparents, who are not avid TV watchers, can use the computer to catch up on their favorite shows or read the news.  Moreover, social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter allow us to stay connected with friends and family members, regardless of geographical distances. This connectivity is especially beneficial for teenagers and parents, as it helps maintain relationships and foster communication. Additionally, the availability of branded items at lower prices online makes it easier for individuals to access desired products without breaking the bank.  Overall, computers play a vital role in enhancing communication, entertainment, and shopping experiences for people of all ages. While experts continue to evaluate the impact of technology on society, it is clear that computers offer numerous benefits that contribute to our daily lives.

1731	1735	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that the issue of computer addiction is not as prevalent as some may think. Many people are able to balance their time on the computer with other activities such as spending time with family and friends. Computers can actually enhance our lives by allowing us to communicate with others, complete schoolwork, and learn new skills. For example, imagine a situation where a student needs to complete a project that can only be done on a computer. Without access to a computer, they would struggle to complete the assignment. In this way, computers can be a valuable tool in our society. It is not the computer itself that takes us away from important things in life, but rather how we choose to use it. Instead of blaming computers for distractions, we should focus on how we can use them to improve our lives. Ultimately, computers have the potential to benefit us in many ways and are an essential part of modern society.
1732	1736	1	3	@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 you imagine the kids in schools that you yourself run not being able to research on computers? Would you be okay with kids not having the option @ORGANIZATION3 typing their homework? Do you think the adolescence @ORGANIZATION3 @LOCATION2 would want to waste paper because @ORGANIZATION3 their messy handwriting and mistakes? I would hate to live like that, and I hate to live like that, and I know my peers would agree. This is just one @ORGANIZATION3 many reasons why computers have a positive effect on people. Other reaasons include, citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world need an easier way to communicate with each other, and some people have to work at home. I know you as a @ORGANIZATION3 would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would. First @ORGANIZATION3 all, think about the schools that the @ORGANIZATION1 runs. Now picture this; kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers, when typing it would have taken three. Imagine those kids the night before, scribbling words away with their cramped hands, typing to write as quickly as possible. These children have no computers, and therefore their teacher will have to take the time to try and comprehend the illegibal students' handwriting. I @CAPS1 almost see the kids screaming, their eyes darting around as they struggle to finish their high priority papers. If there were no computers, then this is what would happen to children. Also, students use computers for research; learning about different parts @ORGANIZATION3 the world. As a @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you @CAPS1 say that research is a negative affect on school kids. I mean, unless you didn't want them to learn. Secondly, I want you to close your eyes. Think @ORGANIZATION3 yourself calling your best friend who lives in @LOCATION1. He does not pick up, so you walk to your clean, shiny black computer. You hear the clickety-clack @ORGANIZATION3 the keys as you write him a message, and the wooshing sound that your moniter maes when you press send. It is kind @ORGANIZATION3 amazing how advanced our technology is, how @CAPS1 you send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 in a matter @ORGANIZATION3 seconds. You couldn't possibly say that all the hard work put in to makng computers did not have a positive effect, could you? I know that I talk to my friends in @LOCATION3 all the time, but not on the telephoone. You see, my family does not have long distance calling, so if I didn't have a computer, I would never be able to talk to her. I know a lot @ORGANIZATION3 my friends have the same issue, and if not then the time difference between locatiions makes it hard to call people. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want the effect to be that you couldn't talk to some @ORGANIZATION3 your friends anymore? Most importantly, I would like to tell you a story. When @CAPS2 five, my daddy used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part @ORGANIZATION3 everyday. But then, when I was six, my dad got a job that required him to work late every night. He stopped coming home and tucking me in, and I didn't understand why, being as young as I was. I cried every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my dad's boss told him that he could work from home... if he had a computer. His work gave him a computer, and he was back to tucking me in every night, and he still does now. If that wasn't a possible effect, then I don't know what is. Many people are able to work from home with computers, which is just another reason why computers are helpful to all citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I'm you, a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION3, needs a computer to work. Although I @CAPS1 see why some people @MONTH1 oppose to computer, I completely and utterly disagree. Computers help people with working, learning, and even communication! People @MONTH1 think

1734	1738	1	3	Dear readers, People around the world are starting to use computers more often, and I am one who believes that it benefits society. One reason for my belief is that individuals, including teens and adults, can easily chat online with friends when other forms of communication are not available. Additionally, computers are valuable for students who are assigned projects by teachers during vacations or weekends as they can access necessary information online without having to visit a library. Lastly, computers provide the opportunity to learn about new topics and expand knowledge in various areas. In my opinion, computers play a crucial role in enhancing society by facilitating communication, aiding in education, and broadening horizons.
1735	1739	1	3	Dear State legislator, back in your time, computers were non-existent. However, in today's society, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, making tasks easier and more efficient. The use of computers has greatly improved hand-eye coordination, facilitated learning about distant places, and enhanced communication among individuals. For instance, computer games have been proven to enhance hand-eye coordination, leading to a decrease in accidents, as evidenced by statistics from reputable sources. Moreover, the internet allows people to explore and understand locations that are thousands of miles away, enriching their knowledge and understanding of the world. Additionally, computers have revolutionized communication, enabling individuals to stay connected with friends, family, and colleagues through social networking sites and video chatting. In fact, the reliance on computers for work-related tasks is evident in the significant amount of time spent using them in the office. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the invaluable role that computers play in society, improving various aspects of our lives.
1736	1740	1	3	Computers have a positive impact on people by improving hand-eye coordination, providing access to information about distant places, and facilitating online communication. Developing hand-eye coordination through computer use is essential for daily tasks and activities, such as typing and playing sports. Additionally, the ability to learn about faraway places online enhances global awareness and helps individuals stay connected with distant family and friends. Moreover, online communication allows for social interaction and the formation of friendships, particularly beneficial for shy individuals looking to improve their social skills. In conclusion, computers offer valuable benefits that contribute to personal development and connectivity in today's digital age.
1737	1741	1	3	Dear local newspaper,  Do you like computers? Computers help you learn about all kinds of things and let you chat with people even if you can't call them. Another reason why I love computers is because when I have to write a project, I can just type it! Computers make everything easier. So, consider liking computers.  Imagine you have a project due in two days, and you have no information on the subject. Your mom can't drive you to the library, but hey, don't you have a computer? You can look up your subject, and different websites will provide you with the information you need. Most of them will help you learn about the subject, giving you time to finish your project and hang out with your friends.   Furthermore, if you forget what page of the book you're supposed to read or lose your friends' contacts, a computer can save the day. You can email or chat with your friends online to get their phone numbers back or find out what pages to read. Many people find chat and email programs useful for contacting friends, family, and co-workers.  Lastly, typing an essay on the computer can make writing much easier. Instead of spending hours writing by hand, you can use Microsoft Office to type your essay quickly. Many people prefer typing on a computer over writing by hand.  In conclusion, computers are useful technology for chatting with someone, learning about new things, and typing essays and papers. Before dismissing computers as bad, consider how they make our lives easier.  Thank you.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1738	1742	1	3	To whom it may concern; I am writing this to express my thoughts on the impact of computers on people. I believe that both positive and negative effects exist. Computers provide access to information from around the world and facilitate online communication, which has been beneficial for my education and staying connected with others. However, excessive use of computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and social isolation, as seen in cases of addiction to online activities. Despite these drawbacks, I believe that the overall impact of computers is positive. They have greatly aided in academic success by enabling quick access to information and have enhanced communication among families and friends. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a predominantly positive effect on people, despite some potential negative consequences.
1739	1743	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that using computers is a good idea and will help people. So many people all over the world have computers. Computers are good because they help kids learn, communicate with others, and help teach responsibility. Please just listen to what I have to say. First, I believe that computers help kids learn. If you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook. Even if you buy the @PERSON1 you are still learning by taking care of them. There are so many good websites that you can go on like @ORGANIZATION1. People learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters. Also, you can go on google and type in anything you want and it will give you the answer. You use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type. If your teacher gives you a homework assignment why not type it so you learn that skill. This is why computers are good for helping kids learn. Secondly, you can communicate with others from around the world or just your friends. There is a thing called @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2. You use a webcam and talk to anyone you want. There are also websites you can go on to communicate with people from all around the world. It is pretty cool because you don't have to travel there to talk to them. All of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same. People's language could be different or their personality. So many communication tools make computers even better. Lastly, using computers helps teach responsibility. Kids who use the internet know that people need privacy and that comes with responsibility because you should know that. If someone doesn't want to be bothered then don't bother them; that has to do with privacy. Also, you learn to be nice on computers. If you video chatted you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude. That is how you get kicked off of these things. Another thing is people learn to take care of things; a computer is worth a lot of money. Not everyone has one so you should be thankful for what you have. Don't brag, but just know you are privileged to have a computer. These reasons show why computers are good. So if you ever consider getting a computer, the answer is yes because computers help kids learn, you can communicate with others, and you learn responsibility. Now you know computers are really good for kids, not that bad. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in enhancing learning, communication, and responsibility among children, making them a valuable tool for personal growth and development.

1741	1745	1	3	Dear local newspaper, years ago computers didn't exist, but now many people have the internet in their homes. Some argue that the effect is negative, but I believe that computers have a positive impact on people in many ways. The internet allows people to stay connected, develop technology skills for high-tech jobs, and discover new information.   Computers enable individuals to communicate with others from all over the world, bridging distances and keeping relationships intact. This ease of communication also extends to family members who may be far away, allowing for frequent contact and closeness.   Moreover, in today's technology-driven world, possessing computer skills is essential for obtaining better job opportunities. Many professions require technological proficiency, and early exposure to computers prepares individuals for success in the workforce.   Additionally, computers provide a quick and efficient way to access information and learn about various topics. Researching on the internet is convenient and offers a wealth of knowledge at one's fingertips. While books are valuable, computers serve as valuable tools for expanding one's understanding of the world.   In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in society by fostering connections, enhancing skills for employment, and facilitating learning. Despite some concerns, the positive impact of computers on people's lives cannot be denied.
1742	1746	1	3	Computers have become an essential tool in today's world, offering a wealth of knowledge and convenience at our fingertips. With the ability to access information instantly through search engines like Google, we can expand our understanding of the world around us. Maps provide us with directions and a global perspective, while educational websites help students with their homework. Communication has also been revolutionized, with social media platforms and email allowing us to stay connected with friends and family in real-time. The introduction of webcams has taken this a step further, enabling face-to-face interactions even when miles apart. The computer is truly a remarkable invention that continues to enhance our lives in countless ways.
1743	1747	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think computer technology is good for various reasons. One of the benefits of using a computer is that it allows individuals to work independently without needing assistance from others. By researching information online, completing homework becomes easier and more efficient, leading to better academic performance. Additionally, the ability to work online enables tasks to be completed quicker and with more convenience.  Another positive aspect of computer technology is the opportunity to communicate with friends online. This is especially beneficial for individuals who may not have access to a cell phone or who want to connect with friends in a different way. Online communication also allows people to stay in touch with relatives they may not have seen in a while, fostering relationships and connections.  Furthermore, using a computer can improve hand coordination skills as individuals learn to navigate the keyboard and mouse effectively. This can enhance motor skills and dexterity, benefiting overall cognitive development. Moreover, being able to surf the web and learn about different topics online can broaden one's knowledge and understanding of the world. With time, individuals can become proficient in navigating the internet and finding relevant information efficiently.  In conclusion, computer technology has various positive effects, including enhancing independent work, facilitating online communication, improving hand coordination, and expanding knowledge through web surfing. These benefits demonstrate the value of incorporating computers into our daily lives.
1744	1748	1	3	Dear local newspaper: I strongly feel that computer technology has a negative effect on the people of our society. People are spending too much time on computers, neglecting physical activity and face-to-face interactions with family and friends. It is crucial to prioritize exercise in our daily routines to maintain good health. Engaging in activities like walking, biking, jogging, and participating in community service projects can significantly improve our physical and mental well-being. Additionally, spending quality time with family through game nights and socializing with friends can strengthen relationships and enhance social skills. By making a conscious effort to exercise regularly and foster personal connections, we can reduce our dependence on computers and lead healthier, more fulfilling lives. Let's work together to create a balance between technology and real-life interactions for a happier and healthier society.
1745	1749	1	3	Dear newspaper, I believe that computers have revolutionized the way we research and stay connected. Not only are they great for researching things like cars or places, but they also allow us to keep in touch with our loved ones through email, webcam chats, and instant messaging.   I think more people should embrace technology like computers because they offer a wide range of capabilities. From saving photos and downloading music to playing games and learning about different countries and cultures, there is so much to explore and discover.   While some may argue that spending too much time on computers is detrimental, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. In today's digital age, it is important to embrace technology and all the opportunities it offers for learning and connection.   In conclusion, computers are a valuable tool that enhances our lives in many ways. Embracing technology can open up new possibilities and enrich our experiences, making it a worthwhile investment of time and energy.
1746	1750	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, People all around the globe are using computers! Some people think this is a bad idea but I disagree. I believe that computers do have a positive effect on a person's lifestyle. Computers help people stay in touch, computers are only getting better, and they help kids in many ways.   Computers definitely help people keep in touch. There is email, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and even video chat options available. For example, my cousin lives in another state, and we are able to stay connected through video chat, which would not be possible without computers. Many people around the world use computers to communicate and maintain relationships.  Moreover, computers are constantly advancing, and it is exciting to think about the possibilities in the future. With technology progressing rapidly, the capabilities of computers are expected to improve significantly in the coming years. This continuous evolution of computers encourages innovation and drives further developments in the field.  Lastly, computers play a significant role in aiding children in various aspects of their lives. Whether it is for schoolwork, entertainment, or learning new skills, computers are valuable tools for kids. They provide access to a wealth of information and resources that can enhance a child's education and overall development.  In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering numerous benefits such as facilitating communication, advancing technology, and supporting children's growth and learning. Embracing the use of computers can enrich our lives and enable us to stay connected in an ever-changing digital world.
1747	1751	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe that computers don't benefit society as much as people think. I think that nature can provide all of the same qualities than any computer can. A computer cannot provide fitness, real interactions with friends or family, or experience in the real world. Did you know that 20% of children in our community are overweight because of a lack of exercising? According to experts from a health organization and a research institute, computer systems are the leading cause of a lack of exercise. So why would a system that leads to obesity be considered a benefit to society? Another issue on that topic is that overweight children that spend excessive hours on computers put off healthy activities such as basketball or tennis, which also leaves them socially behind and lacking in healthy experiences.  People think that computers know everything, but the truth is that there are very little things you can experience on a computer. For example, you may read about World War II, but do you really know what people were thinking or what the combat felt like? A computer cannot teach you how to feel; only a real-life experience can do so. My final explanation for how computers are not the greatest influence on society is true-life interactions with your family and friends. There is only one true way to see family or friends, and that is in person. People claim that they talk to their friends and family over the internet all the time, but the only way to be satisfied is by seeing them in real life. For example, a romantic relationship would fail if the only way they communicated was through the internet, unlike most relationships that succeed.  I hope my letter to your newspaper will get people's attention. I would appreciate it if you joined my cause and helped protect society from dangerous computer technology that could cause obesity, bad relations, and inexperience. Let's work together to prioritize real-life experiences over excessive computer use for a healthier and more fulfilling society.
1748	1752	1	3	"Computers can have a negative impact on people's lives, especially children. Excessive time spent on computers can lead to poor academic performance and a lack of exercise. Many students come home and immediately immerse themselves in online activities, neglecting their schoolwork and physical health. Parents may also be guilty of spending excessive time on computers, engaging in activities that do not add value to their lives.  It is essential to recognize the dangers of certain websites, as they can expose users to harmful content and risky behaviors. For example, there have been cases where teenagers have been lured into participating in dangerous online challenges that have resulted in tragic consequences. Additionally, platforms like ""blogtv.com"" can encourage inappropriate behavior and expose users to exploitation.  It is crucial for individuals to prioritize real-life interactions and activities over excessive screen time. Spending quality time with family and friends, engaging in physical exercise, and pursuing meaningful hobbies are essential for overall well-being. By reducing dependence on computers and being mindful of online activities, individuals can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives. Remember, the allure of the screen should not overshadow the importance of real-world experiences."
1749	1753	1	3	To whom it may concern, many hours a day do you spend on the computer? Too many is my guess! They are warping the minds of people all over, and in my opinion things should go back to the way they used to be. Some people may disagree, and say that computers help children who are in school. That may be true, but honestly only a couple of decades ago the average student didn't even own a computer, and schools were teaching the same materials without the usage of them. Also, some children use computers to cheat on homework assignments and essays, and I'm sure many people would agree that that is not helping education for schools. Another reason computers may not benefit society is because of the dangers of them. Sexual predators swarm the internet, and many people talk to strangers over the internet that could be harmful, without even realizing it. A third reason computers may not be helpful to society is the negative impact they have on physical health, such as eye strain and poor posture from excessive screen time. As you can see, I feel very strongly about the negative effects that computers have on society, for many reasons. I hope you can agree with me.
1750	1754	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, the men and women who write everyday for a living, I would like you to write an article on the positive impact of computers on individuals. Computers play a crucial role in our daily lives by allowing us to explore faraway places, enhancing hand-eye coordination, and facilitating online communication. First and foremost, computers provide a gateway for individuals to learn about distant locations without physically traveling. For instance, a friend of my mother decided to relocate to a new country without thoroughly researching its laws due to her aversion to computers. This lack of knowledge led to multiple unintentional arrests in her initial years in the foreign land. With a simple online search, she could have avoided these legal troubles and stayed in her home country. Secondly, computers contribute to the improvement of hand-eye coordination, as evidenced by a survey indicating that children who spend more time on computers exhibit better skills in sports like tennis and baseball. This demonstrates the beneficial effects of computer usage on physical abilities. Additionally, computers enable individuals to communicate with others worldwide through online platforms. This feature is particularly valuable for maintaining connections with distant family members and friends, as well as for conducting international business transactions. In conclusion, computers offer numerous advantages, including the ability to learn about distant places, enhance hand-eye coordination, and facilitate global communication. By highlighting these benefits, more people will recognize the importance of incorporating computers into their daily routines.
1751	1755	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,   Computers play a vital role in our daily lives, impacting millions of people in a positive way. One of the key benefits of computers is their ability to facilitate research. With just a few clicks, individuals can access a wealth of information on a wide range of topics, helping them expand their knowledge and understanding. Whether it's for work, school, or personal interest, computers make the process of gathering information quick and convenient.  Additionally, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate. Through emails, instant messaging, and video calls, people can stay connected with friends and family members across the globe. This level of connectivity was unimaginable before the advent of computers, making it easier for individuals to maintain relationships and share important moments with loved ones.  Furthermore, computers serve as a valuable news resource, providing real-time updates on current events and breaking news. Instead of waiting for the newspaper to arrive, individuals can simply log onto their computers to access the latest information from around the world. This instant access to news helps people stay informed and engaged with what's happening in their community and beyond.  In conclusion, the positive impact of computers on people's lives is undeniable. From facilitating research and communication to serving as a reliable news source, computers have made various aspects of life more manageable and efficient. Embracing technology and leveraging the benefits of computers can greatly enhance the way we live and interact with the world around us.
1752	1756	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, your computer daily can be a waste of your life. Your computer time can take away from your time spent exercising and enjoying nature, distract you from human interaction, and waste tons of energy. Sitting at your desk, talking to friends online, not burning any calories or exercising muscles, isn't a productive use of time. Shouldn't you be doing something more useful, like taking a walk and appreciating nature? Obesity is a significant issue in our community, with a high percentage of individuals considered overweight. Spending the day sitting in a chair isn't beneficial for your health. Communication through emojis and online messages can hinder genuine emotional expression and cause you to miss important information. Additionally, constant computer usage consumes a significant amount of energy, which isn't cost-effective, especially in today's challenging economic climate. Computers can detract from enjoying nature, reduce genuine communication, and waste energy unnecessarily. Therefore, it's essential to reconsider the excessive use of computers in daily life.
1753	1757	1	3	"I believe the reason why people use the computer so much is because most people might have to work on the computer or maybe even finish a project. But I understand the part when the article said ""Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less exercising."" Mostly young teens use the computer at an early age and become hooked because there are so many things to do on the computer like download games for free and play with others. People around the world use the computer, but not everyone plays video games or has free time. Most adults use the computer for work or research an article. The internet has opened up a lot of new enhanced technology over the past few years. You can search for old friends from school or chat with people from all over the world. You can have an email address and buy new songs or albums online instead of going to a local store. You can also shop online and have clothes delivered to you. Renting or buying movies to watch at home is also a popular activity. The internet has truly revolutionized the way we live our lives, making things more convenient and accessible. In conclusion, while the computer offers many benefits and conveniences, it is important to balance screen time with physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle."
1754	1758	1	3	Dear local newspaper, on a beautiful sunny day, people are choosing to stay indoors on their computers instead of enjoying the weather. This trend can have detrimental effects on individuals. Computers can negatively impact communication skills, decrease physical activity, and harm overall health.   Communication skills are at risk as people spend more time online. Engaging in chat rooms can expose individuals to potential dangers such as sharing personal information with strangers. This can lead to serious consequences like kidnapping or exploitation. Furthermore, excessive use of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter can disrupt face-to-face interactions with family and friends, ultimately reducing overall communication abilities.  In addition to communication challenges, lack of exercise is a growing concern. Many individuals, particularly children, are opting for sedentary activities like playing computer games or video chatting with friends instead of engaging in physical activities. This decrease in physical activity can contribute to obesity and other health issues, ultimately impacting the well-being of individuals and communities.  Moreover, prolonged computer use can have negative effects on health. Eye strain from staring at screens can lead to vision problems, requiring interventions like cataract surgery. Additionally, repetitive movements associated with typing and using a mouse can increase the risk of developing conditions like arthritis in the hands and fingers.  It is evident that excessive computer use can have far-reaching consequences on individuals' communication skills, physical activity levels, and overall health. It is crucial for individuals to be mindful of their screen time and prioritize activities that promote well-being. By striking a balance between technology use and other activities, individuals can safeguard their health and social connections for a healthier future.
1755	1759	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a negative impact on people's lives. Computers take up a significant amount of time that could be better spent on more important matters. Additionally, the internet is filled with inappropriate content that children should not be exposed to. Furthermore, there is a serious issue of predators online targeting young children. These are all ways in which computers have a negative influence on individuals.  Computers consume a large portion of people's time, diverting their attention from activities that promote physical and mental well-being. For instance, excessive computer usage has been linked to the rising rates of childhood obesity in America. Many individuals, like my brother, become so engrossed in computer activities that they neglect outdoor exercise and other healthy pursuits.  Moreover, the internet is a vast repository of content, ranging from harmless entertainment to explicit material. Unfortunately, many websites do not have sufficient age restrictions or parental controls in place, making it easy for children to access inappropriate content online. This poses a significant risk to their emotional and psychological development.  Most alarmingly, there are numerous predators online who use the anonymity of the internet to target vulnerable individuals, particularly children and teenagers. These individuals masquerade as peers on social media and chat platforms, deceiving young users into meeting them in person with harmful intentions. This dangerous trend is facilitated by the unrestricted access to the internet that computers provide.  In conclusion, the negative aspects of computers, such as time consumption, exposure to inappropriate content, and online predators, outweigh any potential benefits they may offer. It is evident that the presence of computers in our lives has led to detrimental consequences, particularly for our youth. Therefore, I believe that society would be better off without computers.
1756	1760	1	3	I think we can all agree that computer usage is a very controversial issue. In my opinion, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people. For instance, it's not safe and children can get into all sorts of things on the internet. Also, people spend too much time in front of the computer nowadays, it's a major distraction and also a negative effect on kids' school work. Isn't every parent's biggest concern the safety of their children? When on the internet, kids are capable of accessing anything and everything. Sometimes kids don't even look for bad things, they just pop up. Would you want your child viewing things that you have no control over? Also, websites like social media platforms are one of the greatest concerns when it comes to internet safety. Although you are supposed to be at least 13 to have a profile, most kids lie about their age. Did you know that 2 out of 3 social media users lie about their age? And it's not always a 14-year-old saying they are 13, it could be a 16-year-old saying they're 17! Not only do people lie about their age, they lie about who they are. Is this the kind of internet exposure you want for your children? Put a stop to this right now!   More than 40% of adults are overweight and unhealthy. This is another negative effect computers have on people. It's a gorgeous sunny day. Perfect day to go out and get active, right? Wrong! Many people would rather be inside on the computer. Instead of going for a walk, people spend hours on social media. This is a serious concern for our health. People don't exercise enough as it is, and then when you add computers, people will never get active! Instead of playing video games online, people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun neighborhood game of baseball is just as fun and much more beneficial. This is just one step we need to take to get a healthier lifestyle.   Did you know that kids that spend more time on computers are more likely to do poorly in school? Surely, if nothing else will convince you of the negative effects of a computer, then coming home and doing homework, more time is spent in front of the computer. As a student, I will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies. You can't expect a child to make the right decision and tell their friends they have to go because they need to study. So take action now, or your child will definitely suffer. The time has come to decide. Do you believe computers have a negative effect on people? It's clear that the computer is not safe. Not to mention, too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active. Most importantly, computers will negatively affect children's grades. Don't wait another minute! Let's agree and do something about this! In conclusion, the negative effects of computers on people's safety, health, and academic performance cannot be ignored. It's time to prioritize a balanced approach to computer usage for a healthier and more productive lifestyle.
1757	1761	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, Computers are very helpful in daily activities, but computers have a bad side. Some users are addicted to their devices, which can lead them to be away from friends and family, as well as neglecting exercise. It is fun to use technology, but it is important not to use it too much. Some people are almost addicted to their devices, finding themselves constantly checking social media, playing games, or listening to music.   Being glued to a computer or phone can make individuals miss out on important activities and interactions. People may feel compelled to constantly check their social media accounts or play online games, leading them to spend less time with loved ones. This can create a disconnect from real-life relationships and experiences.   Moreover, excessive use of technology can also contribute to physical inactivity. People may procrastinate on exercising or going to the gym because they are too engrossed in their devices. Spending hours on end in front of a screen can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which is detrimental to overall health and well-being.   In conclusion, while computers and technology have many benefits, it is crucial to be mindful of the negative effects of excessive use. It is important to find a balance and limit screen time to ensure that we are not sacrificing real-life connections, physical activity, and overall well-being for the sake of digital entertainment.
1758	1762	1	3	Dear Newspaper,   @CAPS1 are worried that people are on the computer way too much and don't spend enough time outside enjoying nature or exercising. I wrote this letter to tell you that there are some good things about going on the computer. First, kids and even adults can talk to their friends online. People might think that kids already have friends at school, but what if their friends moved? They could have moved to a different city, state, or even country, and the only way to connect with them is through the computer. They can't call each other if they are really far away; that would be a pretty expensive phone bill. Seventy-five percent of people talk to their friends through the computer, and about half of them are talking to friends who live in another state or country. Do you really want people to lose their friends?   Next, people can actually make new friends on the computer, like pen pals. Pen pals are people you write to who don't live in the same state as you, or sometimes not even the same country. It could be an assignment at school, but you can do it on your own. If your pen pal doesn't live in the same country as you and doesn't speak fluent English, you can teach them English, and they can teach you their language.   Finally, there's a way for kids to go on the computer with a schedule. You could set a limit on their computer time. If someone wants to play a game on the computer, and it's not their turn, they can play on the computer away from the person who is using it. If someone wants to go on the computer that day and throws a tantrum, the parent should take the computer away for the next day, and so on. Once your child finally cooperates, they will get the chance to use the computer.   As you can see, there are many things to do on the computer, from talking to far away friends to making new friends and having a computer schedule. Thank you for taking your time to read this letter.
1759	1763	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper: Did you know that over half our nation owns home computers? Recently, some experts have been debating whether computers benefit society. In my opinion, computers have a positive impact because they are essential for work, enable online socialization, and facilitate travel planning.   Firstly, computers are crucial for work and education. Students rely on computers to store assignments and study materials, while offices cannot function without them. A student from a local university mentioned, ""I use my computer for everything; it helps me stay organized and conduct research efficiently."" Without computers, both students and professionals would struggle to keep up with their workload.   Secondly, internet access allows people to connect with others online. Social networking sites have become a popular platform for reconnecting with old friends and making new ones. A large percentage of the population owns social media accounts, indicating the widespread use of online socialization. For many individuals, online interactions provide a valuable opportunity to expand their social circles.  Lastly, computers make travel planning easier and more convenient. With the internet, people can research destinations, book flights, and accommodations with just a few clicks. An increasing number of travelers prefer to book their trips online, citing the convenience and time-saving benefits. Without online booking options, the process of planning a trip would be significantly more cumbersome.  In conclusion, computers play a vital role in modern society by enhancing productivity, facilitating social connections, and simplifying travel arrangements. Their presence has become indispensable in various aspects of our daily lives, and it is clear that computers have a positive impact on individuals and society as a whole."
1760	1764	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, The advancing technology is showing a very negative effect on people. Because of computers, people are spending too much time on the computer and less time doing things that are better for them. First, spending too much time on the computer can be bad for your health in many ways. For example, looking at a bright computer screen for more than 20 minutes at a time is extremely bad for your eyes. The brightness damages your eyes and can lead to severe loss of vision. Also, if you spend all of your time indoors and on the computer, you will not get the exercise you need. Did you know that for every 30 minutes you are on the computer, you should spend 30 minutes outside? It is very important to get fresh air, sunlight, and exercise.  Moreover, another problem with computers is that you don't get as much interaction with people. With online chatting, you can't know what the other person is feeling like, or if you are even talking to the person you think you're talking to. It is much better to interact with people in person, face to face. To have good social health, you need to hang out with friends, laugh, and have a good time, not sit in a dark room and talk with online friends. People need to interact with real people.  Furthermore, computers can be very distracting to many people. For example, say you needed to type up an article for the paper on the computer, but you decide to play a game for a minute, look something up, or talk with a friend. You say that it will only take a minute and then you will type the article. But when you stop, all of a sudden you have played for 4 hours. Then you have to stay up later to finish. Computers are extremely distracting, and people of all ages have this problem of being distracted by computers and not getting work done.  In conclusion, computers, although an advance in technology, have very negative side effects. I feel that it is our job to tell people about the negative side effects of computers and help them overcome these effects. We need to help people by writing an article in the paper to warn them of the terrible effects computers can have. It is important to raise awareness and promote a healthier balance between technology use and real-life interactions.
1761	1765	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers are good because you get to learn about other people like famous individuals who passed away a long time ago. Computers are beneficial because you can explore different places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, and Texas. Learning about different locations can be enjoyable. Having a computer allows you to surf the web, play games, and engage in various activities that you may find interesting. Additionally, you can communicate with friends who are far away through platforms like MySpace or Yahoo. These websites enable you to connect with different people you have met online. In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of opportunities for learning, entertainment, and social interaction, making them a valuable tool in today's digital age.
1762	1766	1	3	Man has always been fascinated by technology, with computers being just one aspect of this interest. Computers have a positive impact on individuals, enhancing hand-eye coordination, conserving trees, and facilitating learning. Hand-eye coordination plays a crucial role in daily activities such as driving and writing, and using computers can improve this skill significantly. Additionally, computers contribute to saving trees by eliminating the need for paper, ultimately aiding in environmental conservation. Furthermore, computers serve as powerful tools for learning, offering access to a vast array of information and educational resources. Through the use of computers, individuals can acquire knowledge on various subjects, communicate with experts, and even receive medical assistance. Overall, computers have revolutionized the way we live and learn, making a significant and beneficial impact on society.
1763	1767	1	3	Guaranteed, in the years to come, we will still rely heavily on computers for various tasks such as communication, research, and academic work. Computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, enabling us to connect with others, access information quickly, and complete assignments efficiently. Without computers, our daily routines and activities would be drastically different. From collaborating with friends on homework to conducting research online, computers have revolutionized the way we work and communicate. The advancement of technology in computers continues to enhance our capabilities and streamline our tasks. It is clear that computers play a crucial role in shaping the modern world, and their significance will only increase as time goes on.
1764	1768	1	3	I think the effects of the computer are bad, these are my three reasons why I think its bad; first, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time or hours on their computers. People need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers. Lastly, people need to use computers for a less time. These are the three reasons why I think the effects of the computer are bad. The computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers because the screen of the computer has too much light, and people can't just stop staring at the monitor, potentially leading to sight problems. People need to relax their vision and do something other than being on their computers to enjoy nature, interact with friends and family, or engage in other activities like reading or drawing. Lastly, using computers for a shorter amount of time can help save energy, reduce electricity bills, and allow for much-needed relaxation of the eyes. In conclusion, spending excessive time on computers can have negative consequences, so it's essential to limit usage for better overall well-being.
1765	1769	1	3	Dear editor, I think people are using computers too much and are not benefiting as much as losing from it. People are getting less exercise, not seeing nature, and not spending as much quality time with their family and friends.  Firstly, people are not getting enough exercise, especially children. They spend too much time on computers and are becoming overweight. America is facing a crisis with child obesity, and computers have contributed to that. Many adults are also overweight because they sit at computers for work or play games all day. It is evident that computers are more unhealthy for us.  Secondly, people are not going on hikes or trips to see the beauties of nature. The Earth has many things to offer, new things to explore and discover. People can discover great wonders, find new species, and explore nature for animals, fish, and plants. There are many wonders out there waiting to be discovered, making it clear that computers are not benefiting us in this aspect.  Thirdly, family and friends are not spending as much quality time together as they should. Relatives communicate over computers, but why not talk to them in real life? Friends chat online on social media platforms, but why not talk to each other in person and create fun memories together? More kids are spending time on the computer than sitting down to eat a family meal together and experience what a family should talk about. This indicates that computers are not benefiting us in terms of family and social interactions.  In conclusion, computers are consuming our time and minds, leading to a lack of exercise, a disconnection from nature, and a decrease in quality time spent with family and friends. It is essential to find a balance and prioritize real-life experiences over excessive computer usage for overall well-being and fulfillment.
1766	1770	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, experts have expressed concerns about the amount of time people spend on computers, suggesting it may be detrimental to their health. However, I believe that computers actually bring numerous benefits to our lives.   Firstly, computers play a crucial role in facilitating communication. While some may argue that phones are more convenient, computers offer the advantage of long-distance communication without additional costs. Whether it's sending emails to friends and family across the globe or engaging in video calls, computers make staying connected easier than ever.   Additionally, computers are invaluable tools for education. Many individuals are pursuing online courses and degrees, enabling them to further their education while balancing work and other commitments. Furthermore, computers provide instant access to a wealth of information, making learning more accessible and convenient.  Lastly, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options. From watching videos to playing games, computers provide endless opportunities for relaxation and enjoyment. Music lovers can access a vast library of songs and music videos at their fingertips, without the need to purchase individual tracks.  In conclusion, computers significantly enhance our lives by facilitating communication, education, and entertainment. Despite concerns about excessive screen time, the benefits of computers cannot be ignored. Embracing technology responsibly can lead to a more connected, informed, and enjoyable existence.
1767	1771	1	3	Computers are an essential part of everyday life, serving as valuable information posts that keep us connected to the world around us. With the rise of interactive websites and social networks, children are able to communicate and make friends more easily than ever before. Additionally, computers play a crucial role in education, allowing students to complete projects and assignments efficiently. It is important to recognize the numerous benefits that computers bring to our lives and to ensure that everyone has access to these valuable resources. By embracing technology and its many advantages, we can all work towards a more connected and informed society.
1768	1772	1	3	Dear Newspaper Readers, how many hours a day do you spend on the computer? In this modern world, it may seem hard for you to tear away from that trusty computer screen and face life. Nearly everyone in our country has a computer, about 80%, and it is ruining our country. With all these hours wasted in the virtual world, people are lacking in exercise, leading to many problems. They are also avoiding nature outside, and losing contact with family and friends. I think that computers are causing way too many problems and perhaps, with some consideration of my evidence, you could come to think the same.  Statistically, our country is the most overweight country. One of the reasons? Hours spent sitting at the computer replace healthy exercise. We are all spending our lives on the computer, and sitting and clicking is not exercise. The great lack of exercise is causing health problems. Not exercising can lead to obesity, which damages joints terribly. Then, diabetes develops, taking away from the quality of your life. Finally, there is heart disease, a top killer in our country. All this from spending time on the computer? you may ask, but the amount of time we spend on computers is much more damaging than this.  Every day is beautiful in its own way, and sometimes what is beautiful to us (when it comes to the outdoors) is clear skies and warm temperatures. These days come quite often, but what do we do? Glance out the window and go back to texting on that laptop. Our bodies need this sunlight, as we get vitamin D from the sun, and without going outside, we don't get it. Not traveling outdoors deprives our bodies of an important vitamin. It affects more than just our health, as well; staying inside on the computer keeps us from having real experiences.  We learn things on the computer, but only virtually. What happens when we are forced out into the real world and can't really do anything? Everyone loves having friends and family, so it doesn't make sense why we would rather email them with trivial things instead of talking. Instant messaging doesn't really bond people, as conversations are planned out and you have time to think, so the person doesn't know what the real you would say. This frays the bonds between people, and once we can't work together, even with family, we can't work together at all, and nobody wants that.  Computers take away too much to be spending so much time on. Blatantly, they are bad for people. Not only do they effectively cause obesity, they fool us into thinking we can do things that really, we can only do virtually, and make close people come apart. It's ruining our country. A country cannot be led by the sick, useless, and isolated. It's time to step away from the computer and into real life before our country gets demolished by the effects computers cause. Let's prioritize real-life experiences, exercise, and human connections over the virtual world for a healthier, happier society.
1769	1773	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have recently read that there are some people who do not agree with computers. They believe that people use them all the time. I disagree with them. One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over, wouldn't you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many can't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, it's a great idea if you want to send a small message like ""see you at @NUM1"", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when it's free on the computer. The computer also teaches hand-eye coordination that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quizzes and tests, go to school on the internet, even listen to music, which is important for us to express. Also, there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even being there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have fun in the shining sun. Many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselves to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place. So, the computer teaches hand-eye coordination, allows you to talk to others, and allows you to see far away places. Don't you think that is great? Think about it."
1770	1774	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2 (our local newspaper), @CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people have begun to use computers. This is a great advancement in our society! Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. @ORGANIZATION1, computers are making a great impact! Firstly, computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination. This is useful in daily life all the time! Statistics show that sports players who own computers are @PERCENT1 more talented at things requiring their hands (like baseball or basketball) than those who do not own computers. Owning a computer improves the way you use your hands in other activities too. Something as simple as driving a car or doing the dishes is made easier thanks to the improvement in hand-eye coordination computers bring. This is a fantastic effect that computers have on people. In addition to the hand-eye coordination computers teach, they also help you learn about faraway places and people. This splendid information is easier to acquire thanks to the technology of computers. ""@CAPS2 I didn't use my laptop for my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 report,"" says @PERSON1, a @NUM1 grade student, ""I would never finish. Books take so long and I learned so much about my topic from my computer!"" @CAPS2 you are going on vacation, You can easily research your destination's location and culture with this advanced search engine. Why wouldn't you use a computer when you learn so much from them? Finally, computers have a positive effect on people because they help them communicate with each other. They have lots of ways to video chat, @CAPS6 message, and even speak aloud to the person you want to communicate with. ""I had to move away from my best friend last @DATE1,"" says @PERSON3, a resident of @LOCATION1, ""With my computer we can still talk to each other and stay friends."" Computers are definitely a great way to communicate with friends and family. Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with each other. So, @PERSON2, the increasing number of computer users is a beautiful thing! Ask yourself this, how would computers have a positive effect in your life?  In conclusion, the widespread use of computers is undeniably beneficial to individuals in various ways. From enhancing hand-eye coordination to facilitating learning and communication, computers have become an integral part of modern life, enriching our experiences and interactions. Embracing this technological advancement can lead to countless advantages and opportunities for personal growth and connectivity."

1772	1776	1	3	Technology, such as computers, plays a significant role in people's lives, offering various benefits. One major advantage is the ability to connect with family members who are far away through video chatting or emailing. This helps maintain relationships and bridge the distance between loved ones. Additionally, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter allow individuals to reconnect with old friends, further enhancing their social connections.  Moreover, computers aid in academic settings by providing tools like Microsoft Word and Excel for creating organized and professional-looking documents and presentations. Teachers appreciate the use of technology in completing assignments as it makes the work more readable and visually appealing. Research is also made easier with the help of search engines like Google and Yahoo, enabling students to access vast amounts of information quickly and efficiently.

Embracing technology can enhance various aspects of life and contribute to overall efficiency and connectivity in today's digital age.
1773	1777	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers have advanced significantly since their inception, sparking debates on whether they have a negative or positive impact on individuals, especially children. While some argue that computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity among children, there are also numerous benefits to utilizing computers for educational and communication purposes.   On the negative side, some parents use computers as a way to keep their children occupied, leading to excessive screen time and a lack of outdoor activities. This sedentary behavior can contribute to obesity and other health issues in children. Additionally, constant exposure to computer screens can potentially have adverse effects on their physical and mental development.   However, on the positive side, computers provide a wealth of information that allows individuals to learn about distant places and cultures. With just a few clicks, one can access a plethora of information about any topic, making research and learning more convenient and efficient. Moreover, computers enable people to connect with others around the world through online communication platforms, fostering relationships and expanding social networks.   In conclusion, while computers can have negative implications on children's health and development, their positive aspects, such as facilitating learning and enhancing communication, outweigh the drawbacks. It is essential for individuals, especially parents, to strike a balance between computer use and physical activities to ensure a well-rounded and healthy lifestyle.
1774	1778	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a significant impact on people's health and lifestyle habits. With the constant use of computers, individuals are not getting enough exercise as they are primarily using their fingers while typing or clicking. This lack of physical activity can lead to various health issues in the long run.  Furthermore, prolonged screen time on computers can also have adverse effects on one's overall health. People tend to focus solely on the screen and ignore their surroundings, which can strain their eyes and lead to issues like digital eye strain.  Moreover, the convenience of quick and easily accessible junk food while using the computer often leads to poor dietary choices. This unhealthy eating habit can contribute to weight gain and other health problems.  Overall, the impact of excessive computer use on people's physical activity, screen time, and dietary habits can have a detrimental effect on their health and well-being. It is essential for individuals to be mindful of their computer usage and incorporate healthy habits into their daily routine to maintain a balanced lifestyle.
1775	1779	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1, *@CAPS1*. Now I hear my favorite @CAPS2 tunes. A few clicks here and type in a word and I am watching a funny episode of ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 #@NUM1"". I go to my @CAPS5 page and feel the cool keys under my fingertips as I send @CAPS7 to my friend in @LOCATION3. These are only some things I can do on my computer. As you can see I need my computer for many things. I am all for using computers and I think they are a useful resource. But don't stop now, I have many more reasons for using computers. They're not all that bad. Primarily, if you want to save money on gas, don't use your car!! I can't stress enough to say that if you need to talk to a friend far away don't drive and waste gas, or even waste money on long-distance calls. Go to email, facebook, twitter, or something that will save you gas and money. Some people want to talk to their friends in @LOCATION2 but they don't have any of these computer sites. Persuade them too!! Another issue some face is, ""You need to get out and exercise."" I have only one answer. Most people don't know the right ways to exercise. Then, they end up hurting themselves. If they just went online and found out that they could do a painless, priceless, fun workout that is very effective then they would not get in so much physical and financial trouble. Also, others complain that people need to spend more time in nature. Well, I say, what if you encounter a wild animal that you know nothing about, or say you were lost for days and didn't know what you could or could not eat? Like I always say, ""Better safe than sorry"" remember @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, if you're doing a report or something formal, you want it to look nice, right? Well, most out of 10 people in the @LOCATION4 have messy handwriting and 9/10 teachers mistake words that are messily handwritten. This shows that if you use a computer it will not only show the word you wrote but also correct it with spell check. In conclusion, there are many benefits to using a computer. Let's recap, computers can save money, time, and gas. Computers can provide useful information in the real world. They can also correct spelling mistakes as well as prevent mistakes in legibility. Act now!!! Show others that there are benefits to using computers, show them all the wonders of this amazing machine, That is not only a time waster but a life saver."

1777	1781	1	3	Mom!!! Did you know that the human body has only one liver!!!, @CAPS1 I didn't where did you find out, on the computer. I recently heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, and enjoying nature. I dont think that they should be concerned because the computer leave's people with an open mind and teach people new thing. So the computer does a lot for people, give's them the chance to learn new thing, a chance to chat with friends far away, and also expand your mind of travel. Computers can do a lot for a person's life of know'lleage. Just yesterday I found out that the human body can not survive without its liver. The computer also helped me with my strugle's in math, even though that's what the teacher is for she is not always their, like when I am home or away on vacation and I just want to remember so thing's in math. Its also help's people who want to know new launage's such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4. So you see a computer has a big affect on a person's life. Two days ago I did a video chat with my grandparents back in @LOCATION2 it was great. After six year's not seeing my grandparents they really changed, and I was starting to forget what they looked like. I never knew that a computer could do a video chat from so far away I was surprised. I dont know why you experts are so concerned about computer taking away people's live's look what it has done for my family. I know that if one of you experts family member went away for a long time you would miss them and want to talk. Some people's love to video chat like people in the army because they get the chance to see their love one's. A two-way ticket to @LOCATION3, To see all those beautiful sight's and taste their wonderful food's look at that waterfall where is that, In @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1 now I have to go their. The computer has shone me places that I have neve sene before. The computer is a wonderful thing. So dont be concerned about us and what we do on the computer. In conclusion dont listen to the experts they dont know what their talking about, for all we know they use the computer more than we do. The compute can touch you new thing, give you the chance to chat with family and friends far away, and open your mind on travel. The computer is not a bad thing all it's doing is making life a little better step by step.  The computer has revolutionized the way we learn, communicate, and explore the world. It has become an essential tool in our daily lives, connecting us to people and places we never thought possible. So, instead of viewing it as a hindrance, we should embrace the positive impact it has had on our lives and continue to utilize it to enhance our knowledge and experiences.
1778	1782	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers are a good source of technology. The reasons which I am fighting for tell why, kids are in school more than half of the school day. Parents should be limiting there childrens use and what they do, and computers are a way of contact and research. To begin, kids are in school more than have of a school day. How could children stay on the computer when there in school learning? They can't. In school you get alot of exercise because your always movign around. After school kids usually do homework or go out with friends. Computers don't have effect on people, if anything it makes them smarter. Secondly, if children have a computer at home their parents should be limiting the time and what exactly they could do on the computer. The people who support advances in technology are correct, computers open up imagination, and learning. Parents of the children that have computers should be more worried than anyone else and if they are , they should just take the computer away. Parents sould also take their kids places more often so the schild win not have to go online. Lastly, computers are a way of contacting others. If you don't have a phone, you use a computer to go on your email, or personal websites. Also poeple need computers for schol work and for their jobs too! Another thing numerous peopel use a computer for is research and reports. We need our information! To conclude, my thoughts are very important to consider because, mny other people would be shy to wirte this and get it published in their local newpaper! I would like to say computers are not interacting with family, friends, nature or anything of that sort. We as a whole need computers to do daily life things, without be able to go online, or save files we would be lost! So I will say again to consider my ideas. Thank you.  Computers have become an essential tool in our daily lives, providing us with valuable resources and information. It is crucial for parents to monitor their children's computer usage and set limits to ensure a healthy balance between screen time and other activities. Ultimately, computers play a significant role in communication, education, and research, enhancing our overall productivity and knowledge.
1779	1783	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, there are several reasons why I believe that advances in technology are harmful to our society. One major concern is that technology opens doors to strangers from the outside world, posing potential dangers, especially for teenagers and young adults. For example, the show Dateline has highlighted cases where individuals misrepresent themselves online to manipulate and harm unsuspecting victims. This can lead to trust issues and risky situations for those who engage with strangers online.  Furthermore, excessive use of technology can also lead to isolation from family and friends. Instead of spending quality time with loved ones, individuals may prioritize their online activities, causing rifts in relationships and a sense of disconnect from those closest to them. This can have detrimental effects on mental health and overall well-being.  Lastly, relying too heavily on technology can take away from the joy of experiencing life outside of the internet. By constantly seeking validation and entertainment online, individuals may miss out on real-world experiences and opportunities for personal growth. It is essential to strike a balance between the virtual and physical world to truly appreciate all that life has to offer.  In conclusion, while some may argue that advancements in technology bring about convenience and connectivity, it is crucial to acknowledge the negative impact it can have on our society. From the potential dangers of interacting with strangers online to the risk of alienating oneself from loved ones, it is important to approach technology use with caution and moderation. Let us strive to find a healthy balance between the digital realm and the real world to lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.

Children can use the computer to interact with friends, play games, and conduct research for their assignments. It serves as a virtual outside world for them, especially on rainy days when outdoor activities are limited. Additionally, computers provide a platform for creativity and exploration through various websites and resources. Therefore, the time spent on the computer by both adults and kids is justified and serves a valuable purpose in their daily lives.

It is important to prioritize personal relationships and not let technology interfere with meaningful interactions. By finding a healthy balance between screen time and real-life connections, individuals can enjoy the benefits of technology while also nurturing important relationships in their lives.
1782	1786	1	3	Dear readers, it is important to recognize the benefits and drawbacks of using the computer excessively. While the computer can provide access to a vast amount of information and enhance productivity, spending too much time in front of a screen can have negative consequences on our health and well-being.  On one hand, the computer allows us to connect with others, work efficiently, and access a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips. It has revolutionized the way we communicate, conduct research, and perform tasks. In today's digital age, the computer is an essential tool that has become deeply integrated into our daily lives.  On the other hand, excessive computer use can lead to various health issues such as eye strain, poor posture, and increased risk of developing conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome. Moreover, spending too much time online can also lead to social isolation, reduced physical activity, and mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.  Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance when using the computer. Setting limits on screen time, taking breaks, and practicing good ergonomics are important strategies to mitigate the negative effects of excessive computer use. By being mindful of our computer usage, we can harness its benefits while also safeguarding our health and well-being.
1783	1787	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper,  I agree that computers are invaluable to society. They have revolutionized the way we live and work, making many tasks easier and more convenient. For instance, for elderly individuals who may have difficulty getting around, computers provide a lifeline to the outside world. They can manage their finances, find employment opportunities, and even shop online without leaving their homes.  Moreover, computers offer a respite for those who are physically unable to engage in traditional activities. With just a few clicks, one can accomplish a multitude of tasks, from working remotely to purchasing essentials. The convenience that computers offer can alleviate stress and provide a sense of independence.  While there may be some drawbacks, such as the possibility of technical issues with older computers, the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. With the right equipment and knowledge, computers can empower individuals to achieve their goals and stay connected with the world around them.  In conclusion, computers are indispensable tools that have the potential to enhance the quality of life for many people. By harnessing the power of technology, we can overcome obstacles and make the most of the resources available to us.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]
