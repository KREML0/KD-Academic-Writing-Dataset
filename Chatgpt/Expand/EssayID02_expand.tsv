1	2978	2	3	Certain materials should not be removed from libraries, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. These forms of media provide valuable insights into the real world and can help individuals understand different perspectives and experiences. For example, books and music can offer lessons on overcoming challenges and embracing diversity. Movies can teach viewers about empathy and social interactions, while magazines can provide valuable information on important issues and potential consequences of certain actions. By keeping these materials accessible in libraries, people have the opportunity to learn from the experiences of others and make informed decisions in their own lives. Removing such materials would limit the ability of individuals to broaden their horizons and gain valuable knowledge, ultimately hindering personal growth and understanding of the world around them. Therefore, it is important to preserve a diverse range of materials in libraries to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow from the stories and perspectives shared through books, music, movies, and magazines.
2	2979	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic that has sparked debates for years. Some argue that certain materials should be removed from libraries to protect children and uphold moral values. However, I firmly believe that censorship in libraries should not be allowed.  Libraries serve as a place for individuals to access a wide range of information and ideas. By censoring materials, we limit the diversity of thought and hinder intellectual freedom. It is essential for individuals to have the opportunity to explore different perspectives and form their own opinions.  Furthermore, censorship in libraries sets a dangerous precedent. It gives the power to a select few to determine what is appropriate for the general public to access. This can lead to the suppression of important information and ideas that may challenge the status quo.  In a democratic society, freedom of expression is a fundamental right. Libraries should be a reflection of this principle, providing access to a variety of materials without fear of censorship. It is up to individuals to make informed choices about what they read or view, rather than having those choices made for them.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries undermines intellectual freedom and restricts access to diverse ideas. It is essential that libraries remain open spaces for individuals to explore, learn, and grow. Let us uphold the principles of democracy and resist censorship in all its forms.

I have read and seen a lot of books in my lifetime. I hear people telling me, ""oh, don't read that book, it's a bad book."" But I ask myself, do I know it's a bad book when I haven't even given it a chance? There are some books, music, movies, and magazines out there that are offensive. Yet we still want to read, listen, watch, and look at them. If we tried to remove all the offensive books from the libraries, we wouldn't have anything left on the shelves. Katherine Paterson said, ""If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right, and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" Katherine Paterson makes a great point with her quote. Why should we have to remove a book if just some people think it's offensive? Ask yourself the question again, do you know it's a bad book when you haven't even given it a chance? Don't judge a book by what you hear. Find out what your own opinion is."
4	2981	2	3	In @DATE1's world, there are many things found offensive. Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not. Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not. Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life. This is even taken to the extreme where people want censorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong.  Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries. They find these things to be offensive. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended. The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive. The library is a place for study. It is never intended to offend someone, or bring bad to the world. It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library.  I have been to the library many times, none of which have I ever seen anything offensive. Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research. There are certain sections in the library. If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children's section. I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children's section, or else the library would not have it in that section. The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not. If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out.  Also, if a person complains, and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else's chance getting the materials they need. One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it. If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do, is not look at it. The library can be compared to a big computer. One can basically find anything there. Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs. It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there.  Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life. If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left. People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone. There does not need to be any censorship in libraries. It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find.
5	2982	2	3	In life, there are always things that may offend us, such as books, movies, music, and other forms of media. While it may be difficult to get over these offensive things, they can ultimately make us stronger. It's important to remember that the content that offends us may reflect someone else's truth or life, and it's not the author's intention to harm us.   Libraries are filled with a variety of materials, and it's not fair to remove something just because it offends us. Others may find value in the material that we dislike, and removing it could hurt the authors and publishers who worked hard to create it. Additionally, offensive material can open our eyes to different perspectives and help us see the world in a new light.  Personally, I have experienced being offended by a book only to realize later that it helped me gain a new understanding and change my views. It's important to push ourselves out of our comfort zones and be open to different ideas and viewpoints. Life is too short to be constantly worried about feeling offended.  Every book, magazine, movie, and piece of music has its place and can be valuable to someone. Instead of removing offensive material, we should embrace the opportunity to learn and grow from it. By being open to different perspectives, we can enrich our lives and become more understanding individuals. Let's not be quick to judge or remove things that offend us, but rather seek to learn and expand our horizons.
6	2983	2	3	A lot of content today is censored because of the material found in books, music, movies, and magazines. This censorship can be addressed by implementing specific sections for different audiences, such as adults and children. By creating designated areas for potentially offensive content, individuals can choose whether or not to engage with it. Additionally, age restrictions can be put in place to ensure that young children are not exposed to inappropriate material. Ultimately, this approach can help cater to varying preferences and sensitivities while still allowing individuals to access a wide range of content. Hopefully, libraries will consider implementing these measures to effectively manage censorship concerns in the future.
7	2984	2	3	How would you feel if your favorite book was removed from the shelves of your school or public library? Many students, like myself, would find this discouraging and disastrous, as it could lead to a diminished love of reading, crushed individuality, and a divided population. Censorship should not dictate which books are available in libraries, as it can have detrimental effects on society.  Popular series like the beloved Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling have faced calls for censorship due to their portrayal of witchcraft, which goes against some religious beliefs. However, banning books like these can prevent students from exploring new worlds and developing a passion for reading. All books have the potential to ignite a love for literature, and restricting access to certain titles can hinder the intellectual growth of individuals and communities.  If censorship is allowed to prevail, it raises questions about who gets to decide which books are banned and on what grounds. This power struggle can lead to division and conflicts within society, as people become entrenched in their beliefs and refuse to consider opposing viewpoints. Limiting access to diverse opinions and ideas stifles creativity and undermines the value of individual thought.  Each person has a unique perspective on what is considered offensive, and censoring books would be akin to suppressing individuality and personal beliefs. Embracing diversity of thought and allowing for a variety of perspectives enriches society and fosters a culture of open-mindedness. Free thought is a fundamental right that should be protected, and censorship threatens to erode this essential aspect of human expression.  In conclusion, censorship poses a threat to individuality, personal beliefs, and the joy of reading. Rather than imposing restrictions on what books are available, it is important to respect the diversity of opinions and allow individuals the freedom to explore different ideas. Removing books from libraries based on subjective criteria only serves to limit intellectual growth and diminish the richness of our cultural landscape. So, imagine if your favorite book disappeared from all libraries - it would be a disservice to you and to society as a whole.
8	2985	2	3	Taking certain materials off the shelves of a library because someone finds them offensive is a contentious issue. While some may argue for the removal of offensive materials to create a more inclusive environment, others believe that censorship goes against the principles of intellectual freedom.   In my opinion, books, movies, music, magazines, or computer access should generally remain on the shelves of a library. Just because something is deemed offensive by one person does not mean it should be unavailable to others who may find value in it. Moreover, what is considered offensive is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person.   However, there are instances where materials should be removed, such as if they are severely damaged or promote dangerous behavior like drug use without consequences. In such cases, it is reasonable to consider removing them to maintain the integrity of the library's collection.   Ultimately, libraries serve as repositories of knowledge and information, and it is essential to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and access to diverse perspectives. While some materials may be deemed offensive by some, they should generally be available to those who seek them out. It is important to strike a balance between protecting intellectual freedom and ensuring the quality and appropriateness of the library's collection.
9	2986	2	3	The idea of the removal of 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable. Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view. However, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library.  First, I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf. Offensive is a relative word. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another. Every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences. Many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech. Therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as Katherine Paterson said.  The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource. If the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get information. Sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective.  However, some books @MONTH1 not be entirely appropriate to certain people. For example, some material in the library @MONTH1 not be best for small children to read or view. In this case, I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to.  Having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion. It hinders expression. People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same. If someone finds something particularly offensive, I believe they just should not view it.
10	2987	2	3	All authors write for a purpose, whether it be to teach, entertain, or persuade an audience. No author writes something and says, 'I hope no one picks this off of the shelf!' So, if every author wants to express something through their writing, then why should we not let them be heard. We all have the freedom of speech, right? So, why not the freedom of writing? Libraries should not remove a book, music, movie, or magazine from the shelf just because they found it offensive.  Everyone will read a book that they don't like, its natural, but that doesn't mean that no one will like it. Authors write for an audience, but maybe you are not in that audience; so, it doesn't appeal to you and might even seem offensive. Not everyone believes in the same ideas. You could think about an issue one way and your neighbor think about it a totally different way.  Like for instance, you're reading a book about a young girl that is going through many problems in her life. She has gotten into some really horrible situations. Some of these situations you read about are so awful that you wouldn't want anyone else to read it. But, did you ever think that maybe there's another girl that is or has gone through some of these same situations. Maybe this girl comes to a library and finds this book; suddenly she finds guidance in it. She finds something she can depend on in her life that she's never had before. She feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her. So, would you really want to take that book off of the shelf and not let that girl ever find her guidance?  Situations happen like this all of the time. People find something special in what they read that other people might not find. When a librarian takes a book off of that shelf, an opportunity is forever gone. No one will ever be able to learn of what was to become of that writing and of those ideas. We all have a right to learn, to explore new ideas, and to expand our minds. No one should have the right to take that away. In conclusion, the freedom of writing should be upheld, and all voices should be allowed to be heard, even if they may be deemed offensive by some.
11	2988	2	3	I have noticed that some movies are offensive to certain people, such as movies that are about supernatural beings that some individuals do not believe in. However, some movies are appropriate for certain age groups, like those rated 'R' which are not suitable for children. Magazines can also be offensive, with sections that may talk negatively about public figures. In these cases, I believe some magazines should be removed from shelves.   When it comes to books, I do not see a reason to have them removed from shelves. While some books may contain graphic content, they are not necessarily offensive. However, there may be books that some individuals find offensive, such as those that depict poverty in a negative light. Ultimately, I believe that whether or not a book, magazine, or movie should be removed depends on its content and the impact it has on society. It is important to consider the perspectives of different individuals when making decisions about what should be available to the public.
12	2989	2	3	Personally, I don't think libraries, movie stores, etc., should be selling any of the items just mentioned if they are found offensive to the public. I believe that it offends many people, especially senior citizens and children who shouldn't have to be exposed to inappropriate material. In my opinion, individuals should be at least eighteen years old in order to buy or rent certain books, music, movies, or magazines. The economy is already struggling, and the younger generation being raised should not have memories of offensive content from their childhood.   I strongly feel that music has the most influence on a person, as constantly listening to foul language can have a lasting impact on an individual. Similarly, movies can also greatly influence people's thoughts and behaviors. For example, exposure to violence in movies can lead a child to believe that harming others is acceptable since they saw a character get away with it without consequences.  In conclusion, while I believe in the freedom for individuals to choose what they read, watch, or listen to, I think there should be age restrictions on certain content. Additionally, anything deemed offensive by citizens should be placed in a separate area within stores or libraries to ensure that those who wish to access such material can do so without exposing others to offensive content.
13	2990	2	3	A library is a place you can go to read, write, and relax. Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there. Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship. Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy.   First of all, removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they offend certain people is completely unwarranted. If they offend you then do not read them. It is as simple as that. Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs. A great example of this is the Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide; however, it does not correlate with many people's beliefs. Therefore those people boycott the series.   I remember several years ago I attended a Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released. While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing. Now most people would think that it was only a storm, but the people in town who did not like the Harry Potter books blamed it on the party. They said that we were worshipping the devil and God brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong. I know many people do not like the Harry Potter series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it, but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurrences on a book!  Even great novels like the Catcher in the Rye should not be banned because of their content. For a while, Catcher in the Rye was reading material for school, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person. Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards.   Consequently, what Katherine Paterson states is true. If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable, eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library. Although there could be a way to compromise. If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that, then it could benefit both sides.   In conclusion, eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all, especially children. When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read. While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read. Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes. Books are a gateway to another world. Why take that magic away from children?
14	2991	2	3	Yes and no, some materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be voted upon by citizens to be removed from shelves. Some materials in these categories should be removed if they are offensive to me and others, but it will take time to get them removed if others enjoy them. Music with violent themes can influence teenagers negatively, leading them to engage in harmful activities like selling drugs. While it may be challenging to stop the production of such music, collective efforts can help prevent the spread of harmful content. For instance, if an artist produces offensive material, individuals should voice their concerns and work towards removing it from circulation. It is important to stand up against content that promotes destructive behavior to safeguard communities and create better opportunities for individuals. Ultimately, addressing offensive content requires collaboration and a commitment to upholding values that prioritize the well-being of society.
15	2992	2	3	When discussing censorship in libraries, it is important to consider the role of the community in determining what materials are available. While library staff play a significant role in managing the collection, the input of the community members who actually utilize the library is crucial. It is essential to respect diverse opinions and preferences when curating library materials.  While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, there are certain instances where censorship may be necessary. For example, offensive music that could potentially harm or disturb library patrons should be carefully evaluated and potentially removed from the collection. This does not mean that all music should be banned, but rather that materials with the potential to cause harm should be considered for removal.  In conclusion, community involvement is essential in determining library materials, and censorship should be approached with sensitivity and consideration for the well-being of library patrons. Offensive materials should be carefully evaluated and potentially removed to ensure a safe and inclusive library environment for all.
16	2993	2	3	Dear Newspaper,  How would you feel if someone wrote a book about how bad newspapers are, tearing you down so much that no one wanted to touch another newspaper? Should offensive materials be available for thousands of people to read? I believe that certain offensive materials such as books, music, movies, etc., should not be allowed on library shelves, let alone be available for public consumption.  Imagine if a sexist book ended up in the hands of an innocent child who could be influenced by its harmful content. That child could end up living a life that the book portrays. As a parent, I would never want my children exposed to such harmful reading materials until they have a clear understanding of right and wrong.  Now, consider if a book promoting racist ideologies fell into the hands of someone who already harbors such beliefs. That book could fuel their discriminatory thoughts and lead to harmful actions towards others. This could result in violence, discrimination, and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.  All it takes is one book to cause significant harm and perpetuate negative beliefs. That is why it is crucial to reconsider the availability of offensive materials in libraries. These materials have the potential to influence individuals in detrimental ways, leading to real-life consequences that can be devastating.  In conclusion, the impact of offensive materials on individuals and society as a whole cannot be underestimated. It is essential to take proactive measures to prevent the spread of harmful ideologies and protect vulnerable individuals from the negative influence of such materials. Let us strive to create a safe and inclusive environment where everyone can access materials that promote understanding, empathy, and respect.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
17	2994	2	3	A lot of people in school may come across books or magazines that contain offensive content, such as profanity or racial slurs. While some may find it humorous, others may be deeply offended. It is important for libraries and schools to consider the impact of such material on their students. Parents have the right to object to their children being exposed to inappropriate content and should be able to have such material removed from school libraries. Additionally, movies and music that contain offensive content should be reviewed and potentially altered or removed if they are found to be offensive to a significant number of people. It is crucial to prioritize the comfort and well-being of students and ensure that they are not subjected to content that makes them uncomfortable or goes against their values. Ultimately, if a book, song, movie, or any form of entertainment offends a considerable portion of the audience, it should be addressed promptly and removed to uphold respect and sensitivity towards all individuals.
18	2995	2	3	I believe that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves simply because someone finds them offensive. People choose what they want to read, listen to, watch, or purchase, so if something appears offensive, they can simply choose not to engage with it. Additionally, when visiting the library or a store, individuals are typically seeking something that aligns with their interests, so they are likely to avoid materials that seem offensive to them. Ultimately, censorship based on individual sensitivities should not dictate what is available for others to access. Everyone has the right to choose their own entertainment without interference from others' opinions on what is offensive.
19	2996	2	3	If the people that are publishing and writing these articles in these magazines then yes, they can feel offensive about the things inside the magazine or books. These people are going to always find something or some rumor to start a big fight about these things, those people are called 'haters'. They can find an easy way to get something started just like that, That's why before I buy a magazine, I take a look inside first and see if I'm interested in buying that specific certain book or magazine. If I don't like the things that I see inside of it, then I will not buy it, it's as simple as that. If they are offensive, they should immediately be removed from the newsstands on the streets of various locations.
20	2997	2	3	I think that all the bad books, music, magazines, and movies should be removed from libraries. Children can easily access these materials without understanding the harmful content they contain. Parents do not want their children exposed to inappropriate themes such as sex, explicit language, or violence. It is essential for libraries to be mindful of the materials they offer to ensure the protection of young minds. In addition to books, music, and movies, magazines also play a role in exposing children to inappropriate content, such as pornography. Overall, it is crucial to eliminate such materials from libraries to safeguard the well-being of children and promote a safe and healthy learning environment.
21	2998	2	3	Dear news people,  I believe that individuals should have the freedom to write whatever they want in books without facing unnecessary criticism. In a free country, people should have the liberty to express themselves through their writing, regardless of the content. Readers have the choice to pick up a book or not based on their personal preferences, so there is no need to create a fuss over books that do not align with one's beliefs. It is simply a matter of choosing to read something else that resonates more with them instead of making a big deal out of a book that they do not agree with. Ultimately, it is a waste of time and energy to complain about something that can easily be avoided by choosing a different book to read.  In conclusion, rather than causing unnecessary conflict over the content of books, individuals should simply set aside ones that they do not appreciate and opt for literature that they find more suitable. It is important to respect the freedom of expression and choice when it comes to reading material, and not dwell on books that do not align with personal beliefs.  Thank you.
22	2999	2	3	I think that books, magazines, papers, etc. should not be removed from libraries because some people like to read them. Some individuals feel that reading a book about their problems will help them get through whatever difficulties they are facing. Many people often express feelings of stress and depression, and having access to these resources can provide valuable support. If certain materials are deemed offensive, individuals who find them objectionable can simply choose not to read them. People have the right to access a wide range of books and other materials, and those who feel uncomfortable with certain content can easily avoid it. Ultimately, it is important to respect the diverse preferences and needs of library users and allow them to make their own choices about what to read. Libraries serve as valuable resources for individuals seeking knowledge, understanding, and personal growth, and it is essential to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and access to information for all.
23	3000	2	3	Hello, my name is @CAPS1. I feel that there should be any genre of media in libraries. If they call it a 'media center,' then why censor any media. People know to read the back of a book to see if they want it, so if they see something they don't like, they are able to put it back on the shelf. People say The @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 inspired @CAPS4 @PERSON2 to kill @PERSON1; that is completely speculated. It's all a matter of 'he said she said.' I feel there should be sections for different age groups, but to censor literature is just un-@CAPS5. There should be a parent supervising children @NUM1 and younger because, ultimately, it comes down to the children not being exposed to something they're not ready for. There are some magazines and movies that I feel shouldn't be in libraries, including pornography, non-educational movies, @CAPS6 @CAPS7, and social networks. I'm not saying to let kids listen to murderous music and jump off of the terrace, but shouldn't some leeway on books. This is an approved message. Thank you for your time. Goodbye.
24	3001	2	3	Books should not be removed from shelves simply because some individuals may find their content inappropriate. Instead, these materials should be placed in a separate section where only adults can access them. Children often imitate what they see in books, movies, and other media, so it is crucial to shield them from harmful influences. By keeping explicit content out of reach, we can protect young minds from being exposed to inappropriate material and prevent them from engaging in risky behaviors. Parents can also play a role in monitoring what their children read and watch, ensuring that they are exposed to age-appropriate content. Ultimately, while freedom of expression is important, it is equally essential to safeguard the innocence and well-being of our youth by carefully regulating the content they consume.
25	3002	2	3	I think almost every movie might offend someone in some way. So if you want to take every movie off the shelf, then go ahead. Everyone has different tastes in movies, music, books, etc. If the music offends you, don't listen to it. If a book does, don't read it. It's as simple as that. I don't think they should remove books, music, movies, etc. that could offend someone. If you were to remove all the things that might interest people nowadays, then there wouldn't be anything to entertain kids, potentially leading them to get into trouble.   Everyone has the right to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. If something offends them, they can simply avoid it. Children should also have the freedom to choose what they read, listen to, or watch. Exposure to different materials can broaden their perspectives and help them understand that life isn't always easy. People have different tastes, and as long as something doesn't offend them, they should be able to enjoy it without judgment.   In conclusion, people should be able to consume what they want, even if some find it offensive. Exposure to potentially offensive material can help individuals navigate life's challenges and understand different perspectives. It's essential to respect everyone's right to choose their entertainment without imposing restrictions based on personal preferences.
26	3003	2	3	The world is filled with offensive material, but it is essential to preserve a wide range of knowledge in libraries, even if some content may be deemed inappropriate by certain individuals. Exposure to diverse information is crucial for individuals to make informed decisions and understand the world around them. While some materials may be controversial or potentially harmful, they still have value in providing a comprehensive view of society. It is important to strike a balance between necessary knowledge and purely entertainment-based content, removing only those items that serve no purpose. Ultimately, each person's perception and values will determine what is considered acceptable, highlighting the ongoing challenge of navigating the complexities of censorship and information access in our society.
27	3004	2	3	People are entitled to their own opinions about things, and what one person finds offensive, another may not. Libraries should have the freedom to stock materials that may interest and educate individuals, regardless of potential offense. If we catered to every individual's sensitivities, libraries would have very limited content. It is natural for people to find fault with almost anything that is put out into the world.  I have come across nonfiction books and movies based on true events that use language some may find offensive. However, how can we effectively express emotions and educate others without possibly causing offense? Teaching history, especially events as dark as slavery and the Holocaust, requires a full and honest narrative, even if it may upset some individuals.  I firmly believe that such materials should be available in libraries for those who wish to learn and understand history and human experiences. If someone finds them objectionable, they have the option to avoid those specific resources. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and it is essential to have a diverse range of perspectives and information available for those who seek it.
28	3005	2	3	"If people find books offensive, they should simply choose not to read them. Removing offensive books from shelves would leave bookstores barren, depriving readers of valuable literary works. Many esteemed authors incorporate offensive language or themes in their writing, but censoring these works would eliminate some of the greatest material available. For instance, in the book ""American Psycho,"" which contains offensive content towards gays, removing it from shelves would mean losing a significant piece of literature. It is essential to respect the diversity of perspectives in literature and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they read. Freedom of expression and the availability of diverse viewpoints are crucial in fostering a vibrant literary landscape."
29	3006	2	3	A book is more than words or happenings; they're adventures and stories that travel from one person to another. I find it amazing how someone from one country could write a book, then someone from another country could read it. Inspiring stories reach from one person to another in books, music, and movies; I believe things like that help shape us into who we are today.  There are many problems with entertainment today in my opinion. They include things now that show a lot of violence and intimacy; which may not be fit for some people. I don't think they should take them off the shelves, but simply rate them so everyone knows what to expect. Movies are rated because some people don't want or need to see what will happen in them. While some of it is not appropriate, other parts of it guide us. It's almost like they are preparing us for the worst, but are hoping for the best. We see what happens to one person in these articles of entertainment, and it helps us to make sure we don't make the same mistake.  I also believe that many stories and movies inspire us to be better people and to reach for our dreams. If we see that one person can do it, we think, why can't I? Where would we be in the world if no one encouraged or pushed someone else to do what they wanted? Entertainment pushes that concept, but adds everything in it to show the reality of it. Whether these things have offense or harsh contents to them, they still prepare and help us to battle through everyday life. Ultimately, entertainment serves as a source of inspiration, guidance, and motivation for individuals to strive for their goals and become the best version of themselves.
30	3007	2	3	I don't believe that certain books, music, magazines, or movies should be removed just because they are found offensive. If something offends me, that is my own issue to deal with. Society will always rediscover and bring back items that were once deemed offensive. Everything has educational value, even if it may be offensive to some. Whether something should be removed from shelves depends on personal beliefs and views. It's important to remember that what is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. It's easier to live with the fact that not everyone will agree on what is offensive. Maybe the creator intended for their work to be offensive, or maybe they didn't. It all comes down to how individuals interpret the content. In the end, nothing should be removed from shelves, as removing one thing may lead to removing everything. It's important to respect diverse perspectives and opinions on what is considered offensive.
31	3008	2	3	I absolutely do not think that any book, movie, magazine, music, etc., should be removed from the shelf because they find it offensive. If we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf. Sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive, because they are actually telling you what they really believe in.  I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school. The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book. Even teachers were reading it. The school board did not even care though. I think that was completely handled the wrong way. They should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it. If it offended her, then she should not read it.  Music is an outlet for many people. They can express their feelings in a way that is amazing. Without music, there would not be any fun in the world. People are always listening to music. When they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc. If people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it.  Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time. That is what makes a movie: a hero and a villain. We want the good guys to win. The movie makes fun of the bad guys. Somebody is always going to get hurt.  When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else. I think of how the artist feels. Why they wrote it that certain way. If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first. Then if I like it, I start singing it. If I do not like it, then I just change the song.  I hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended. We need the different opinions in life. If we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in any way. I do not want to be the same as everybody else. I love my personality. I am different and kind of an outcast. But I am true to myself. And I respect other people's opinions. I wish everyone would do the same. Or at least try to do the same. Thank you for listening to what I had to say.
32	3009	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be removed from certain library shelves because people have enough sense on what they are interested in and what they are not interested in. There will always be people that find specific thoughts or ideas offensive no matter what the subject is, so censorship does not really make a difference to the individual. Censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone helping them find what they are looking for.  Censorship is not entirely necessary because people will always find something that they are not exactly looking for or interested in. People's interests are their own business without the censorship of others in the surrounding community. I've read a couple books that have cussing in them, but the book is still as good as it would be without the cussing in it. People like things no matter what, because there will always be flaws with some objects such as books, music, and movies.  Books, music, and movies all have much interest from the common person, and each individual is capable of making their own decisions based on what they are interested in. The individual does not need edited objects, or music to listen to the music or other objects without being offended. There is something offensive to people in every work that has been published, and the buyer is fully aware of that fact before they go and buy something.  Censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for. People will almost always get offended about what they are watching or listening to no matter what it is, so why is censorship such a big deal? Censorship is not needed in today's society because each specific individual is capable of making their own decision in what's best for themselves. Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be taken away from the library shelves because there will always be some offensive objects that some individuals will find offensive no matter what the object is.
33	3010	2	3	Many people believe that magazines, books, movies, music, posters, and other forms of media can contain content that parents may not want their children to see. This could include books discussing different races or cultures, which may contain sensitive or inappropriate material for young readers. It is important for individuals to approach these materials with an open mind and consider whether the content aligns with their values before making a decision to engage with it. Ultimately, it is up to each person to make informed choices about what they consume and to be respectful of different perspectives and experiences.
34	3011	2	3	"Would you want your children reading about things that only adults know? When you go to a library, you expect to learn about history, science, literature, and more. Libraries are places for expanding knowledge and gaining valuable insights. Upon entering a library, you anticipate seeing people checking out various books or finding ones that pique their interest. If a book is deemed inappropriate or detrimental to a child's development, it is crucial to advocate for their mental growth.  We must also consider what children desire to read. They should have the freedom to explore topics that interest them, as long as they are engaging and educational. Some books provide valuable lessons about the world they inhabit. While there may be books we hesitate to let our children read, they may offer valuable insights that we cannot provide. These are what I refer to as ""eye-openers,"" books that may initially seem controversial but ultimately prepare them for the future. Not every book is filled with positivity; children must learn about the complexities of life and the importance of distinguishing right from wrong.  Do you remember the first book you read independently? I recall mine was ""Of Mice and Men"" at a young age. Despite my mother's concerns about its content, that book taught me valuable lessons about the world. Some books are meant to be read, while others may not be suitable for children. If you feel a book is unsuitable for your child, read it first and then explain your reasoning to them. It is essential to guide children towards appropriate reading materials that align with their age and maturity level. Ultimately, fostering a love for reading and learning will enrich their lives and contribute to their overall development."
35	3012	2	3	Libraries should not remove materials from their shelves just because some people find them offensive. When individuals visit a library, they are seeking knowledge or entertainment, and removing materials could limit their access to information. It is important to respect diverse beliefs and opinions, as everyone has the right to choose what they want to read or view. If someone finds a particular item offensive, they can simply choose not to engage with it and find something else that suits their preferences. Libraries offer a wide range of materials across various genres and subjects, catering to different interests and age groups. It is crucial to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and allow individuals to make their own decisions about the materials they want to explore. By maintaining a diverse collection, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for education, research, and personal enrichment.
36	3013	2	3	Censoring books goes against freedom of speech and the right to access information. While some may find certain topics offensive, it is important to understand historical events and learn from them to prevent their repetition. Censorship limits the exchange of ideas and can be just as offensive as the material being censored. Instead of censoring books, individuals can choose not to read them if they find them offensive. It is important to respect different viewpoints and allow readers to make their own decisions about what they choose to read. Ultimately, censorship restricts knowledge and inhibits intellectual growth, which is detrimental to society as a whole.
37	3014	2	3	There are many types of materials in the library to entertain you. Some of these materials may be books, magazines, movies, and music. Each person has their own type of information and genres that they like. For example, most teenage girls love to read young romance stories, and about young peoples' lives; some people like informational books. Everyone is different in their own way. The material they choose to read is their own choice.  How would you feel if one of your favorite books or magazine were taken off the shelves of all the libraries? You would probably wonder why such a thing would happen. Well, some people would like to argue about how some of the information that is contained in such materials are offensive or inappropriate. They want these types of things to be taken off the shelves. But is it their decision to say that some things offend people?  Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own choice on what they want to read or what they do not want to read. In my opinion, these types of materials should stay on the shelves. It is simple, if you do not like a certain genre of magazines or books, do not read them. If you hear someone's music, and it sounds completely awful to you, then just walk away or listen to your own music. There's a new movie out about how the world is going to end, and you disbelieve in the fact that the world will not end that way, do not go and see it.  Some parents do not want their children to know about some of the things that are out there in the world, which is completely understandable. But, everyone has rights to what they want to know and what they do not want to know. If everyone had a right to take away some books that they think are not appropriate, do you think there would be any books left? The thing is, is that in today's society, people want to do what they want and think what they want. Some people do not agree with most things, but that is something they will have to face, because not everyone can be happy.  In conclusion, it is important to respect individual choices and preferences when it comes to reading materials. Everyone has the right to access information and entertainment that aligns with their interests, and censorship should not dictate what is available to the public. Let people make their own decisions about what they want to read, watch, or listen to, without imposing restrictions on content.
38	3015	2	3	Should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive? @PERSON1 states that we will have no books left of the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of. What some people think is the most innocent book, could offend another individual. Different people find different topics offensive. No two people think the same.     Though certain books or magazines @MONTH1 have offensive subjects or materials in them, if they were to be removed, how would we learn? For example, say there was a historical fiction book about racism. The book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished. Readers could learn from the books how racism affects people, and why it is wrong. Learning about dislikes can make someone more knowledgable on why some people think the way they do. The readers can learn from mistakes made in the past. Books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago; morals were different a while ago from what they are now.     If many people were to agree that a certain material is very offensive or not appropriate for adolescents or young children, one option that could be available is only allowing adults to check it out. The library could also put a warning on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh. Another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library. Consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not.     People have their own opinions and views on materials. A person should learn to be tolerant of materials; others might truely enjoy it. This article might be offensive to those who read it, because they might think things should be more sensored rather than tolerated.  If someone does not like the material, they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it? One person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual. Each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library?
39	3016	2	3	One essential right that every man, woman, or child should have is the freedom of speech. Without this right no one would be able to express their views. When libraries pull books, magazines, movies, and music off of their shelves it takes away that right. Even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people, the books or other items should be left on the shelves.  What one person finds offensive another could find miraculous. If one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book. Libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it. I do think however, that books should be placed in the section that they belong. Sections for children's books, young adult books, adult books, and many more can all be found in a library. An example would be that a book about the anatomy of the human body does not belong in the children's section. beyond this, the library should leave the rest of the decisions to the reader. If someone wanted to read a book on the @LOCATION1, then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out. The problem with censorship is that a @CAPS1 could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves. Then the person interested in the @LOCATION1 would not be able to withdraw the book.  The choice of what material you read should be left up to you, not restricted by what someone else finds offensive. Libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs. The person should just not read the book. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore, there should not be censorship in libraries. In conclusion, the freedom of speech should be upheld in libraries, allowing individuals to choose their reading material without interference from others' personal beliefs.
40	3017	2	3	"Writing is a form of expression that allows individuals to share their thoughts and ideas freely. In this country, authors have the freedom to write about any topic without fear of repercussions. While some works may be enjoyable to read, others may be disturbing. However, just because a piece of literature is offensive does not mean it should be censored or removed from shelves.  For example, ""The Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair shed light on the appalling practices of the meat packing industry, sparking outrage and leading to much-needed reforms. Despite its controversial content, the book remains a significant part of literary history. If authors were not allowed to address issues like those depicted in ""The Jungle,"" important societal changes may never have occurred.  In education, students should be exposed to a variety of literature that not only enriches their minds but also reflects the world around them. While classics like Shakespeare and Dickens are important, students should also read works that address contemporary issues and offer insights into success and personal growth.  It is crucial for individuals to cultivate a love for reading in a world dominated by technology. If every book that offended someone was removed, we would be left with a limited and censored literary landscape. Therefore, it is essential to uphold the freedom of expression and keep all books accessible to those who wish to read them. Censorship should not dictate what individuals can or cannot read, as every book has the potential to educate, inspire, and provoke thought."
41	3018	2	3	Dear Newspaper,   I believe that no book should be taken off the shelves for any reason. People may not be mature enough for some books, music, magazines, etc., and so if libraries have a problem with certain materials, they should consider putting an age limit on checking out those items. Libraries cater to a diverse range of tastes and preferences, so there should not be a reason to remove any material from their shelves.  If libraries start removing materials that some people don't like, then it would be unfair to those who enjoy them. For example, taking off a popular series like '@CAPS1' would upset many fans. Different people have different interests, and libraries should be able to provide a variety of reading options for everyone.  While some parents may not want their children to read certain books, it is ultimately their responsibility to monitor what their kids are exposed to. They could request age restrictions on certain materials or simply guide their children in their reading choices. However, removing books altogether just because some individuals object to them is not a fair solution.  In my opinion, all books should remain accessible in libraries because diversity in reading materials is important. If someone has an issue with a book, they can simply choose not to read it. It is essential to respect the varied preferences and opinions of readers.   Sincerely, @PERSON1
42	3019	2	3	From many arguments, people disagree with school libraries due to the presence of disturbing content like violence, drugs, and nudity in books, magazines, articles, and the internet. Parents are concerned about their children having access to such uncensored material, fearing it may influence them negatively. Libraries need to be more responsible in curating their collection to ensure children are not exposed to inappropriate content. Parents also play a vital role in monitoring and guiding their children's exposure to such materials. Both parents and libraries need to work together to create a safe and educational environment for children to thrive in without being exposed to offensive or uncensored content. Ultimately, the well-being and development of children should be the top priority for both parents and libraries.
43	3020	2	3	Parents should have control over what their children read and watch, especially when it comes to inappropriate content like sexual relationships or violence. Libraries should also be mindful of the materials they provide to young readers, ensuring that they are age-appropriate. Parents need to take responsibility for disciplining their children and not allow them to be influenced by negative behaviors seen in movies or books. Education should focus on preparing students for the real world and teaching them valuable lessons about life and society. It is essential to prioritize educational and informative content over material that may have a negative impact on young minds.
44	3021	2	3	In this millennium, censorship should not be a major concern, as people often say and do worse things in public than what may be found in books, music, or movies. Parents should take responsibility for monitoring what their children have access to, whether it be in a library or a store. If a child is exposed to adult content, it is ultimately the parent's responsibility for not supervising them properly. However, if the material contains racist content, it should be censored to prevent negative influences on young minds. While some materials may not be suitable for children, it is essential for research purposes or personal interest. Implementing age restrictions or creating separate sections for sensitive material could be a solution. Overall, censorship in libraries should be limited to ensure a wide variety of resources are available for all individuals without restricting access.
45	3022	2	3	Libraries, to myself, are a gateway to another world; where I can be who I want to be, and let my imagination wander where ever it pleases. Libraries should not have the ability to take a book off the shelves depending on its content. We are all different people, we all don't enjoy the same kind of books. Also, some books may be needed for research. Censorship in a library should not be allowed.   First, there are so many different people in the world. Some people learn more about people from books. Imagine yourself a white, 10-year-old boy, growing up in an all white town. Never in your life have you seen an African American. You go to the library and pick up 'The Diary of Anne Frank.' This young boy has never been introduced to such racism. Books are history. Books are learning. Books can not be taken off the shelf just for their content. That content might be a whole other world for a young child.  Next, libraries are used so often by college students to writer papers for school. Books are needed for research. For an example, you're a college student writing a research paper on abuse--including sexual, physical, and mental. A young author writes a non-fiction novel about her childhood ranging from being raped by her father at six years old to being bullied in school. After hours of searching, you find all local libraries have removed this book for its explicit content. College students need books no matter what they're about.  Libraries are open to people of all ages. It is understandable that a twelve-year-old could easily get a hold of a book inappropriate for their age level, but that's why libraries are split into sections. If you find a book that is considered to be taken off the shelves, don't remove it, just move it to a more secure and mature area. Censorship in libraries limits access to information and hinders intellectual freedom. Let books remain on the shelves for those who seek knowledge and inspiration from them.
46	3023	2	3	"When it comes to the idea of removing certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines, it should ultimately be a personal choice. It is a fundamental right protected by our constitution. I personally enjoy reading urban books as they resonate with my experiences and where I may be headed in life. While these may not be suitable for my grandchildren, they may develop a liking for them later on. Everyone has different preferences, and just because something is not to your taste doesn't mean it should be banned.   Libraries and bookstores offer a wide range of materials, catering to diverse interests. If certain books are not suitable for children, they can be placed in a separate section labeled ""For Adults."" Ultimately, it is up to us as parents and individuals to monitor what our children read and watch. Banning materials may not solve the underlying issues as determined individuals will find a way to access them. It is important to respect differing tastes and preferences, as what may seem inappropriate to one person may hold value for another. Let's embrace diversity and individual choice when it comes to selecting reading materials."
47	3024	2	3	Libraries are essential repositories of knowledge, providing us with insights into the past through both factual information and fictional stories. Censoring books in libraries, whether due to perceived vulgarity or controversial content, hinders our ability to learn from diverse perspectives and experiences. History, despite its sensitive nature, should not be whitewashed or hidden, as understanding past mistakes is crucial for building a better future. In a society inundated with adult content in media, libraries serve as a valuable source of educational material for all ages. Limiting access to books restricts the opportunities for individuals, especially children, to explore different ideas and perspectives. As technology increasingly dominates our entertainment choices, it is important to preserve the tradition of reading and the valuable lessons it imparts. Books with complex themes such as substance abuse, family dynamics, and social issues play a vital role in shaping our understanding of the world and our interactions with others. Encouraging reading, especially of diverse and challenging material, is essential for fostering critical thinking and empathy. The richness of literature lies in its ability to provoke thought, evoke emotions, and inspire growth. By safeguarding the availability of a wide range of books in libraries, we ensure that future generations have the opportunity to expand their horizons and learn valuable life lessons from the written word.
48	3025	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should never be removed from libraries because people have the right to access information, regardless of whether it is offensive. Our country was founded on principles of freedom of speech and equality, and removing materials from libraries based on offensiveness sets a dangerous precedent. If we start censoring for offensiveness, where do we draw the line? What one person finds offensive, another may not. Libraries are meant for learning and teaching, and the information within them should be helpful and constructive. Removing materials would only limit access to knowledge and ultimately harm the purpose of libraries. It is important to uphold the principles of free speech and access to information, even if some may find certain materials offensive.
49	3026	2	3	Have you ever been offended? Did you lash out, or did you keep an open mind and try to understand? People are offended by many things every day in life. So, we should broaden our minds and see these 'offenses' as a normality.  You're at a party with a bowl full of candy stationed right beside the front door. You walk in and take a piece. Wait, you don't want that piece? What are you going to do with it? Do you take all of the same pieces that you don't like out of the bowl and throw them away, or do you simply drop it back into the bowl and choose a new one? If you throw the candy away, what does that mean for the other party guests? You have narrowed their choices down because of your own selfish opinion. That candy could have been the guest favorite. But, since YOU don't like it, you take away the other guests' privilege to eat that candy. They didn't deserve that, now did they?  If you're searching through books in a library and you come across a book that doesn't interest you or offends you, then put it back and look for a new one. If you're having trouble finding the right book, ask the librarian for suggestions on other topics or books to check out. Go to a new library, even, but don't mess with something that isn't yours. Especially, something as small as a book.  The point of the matter is, if you don't like something then disregard it. The moment the book, and the book alone, starts causing problems is the moment anyone should intervene. But, come on, do you really think a book could cause a problem? If your child is having problems, don't you think you ought to check what's going on with him instead of looking to see if he/she checked out the 'book that we hope none of our children' took off the shelf. This is quite possibly one of the last things I would think of causing a problem, if I even thought of this at all. Opinions can cause a lot of problems. Sometimes, people just need to keep their opinions to themselves, agreed?
50	3027	2	3	The libraries can contain books that are offensive to humans and animals. These offensive books may include negative comments just for entertainment purposes. However, it is important to consider the impact of such offensive content on readers, especially when it involves sensitive issues such as race.  I believe that all materials in libraries should be reviewed, and any content found to be offensive or derogatory towards any individual or group should be removed. Libraries should be a place that promotes positivity and knowledge, not one that contains harmful and hurtful material. Children, in particular, should be able to access books without encountering offensive or inappropriate content.  I recall a time when my little brother brought home a book from the library that depicted discriminatory behavior towards a dark-colored dog, which made him feel uncomfortable and upset. This experience highlights the importance of ensuring that libraries maintain a safe and inclusive environment for all readers.  In conclusion, while libraries are valuable sources of information and entertainment, it is crucial to be mindful of the content they offer. Offensive material can have a detrimental effect on readers and should not be tolerated in such spaces. It is essential to promote a culture of respect and understanding in libraries to create a welcoming and enriching experience for all individuals.
51	3028	2	3	Censorship, whether in libraries, schools, or on television, restricts the free flow of ideas and information, leading to a society of conformists. While some may argue that censorship is necessary to protect the youth or maintain societal norms, it ultimately hinders individual thought and creativity. By censoring books, movies, and other forms of media, we limit our ability to explore different perspectives and learn from diverse viewpoints. Instead of promoting conformity, we should embrace the diversity of ideas and encourage critical thinking. In a world without censorship, we have the opportunity to expand our minds and enrich our lives through the exploration of all kinds of literature and media. Let us not stifle creativity and individuality but instead celebrate the uniqueness of each person's thoughts and opinions.
52	3029	2	3	"Wow, that's racist. As I said when I saw the movie ""White Men Can't Jump,"" yes, that movie could have offended me a lot, but it didn't. Personally, I thought it was funny, and I enjoyed it because it's true that statistics show black people can jump higher than white people. It's all about how you look at it – you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that. Everyone remembers a time when someone said something offensive to them, but it's your choice to take it to heart or just laugh about it. Life is so much easier when you don't cry over every little thing that someone said to you. See, now I have a sense of humor. When I was in that movie, I was laughing so hard I almost peed myself. I didn't care that it singled out white people – so what, it's funny.  ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was also a book that many people found offensive, and I can see why. It had the n-word in there a lot. But back then, it was a different time, and the people in the book weren't saying it to you, so why would you be offended by it? They weren't offending you. If you take little things like that to heart, you'll have a tough time going through life. Some things you just have to let go and roll off your body.  In conclusion, yes, we've all had a lot of offensive things said to us, but you can't let it get you down so much that you have to move on. And if you move on, you'll be a better person in the long run."
53	3030	2	3	Books, music, movies, and other forms of media are valuable tools for learning, but it is important to exercise discretion in choosing what to consume. While some material can be educational and enriching, others may be harmful or inappropriate. It is essential to consider the content and quality of what we read, watch, and listen to. By being selective and mindful of the media we engage with, we can ensure a positive and enriching learning experience. Remember, not all books, music, and movies are created equal, so choose wisely.
54	3031	2	3	Every library has tons of information on just about everything. There are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information. There is even some information that some people might take offence to. On the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it. I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa.  The subject race might come into play in some books in libraries. Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race. Some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be a n important part of history that people need to be educated about. Some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color, relgion, or ethnic race. This information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today.  Libraries have all kinds of information. I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain. Even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know. Ultimately, the diversity of content available in libraries allows for a broader understanding of different perspectives, histories, and experiences, making it essential to preserve all materials for educational and informational purposes.
55	3032	2	3	In my opinion, books, movies, magazines, etc., should not be taken off the shelves if they are offensive to some people. Everyone has different views, and what one person finds offensive, another may not. Removing offensive material would result in empty shelves and hinder learning in schools. Authors and creators would be discouraged from producing new content if their work is constantly rejected. It is crucial to preserve diverse perspectives and allow individuals to choose what they want to read or watch. Overall, maintaining a variety of materials on the shelves, even if some find them offensive, is essential for education and freedom of expression.
56	3033	2	3	Being careful about what we have in libraries is essential because it can have a significant impact on individuals, especially children. Books, magazines, and movies can influence behavior, mindset, and even family dynamics. While libraries are valuable sources of knowledge and entertainment, it is crucial to filter out materials that may have negative effects. By being selective about what we expose ourselves and our children to, we can promote healthy growth, positive behavior, and a more peaceful environment. It is important to strike a balance between enjoying media and ensuring it does not harm our mental and emotional well-being. Ultimately, being mindful of the content we consume can lead to a more positive and enriching experience for everyone.
57	3034	2	3	Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  This quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate.  If we got rid of all of the books from our world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read.    If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about.  Children should be allowed to read books such as To Kill a Mockingbird, The Diary of Anne Frank, and Night in order to get a taste of how much times have changed.  Stories from grandparents only take a person back about 20 years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years.  Some families, such as an African American family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history.  It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated.  We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations.    Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted.  Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture.  How is a young girl from a small town in Iowa supposed to find out how people in Japan live their life?  For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos.  I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society.  Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well.  If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten.    Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves.  Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style.  Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows.  There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation.  Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality.  Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or our world.    Now, some parents may have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids.  If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally.  They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves.    Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in our world is beyond me.  It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides.  It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding.  Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful.  They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source.  Without them, we would be and have nothing.

Libraries already have designated children's sections, and it is the responsibility of parents and guardians to monitor what their children are reading. It would be unfair to inconvenience others by restricting access to certain materials just because of the possibility that a child might come across them. It is also important to consider the context in which a book, movie, or game is being used, as it may not necessarily be inappropriate. Ultimately, it is crucial to balance the need for access to information with the need to protect children, and removing offensive material may not be the most effective solution. In conclusion, I believe that censorship in libraries should be approached with caution and consideration for all perspectives involved.
59	3036	2	3	Who cares about unsensored things anyway? Offensive materials have always been present in libraries, so why the sudden concern now? Removing these materials from shelves and censoring them won't solve anything. If someone is not mature enough to handle certain content, then they shouldn't be reading it in the first place. Blaming offensive materials for societal issues like bullying is misguided; the focus should be on parenting and personal responsibility. It is unnecessary to censor books simply because a few individuals find them offensive. Let's leave unsensored things alone and focus on more important issues at hand. Thank you for your time.
60	3037	2	3	When you were a child, how much did you learn from books? Books are filled with great stories of far-away lands, accounts of real events, and poems with powerful meanings. All of those books were written by an author with a clear point to make. Those books should not be censored from libraries because of words or ideas that are found offensive. Children have to learn these things sometime in their life, and the earlier they learn, the less trouble it will cause them later in life. There are also freedoms in the United States that grant us freedom of speech. Shouldn't there be a freedom to read as well? Authors are brilliant people. Without them, there would be no books for anybody to read. We should all respect authors and what they put into their books. This means when an author believes that a certain word or action fits in a book, we should leave that book alone and respect what he or she chose to put in it. When I was a child, I picked up on everything. I was very inquisitive as any kid my age would be. I remember wandering around my public library scanning the rows of books and reading the titles. There were books about politics, religion, sex, and violence. However, on the other side of the library, there were books about children escaping their world and traveling through time in a magical treehouse. There were even stories about mice who had feelings and normal conversations amongst themselves! The library is great because of the plethora of knowledge contained in the unrestricted inventory of books. As I grew older, I began to delve into more adult books such as politics and religion. I then formed my own personal opinions on what I gathered from the books. Without those books in that library, I would have never been able to research those topics. There is an amendment in our Constitution that promotes freedom of speech in the United States. This allows for anybody to say whatever they please as long as they don't infringe upon the rights of anybody else. The definition of a library is a place where people can read and check out books from the library and return them when they please. Libraries should allow every book in their collection because every book has some sort of value. Taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them. Some books may have material that might not belong in the hands of children. Children need to learn those things sometime in their life. Why not now? Books are what have taught all of us. Please let them keep teaching.
61	3038	2	3	Books that are offensive should not be taken off the shelf altogether, but should be put in a section made for adult readers only. This way, no children would see the book anyway. If an offensive book is in a school or any other place where the majority of readers are children, then it should be okay to take that book off the shelf. All in all, it should be acceptable to remove an offensive book from a shelf, but only if the book is offensive to the wrong audience.
62	3039	2	3	I think that everyone's opinion is different about some books getting removed from the library. Do I believe that certain books should be removed from the library: yes and no. The reason why I choose yes and no is because some books are helpful to others for their class and their research for whatever class they need it for. Another reason why I say no is because if the book offends you then don't read the book or think about what it says, just leave it alone.  The other reason why I picked yes is because if it shows hurtful words towards others that are offensive, then yes, it needs to be removed before others start using those hurtful words towards their peers or elders. If the book contains racial slurs towards different races, then yes, they need to be removed as soon as possible. If others get a hold of these kinds of books, then everyone would use them against each other, resulting in outbreaks of fights, people arguing with each other, and pure hate between those people using it against different races.  These are my opinions on removing some books that contain hurtful things or meanings that can incite violence or target someone based on their name or race.
63	3040	2	3	Should censorship be used on library books? While some may argue that censoring inappropriate words in books is necessary, especially for younger audiences, others believe that it is unnecessary and may even detract from the overall quality of the material. Personally, I believe that a few cuss words in books, movies, music, and magazines are not a big deal, as long as they are not prominently displayed in libraries catering to younger children. High school and above should have access to a wider range of materials, including those with some level of explicit language. Censorship should not be a determining factor in selecting reading material; rather, focus should be placed on the content and the potential enjoyment that it may bring. Ultimately, exposure to some foul language in media can have an impact on youth, but it can also add depth and realism to storytelling. It is important to consider the context and purpose of such language rather than simply censoring it for the sake of censorship.
64	3041	2	3	There are many books that are offensive to people. I personally agree. There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children. There is a lot of material out there, whether it's books, movies, or other things that have a bad influence on children. Children learn by watching and observing. They learn from us and our generation. What better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences.  First, children watch movies and see people kissing, which can lead to more explicit content. Some movies even depict people having sex, which can have a negative influence on children. This exposure can lead to increased teen pregnancies and risky behavior. By limiting children's exposure to such content, we can help prevent these negative consequences.  Secondly, there are books, movies, and video games that glorify violence and crime. Children may be influenced by these portrayals and believe that such behavior is acceptable. This can lead to tragic incidents such as school shootings or acts of violence. It is crucial to monitor and control the media that children consume to prevent them from mimicking harmful behaviors.  Lastly, excessive screen time and sedentary activities are contributing to a rise in childhood obesity. Children are spending more time indoors watching TV or playing video games, leading to a lack of physical activity. This sedentary lifestyle can have serious health consequences and negatively impact a child's self-esteem and mental well-being. Encouraging children to be active and engage in outdoor activities can help combat obesity and promote a healthier lifestyle.  In conclusion, it is essential to protect children from harmful influences by monitoring the media they consume and promoting healthy habits. By taking proactive measures, we can ensure that children grow up in a safe and nurturing environment that promotes positive behavior and well-being. Let's work together to make a positive change for the future generation.
65	3042	2	3	I don't think that books should be censored. There are no books, besides maybe math books, that don't offend at least one person or a group of people. Books are an important part of the learning system. If a certain book offends you then you have to deal with it. It's that simple. There is no need to overreact to words on paper. Besides, there are more important issues at the moment.  While being offended by a book is bad, we must realize that some people are going through things that are way worse than that. People who do drugs or have a family member that does drugs are an example. A better example would be the parents or guardians of a kid who was killed either by accident or on purpose. One of the most common but overlooked examples is what the loved ones of people who die serving our country go through. As you can see, if people can live with that, then we can definitely handle an offensive book.  Censorship causes blindness. What I mean is, if we censor one offensive book, then we have to censor every book that someone finds offensive. All men are created equal, right? So they'd have to censor the book. If a book offends you that much, then listen up, just because a book is offensive to you doesn't mean it's offensive to everyone. Sometimes a history book could be considered offensive, so we censor it, and then we don't learn about the mistakes of our past and repeat them. The point is if a person can handle some of the things I've mentioned, then we can all handle a little bit of words on a little bit of paper. Ultimately, censorship is not the solution, and we must learn to accept diverse viewpoints and opinions in literature.
66	3043	2	3	This is what's wrong with today's society. We are too soft. We're too worried about what other people might think if we say this or do that. I'm the kind of person that doesn't care about other peoples' feelings. And I say that to an extent. If we're talking about my friends, family, my girlfriend, that's totally different. I show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis. But as far as people I don't know, I could care less what their beliefs, opinions, and outlooks on life are. Maybe we should stop worrying about other people for once and just try to grow and prosper as a race. Anybody ever think of that? If I had it my way, the @ORGANIZATION1 would not exist. @CAPS1, radio, books, movies, magazines would all be uncensored. Is life filtered and censored? Absolutely not! So why should those things be? I'm sick and tired of people constantly sheltering their children from life's normalcies. They've gotta learn sometime. Life isn't lollipops and rainbows. It's hard, unforgiving, and it kicks you in the teeth. You've just got to learn to adapt to it. And censorship in libraries, on @CAPS1 etc, won't and aren't helping matters in the least bit. I guess I don't understand why we have to care so much. If everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves, we would be fine. Every time I hear the word 'offensive' it makes me sick to my stomach because in my eyes, that word doesn't exist. It's a made-up word that really means we care about other peoples' feelings more than we do our own. Life is about growth, challenges, and facing realities, not sheltering ourselves from the world's truths. Let's embrace the rawness of life and focus on our own personal development rather than constantly worrying about others' perceptions. It's time to toughen up and take on life's challenges head-on, uncensored and unfiltered.
67	3044	2	3	I don't believe in censorship of libraries. In a free country like ours, we should have the right to access the material we want from libraries, regardless of whether it is deemed age-appropriate or not. If parents do not want their children exposed to certain content, it is their responsibility to monitor and regulate what their children read, watch, or listen to.   The freedom to access a wide range of materials is a fundamental aspect of living in a free society like ours. If we allow censorship in libraries, we risk losing access to a variety of books, movies, and music. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if one person has the power to remove a book they dislike, then everyone else could do the same, leading to a situation where no books are left on the shelves for anyone to enjoy.   Censorship in libraries could set a dangerous precedent that could lead to further restrictions on information and freedom of expression. It is important to preserve our rights and uphold the principles of freedom of access to information. Therefore, I am against the censorship of libraries as it would infringe upon our rights and limit our access to diverse perspectives and ideas.
68	3045	2	3	Books, magazines, music, movies, and other forms of media should not be censored based on age levels. Censorship limits the ability for individuals to learn and explore different topics. Books, for example, are a valuable source of education and can provide insights into various aspects of life. Censoring books could prevent individuals from gaining knowledge and understanding different perspectives.  In the past, books often contained cursing to accurately depict characters and set the tone of the story. Censoring this language would take away from the authenticity of the narrative and hinder the reader's ability to fully grasp the characters and their experiences. Everyone has the right to read and learn about topics that interest them, and censorship could restrict this freedom.  Overall, censorship of books in libraries should be avoided as it allows individuals to learn about the realities of life and explore diverse viewpoints. Exposure to different ideas and perspectives can help individuals become more informed and well-rounded individuals. Censorship should not be used to limit access to information and knowledge.
69	3046	2	3	I believe that if books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media are offensive or inappropriate, they should be removed to protect younger children. Young children should not be exposed to such content that is not suitable for their age. To ensure this, there should be a designated area where these materials can be kept away from children, and only adults can access them.  Among these media forms, movies and magazines are of particular concern due to the explicit content they may contain. While books and music may have offensive language, they are less likely to have explicit images or themes. If anyone comes across a book, music, movie, or magazine that they find inappropriate, they should have the right to remove it and bring it to the attention of library staff.  Separating censorship in libraries is essential to safeguarding children. Adults can handle mature content better than children, so it is necessary to keep such materials separate. By implementing these measures, we can ensure that children are protected from harmful content while still allowing adults access to a diverse range of materials.
70	3047	2	3	Many people are very stern about their beliefs, often shaped by their life experiences and the tragedies they have endured. While some may disagree with your opinions, it is important to understand that everyone is unique and has their own perspective. Acceptance is key to fostering harmony, yet homophobia continues to be a prevalent issue in society.  The debate between male and female opinions is another common occurrence, with both genders often at odds. Despite their differences, it is essential to recognize that men and women complement each other and play vital roles in society. Forgiveness and understanding are crucial in maintaining healthy relationships and moving forward from conflicts.  Books often reflect the diverse viewpoints and realities of individuals, providing insight into different perspectives on the world. Dramatic expressions can help convey emotions and experiences effectively, allowing others to understand the depth of one's beliefs and struggles.  Ultimately, it is essential to appreciate the uniqueness of each individual and strive for acceptance and understanding in order to create a more harmonious society. Cherishing every moment and valuing the diversity of opinions can lead to a more compassionate and empathetic world.
71	3048	2	3	I believe that all books are meant to be in the library. People would not want them gone if they thought of it the way I do. It makes sense that we need all sorts of books to learn from. Some books may seem bad, but when you think about it, there is always a good lesson to be learned. There are many different reasons why all books should stay on the shelf, but here are a couple of mine.  Two years ago, there was a boy named @PERSON1. On many occasions, he found himself in bad situations that he did not know how to deal with. Many parents do not talk to their kids about certain things, such as drugs. This makes kids unaware and curious to figure out the truth. He had no other way of figuring out how to handle fights, drugs, and alcohol unless he read about them in a book.  When he was almost sixteen years old, he began to hang out with a bad group of teenagers. They were going to take @PERSON1 to a party. @PERSON1 secretly left his house and went because he was curious. When he got to the party, everybody began to drink. He knew that he always wanted to try it, yet he was not going to because he had to be home before his parents got up at five the next morning.  After several hours of sitting on a couch watching everybody else do it, they finally had him talked into it. He figured that one would not hurt. Well before long, one became two, two became four, and it just kept going up. @PERSON1 was having so much fun that he lost track of time. He looked at the clock, and it was three a.m., he got really worried.  He didn't know what to do until he thought back to a book he read. The book was about a guy who was out drinking, the guy had no other way home than to drive. The guy decided he would just drive home because he was not very drunk. When he was driving home, he pulled out on a highway at the wrong time. A semi hit him on the left side of his car.  After thinking about that book, he decided to be brave and call his parents. @PERSON1 knew that he would get punished, but he decided that grounding would be better than injury or even death. @PERSON1 had his dad come get him from the party. He was grounded for two months. It would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end. @PERSON1 was happy with his decision as well.  Events such as that are the exact reason why I think that almost any book belongs on the shelf. The story in each book helps everybody comprehend what should be done in real-life situations. I know that books help me figure out many things, even what to do and what not to do. If you just give every book a chance, you will find a good reason for it to be read.
72	3049	2	3	Certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. They can have a negative influence on younger children and contain explicit content that may be inappropriate for them. Additionally, some materials can be offensive to certain races, religions, or individuals, leading to feelings of discrimination and disrespect. It is important to consider the impact of these offensive materials and their potential to harm individuals or perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Therefore, removing such offensive content from shelves is necessary to promote a more inclusive and respectful society.
73	3050	2	3	NO, I don't think music, movies, magazines, and other non-book materials should be removed from libraries. A library should offer a variety of resources to cater to different interests and preferences. Music can create a relaxing atmosphere and uplift one's mood, while movies provide entertainment and educational value. Magazines keep readers updated on various topics and can be a great way to pass the time. These materials enhance the overall library experience and should continue to be available for patrons to enjoy. In conclusion, a library is more than just books, and the inclusion of music, movies, and magazines contributes to a vibrant and engaging environment for all visitors.
74	3051	2	3	The library is a pathway to knowledge, branching into various cultural roads. It has evolved from a place of books to encompass music, movies, magazines, and more. The question arises whether certain materials should be excluded if deemed offensive.   Censorship is often seen as a solution to offensive or politically incorrect materials. However, those advocating for censorship may not fully understand the viewpoints of those they claim to protect. Parents play a crucial role in determining what their children can access in the library, whether setting restrictions or allowing free exploration.   As a creator myself, I believe in the importance of being able to share one's work freely. Libraries serve as vital outlets for creators to spread their ideas. The issue of censorship in libraries poses challenges in determining what materials should be excluded and on what grounds.   In conclusion, access to all kinds of materials in a library should be upheld. It is a place where individuals can delve into worlds they may never experience otherwise. The ability of libraries to provide such diverse resources should not be compromised.
75	3052	2	3	In third grade, I took a book off the shelf of my local library that had an interesting cover. It was rather large, but I had come to love reading in that time of my life so I decided I was up for it. The genre of the book was fantasy which I enjoyed immensely. Although, there were some parts of the book that had me confused. There were scenes involving women that I did not understand, and many new words. Eventually, I came to ask my dad about a certain part of the book. He read the passage, and his eyes went wide. I never finished that book.  There is no doubt that I had a learning experience by reading that book, but, as my dad obviously thought, it may have been a little too much for that time in my life. If it were not for my mom not wanting to make a big deal out of it, my dad would have had a little chat with that library. Now that I am old enough to understand what was going on in that book, I realize that I lost some of my innocence because of it. There is simply some material that is not appropriate for children, and it should not be put in our public libraries. Not censoring what is put on the shelves seems absurd considering my experience. If I have a son someday, I want to be the one telling him about the touchy subjects of women and swearing; it should not be from some fiction book. I also do not appreciate the other material found in our libraries. The music that I see has artists that write their songs without children in mind, movies have up to R ratings, and magazines promote gossip and have sexual references.  Overall, it is disappointing to me that our libraries have allowed some of these things onto their shelves. As I think about my experience in third grade, I wish I had never seen that book. Maybe it would have allowed me to keep a little more innocence for a little bit longer, and maybe I would have respected women more through my youth. I would love to see more censorship in libraries so that we can protect today's children until the parents choose to open their eyes to the world. It is essential to consider what materials are suitable for children to access in public spaces, ensuring that they are not exposed to content that may be inappropriate for their age and understanding.
76	3053	2	3	Have you ever noticed how much bad material is out there for children to access? Whether it's a movie, book, magazine, music, or even content on the internet, there is no shortage of potentially harmful material. While it may be tempting to try and eliminate all of this negative influence, it's important to consider the implications of such actions.  Removing all offensive materials could spark conflict and violence among those who have differing opinions on what is considered appropriate. Throughout history, we have seen how attempting to suppress certain forms of expression can lead to rebellion and resistance. People will always find ways to access what they want, regardless of restrictions.  Furthermore, censoring offensive material goes against our fundamental right to freedom of speech. While certain content may be offensive to some, it is not up to any one individual or group to dictate what others can or cannot see or hear. It is impossible to please everyone, and trying to eliminate all offensive material would be a futile and ultimately restrictive endeavor.  In the end, trying to rid the world of all offensive material would only serve to create more problems than it solves. As parents, it is important to guide and educate our children on navigating the complexities of the world around them, rather than shield them from every potentially harmful influence. Offensive material will always exist, and it is something that we must learn to coexist with while upholding our rights to freedom of speech.
77	3054	2	3	Libraries often face the dilemma of whether to remove items that some people find offensive. This decision can be challenging, as it may result in losing customers regardless of the choice made. People may have differing opinions on what is offensive, and it is important to consider the feelings and perspectives of others before making a decision. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to decide whether they want to request the removal of an offensive item or not, keeping in mind the diverse preferences and sensitivities of library patrons.
78	3055	2	3	If you were offended by a book in the library, would you want it taken off the shelf? I wouldn't. There is no point in removing it, as there are many books that offend people, and that one book isn't just targeting you. The same goes for movies and music. Books should be able to cover any topic that interests people. Some may not find the same thing offensive as you do, as everyone's perspectives differ. If books were limited to only certain emotions or viewpoints, there wouldn't be as much variety in literature. In a free country, we have the right to express ourselves through writing and speech.   Movies also serve as a medium for expressing emotions and ideas. While some may find certain films offensive, they are not created with the intention of targeting specific individuals. People may feel like the center of attention in movies, but this is often a personal interpretation.   Music, too, can evoke strong emotions and serve as a form of freedom of speech. While some may find certain songs offensive, music is a way for artists to express their thoughts and emotions. I have never been offended by a song, as people have the right to express themselves through music.   Freedom of speech is essential in the world, and people must learn to accept differing opinions without taking offense. Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be censored based on individual emotions. These forms of art are expressions that reflect how people think and respond to various subjects.
79	3056	2	3	Many books and material in libraries are sometimes offensive to certain people, but that does not mean they should be taken off the shelves. Offensive material can still hold value for others, so it should be handled thoughtfully. One way to address this is by placing controversial material in a separate section of the library, where it can be accessed by request or with staff assistance. This ensures that the material is still available, but with added precautions.  In addition, sensitive topics like sex, racism, politics, and more could be kept behind the counter, similar to cigarettes in a store. This would limit public exposure while still allowing access through special requests. By keeping such material out of plain sight, it can prevent unnecessary uproar or discomfort in the community.  For small towns that may be particularly sensitive to certain material, restrictions could be put in place to limit access. This would involve only allowing specific material to be available in larger libraries or designated bookstores, ensuring that smaller communities are not exposed to potentially upsetting content.  Overall, implementing these measures can help strike a balance between providing access to diverse material and being considerate of different sensitivities within the community. By taking these steps, libraries can continue to be valuable resources for all while respecting varying viewpoints and preferences.
80	3057	2	3	I do not think that books should be removed from shelves just because some people find them offensive. Everyone has their own beliefs and opinions, and it's important to respect that diversity. For example, while some may find certain content offensive, others may find value or significance in it. It's essential to remember that not everyone will agree on what is acceptable or appropriate. People have the right to choose what they read and what they believe in. If a book offends someone, they always have the option not to read it. However, that doesn't mean it should be banned for others who may have a different perspective. In a society where freedom of expression is valued, it's crucial to allow for a variety of viewpoints and ideas, even if they may be controversial or uncomfortable for some. Ultimately, censorship limits intellectual freedom and the exchange of diverse thoughts and perspectives, which are essential for a healthy and open society.
81	3058	2	3	All throughout the world there are libraries with a variety of materials on their shelves. While some of these materials may be considered inappropriate by some, I believe that libraries should have the freedom to choose what they offer to the public. Everyone has different tastes and interests, so having a diverse range of materials allows individuals to explore and learn about a wide variety of subjects.  While some may be concerned about children accessing inappropriate material in libraries, there are ways to address this issue. For example, libraries could have separate sections or rooms for more mature content, ensuring that children are not exposed to material that may not be suitable for them. This way, individuals who are interested in such material can still access it while parents can feel more comfortable knowing that their children are protected.  Schools play an important role in educating students not only academically but also about the world around them. By having a variety of materials in libraries, including those that may be considered offensive by some, students can gain a better understanding of different perspectives and issues that exist in society. This can help them develop critical thinking skills and become more informed individuals.  In conclusion, while there may be concerns about censorship in public libraries, there are ways to address these concerns while still allowing for a diverse range of materials to be available. By implementing strategies to separate inappropriate content from children and providing access to a wide variety of materials, libraries can continue to be valuable resources for individuals of all ages and interests.
82	3059	2	3	Censorship is the idea of blocking or removing things that are offensive to people's beliefs, religion, race, or way of life. However, I do not believe that books in libraries should be censored. While some content may be offensive to some, it is not fair to remove books that may be valuable to others. Parents should take responsibility for monitoring what their children read rather than censoring materials for everyone. Libraries should remain open spaces for diverse ideas and perspectives, even if they may be controversial. Censorship should not extend to libraries as it limits access to information and restricts intellectual freedom. It is important to respect differing opinions and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they read.
83	3060	2	3	Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being what may be offensive to you may not be to someone else. The next reason is that the thing being called offensive can help teach others about different perspectives. Lastly, if we start removing things we don't like, the world would lose its diversity and freedom of expression. Therefore, it is important to keep a variety of materials available, even if they may be offensive to some individuals.
84	3061	2	3	Dear Katherine Paterson,  Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I honestly don't think that's necessary because not everybody may find those materials offensive. If a couple of people think that a certain book or something is offensive, then don't read it or pay attention to it; don't take something from someone that they like.  I think that if there were people who found a certain topic interesting and there were also people who found it offensive, they should keep the material, and the people who dislike it would just have to get over it. Either way, I think they shouldn't remove those materials unless everyone agrees that it's offensive. That's not fair to everyone else who likes that topic just because one person found it offensive. Now, if a magazine for the public is being racist or something like that, then maybe that can be considered being removed, but other than that, I see no reason why you should take away something that some people enjoy. Let's say I enjoy movies, books, or magazines about hunting and people find it offensive to kill animals for the fun of it or for food. Just because that single person doesn't like that certain thing doesn't mean they should take it away from everyone else. That's just their opinion on things, and you can't always get what you want, so just deal with it.  Well, those are my thoughts on whether or not you should remove materials that some people find offensive. My last opinion is if you don't like the material and it offends you, don't read it or have anything to do with it. Other than that, you shouldn't take materials away from people unless everyone agrees on it.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
85	3062	2	3	Many people have different opinions about what's appropriate and what's not. It depends on one's beliefs and morals. I personally don't think that there should be any censorship in libraries. I think that individuals should have the freedom to choose what to read, watch, or listen to. Each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe. It also depends on a person's age and maturity level. Some parents let their kids watch certain movies that maybe other parents wouldn't. The situation is different for each person. It's hard to judge certain materials because some may find it acceptable while others might not. There would be controversy over virtually everything because everybody has different standards of what's acceptable and what's not, and these standards would clash with each other. It would be impossible to make sure that nothing in libraries would be offensive to everyone. If someone finds something offensive, then they don't have to check it out. I also think that there are some things that can be done to help appease the argument. For example, materials can be categorized by maturity level. That's what movie ratings are for. Materials should be organized so that individuals can easily see if they would be offensive or not. For example, all the kids' movies and books can be put together so that parents don't have to worry about their kids seeing or reading something inappropriate. It should be obvious to individuals who would find it offensive and who wouldn't. Individuals should have the individual freedom to make decisions for themselves. A library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want. Just because somebody finds a book offensive, that doesn't mean that nobody should be allowed to read it. That being said, certain things can be done so that individuals would know if something would be offensive or not.
86	3063	2	3	How would you feel if you wrote a story about your life, and someone found it offensive, so they took the book off of the shelves? I feel as if the censorship in libraries is becoming a controversial problem for the following reasons: it is wrong to take away freedoms, people have different opinions and views, and some books, magazines, or songs are trying to make people aware of dangers.  One important aspect in why censorship is becoming controversial is; it takes away our freedom of speech. In our country, we have the right to speak our minds. If everything we read was censored, there would be nothing to read. The liberties and freedoms of all citizens should not be taken away because of something that is thought to be inappropriate.  Another reason why I believe censorship is wrong is; different people have completely different opinions on things. One person might feel that a book about a sexual assault victim is offensive, while another person might think the book is informational and helpful. No one can base censorship on one belief or idea, because it will never be the belief or idea that everyone approves of.  A third reason why censorship should not be enforced as much is; it takes away the awareness of the dangers in everyday life. Stories about people who were kidnapped, or were in a car crash because the person who was driving was under the influence of drugs, can be a good thing. Even though the story may have some accounts that are not appropriate, it could be very influential, and convince someone to make the right choice. If we censor stories about abduction, drugs, alcohol, or people making the wrong choices, no one will be able to read a story about it and make the right choice instead of making the same mistake as the person.  Although stories or magazine articles that may be seen as vulgar are looked down upon, they help to make people aware, give people the freedom of speech, and allow them to have their own opinions. Censorship in libraries and media should be abolished to ensure that everyone has the right to access information and make their own decisions based on that information.
87	3064	2	3	I actually do believe that they should be able to be removed from the shelf. On the other hand i do not believe that anything rascist should be on library shelfs. Teens these days want to be able to pick up a book that they can actually relate to and the same thing goes for a movie, nusic, and a magazine.      You can't help what people want to listen to or like to read or watch. I don't really like robot movie's or any of that crap so that wouldn't be something i'd pick out to watch. On the other hand i don't think that it should have to be removed out of the library just because i dont like it. Also something like @CAPS1 in the @LOCATION1, i don't think that it should be removed from shelve's just because of the title. Family @CAPS2 is a really funny show but also has a lot of bad language in it but i don't think it should be removed because thats what people like to watch. Teens want to be able to read about they can relate to, but some of the things in the book can be offensive maybe. If they didn't have anything to read that they could relate to hardly anyone would read. Not everyone listens to the same music but a @NUM1 yr old doesn't want to go around listening to barney, they want to listen to the music that they like and think is cool, but on the other hand others @MONTH1 not like it. Not letting you get something off of the library shelf because it's bad is like saying you can't eat a certain kind of food because its bad for you.     If people didn't get to listen to, read, or watch the things that they like they would be screwed and very upset. I think people are entitled to their own opinion, although some people's opinions could be rather stupid. Not everyone likes the same things and we shouldn't have to. Teens should have the ability to choose what they read, watch, and listen to, even if it may not align with everyone's tastes or preferences. It is essential to respect individual choices and allow for a diverse range of materials to be available in libraries to cater to the varied interests and needs of the community.
88	3065	2	3	From my own observations, I do not believe that any materials should be removed from libraries. All students have the right to read and learn about different subjects, even if some may find them offensive. For example, studying the Holocaust is crucial to understanding the atrocities of the past and preventing them from happening again in the future. It is essential for individuals to have access to a wide range of information to become well-rounded and educated members of society. Therefore, censorship or removal of materials from libraries should not be encouraged. People should have the freedom to choose what they read and learn, allowing for a more informed and diverse perspective on the world.
89	3066	2	3	I do think that there should be censorship not just in libraries, but everywhere. Personally, I believe that the way libraries organize their books is appropriate, and if parents do not want their children accessing certain materials, they should be vigilant and keep a close eye on them. Parents should be aware of their children's interests and guide them to the appropriate sections in the library. Censorship plays a crucial role in protecting children from harmful content and ensuring a safe environment for all. It is important for parents to take an active role in monitoring their children's reading materials and guiding them towards age-appropriate content. Overall, censorship is essential in maintaining a positive and safe environment for everyone.
90	3067	2	3	How would you feel if you were at your local library and you found something with something offensive in it? Many people would not approve of having offensive materials in their library. The library is open to anyone and anyone could see the material. Library's should make sure there isn't anything offinsive in their materials before they put them on the shelf. Everyone has access to the library in your district and can look at anything that is there. A lot of stuff that can be found in your library could be offensive; but how would people know what is offensive and what isn't? Library's shouldn't have that accessable. If they still have it in your library, then it should have a warning on it or be on a high shelf. Library's should be aware of what they are putting on the shelves and know if it is appropriate or not. Furthermore, children also have access to the public library. Most of the time the child will have an adult with them but sometimes they can pick up something before you can stop them. If there is something offensive in a child's reach, they might grab it and see whats in it. Most librarys have a childrens section where you can trust that there isn't anything offensive in it. Not all children will just go to the childrens section so there shouldn't be offensive material in library's or at least in childrens reach. Lastly, librarys choose what they put on the shelves and they never know who will look at it. If there is offensive material in their stuff then anyone can see it and it could put a negative thought in some peoples heads. There are some people who are mature enough to see the offensive material but there are others who can't. Thoes that can't, it @MONTH1 reflect something negative on them and it @MONTH1 cause problems. Therefore, there should not be offinsive material in librarys. In @CAPS1, librarys should not supply offinsive material. If there are people that want to see that kind of stuff there are other ways of getting that material. There shouldn't be access to that in your library because everyone can see it and you don't know how it will effect them. If there is going to be offinsive material in your library there should be an adult area where only people over the age of @NUM1 can enter. If there is something offinsive that is open to anyone, hopefully one day librarys will elimanate them.
91	3068	2	3	I believe that offensive materials should not be available for children in libraries. These materials should be placed in a separate section for adults. It is important to fight for what our libraries offer to young people. We should have the right to remove offensive books from children's sections and ensure that only appropriate content is available for them. Our children should not be exposed to inappropriate material at a young age. It is crucial to provide them with the right kind of books and resources so they can learn and grow in a positive way. We must prioritize the well-being and development of our children by advocating for suitable materials in libraries. Let's work together to create a safe and educational environment for our young ones.
92	3069	2	3	If you walk into a store and see a book you don't like or a magazine you could care less for, you should not be able to get rid of it. You do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. You are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers, and if you don't like it, don't buy it or look. When I was in the eighth grade, I went to @LOCATION2 for a church missions trip. There were a lot of cool things there that I saw. This was one of the most popular places in the @LOCATION1. When we wouldn't be working or serving others, we would walk around and do some shopping. There were a lot of people in this city, and it was packed all the time. Now with that being said, there were a lot of different stores, and there are some, in my opinion, at the time that I thought were very inappropriate for my age level. My whole group walked into a store where we just really didn't belong, and we all had no clue this was the kind of store this was. Our actions simply involved nodding our heads goodbye at the cashier and walking out, continuing our day of shopping. We did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store. The reason being is that that was their store, and we had no right to remove anything. After we left, other people walked into that store and liked what they saw. If we had removed those items, they wouldn't have gotten to see what they liked. That would be like someone removing something from a store I like, meaning I'd never get to see it, and I wouldn't want that. If you walk into a store and see something you do not like, you shouldn't be able to try to get rid of that object. Whether you want your kids to see it or not, you just can't do it. You take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you. You are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like to. Every store should have their own certain things, and what you find offensive, other people might like. That goes for the opposite too, what other people find offensive, you might like. It is all a big chain with many loops. So, say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display. Now that material is gone all because you thought it was offensive. Say another person walks into the same store and takes something off the shelf that they thought was offensive. Now there are two things gone from the shelf, but you actually liked what they took off the shelf, and you're upset that they took that off. This will cause a lot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed. One person likes it, one person doesn't. If you don't like what you see in a store, then you shouldn't walk in, or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you. These are some of my opinions about this category. I believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other store's products. Always be aware of what you're getting yourself into and know the outcome of the decisions you make. This could cause a lot of lost jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you. I hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasoning for what I have said.
93	3070	2	3	Libraries are valuable educational resources that offer a wide range of materials for people to explore. While some individuals may find certain items offensive, it is important to consider the diverse perspectives and preferences of library users. If something is deemed offensive by a significant number of people, it may be worth discussing with library staff for potential solutions. However, removing materials solely based on individual preferences may not be fair to others who may benefit from them. Ultimately, libraries aim to provide a variety of resources to cater to the diverse needs and interests of their community, and open communication can help address any concerns regarding potentially offensive content.
94	3071	2	3	Definitely not, offensive material may be offensive to some but not all. Everyone will come across offensive material at some point in their life, so there is no real reason to censor it. Offensive materials are created to entertain some people, as some may find them entertaining. I believe that nothing in the library is so offensive that it needs to be removed. If something offends you, you can simply choose not to engage with it and opt for different material. Censoring materials goes against the First Amendment, a cornerstone of our democracy. If we start censoring everything that some people find offensive, soon there may be nothing left. Books, music, and movies are forms of expression, and censoring them restricts creativity and cultural growth. Censorship hinders our progress as a society and limits our ability to explore diverse perspectives. It is essential to protect freedom of expression and allow all voices to be heard in order to foster a rich and vibrant cultural landscape.
95	3072	2	3	Have you ever been to a library and found no books or magazines on the shelves? It may seem like a strange scenario, but imagine if libraries removed all potentially offensive materials. There would be very little left to read. However, if you come across a book or movie that offends you, the simple solution is to choose something else. It's all about personal choice. If you feel strongly about a particular item, you can bring it to the attention of the library manager. They can then assess the situation and decide how to proceed. It's important to remember that just because something offends you, it doesn't mean it should be removed for everyone else. Libraries offer a wide range of materials to cater to diverse interests and preferences. So, the next time you encounter something offensive, consider discussing it with the library staff rather than demanding its removal. In the end, it's about finding a balance between individual sensitivities and the freedom to explore different perspectives through reading and viewing materials.
96	3073	2	3	What are we hiding from? Is personal expression really that bad? Questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises. In my own personal opinion, I believe forbidding works of art from libraries is the same as destroying the people who created them. Censorship in general is a way to hide reality and sugarcoat the struggles within life itself. One cannot learn unless given the opportunity to face the problems in society and the world. By banning certain pieces, the world destroys an opportunity to expand the knowledge of every individual.  With the removal of materials such as books and music, libraries ruin the time spent and heart that the creators have placed trustfully within them. Although most people use these materials strictly for entertainment, the writers and musicians created them for self-expression and to show their pain and struggles. It could even be said that expression such as this is therapeutic for these specific individuals. How would you react if your form of art was deemed unsuitable for a public audience? Would you be hurt and taken aback? Many artists probably feel that they are being placed in a state of seclusion and hatred. With the creation of art, there is always a deeper meaning behind them. The biggest question in my eyes is, who deems that material as unsuitable for libraries? What can be so wrong with specific material that we must take it away from everyone? At the pace our world is going today, there will be no individualism left within the next fifty years. If people are not even allowed to listen to specific types of music, sooner or later people won't be able to wear certain types of clothes or even dye their hair a different color. The human population's greatest gift is their ability to be different. If our society cannot even handle freedom of expression through art, how can it handle any other type?  Libraries are created as a place to expand knowledge. If materials are censored, how can anyone learn? Every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects. A book seen as entertainment and downtime reading to one person may be the very thing that strikes a world-changing idea in the mind of another. A human's greatest idea comes strictly from the knowledge they have accumulated throughout their lifetime and off of their interests. If certain forms of art are censored, individuals will never be able to find that form of interest in certain subjects. Everyone will strictly be forced to believe and learn the same things, restricting the world from the magical ideas one man could have formed with the information obtained from the art that had been censored.  The biggest thing about censorship is the cover-up of reality. Do libraries think if they do not publicly display a controversial topic, no one will know about it? Knowledge is all around us. No one needs a book to tell you our world is not perfect. For all we know, a book censored could have saved millions of lives. I cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public. There will soon come a time where expression at all will be censored. If we are getting rid of art, should we remove people too? I can relate censoring books to censoring people based on my own personal experience. A teacher once told me that I would not ever achieve my career because I had piercings. Opinions such as these could kill a person's dreams. I have known that I wanted to be a lawyer since I was seven years old and have been working to better my education based on my goals. How can you tell someone that they are not good enough based on your specific beliefs? There will always be something in the world you do not like. Each library has decided to censor a different type of art from their individual location. Eventually, the world will have no art left because those few people chose that it was not suitable for everyone. I can almost guarantee that most individuals have lived through worse experiences than what is being covered up. The world cannot be sugarcoated or portrayed as perfect because that is not life. Everyone will struggle at some point, and it's works of art that really get us through it. Sometimes we relate to them, or in my case, art such as music is what makes me feel better when I am hurt. The pain will always be there. Going through reality and the struggles is what makes each individual who they are. Censorship in libraries will not hide anything from the public; it will just destroy an opportunity to grow.  Censorship in libraries is what will destroy our world. No individual can say that material is not suited for the public because they are not the public. Every person has their own opinions on life. By banning these works of art, you are banning individuality as a whole. If things like this continue, our planet will become mindless zombies with no personal opinions. Libraries will be taking knowledge from everyone and ruining the chances for greatness for many people. There is no true way to hide reality
97	3074	2	3	Several years ago, a parent at my school complained to the administration about a book, The @PERSON2, her child was about to read for his English class. She believed that it was an inappropriate book for a ninth-grader to read. She was within her rights to be a little nervous about the book, as there had been concerns from within the school when it had been added to the curriculum. The administration eventually decided to keep the book as part of the class because even though the appropriateness of one scene may have been in question, the rest of the book taught lessons that were important to children, like tolerance for other cultures, the importance of right and wrong, and that you must fix the things that you have done wrong.   Although I understand that parents do not want to expose their precious children to the rest of the world, I believe that it is important to be exposed to a wide variety of materials because it helps people learn about different cultures and other ways of life. I once read a quote that said something along the lines of understanding leads to tolerance. We cannot ban books and other media because we think they are inappropriate for a situation. Being able to understand another person's culture or point of view may one day lead to the solution of problems in our world today, such as the crisis in the @LOCATION1 involving the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2.  I agree very much with the quote by Katherine Paterson about how if we all take away books and other media that we dislike, we would have nothing left. A good example of this is the popular internet video site, @CAPS3. There are thousands of videos listed on this site and millions of people who watch them. On each video, there is a place to leave feedback on whether you liked or disliked said video. With all of the different viewpoints, opinions, and interests of the millions of people who have viewed this site, it is very difficult to find a video without at least one or two dislikes. If we all had the power to take videos we disliked off the site, there would be none left for us to watch.  Another reason why we cannot just remove offensive things from our shelves is that without authors taking a little rebellious flair and exposing new ideas, the material we read would quickly become very boring. During the women's suffrage movement, the men of this country thought the idea of women being allowed to vote was offensive. Now, after many years, it is seen as a commonplace thing and it is now a legal right for women to vote. This is an example of how a once radical idea has now gained support and made people's lives better. If we take these books from our shelves, we are harming ourselves and allowing us to become ignorant.  All books and media have value, whether they express just one person's ideas or the thoughts of thousands. We remove material from our shelves at a risk to ourselves as individuals and as a society as a whole. I believe that the founding fathers of our country knew what they were doing when they included the freedom of speech in the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. If we remove books and other media from the literal and figurative shelves of our society, are we not denying the authors, writers, singers, and publishers who made those works their freedom of speech? Ultimately, it is crucial to embrace a diverse range of materials to foster understanding, tolerance, and growth in our society.
98	3075	2	3	The old saying one should never judge a book by it's cover comes into literal meaning with this particular subject. Every mind that is among the world is extremely different, just as every book is. One person may look upon a certain subject as offensive, while others may not have the same point of view. However, in my personal opinion books with 'suggestive' references or language should be placed in sections marked mature and clearly labeled with a warning of the contents lying between the pages. With over a billion different points of views residing all over the world, why should books that only a few select find inappropriate people be removed? Every person has their own life story and rough experiences. Life's journey brings bumps in the road which can scare someone deeply and change their life forever. While reading a book, a viewer may skim across a passage that brings horrible experiences swelling back up in them. For one to have to relive a trauma that they have struggled to get over isn't right, but for another to read about a situation similar to a particular person's life journey could possibly grant them more understanding and compassion for the victim. I do not believe victims of abuse no matter what degree should have to read about that subject in a book they thought they were reading for leisure. However, these books should not be taken off the shelves because people who have not had to endure a struggle such as this should be able to grasp a better understanding for the other person. Books for a more mature mind should be monitored and placed upon a shelf out of reach from a child who can not yet handle that topic. At a young age I selected a book I had thought was a ghost story. Midway through I came to the understanding that the book was truly about a young girl my age being raped. As a sixth grader I was horrified because I was not yet exposed to that danger of the world, and I was not mature enough to handle that subject. For weeks I walked the halls scared that I might have the same fate as the girl in the story I had read. Books with mature topics should be separated from those for younger children, because the description in a book may leave a child with emotional scars. Labeling books clearly with any 'suggestive' content the book may contain would help this issue tremendously. If books are clearly labeled that they contain offensive words, comments, or horrifying situations, then a reader who will become offended will have less likely of a chance to grab the material. If children who are still developing their level of maturity come across a book that mentions inappropriate subjects, they will have a better understanding of what they may be about to view. By simply pressing a label on a book that states the concerns can be found within the pages, it will save the world a lot of harm. If books begin to fly off the shelves because of offensive topics, there won't be many books left to read. Every person takes a different look at what a story says, just as every age group comprehends the message that passages give differently. By monitoring and labeling books, bookworms will be able to make a quick decision on whether or not the material they think they want to read is for them. So, in conclusion don't take away the wonders of reading from those who enjoy traveling through the imagination of books, but let them know exactly what they will see as they mosey through the unknown pages of a new adventure.
99	3076	2	3	Yes, I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the bookshelves if they are found offensive to someone. People visit libraries for reading, studying, and quiet time, not to be offended. Librarians should be responsible for determining what is appropriate for their library. Offensive materials should not be displayed in public areas to ensure a comfortable and respectful environment for all patrons. It is essential to maintain a standard of decency in libraries to prevent people from feeling uncomfortable or discouraged from utilizing the library's resources. In conclusion, offensive materials should be removed from libraries to uphold a welcoming and inclusive space for everyone.
100	3077	2	3	It seems you cannot always make everyone happy. No matter what, someone is offended or upset over something. This holds true with everything- including media. Whether it be a book, movie, or a song, someone somewhere will be unhappy with it for some reason. Though this is true, it certainly does not mean you can take that media away from those who enjoy it. The Constitution of the United States guarantees that all people are granted freedom of speech and freedom of press. Would taking 'offensive' material off of shelves not take away from this right so clearly and intently given to us? Not only that, but does sheltering the public and making us all believe the world is a place without bias, prejudice, or slander really help us in the grand scheme of things? Pretending that the world is perfect ensures that future generations of the world will be devastated by reality once they get out in the real world and realize everything is not perfect and nice and unbiased all the time.  My ninth-grade year in high school, I read 'To Kill A Mockingbird' by Harper Lee. This book demonstrates the harsh prejudice that used to be normal in the South during the earlier years of the United States. This book could certainly be considered offensive by a person living in the southern states; one could say this book stereotypes people in the South. One could also say this book is offensive because of the language it uses. African-Americans could be offended by the explicit racist comments and names within the pages. Despite this, 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is considered a classic and is praised and taught throughout the United States and the rest of the world. I grew from reading Harper Lee's masterpiece- it taught me a lot about where the United States has been and how far it has come with acceptance of other races. You learn from your mistakes, they say. Therefore, we can learn from the media's mistakes. We can grow as people from being offended or having offensive material brought to our attention. We can stop history from repeating itself by being well-informed.  Theology is a huge matter of dispute among all cultures; Christian or Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, or atheist. Any bookstore you walk into, you can find a Bible or a book on atheism or even 'The Satanic Bible,' which focuses on Satanism. Any music store you walk into, you can find bands that bash the ideas of religion, but you can also find theistic worship bands or meditating music. Just the same, any movie theater or movie store you visit could supply movies with anti-theistic or pro-theistic themes. Taking such things off of the shelves because one work could be offensive to a group of people could limit another's options to explore theology and find out what suits them. It could limit one's exploration of interests. It could very well take away from one's personal growth.  In any case, it is unfair to take something that could be considered offensive to one person away from another just for the sake of being nice and having discretion. Putting a ban on certain works could harm the flow of society. Putting a ban on certain works could limit one's awareness of the world around them or the history they could potentially be inspired by, it could limit the expansion of one's intellect, it could take away from one's exploration of interests or the search of who they really are or want to be. It is best to just keep things the way they are- free.
101	3078	2	3	Most people create books that may be inappropriate or offensive, drawing from their own life experiences. While some individuals may find certain materials offensive, it is important to recognize that these materials can also serve as a valuable resource for personal growth and understanding. It is not necessary to remove such materials from shelves, as they can provide insight into different perspectives and help individuals navigate the complexities of life. Ultimately, it is up to each person to decide whether or not they engage with these materials, but they should not be removed simply because they may be deemed offensive by some. Embracing diverse viewpoints and experiences can contribute to a richer understanding of the world around us.
102	3079	2	3	I think that books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media should be allowed to remain on the shelves of stores and libraries. Removing them would deprive people, especially children, of valuable knowledge about historical events, famous figures, and various topics of interest. While some content may be considered inappropriate, eliminating all books would leave little to read and hinder learning opportunities. Reading is an enjoyable activity for many, and access to a diverse range of books is essential for expanding knowledge and understanding the world. It is important to preserve our literary heritage and provide future generations with the resources to explore different subjects. Therefore, it is unnecessary to remove books from libraries as they play a crucial role in education and entertainment.
103	3080	2	3	I've recently read a letter from Katherine Paterson about censorship in libraries. This is my opinion expressed in words about how I feel about the whole topic.   I've been reading ever since I hit first grade. To be honest, I couldn't tell you the names of most of them because... well I just can't remember them. I'd like to think that it's because I have a horrible memory, but the truth is, they were just unappealing and unmemorable books. In all aspects, these books could be considered a waste of my life. Back then, I guess I only read them because I had nothing better to do, which is horrible because you should read books because you want to. I stopped reading books at around seventh grade because every book I picked up seemed to be extremely boring and it would take the first one hundred pages to actually have something decent happen.  Luckily, there is light at the end of this tunnel. Every now and then you come across a book that changes your life. Not literally, but it feels that way at the time (which is what you should feel). These are the books I remember. These 'life-changing' books all have things in them that would interest anyone who picks them up. Unfortunately, these things would be viewed as innappropriate to a select audience. For example, one book might talk about murder and be viewed as highly offensive by a person whose mother had been murdered, whereas the same book could be viewed as a piece of art by someone who has escaped the terribleness of death. Apparently it has gotten to the point where people would have the books censored or have them removed the libraries completely. I can stand idle no longer.  Books all go through a long, drawn-out process before they are shelf-ready. They need to be written, read, and selected to be published. For some books, this can take years. To completely alienate these books is extremely unfair to the time that was put into them. If you don't like the books, don't read them. It's as simple as that. If that's not enough reason for you, think of it this way: a book about a child getting raped and fighting to overcome it could serve as inspiration for rape victims. Or, a book about someone's parents dying could help a child in the same situation overcome the grief.  All books serve a purpose and should remain staunch on the shelves of local book stores, regardless of the methods used in them. Even if they don't appeal to you, it could be a completely different experience for someone else halfway across the world. Let these books serve their purpose.
104	3081	2	3	In my opinion, I believe that inappropriate content should not be removed from shelves because children are aware of what is suitable for them. Libraries have separate sections for kids and adults, allowing children to understand boundaries. Librarians also monitor what children check out. In addition to libraries, inappropriate content can be found in schools, on the radio, TV, and video games. It is the responsibility of parents to shield their children from such content. Parents should be open and honest when addressing questions about inappropriate material. It is concerning to see young children exposed to violent video games and music about drugs and alcohol. Parents should be more vigilant in protecting their children from harmful influences. The increasing exposure of children to inappropriate content is alarming, and parents need to take action to safeguard their children's innocence.
105	3082	2	3	NEWSPAPER     @CAPS1 Today, I'm going to share my thoughts on offensive materials in libraries. Some people may find books, magazines, music, or movies in libraries offensive, while others may not see any issue with them being available in a public space. The perception of what is offensive varies from person to person, as it is ultimately a matter of personal opinion.  It is important to note that offensive materials should not simply be removed and discarded from library shelves. These materials can be valuable and educational to some individuals who may relate to them in a meaningful way. If there are concerns about offensive materials, libraries could consider creating a separate section for such items so that those who do not wish to encounter them can easily avoid them.  Libraries are intended to be inclusive spaces that cater to a diverse range of interests and perspectives. It is essential to have a wide variety of materials available to accommodate the different preferences of library visitors. While something may be offensive to one person, it may be highly valued by another. It is crucial to consider the needs and preferences of all library users, not just one's own.  In conclusion, my stance on offensive materials in libraries is that they should not be censored or removed altogether. Instead, libraries can consider ways to accommodate diverse viewpoints and preferences, such as creating separate sections for potentially offensive materials. Ultimately, promoting inclusivity and respecting the diverse perspectives of library users is key in addressing this issue.
106	3083	2	3	Do you believe that certain things need to be taken off the shelf that's uncensored for my children to see. No, I honestly do not because the library shouldn't have no uncensored things put up on the shelves that our children might not see. Cause the staff shouldn't let the children in that area without a parent were the uncensored books, magazines, movies, music and etc. But it's know ones fault because the media staff that works in the library shoudn't allow the younger kids to go in that area were those things are unless their guardian are with them. Unless they allow them in the area were the books, movies, magazines, etc. The kids should have a certain part of the library were they can take books from that's inappropiate for them. There's alot of books that children shouldn't be able to read but they read anyways without adults permission. And yes their some books, that's not inappropiate for the little ones and the big kids. Thing's like that is offensive toward the parents how the staff just let them read in see things like that in the parents wonder why, an how there children learning things like that. Certain things should be posted for things that kids shouldn't be able to see an read and do. And yes I have the right to say something to the staff for letting my child read, see things their not suppose to see. They know those things not appropiate for them so why would they let them watch or do or see stuff like that. My conclusion yes I think certain things that don't suppose to be were they suppose to be for young children to see. That's not right to let them see things like that. So that's why I'm writing this essay to the newspaper arguing on whats right for allowing them to see uncensored things they are not to see.
107	3084	2	3	Certain books should be removed from library shelves if they are offensive. Libraries are public spaces open to everyone, including children who may be negatively influenced by inappropriate content. Exposure to offensive material can lead to children imitating what they see or hear, causing problems for both the child and their caregivers. Additionally, offensive content can be disrespectful to individuals of different religions, creating discomfort and potentially leading to complaints against the library. Finally, failing to address offensive material can tarnish the library's reputation and drive patrons away. To prevent these issues, libraries should consider implementing restrictions or clearly marking sections containing potentially offensive material. This approach can help maintain a peaceful and welcoming environment for all patrons.
108	3085	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should not be removed from library shelves. While some may find certain content offensive or inappropriate, it is important to remember that different people have different interests and sensitivities. What may be offensive to one person may be valuable or thought-provoking to another.  It is important to respect the diversity of perspectives and preferences within a community. Libraries should strive to offer a wide range of materials to cater to the varied interests and needs of their patrons. At the same time, it is crucial to ensure that materials are age-appropriate and do not contain harmful or explicit content that could be damaging to individuals, especially children.  Ultimately, the decision to keep or remove materials from library shelves should be made with careful consideration of the potential impact on the community. It is important to strike a balance between offering a diverse selection of materials and ensuring that they are suitable for the intended audience. By promoting access to information and fostering an inclusive environment, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for individuals seeking knowledge, entertainment, and personal growth.
109	3086	2	3	Yes, I think that some books should be taken out of all libraries. No little kid should be exposed to inappropriate content that may be found in certain books. Parents play a crucial role in monitoring their children's reading materials and guiding them on what is suitable for their age. By being proactive in overseeing what their kids read and watch, parents can ensure that they are not exposed to potentially harmful content. It is important to consider the impact that certain books may have on individuals, especially children who may not fully understand the implications of the material they are consuming. Removing inappropriate books from libraries can help protect young readers from being exposed to content that could be offensive or harmful to them. Ultimately, it is essential for parents to take an active role in guiding their children's reading choices and educating them on the importance of consuming age-appropriate content.
110	3087	2	3	AS WE ALL KNOW, ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND IN A LOCAL BOOK STORAGE FACILITY, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A LIBRARY. ALL KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE IS IN THIS LITTLE AREA, BUT IS SOME OF THAT INFORMATION INAPPROPRIATE ENOUGH TO BE IN A PUBLIC PLACE? MANY LIBRARIES POSSESS ON THEIR SHELVES BOOKS AND MAGAZINES AND EVEN MUSIC CONTAINING EXPLICIT MATERIAL, AND HOW COULD YOU AVOID IT? IN A MODERN WORLD, THERE'S GOING TO BE LANGUAGE AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES THAT WOULD BE FOUND OFFENSIVE TO OLD PEOPLE AND VIEWERS OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING. YES, I AGREE SOME MATERIAL CAN AND SHOULD BE IN SEPARATE AREAS FROM MAINSTREAM MATERIAL, BUT ON A WHOLE, WHO CARES? I MEAN, MOST ORDINARY PEOPLE DON'T. I KNOW I DON'T. CENSORSHIP IS STUPID BECAUSE MOST OF THE STUFF IN LIBRARIES, IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT YET, YOU WILL SOON, NO MATTER WHAT CENSORSHIP STEPS ARE TAKEN BY LIBRARY OFFICIALS. In the end, it is essential to embrace the diversity of information available in libraries and recognize that exposure to different perspectives and ideas can enrich our understanding of the world.
111	3088	2	3	I believe libraries should have a wide variety of books, music, movies, and magazines to cater to the diverse interests and needs of the community. Having a limited selection would deter people from visiting the library, as they may not find what they are looking for. While books should be available in all genres and topics, music should be more limited due to explicit content. Movies should have age restrictions to ensure children are only exposed to age-appropriate content. Magazines should also be available for all age groups, with explicit ones kept in the adult section. Overall, libraries should aim to provide a comprehensive collection of materials while also ensuring that inappropriate content is appropriately managed.
112	3089	2	3	We've all heard the songs on the radio that are censored by constant beeps because of bad words, and we've all seen shows and movies that are the same way. Books and magazines are censored the same way by either blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with asterisks. Numerous amounts of people see no harm in this and support it, while others think that it is no big deal because, eventually, people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway.  If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published as you had originally written it? Most of those people would, and get angry when their work is edited. They want their work to be heard, and sometimes editing out the disrespectful things cause the message not to be understood as clear as it would be with those certain words. This can also cause the original message to be completely missed, and the work could end up meaning something totally different than what it was originally supposed to mean.  However, another question arises: If you were a parent, would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies, or hear harsh words in music? Most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand. Eventually, though, kids are going to be faced with those things.  In conclusion, censorship should just be ignored. Children are going to end up hearing bad words, seeing inappropriate things, and reading offensive passages in books or magazines. Censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians. There are loads of harsh things in the world, its impossible to just edit them all out. Everyone has different values and beliefs, and it is up to individuals to decide what they want to expose themselves or their children to.
113	3090	2	3	They were discussing the importance of being mindful of the books we read, especially those that may be offensive. It was suggested that if an author has the right to remove a book from the shelf due to finding it offensive, then others should also have the same privilege. However, this could potentially lead to a lack of books available for reading. The consensus was that books deemed offensive should not be read, as they can have negative effects. Instead, it was emphasized that non-offensive books, like educational ones, are beneficial for learning and should be prioritized. It was also highlighted that being unaware of a book's offensive content could lead to unintentionally repeating inappropriate language or ideas, resulting in potential consequences. Overall, the importance of being selective with reading material and avoiding offensive content was stressed to avoid negative outcomes.
114	3091	2	3	The way that books, music, and other forms of media are created is often tailored to specific age groups. If a particular book contains content that some may find inappropriate, it is best to simply choose a different book rather than causing controversy over it. Some items are labeled with parental guidance warnings to indicate the appropriate age group for the content. If something is not suitable for a certain age group, it can be placed in a separate section of the library to ensure that it is not easily accessible to younger audiences. Ultimately, it is important to respect the individual preferences and sensitivities of different people when it comes to media consumption. By providing options and categorizing materials appropriately, libraries can help ensure that everyone can find something they enjoy without causing unnecessary disputes.
115	3092	2	3	There are some books that kids shouldn't read, but only you can stop them from reading them. They will always try to find a way to get what they want, so taking books off the shelves wouldn't do any good. The only way to ensure that they don't access inappropriate material is to closely monitor what they are reading and watching. In conclusion, removing books from shelves is not a solution, but rather parents should actively guide their children and set boundaries to protect them from harmful content.
116	3093	2	3	If I owned or worked at a library, I would have books, music, movies, and magazines that some people might find offensive. However, I would not place these materials in the children's section but rather in the adult area. Adults and older teenagers should be able to handle and consume these materials responsibly. If any item causes violent behavior in the community, I would remove it from the shelves.   It is important for parents to monitor and guide their children's reading, viewing, and listening choices. Children should be directed towards age-appropriate content and encouraged to explore books, movies, and music that are suitable for their maturity level. Offensive materials should be accessible to adults who can make informed decisions about their consumption.  In conclusion, while offensive books, music, and movies have a place in libraries, it is essential to ensure that younger audiences are not exposed to them. Adults should have the freedom to choose what they want to read and watch, even if it may be considered offensive to some.
117	3094	2	3	Books, music, movies, and much more should not be removed from the shelves just because some people find them offensive. While some may not like certain content, others may find value in them for school research or personal enjoyment. It is important to respect individual choices and not restrict access to these materials. It is crucial to use such content responsibly and with maturity, rather than banning them altogether. By finding a balance and using these resources respectfully, everyone can benefit from the diverse range of information and entertainment available.
118	3095	2	3	Yes, offensive books should be taken off the shelves of public libraries to prevent potentially harmful content from being accessed by children and other vulnerable individuals. It is important to consider the impact of such material on diverse groups of people, as it may perpetuate stereotypes, discrimination, or negative perceptions. By removing offensive books, libraries can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all patrons, promoting respect and understanding within the community. It is crucial to prioritize the well-being and safety of library users, especially those who may be negatively affected by offensive content.
119	3096	2	3	I believe that it is important to keep and acquire more information as there is always more to learn. Increasing the availability of magazines can provide a wealth of knowledge on various topics. However, it is crucial to ensure that children do not have access to inappropriate content that may not be suitable for their age. Monitoring what children are exposed to can help in safeguarding their innocence while still allowing adults to explore and expand their knowledge. By increasing access to information and regulating its distribution, we can continue to learn and discover new things that could potentially benefit the world.
120	3097	2	3	"I @CAPS1 would like @CAPS4 if nothing was censored, but I don't matter, right? I am the kid that has no choice in the matter. @CAPS3 should I not care about what I am forced not to see? I am sure there are a lot of parents that don't follow the censorship rules. Like buying a rated '@CAPS2' movie, or game for their kid that is @NUM1, and not @NUM2 years old, but @CAPS4 does matter that the parents are following the law. I say shrew the law, because when @CAPS4 comes down to @CAPS4, it's the parents' right to tell/show their kid about things, not the government.   I think that @CAPS5 have never really had a choice in matters that affect them directly, and I think we should. @CAPS5 have to follow whatever rules until they're @NUM2 years of age: @CAPS3? I wish I knew @CAPS3, but I don't. Because there is no logical reason for @CAPS5 not to have a vote on what affects them.   For all I know, there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerful than the last generation. I am not saying that this is true; I am only saying that it's possible for something like this to happen.   Video games, They are my weakness I admit, but I don't see a reason for games to be censored. When people say things like ""@CAPS5 who play video games with violence will make them murderers,"" it frustrates me. There is not one single thing that proves that.   I have known @CAPS5 who have been censored all their life, and when they learn about it, they can't even handle it. It's sad really to not be able to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world just because they have been kept away from all that all their life.   I don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place. Did their parents tell them it was bad, and never watch/read it? Where did they hear it from? I believe it came from the media itself. I can see the headlines now, ""@CAPS5 watching @CAPS6 movie cause them to be murderers."" Then they would have some made-up percentage on how many @CAPS5 turn into a murderer that watch @CAPS6 movie compared to @CAPS5 that don't.   What I am really saying is that I try not to let other people's beliefs get in my head and change my own beliefs. Even by me writing this, I may have caused someone to change their beliefs, and I really hope I haven't.   In conclusion, censorship, especially when it comes to media and information, can have a significant impact on individuals, particularly children. It is essential to consider the implications of restricting access to certain content and the importance of allowing individuals to form their own opinions and beliefs."
121	3098	2	3	I believe that all books, movies, magazines, and other forms of media should not be removed from public spaces just because some people find them offensive. Everyone should have the opportunity to access and explore different materials, even if they may be controversial or uncomfortable for some. Removing items based on individual preferences can limit the access of others who may benefit from them, such as students conducting research for school projects. Public libraries serve a diverse population, and it is essential to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they read or watch. Removing materials due to offense would not be fair to everyone, and it is important to maintain a balanced and inclusive collection for the benefit of all patrons.
122	3099	2	3	Twilight, @PERSON1, or even The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series are books that many guardians do not allow their children to read due to their beliefs on what is real and what is not. Magic, spells, and vampires many of us know are not real but others do not believe in what it is that is being taught to the younger readers. My personal view on censorship would be a very low tolerable standard due to different people, more variety, and different reading or viewing materials. But there would be certain circumstances where I would have to put my foot down and censor things such as sex and drugs just because that is not suitable for young children to be reading at that young of age.  The reason why I would have a low tolerance of censorship is because different people like different things. If someone was an athlete they might not find a book about cooking and cleaning very appealing. Just because one person has different beliefs or what their standard is for offensive would not change my standpoint on the censorship of certain articles.  Another reason why my censorship in libraries is important is that it would give my library more variety. If there were twenty different @PERSON1 books on the shelves, many people would be able to look at them and check them out as they please. Having a wide range to select from would keep the guests always coming back for more.  Additionally, having different reading or viewing materials on hand is crucial in a library as some books these days are turned into films, making people eager to finish the book quickly to watch the movie. Most people say that the movies are never better than the original book itself, but an opinion is easier to form after experiencing both.  In conclusion, my personal view on censorship in libraries would be a very low tolerable standard to accommodate different people, offer more variety, and provide different reading or viewing materials. It is essential to respect individual preferences and not impose high standards on censorship in libraries to allow everyone to enjoy their reading experiences without limitations.
123	3100	2	3	I strongly disagree with the removal of materials from the library. All materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and CDs, are essential parts of the library for the school and for us. Removing materials can limit access to information and entertainment for students and the community. While it is important to ensure that offensive materials are not available, overall censorship should be avoided to provide a diverse range of resources for everyone to enjoy. Let us continue to value and respect the importance of libraries in providing a wide variety of materials for all to benefit from.
124	3101	2	3	No, I do not think that books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed. However, I do think that they should be monitored by age to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content. By implementing age restrictions and parental supervision, we can protect the well-being of young individuals and allow them to enjoy age-appropriate material. It is important to consider the impact of media on children and take necessary precautions to safeguard their innocence and mental development.
125	3102	2	3	Picture yourself walking through the library with your child. Now think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners. Imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song.   I agree with the censorship in libraries today. Most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem. Libraries have continued to keep children areas clean of explicit materials and are careful so that magazines such as '@CAPS1' do not reach their shelves.   Explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive. I have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids. That childish innocence disappears when they hear songs about money, sex, and abuse. Some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions. One example is a teen pregnancy book. The ideas in the book are either to keep the baby and deal with the consequences or abort the baby and move on with life. Some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier. Would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think?   In conclusion, censorship should be kept in libraries. It helps everyone altogether not to worry about what wrong things their kids are doing, or how they snatched the wrong idea. Please help us promote censorship in libraries to make a more respectful environment.
126	3103	2	3	I feel that children today are being allowed too much freedom without proper boundaries. It is important for us to guide them and set limitations on what they can access. Implementing age policies in libraries for materials with adult content is essential to protect children from harmful influences. Exposure to adult themes at a young age can have negative impacts on their development and behavior. By restricting access to such materials, we can help shape a healthier and more responsible generation. It is crucial that we take responsibility for what we expose our children to, and ensure that they are not influenced by destructive elements in media. It is time to prioritize the well-being and development of our children by implementing censorship and restrictions in libraries.
127	3104	2	3	The media is not to blame for the issues facing youth today; it is the responsibility of parents to teach children the difference between right and wrong. Censorship is not the answer, as it limits knowledge, stifles diverse beliefs, and erodes our freedom of speech. History has shown us the dangers of censorship, as it can lead to the destruction of ideas and the suppression of differing opinions. By allowing censorship, we risk losing the richness of learning, the diversity of beliefs, and the freedom to express ourselves. We must not give up our fundamental rights to those who seek to control what we see, hear, and think. It is vital to protect our learning, beliefs, and freedom of speech from the dangers of censorship.
128	3105	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be a big deal. Offensive materials can be avoided by those who find them objectionable. It should be up to individuals to choose what they want to read or not. Censoring books like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' would alter their essence and deprive readers of valuable insights into history. If everything offensive to someone was removed, libraries would be left with only children's books. Censorship limits intellectual freedom and should be avoided to preserve diverse perspectives and knowledge for all.
129	3106	2	3	The library is a place of learning, discovery, and knowledge, available to anyone willing to take the time to engross themselves in the rows and rows of information. Including children's books, novels for young adults, @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2, music, and movies, the library gives us a magnitude of opportunities to discover something we didn't know before. Although, there are other things that can be found in the library as well. Books including racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments can accidentally be stumbled upon while searching for something else. A parent should not have to worry about their child coming across a book or magazine containing inappropriate things such as this. I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of our libraries.  I would like to being by saying that I have an extreme issue with books that include comments, remarks, or names referring to people of a certain race. Imagine if an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 woman brought her daughter of @NUM1 years into the library to find information about a school project. Instead of finding the birth date of @PERSON1, she found a book making fun of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and calling them inappropriate names. Children should not have to come across a discovery like that in a public facility, where fun and interesting facts should be found; not racial slurs. This type of event could cause serious damage on a child emotionally and mentally. That is why these types of things should be taken off the shelves immediately!  Another issue I have is with sexual content being found in libraries. I do understand that several books contain some sort of sexual content, but I am speaking of a novel describing a sex scene in extreme detail, or images of almost naked women on the cover. If someone is searching for a book of that kind, they can travel to a sex store somewhere nearby and get their fix of sexual reading pleasure. That type of book, however, should not be found in the library. It makes our society look bad and taints our places of knowledge.  Lastly, I would like to express how I feel about offensive religious comments being found in libraries. Every human in the @LOCATION1 is entitled to their own choice of religion. They @MONTH1 practice it freely, which is sadly not the case for others in different countries. If we have an uncommom right such as freedom of religion, then why would we put books in our libraries that include rude comments towards different religions. A @CAPS5 woman should not have to go to a library and come across a book stating her religion is an waste and stupid. This is not the truth, and it should not be in our libraries!  Even though I feel this way about inappropriate books, I understand there has to be some sort of limit when it comes to censorship. Many people fear once we start removing certain books from libraries, more and more books will be taken from the public until almost all our libraries are empty. Yes, if we do not censor within certain limits, this could happen. This is not what I want to happen though. I simply want the people of this community to stop and consider what is easily available for our children to obtain. The least we can do, as parents, is to take books, movies, magazines, and music containing racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments out of the libraries.
130	3107	2	3	Two of the many privileges that we have as individuals are freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Although some bodies of work may be perceived as offensive or inappropriate, I believe that they should still be available to the public. Some might agree with the topic being expressed, even if it is offensive or inappropriate, and others may not; but they should not be removed from libraries because of their negativity.  These offensive or harsh pieces of literature could even be used to show the public what is considered rude, offensive, or inappropriate, and should be thought of as learning tools instead of being banned. Every person has a right to an opinion, and others may or may not agree with what that person has to say, but it does not change the fact that they have the right to their beliefs.  Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. I myself have read literature that is considered offensive, but as disturbing as the literature was, I am glad that I was educated on what people thought was acceptable behavior so that I know, and can teach others that despite what the book said, we now know that it was describing how people should not be living.  I believe that it would be a grave mistake to remove these materials from the public eye, because many are ignorant to the historical beliefs of others that have affected our nation and other countries across the globe. All of these books are educational, though some are harsh, and they should be used to show what is right and wrong. If they are taken off of shelves in the libraries then people, especially children could start to think that a certain idea, that may be incorrect or offensive, is completely appropriate and acceptable. As someone once said, 'Those who do not know their history are bound to repeat it'.  By removing the problem, we would be creating another issue. For example, many books have been written over history that convey hatred and discrimination towards other cultures, ethnicities, religions, and lifestyles. If these works of literature were banned and not available to the public, many people would not know that it is wrong to show hatred towards others just because they are different than you. This type of literature provides useful information: it allows people to see how a large amount of people thought life should have been years ago, and they taught the people of today that it actually was how people should not be living.  In conclusion, it is important to preserve all forms of literature, even if they are offensive or inappropriate, as they serve as valuable educational tools to showcase what is right and wrong in society. Banning such materials would only lead to ignorance and a lack of understanding of historical beliefs and behaviors that have shaped our world.
131	3108	2	3	Libraries are known as places where a person can go to find material on almost any topic they could want to learn about, whether that material is a book, movie, or magazine. Anyone can use the library, and it is a valuable resource to many people. So why do some libraries insist on removing some of those valuable materials from their shelves? In past years, censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports. In almost all cases, library patrons have been angry that certain materials have been deemed unsuitable to be offered at the library. People have a right to choose what books they want to read, what movies they want to watch, and what music they want to listen to. People have opinions; people disagree. What one person loves, another person could hate. But just because one person dislikes or is offended by a material on a library shelf does not mean that the opportunity to use that material should be denied to all other patrons. I feel that if a resource is checked out by just one individual, and that one individual is able to learn from or enjoy the resource, then the library has achieved its purpose and helped the community by offering that material. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is limiting and wrong. It creates barriers for those who want to learn and it takes away people's freedom to make decisions for themselves. Everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material, and censorship makes that impossible.
132	3109	2	3	Katherine Paterson stated this quote, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf,' @CAPS1 I agree . I feel that some of the books we have in our @ORGANIZATION1 libraries today just shouldn't be there. Offensive books, music, movies, and magazines can give  students and young children the wrong impact on life or their environment around them. Now days, what children see is sometime what they do, so if books, music, movies, and magazines give them the idea that what they say or do is cool, then kids will most likely do it. @CAPS2 observation when i look at kids  in @CAPS2 community playing  is that they follow one another. When they're playing tag and hide an go seek, movies, books, music, and magazines play a big part in the way they behave. @CAPS2 own experience with offensive books would be, there are books that are made by @PERSON3. In these books they use cruel language, use women body parts as symbols and many more rude things. @CAPS2 little sister came across one of these books, when she asked me about it was hard for me to explain to her that this was no book for a child her age to be reading, So the best way for me to put it was that it was an adult book. For her to get any images out of her head that I felt she shouldn't have. Another experience I've seen was with @CAPS2 little cousin @PERSON2. He was looking at a magazine out of @ORGANIZATION1 library. The magazine was offensive to women. It was a playboy bunny magazine. Now I don't know if you ever heard of these magazines, but I think it is very wrong that they use women's bodies for men to view. I also feel that those types of magazines should not be in a @ORGANIZATION1 library. I believe it gives children, mainly young men, the wrong thoughts about women. @CAPS2 overall thoughts on censorship in libraries, is that not everyone is going to feel the same way I do. There are parents that allow their children to read, listen, and watch whatever they want. I'm here to say I don't feel that is the way to go about things, because it can influence your children to do inappropriate things. I hope you take with you, @CAPS2 personal experience with you and help your children read, listen, and watch age-appropriate books, music, movies, and magazines.
133	3110	2	3	I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from libraries because they serve as valuable sources of information and learning. People may need specific information on various subjects, and these sources provide a wide range of lessons and knowledge. Different individuals learn in different ways, and these materials cater to various learning styles. Additionally, in today's digital age, these sources are essential tools that we rely on for everyday tasks. Therefore, it is important to retain these resources in libraries as they are not only beneficial but also indispensable in our lives.
134	3111	2	3	The right to remove a book off of a shelf is not a good thing to do. If this practice begins, there will be empty shelves in libraries across the country. We use books every day for learning and entertainment. Books help us learn new things and expand our knowledge. It is wrong to remove a book just because some people find it inappropriate. Instead, libraries could have a separate section for books that may not be suitable for all audiences. Another solution could be to have a national library service to decide which books should be removed or placed in a special section. Libraries could also implement a new labeling system to provide more information about the content of books. Books, music, and magazines should be available in libraries for people to enjoy and learn from. Let's preserve the diversity of literature and information in our libraries for everyone to access and benefit from.
135	3112	2	3	Libraries should never remove any material just because it may be found offensive. Something that is offensive to one person may not be to another. If the material was so offensive that it went against the law, then it probably wouldn't have been published in the first place. People often get offended if they read, see, or listen to something that goes against their personal views, ethics, or religion. But people need to learn to understand that other people think differently and have different values. Though peoples' opinions differ, each opinion is equally important to that certain person. So many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions. As a student I often have a hard time finding meaningful literature in the school library because it is so censored. I am not complaining about this because I understand that schools have to be careful of what they are exposing students to. But if I am looking for something maybe more religious, derogatory, or less accepted, it is nice to have a public library where I can find these things. In closing, if people are offended by something on the shelves of a library then they shouldn't read, watch, or listen to it. But do not censor everything so that people who do enjoy these materials can no longer easily access them.
136	3113	2	3	I dont believe books should be takin off of the shelves for being offensive. Some books that are found offensive by one person might not offend another. People @MONTH1 have the right to say that a book is offensive if that is how they feel, but they do not have the right to deny others the right to read that book. I understand that parents want to protect children. Parents should talk to their children and explain to them why they dont want them reading that specific book. Parents might also just let their children read it and explain why they don't approve.      I feel the same way about the censorship of music and movies. When I was twelve years old i started to listen to music that I enjoyed instead of the music my mother played. My mother was concerned about the lyrical content of the songs i would listen to. She refused to buy me the music and would not let me listen to it. I went to my friends houses and listed to explicit music and watched rated @CAPS1 movies. She could never really stop me because that explicit language was being said wherever I went.     I think instead of trying to deny teenagers the music the parents should explain why and let them make the decision. I think censorship should be left up to the parents of that child. Sometimes when parents try to pull their kids closer they actually push them away. That's why I think it's so important for the parent and the child to always talk and be comfortable. Parents should trust their children to make the right decisions and guide them through the process rather than imposing restrictions that could potentially lead to rebellion. Open communication and understanding are key in fostering a healthy relationship between parents and their children.
137	3114	2	3	Many people go to libraries; such as children, parents, and grandparents. I have come to realize that their purpose for going to this community loving place is to find peace and quiet. Some don't even go there for the books. They will engage in music, magazine, enjoy a cup of coffee, or simply get on the internet. Now some people argue that some of the books, music, and movies in libraries are inappropriate or offensive, but does that mean the libraries should have to get rid of them?     These materials people find offensive have no reason to be banned. First of all, the libraries will lose customers. There is a majority of people in the world who really like listening to rap or @CAPS1&@CAPS2. It's hard to find that kind of music without cuss words or sexual inuendo. Even I will listen to that type of stuff occasionally just so that I can have a cool beat stuck in my head for a while. Plus, when you are in a library and listening to music you will have head phones on, which isn't disruptive to other in or around the library.     Secondly, customers who don't like the context of these materials don't have to get them. If there is a book that has a sex scene or talks about drugs then don't read it. You have a choice to what book you would like to read and if that isn't your style then there are plenty of other aisles and children books you can look through. Those who are interested in those topics still deserve to be able to choose those books. I have been to my public library many atimes and all the times I have been there I have not once even seen a book, music, or a movie that looks displeasing to the eyes. So if you're a person who wants an offensive book, then it takes A @CAPS3 of looking, not just a quick little scan.     Finally, freedom. Isn't that was @CAPS4 is all about? The freedom of speech, and religion, and even what type of movies you want to watch. I know this might come as a shocker, but there are labels on the back of movies that tell whether it is @CAPS5, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1@NUM1, or @CAPS1. It also includes the not-so-nice content that will be present in the movie. So you have total freedom to purchase(check out) any of those rated movies. Like I explained clearly earlier, you aren't forced to watch any of the naughtier movies, so just pick what you want and be happy.      As you can see, there is absolutely no reason to remove offensive books, music, or movies. There are many different types and styles of these categories and it isn't disturbing anyone. Libraries will lose customers, people dont have to choose the less appropriate things, and us @CAPS7 have freedom to do what we please, especially with what we would like to read, listen to, or watch. So save youself some time and just keep the few so called 'offensive' materials.
138	3115	2	3	There are many people that think certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and should be taken off the shelves at libraries. If you had to do a project on a subject that was offensive to certain people and there was no information on it wouldn't you be a little upset? If you found somethings that are offensive interesting you should be able to go to your local library and read a book about it, and if you like to listen to offensive kind of music then you should be able to just turn the radio on and listen to it and not have to worry about those kinds of things getting removed. Some people are assigned projects for either their job or for school work. If the subject of your project was offensive to a certain race or person you would want there to be books or any other kind of information on the shelf at your local library so you could work on it. If all of the offensive books got removed from the shelves at libraries then nobody could be getting there work done. Some people find some offensive subjects interesting. For example, if someone found the @PERSON1 interesting they @MONTH1 want to just do some research to learn more about it. If the books and magazines all disappeared from the shelves about this subject then those people would not be able to learn more about those kinds of subjects. There are a lot of people that think most of the music that you hear on the radio today is offensive. If they got rid of all of that kind of music then there would probably not be a lot of music left to listen to, and a lot of people would be very mad. Also, if they got rid of all of those types of music then the writers of those songs would not be able to make any money and would be out of a job. I think that the people who think these kinds of things are offensive should just stay away from these things and stop complaining. All of the people who do not take these things offensively will be glad that they are not removings books, magazines, music, etc. I hope you take into consideration not removing these types of things from libraries and anywhere else. In conclusion, the availability of diverse content, even if considered offensive by some, is essential for research, creative exploration, and personal choice. Removing such materials would limit opportunities for learning, expression, and entertainment, affecting both creators and consumers. Let's preserve the freedom to access a variety of content while respecting individual preferences and perspectives.
139	3116	2	3	I believe that there should be a right to remove offensive books, music, movies, or magazines from library shelves. As a parent, I am concerned about the impact of such material on my child. Libraries are funded by taxpayers, and it is important that the content available is suitable for all audiences. Children can be influenced by what they read, watch, and listen to, so it is crucial to be mindful of the materials they are exposed to. Inappropriate content can promote violence, drug use, and other negative behaviors. It is essential to ensure that libraries provide a safe and educational environment for everyone.
140	3117	2	3	Going into a library, everyone has their own opinions on what should be on the shelves for all to see, including children. Some believe that only age-appropriate materials should be available, while others disagree. In my view, there should be a variety of books for all ages, with a designated children's section for parents who want to control what their kids see. When it comes to magazines, movies, and music, I believe there should be a range of options available, excluding any explicit material like pornography. Parents should take responsibility for monitoring their children's choices, but there should be limits on what is publicly accessible, especially in a library setting. Drawing a line at pornography is essential to maintain a suitable environment for all library users.
141	3118	2	3	All libraries have their own advantages and disadvantages. While some people misuse library resources, such as using computers for inappropriate purposes, others utilize them for job applications and other productive activities. Despite these challenges, libraries remain valuable spaces for learning and research. People of all ages can benefit from the vast resources available, whether it's to learn about history, current events, or other cultures. Ultimately, the library serves as a place for self-improvement and personal growth, and it is up to individuals to make the most of these opportunities.
142	3119	2	3	There are more than six billion people in the world, each with their own unique personalities and opinions. It is virtually impossible to remove all aspects of media that could be found offensive, as almost everyone is offended by something. With the accessibility of the internet, materials once limited to shelves are now online and can never be permanently removed. While some media aims to raise awareness, there is a fine line that can be crossed into offensiveness. Authors must consider the impact of their words and avoid stereotypes that can be hurtful. Censoring libraries may not effectively address the issue, as libraries are already losing relevance in today's technology-driven world. Authors and readers alike should be mindful of the impact of their words and actions, working towards raising awareness rather than causing offense. It is crucial to respect the feelings of others and think beyond oneself when creating and consuming media in a diverse world.
143	3120	2	3	"What is offensive to you? See your answer might be different from the person sitting right next to you. There are so many materials in the world that are found to be offensive. The world wouldn't be any different if we were to pull all of these offensive materials off the shelves. There wouldn't be anything left because everyone has their own opinion about something and everyone has different inferences about what's offensive to them. I believe that offensive material shouldn't be removed from the shelves. Everything would be off the shelf if we were to pull offensive materials off the shelf. There is always something wrong with something. Someone might be the way someone has said something or the way they mean it by. There is always that one person out of the bunch who has something negative to say. Either they take it the wrong way or they just think it's wrong. Everyone has their own opinion about everything. Same for when someone asks you what's offensive to you. Someone else may say that what you find offensive is nowhere near offensive to them. For instance, my grandpa loves all types of music and his life revolves around music. My grandma doesn't like some of his music because she says, ""it doesn't sit right with me,"" meaning that she doesn't believe in some things that the music is trying to persuade people to do. My grandpa really doesn't pay attention to the lyrics as much as my grandma does because he doesn't see music in that kind of way. My grandpa likes a lot of music because of their rhythm and beat. They always kind of get into disagreements about music they want to listen to because my grandma finds something in the music that's offensive to her beliefs, but my grandpa doesn't. It doesn't affect him as much as her. If you were to go around and ask people what's offensive to them, there would be so many different answers and you could never sum it all down to one answer. With only a couple of people feeling offensive to some things, but the majority find it different, that would ruin it for everyone almost. Then that would almost be everything gone because there's always that one person that takes it the wrong way and has to feel offended. So I still believe that offensive materials shouldn't be pulled off shelves."
144	3121	2	3	I, personally, do not think that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves because they are found offensive. However, I do believe that there should be a way to protect adolescent, still-developing children from reading books that may offend them or introduce them to new concepts or ideas that could hinder their educational growth. Some kids who have not been properly educated over a controversial topic (such as drugs or alcohol) may make a bad decision based on something they read in a book or on a webpage.  To help solve the problem of offending children or deterring their education, I propose that we implement a book 'rating' system. Similar to rating a movie or a video game, this system would provide readers with information about what age level the book is appropriate for, and what factors led to the book being rated in that way.  As a newspaper company, you are familiar with our rights of freedom of speech and press. One of these rights is freedom of speech, which includes the freedom of authors to express themselves through their work. Taking books labeled as 'inappropriate' off the shelves is not a reasonable solution to the issue. Authors, editors, photographers, and publishers put a lot of effort into creating these books, and removing them would be repressing their freedom of speech. It could potentially lead to protests and strikes from authors who feel their work is being unfairly censored.  However, I do believe that implementing a rating system for books is a good compromise. It allows authors to fully express themselves while also providing readers with information about the content of the book. This way, readers can make informed decisions about what they choose to read without being exposed to potentially harmful material.  In conclusion, a book rating system would be a fair and effective way to address the issue of offensive content in books without infringing on the rights of authors. It would benefit both authors and readers by promoting freedom of expression while also ensuring that readers are aware of the content they are consuming.
145	3122	2	3	Why @CAPS1 @CAPS2? Is there movies, music, magazines, books, and more in our libraries today seen as offensive to some? A good portion of people believe so, and there is some that @CAPS2 doesn't even concern. So should they be removed from the shelves of our public libraries or should they be able to stay? Katherine Paterson made a statement and a part out of @CAPS2 said ' But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work that I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS3, I believe that some of the literature and magazines should be taken out of the libraries just because of the content many books are loaded with foul language, violence, sex appeal, etc. For example I can recall a day I went to a local library with my little sister, and she was looking for a disney magazine and there were provocative magazines on the shelf that had half naked women on the cover right next to the kids magazines. To me this is an image of selling sex. What parent would want there child learning about sex at a young age?  Next, even the music today placed in libraries is not good clean music. A lot of the music today is also selling sex, violence, and drugs. My father tells me all the time till this very day that music back in the day was appropriate for all ages. Music such as hip hop, and rap, is the main source for all the inappropriate stuff, but the rappers and producers are not to blame cause they are only creating what people want and what is selling.  Also, the movies rented out of the libraries today are very offensive. They seem to contain the same material as the books, magazines, and music. They all portray the same image that seems to be entertaining to majority of the society today. So can we just find something better to catch the attention of the audience who buy this material?  In conclusion, I do believe that this material should be taken off the shelves of public libraries. But I don't think @CAPS2 would do any good, cause people will just find another source to get @CAPS2. Like Katherine said @CAPS2 won't be any books left if it's all taken off.
146	3123	2	3	I believe censorship should be used in libraries to a certain extent. There are too many children that have access to inappropriate materials at the library, but some of it could be useful. There was a time when I borrowed a movie from the public library. When I went home to watch it with my mother, it turned out to be highly inappropriate and offensive, not to mention awkward and embarrassing. My mom and I couldn't believe that a person of any age could have access to a movie as inappropriate as the movie '@CAPS1'.   Although there are some materials that should not be in the library, there are some materials that could be thought of by some people to be offensive that are in the library for educational purposes. Some people think gay rights, abortion, and teenage sexual activity are offensive. There may be some people that would like to know more about one of those things for a project at school or a problem in their personal lives. Somebody may have a family member who believes they are homosexual, a daughter who has become sexually active, or a woman may be thinking about receiving an abortion. What is offensive to some, may not be offensive to others.  I believe censorship should be used for some offensive materials. If it is educational, it may be useful to some people. There will never be a perfect answer for a problem like this in the world. As the world evolves, so does the human race's morals and there is nothing that is offensive to all the people in the world.
147	3124	2	3	Have you ever been offended by a movie, book, song, or magazine? Did you have a choice on whether or not you watched and/or read the item? The question that seems to be of interest to people is should these items that are offensive be taken off the shelves. I don't think they should.  I am sure that you could ask anyone if they have ever been offended by a movie, book, or magazine and all of them could give an example. I doubt they ever watched the movie again and if they did it obviously wasn't that bad. If something offends you, don't read or watch it. If you don't want your kids watching something, don't let them. You can make that decision. No one is making you watch or read any of that.  I know I have watched a movie or two that I probably shouldn't have. I've even read some books that are not the best, but I choose to read them. No one forced the act on me.  Some of you may ask, what about at school? If a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it, then take it up with the teacher. They will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book. They might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature.  There are always going to be offensive books and movies out there. If you take out all the books in a library that has offended someone at one point in time, you probably wouldn't have much of a library left. The shelves would be bare.  You have a choice to read or watch something. If it is offensive don't watch it. Everyone has different views on that book or movie. It may be offensive to you, but to the next person it might be a really good show. I don't think offensive books, magazines, music, or movies should be taken off the shelves.
148	3125	2	3	Libraries should not have to remove books that some people find offensive. People have the choice to read or not read certain books, and having a variety of ideas and viewpoints available is important for a diverse society. Different people have different preferences, and it is not fair to restrict access to certain materials just because they may be disliked by some. Embracing diverse perspectives and allowing people to make their own choices when it comes to reading is essential for intellectual freedom and growth. Let's celebrate the richness of literature and respect individual preferences without imposing restrictions on what can be accessed in a library.
149	3126	2	3	Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? If a library feels that a book is too graphic, a movie too violent, or that music is too aggressive, then it's their own choice to remove it or not. It is true that it's pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers. Explicit content is all around, not only in the media and literature. The never-ending game of shielding this generation's teenagers and children is already finished.  In this point in time, the main focus of a lot of movies, music, and books is something violent, aggressive, inappropriate, or explicit. The idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless. There will always be violence and crime in today's world along with excessive swears and cuss words all around. It's acceptable that some parents don't want their children reading, watching, or listening to something they don't or wouldn't approve of, but even if the kids are protected at home, out in the world, sometimes the parents won't be there.  Libraries are public places, and a percent of the audience would be upset, frustrated, or angry if the books, music, or movies they liked were no longer available due to censorship. It may seem as if viewing, reading, or listening to something violent or explicit would have an effect on the listener. However, children and teens are exposed to this type of explicit language in various settings, so attempting to censor it in their reading and viewing material is just pointless.  In my experience, I have grown up and been around people who have grown up listening to violent music, watching graphic movies, and consuming more explicit material without being affected. Why would you hinder the real world away from children and teenagers? Movies have a rating, and music has an explicit content label, so people should know what's appropriate for themselves. The first swear word a child hears probably wasn't in a song or movie but somewhere in the real world.  Real life is rated @CAPS1, so why pretend it's not? Trying to block the explicit content and violence in the world is an endless battle. Certain things may go over the line, but others are just reenactments and previews of what's really going on in this world. The continuous exposure to explicit content in various forms is a reality, and children and teenagers need to be equipped to navigate and understand these aspects of the world around them. Ultimately, censorship in libraries may not be the most effective approach in preparing young individuals for the realities they may encounter.
150	3127	2	3	There are many books in the library that shouldn't be there. From books about racism, violence, or pornography, I wouldn't want my young children to be able to take those types of books out of the library. A library in a school is a great way to help students with projects, essays, or just to read. If my child was in elementary or middle school, I wouldn't want them to be able to check out a book about things they shouldn't even know about yet. However, for teenagers in high school, they are old enough to understand the realities of the world and could benefit from accessing a wider range of materials, including potentially controversial subjects. Libraries also offer a variety of music, movies, and magazines. While educational materials can be beneficial, it is important to monitor and restrict access to inappropriate content, especially for younger audiences. Ultimately, it is essential to consider the age and maturity level of the readers when deciding what materials to include in a library to ensure a safe and enriching environment for all.
151	3128	2	3	Books can be valuable resources, providing knowledge, entertainment, and comfort. However, there are instances where books may contain inappropriate content that could offend certain individuals. In such cases, it is important for libraries to consider removing offensive books from their shelves to ensure a welcoming and respectful environment for all patrons.  Religious sensitivities, language, and imagery unsuitable for children are factors to consider when evaluating the appropriateness of books. While some may argue for creating separate sections for controversial material, it is essential to recognize that individual beliefs and values vary. Therefore, libraries may need to take steps such as censoring or ultimately removing offensive books to maintain a positive atmosphere.  Similarly, music and magazines can also present challenges regarding offensive content. Some may view certain music genres as inappropriate, while magazines may contain images or language that could be misinterpreted. Libraries should exercise caution and possibly provide warnings for materials that may not be suitable for all audiences.  In conclusion, while books are generally beneficial, there are circumstances where they may have negative implications. Libraries should carefully consider the content of their collection and take appropriate action to address offensive material, ensuring a respectful and inclusive environment for all patrons.
152	3129	2	3	Just because I agree with something, does that mean you have to agree too? Your cousin believing in one thing does not mean you have to believe in it as well. People have different opinions, and that is what makes the world diverse and interesting. If something offends you, it does not necessarily offend others around you.   Offensive material exists in the world, and it will not disappear. We should not try to eliminate everything that we find offensive because what one person finds offensive, another may not. Everyone has the right to express themselves, and we should respect that.   If something offends someone, it does not make it less valuable or inappropriate. We all have different likes and dislikes, and that is what makes us unique. We should not try to erase things that do not align with our personal beliefs.   Removing items from shelves because they offend some people sets a dangerous precedent. If we start eliminating everything we do not like, we will have nothing left. We should learn to accept that people have different opinions and respect their right to express themselves.   Instead of trying to erase things we do not agree with, we should focus on fixing the broken things in the world. Acceptance and understanding are key to creating a more harmonious society. We should embrace the diversity around us and learn to love what we have, flaws and all. After all, without the world as it is, nothing would be anything.
153	3130	2	3	Offensive materials in libraries should not be taken off of the shelves because of their content. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message. People live around offensiveness every day on the street and in public places so censoring it in libraries would not protect anyone. Removing the books from libraries entirely could also interfere with research or school projects children have to work on for class. Censorship of books in libraries based on content should not be allowed as it could hinder the understanding of important themes and messages, people are already exposed to offensive language in daily life, and it could disrupt academic and research endeavors.
154	3131	2	3	Libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring, with people walking up and down aisles looking for interesting books. However, some books may contain inappropriate content like profanity and nudity. In such cases, it is important for parents to educate their children about what is suitable for them to read or view. Instead of relying on censorship by libraries and other media outlets, parents should take an active role in monitoring their children's exposure to such content. By explaining the reasons behind restrictions and being present when children have access to potentially inappropriate material, parents can help guide their children towards more suitable choices. Ultimately, the responsibility for ensuring children's exposure to appropriate content lies with parents, not external sources of media.
155	3132	2	3	Brian believes that censorship in libraries should vary depending on the age group. In a school library, he argues that there should be no censorship for books, as they provide important information, including historical and educational content. However, in a public library, Brian suggests that there should be some level of censorship, especially when it comes to explicit topics like drugs or alcohol. Similarly, he recommends limiting the types of movies available in school libraries to educational films, while in public libraries, movies should be restricted to a certain age rating. When it comes to magazines, Brian believes that there should be more leniency in school libraries, focusing on learning and fun content, while stricter censorship should be applied in public libraries to protect younger readers from inappropriate material. Ultimately, Brian's stance on censorship in libraries is clear: it should be more relaxed in school libraries and stricter in public libraries to cater to the different needs and ages of library users.
156	3133	2	3	To begin with, I feel everyone should admire the libraries. I feel this way because at one point in time, we didn't even have books, let alone libraries to get books from. A library is a place that has a peaceful and calm environment. People come to hang out at the library to collect good books, surf the internet, check out new music, and also to relax.  So to answer the question 'Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves at the library if found offensive?' I believe if things are on the shelf that come off as offensive to people, they should absolutely be removed. You shouldn't have to be in an environment where things are offending you. If things seem to come off as offending, it will make individuals stop coming to the library. This will make the library lose a lot of business due to lack of service.  The library should be a place that consists of love, peace, and harmony. It should be a place where people should feel free and relieved from any stress. By seeing or hearing something that comes off as very offensive will tend to bring confusion to the library. This also will make the librarian's job much harder than what it should be. They will have to work harder to satisfy the difficulties that you seem to be having with the library.  Something that would offend me in a library is some of the music they carry. Certain types of music shouldn't be found in a library. An example of some offensive music is the explicit music, meaning the music with all types of different profanity. The music that is degrading women in a very disrespectful manner. Also, the music that's making it seem cool to be violent.  This will come off as offensive to many men and women. Think about it, who wants to listen to music that makes women feel like they're not worth anything and who wants to listen to music that's always talking about killing, fighting, and gangs, etc. People would like to hear more soothing and relaxing music. The music that makes you happy no matter the mood you're in. The library should just pick their music wisely so everyone can be well satisfied.  In conclusion, as stated, the library is a great place to hang out and just to relax. It should never come off as a place with things that are offensive or so it should get removed. This would keep down less confusion and more people would continue to attend the library because they know what a nice place it really is.
157	3134	2	3	Some people might think that it is a good idea to censor things in the library. People might think that some of the material might be offensive or bad for the youth who visit libraries. They might believe that removing such items would be beneficial. However, I disagree with this viewpoint. I believe that nothing should be censored in the library, whether it be books, movies, music, magazines, or any other form of information. Censoring materials would limit resources and prevent individuals from accessing valuable knowledge, including important historical events that may be uncomfortable but necessary to learn about. Removing offensive materials would also not solve the issue, as people would find a way to access them elsewhere. Ultimately, individuals have the right to choose what they read, watch, or listen to, and the opinions of a few should not dictate what is available in a public space like a library. Everyone should have the freedom to access information and form their own opinions.
158	3135	2	3	Okay, to me, people are way too moral in the modern world. I was taught that if you have a problem, keep it to yourself. Most everyone knows that censorship is a big deal, but it doesn't have to be. I know that some things are a little risqué, but getting this out there quicker would be a better solution. You're probably asking yourself, how in the world can this be a better solution? Let's talk about children and this content. If you get this out there quicker and subtly, children won't see the need to find out what it is at a later age. If that were to happen, the consequences could be fatal, such as fines, misdemeanors, respect, reputation, and even some time in jail.   Tell the kids about murder, drugs, sex, and crimes in general. They are twice as moldable then as they are when they are older. Taking them off our shelves will only make us a nicer community. Yes, I know what you're thinking, why not do that? If more people in your community are nicer, when a real threat comes, who's going to help? The police? Who knows, it takes a little bit for a squad car to get around, even longer if you're in a city. In that time, someone could have died, been robbed, and that same criminal gone.   So, if we let this stay out on the shelves and so on, people will have the knowledge to see that using these to help people can be beneficial. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is if you take this away from us, people will become weaker. If you let it stay, people will learn from it and use it for good. In conclusion, it is essential to provide access to information and content that may be deemed controversial to educate individuals, especially children, on potential dangers and how to navigate them effectively in society.
159	3136	2	3	Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching? I have, heard of many books. There are even music out there that only adults should be listening too. There are some parents that are strick on what their kids watch, hear, read or sing. I know for a fact that my parents would not want me to be letting my childern read, watch or hear that kind of stuff.  When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern reach what should they be? I think the movies, books and even music that have bad language, violence, and bullying need to be hidden from childern. Bad language is not apporaite from kids to be hearing when they are under the age of ten or even older. When you hear a bad song coming on when you have little kids near you, you should turn the station to a differnet station. If little kids hear this kind of language they well be saying it when the are young.  Another book, song or music that should be taken off the shelf should be ones that have violence. If kids watch, hear or read about violence, they are most likely to start being violent when they start hearing or reading about it. When you are walking around you, you should not be scared to walk by yourself with out getting attacked. If you see someone reading or watcing something that you do not think is right for them you should tell them not to be reading or watching that. Violence is bad for little kids to be doing when they are young.  Books, movies or music about bullying should be taken out of. Bullying is not the answer to everything, even though many think it is it is not. If you think it is good for little kids to be learning about bullying you are wrong! It is a bad thing for little kids. Bullying also gets you in trouble when you are caught doing the bullying.  Have you ever thought of a book that should be taken off the shelf? The books that I think that should be taken off the shelf would be the ones that have bad language, violence, and bullying. Childern should not be hearing or reading about bad language. They also should not be watcing anything about violence. Lastly they should not be reading anything about bullying.
160	3137	2	3	Some books in libraries offend others, leading to debates about whether they should be removed. While graphic and gory books may disgust some readers, warnings can help individuals avoid content they find disturbing. However, offensive material related to race, religion, or other personal characteristics can incite strong reactions and should be carefully reviewed by authors to prevent controversy. Inaccurate statements in books can fuel public curiosity and conspiracy theories, potentially harming an author's reputation. Overall, authors should strive to create works that resonate positively with the public to avoid backlash and ensure a successful outcome.
161	3138	2	3	In libraries, there should not be censorship on materials considering that it's an individual's decision to read what they prefer. There is no appropriate standard on what makes a book offensive to a group, so it should be undetermined as to what makes a book offensive. In a public library, many children, who the books are censored for, are with their parents. Parents should make an independent choice on what they can allow their children to read. Letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is ridiculous. If an author spent time creating a story, it should be appreciated, and should not put on a list of no-nos. If a certain person doesn't like a book's reputation, all they have to do is not read it. Even in school systems, librarians are there to guide kids to read good books. If a child wants to read an inappropriate book, the librarian will most likely discourage him or her not to read it. In my experience, I wanted to read a book that my mother suggested to me, but as I went to the school library it turned out to be a censored book. Some parents believe children should be ignorant about offensive things written in books, but honestly many of the same ideas are exploited to them everyday on television and internet. So trying to shield your child from the bad things @MONTH1 be a great thing, but the efforts are usually failed attempts. It also never occurs to the people censoring the books, that some people can't afford to buy the books they want to read. The libraries, for some, are the main means for getting books. To conclude there is very little reason to ban a book from the shelves. Many of the books banned have important lessons that can be obtained through reading it. If a person doesn't like a book, the simplest thing to do is not to pick it up.
162	3139	2	3	Honestly, there are many books and magazines that should be removed from the shelves. I remember in sixth grade, I came across a book in the school library that not only explained what weed was but also provided instructions on how to grow it. It is alarming to see so much explicit content in books that are easily accessible to young students.  Many books in schools and public libraries contain references to drugs and sex, which is inappropriate for young readers. These books provide detailed information on various drugs, their effects, and even where to purchase them. This kind of content can potentially influence young minds and lead them towards dangerous behaviors.  I recently encountered a book that contained explicit descriptions and images of sexual positions, resembling a pornographic magazine. Such content is not suitable for students, as it can have a negative impact on their understanding of relationships and sexuality.  It is concerning to think about the kind of material that younger siblings may come across in libraries. As responsible adults, we should ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content that could potentially harm their development.  In conclusion, it is crucial for schools and libraries to carefully monitor the content of books and magazines available to students. We must prioritize the well-being and education of our youth by removing explicit and harmful material from their reach. Let us create a safe and nurturing environment for our children to learn and grow without being exposed to inappropriate content.
163	3140	2	3	I think that removing books from a library that are offensive shouldn't be allowed, first off because people have different taste on the books they read. I also think that the books that the library carries are educational, they might be offensive to people but sometimes they are good for learning new things about the world around us. Another thing is that a lot of books, movies, music, and magazines might be offensive to you, but if you dont want your child to read those then just keep them away from those types of books at the library, and the people that do want to look at that stuff can. So i think it just depends on what kind of stuff people like, everyone likes something different. One reason why i think that libraries shouldn't be censored is because some people have different taste in the books they read. Some people like scary books, some people like romantic, so everyone doesnt all like the same thing. Everyone might be offended of something but people should't let it bother them. My second reason is because books that they carry at the library are usually educational. They have learner books for the little kids to help them learn how to read, they have magazines for the people that are interested in the drama around the world, then we have war books for the people that are interested in history, so i dont think that people should really be to offended by the books that people read. Another reason is that if you dont want your child or a looking at the books or ect. That might look offensive to you then dont let them read them, everyone likes different things, and if you take away things that other people like then your just offendending them too. Thats why people that enjoy to go to the library should't take things so offensive, so we don't have to censor things at the library. So thats why i think that libraries shouldn't have to be censored at all because people have different taste in the books that they read, that books that libraries carry are usually educational, and if you don't want your child looking at those kind of books then don't let them read them. People need to undrstand that some books aren't always trying to offend people, but the ones that are they are just trying to state there own optinon
164	3141	2	3	To @CAPS1 it @MONTH1 @CAPS2:     @CAPS3 I walk into a library, I want to be able to think I am in a peaceful place where I can find books that are helpful for what I need and are not harmful to anyone. Anywhere I go I want to feel like a free person and shouldn't have to worry about things that will hurt others or myself. People are people and everyone should be treated the same. It doesnt matter what color your skin is, the way you look, or how you talk. Everyone should be treated equaly. I believe if there is something offensive in a movie, magazine, books, or anything to any kind of people it should be removed for good. It doesnt matter what the past was like. The present is all that matters and in my opinion everyone deserves the same.      I beleive that no one in this world should feel ashamed of who they are. If someone is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 they should be proud of it and shouldn't be afraid of negative things that would hurt their feelings. I think most people would agree @CAPS3 I say everyone in this world should be treated the absolute same. Negative things in books or magazines or anywhere should be removed for good. We do not need things like that in our world. That is what causes people to become crazy and get into gangs or into drugs. Our world shouldn't concist of bad things that will hurt the lives of others. Anything that is negative to a person or group of people shouldn't be allowed and should be thrown away. Inacent people do not deserve what people received in the past. The past has nothing to do with what is going on in the present. Right now people should be proud to be who they are and not scared of things like that. I treat people the way I want to be treated and that should go for everyone. Harmful things need to be removed from everything. We do not need things like that in our world. People should be able to live free and feel proud of who they are.     In conclusion I beleive that certain materials should be removed if they are found offensive. Everyone is who they are and that shouldn't have an effect on others and the way they live. People should feel proud to be here and not scared of things that could impact their lives forever. Harmful things are not good in this world and shouldn't have an impact on others. Everyone deserves the best and should be treated with care, not hatred.
165	3142	2	3	Comics, romance, adventure books, and mystery books are just a few of the different types of books available in our local libraries, along with magazines and music. While some content may be deemed offensive to certain individuals, it is important to remember that libraries cater to a diverse range of interests and age groups, including young children.  It is unrealistic to shield children from all potentially offensive material, as they will inevitably encounter challenging or inappropriate content at some point in their lives. Instead of removing offensive material from libraries, parents and guardians can take proactive steps to guide their children's reading choices and supervise their library visits.  By familiarizing themselves with the library's layout and content, adults can ensure that children are exposed to age-appropriate material and avoid areas with content that may be unsuitable. Additionally, parents can actively engage with their children during library visits, encouraging them to select books that align with their values and beliefs.  As children grow older, they will develop a better understanding of what is appropriate for them to read and will be better equipped to make informed choices. Ultimately, by fostering a culture of open communication and guidance, parents can help children navigate the diverse range of material available in libraries while respecting their individual preferences and sensitivities.
166	3143	2	3	To start, if any materials in the library such as books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive, I believe that they should still remain on the shelves. This is because everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and people should have the freedom to choose what they read, listen to, or watch. While something may be offensive to one person, it may be of interest or importance to another.   For example, a book or music that touches on a sensitive topic like slavery in history may be disturbing to some, but it is essential to understanding our past and learning from it. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it should be censored for everyone else.   In conclusion, it is important to respect individual choices and allow people to decide for themselves what they want to engage with at the library. While some materials may be offensive to some, they should still be available for those who find value in them. Libraries should be inclusive spaces that cater to a diverse range of interests and perspectives.
167	3144	2	3	Censorship is a tool used in the media to prevent people from being offended by what they see or hear. While censorship can be useful in some situations, it can also be overused. Different cultures and religions have varying views and morals, so what may be acceptable to one group could be offensive to another. In my opinion, instead of demanding censorship, individuals can choose not to engage with content that offends them. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right, and censoring material because it may offend some goes against this principle. It is important to exercise discretion and personal choice when it comes to consuming media. For instance, while I may find certain language offensive, I choose not to watch programs that I disagree with. Censorship should be reserved for situations where there is a clear and present danger, not simply to cater to personal preferences. In conclusion, while some censorship may be necessary, individuals should have the freedom to choose what they consume without imposing their beliefs on others.
168	3145	2	3	Censorship in libraries is not necessary. No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. If the guardian of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive, then the guardian can forbid the child to read it. If people begin to take away options on reading materials, some kids may refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get into. Censoring books at a library is pointless; it takes away options and the experience to learn from certain books. Every book has a different plot and a different moral, teaching the reader something unique. Removing books from libraries takes away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book and can hide away reality. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves is another learning experience taken away. If there is a book that a child's guardian disapproves of, it should be up to them to forbid their child from reading it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they want unless a guardian forbids it. It is not up to libraries whether a book is offensive or bad; that is solely based on the reader's opinion, which varies for everyone. When libraries begin to censor books, they take away the option to pick books, potentially leading to fewer kids picking up books. Everyone enjoys a different kind of book, so leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. All in all, libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. Everyone is different, even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a different story and teaches a different moral. Leave the options open to children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books help teach a moral or get a point across, while others prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn about the things happening around them. In conclusion, censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the guardian of a child.
169	3146	2	3	Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion, no, I don't think that any books should be banned from a public library. The authors of books have freedom of speech, so while some books may offend people, individuals can choose to avoid those books if they find them offensive. Banning books from libraries could lead to restrictions on what is available in stores as well. In my view, no book should be banned from the public library because judging a book by its cover is not fair. Only after reading a book can one truly know if it is offensive, and in that case, they can simply return it and choose another. Books that may offend people often provide valuable insights into history and should not be restricted from public access.
170	3147	2	3	In my opinion, some books should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. Certain movies and books can contain harmful language or content that may be upsetting to readers. Similarly, some music can also be offensive with explicit lyrics or themes. However, not all music is inappropriate, as there is a wide variety of genres available to suit different preferences. It is important to consider the impact of media on audiences and ensure that materials being consumed are respectful and inoffensive. Ultimately, the decision to remove offensive books, movies, or music should be based on promoting a positive and inclusive environment for all individuals.
171	3148	2	3	I believe that there shouldn't be any censorship in libraries. The reason why I say that is because of our first amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech. We should be able to include anything in books, magazines, music, movies, and other materials without restriction. Another reason why censorship should be avoided is that individuals should have the ability to determine if a particular book is suitable for their age or aligns with their personal views.  The first amendment protects our right to freedom of speech, allowing us to express ourselves in various forms of media. If we begin censoring materials in libraries, it could set a dangerous precedent that may eventually lead to the erosion of our first amendment rights.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries should be avoided to uphold the principles of the first amendment. It is important to preserve the freedom to express ourselves and access a wide range of materials that reflect diverse perspectives and ideas.
172	3149	2	3	You know when you find a book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book is not appropriate for children to read. The same goes for magazines, with some images and covers not suitable for young minds. It is better to have offensive items like books, music, movies, and magazines removed from shelves as they can poison the minds of children.  For example, music with explicit lyrics can influence children's behavior and language. Rap music, in particular, often contains offensive language that kids may imitate, leading to inappropriate behavior. Similarly, magazines with inappropriate images can have a negative impact on children. Coming across such content in a learning environment like a school can be disturbing for both students and parents.  In conclusion, removing offensive items from shelves is essential to protect children from harmful influences. It is important to create a safe and positive environment for young minds to thrive without being exposed to inappropriate content.
173	3150	2	3	Freedom of press is a right not many countries have. America is the land of the free. To some, having this much freedom causes great things to happen. Without the freedom of press, many of the most classic modern literature would not exist and their messages would be unknown. To censorize the right to write freely about one's outlook on the world or government or anything means taking away imagination and in some cases statistics and events that relate to the past.   Before today's technology, books were one of the only ways to obtain knowledge, and the process to make and publish a book took so long that it was an honor to receive one of the few copies produced. People have a craving for information; they like to learn and advance. If all books that were found 'offensive' are stripped off the shelves, information is slowly taken away, and the enjoyment of reading would be gone.   In the brilliant novel, Fahrenheit 451, a man who lives in a dystopian society discovers the lack of literature. All books found in homes are immediately taken out and burned in the streets for all to see. Children found it entertaining, and adults did nothing. The man goes through the novel with a secret stash of books of his own. Once discovered, he is on the run to protect his precious knowledge the government tries so hard to keep from the public. Censorship would create nothing but chaos and destruction as in the novel.   Having the right to know about your country's history or what is going on in your current government is critical in schools and colleges. Parents often find offense in the authors schools choose to make students read, saying their ideas and ways of thinking are too single-minded and wrong. Students need books to grow and learn, and if every person chose one book to take off the shelf permanently, there would be no more books. Eventually, all information would come from what one would know before the books were banished and in time gone for good.   Books are a history in themselves; no one wants to hear the raw truth of certain topics such as slavery or the possibility of a complete government takeover. In order to avoid hearing of this, one could simply choose a more fiction novel in which to escape into a fantasy of their own. No one can change history; however, they can exaggerate certain events, and without the actual book or site it came from, one could completely alter the public's view and thoughts of the past. Should one take offense to a certain book, they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it.   Writing is a gift few have naturally, and to be able to show off one's talent is a privilege. Books help people escape the harsh world we live in or help them gain more knowledge. Censorship is irrelevant, for having all forms of music, movies, and magazines stripped of the truth, what does that leave? People always stretch the truth or tell a 'white lie,' however, most information is factual. The freedom to write and make books and music and movies is not all about entertaining people. The messages behind said 'offensive' material could be quite strong, and though the author might be long gone, his or her message could live on for decades.   In conclusion, the freedom of press and the right to write and publish freely are essential components of a democratic society. Censorship not only limits creativity and imagination but also hinders the dissemination of important information and diverse perspectives. It is crucial to uphold and protect this fundamental right to ensure a vibrant and informed society.
174	3151	2	3	The entertainment for children and adults consists of movies, music, sports, video games, and reading. Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from any shelf at any time. Libraries censor some material because of violence or inappropriate material. Children should have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to because it's their life. Books, magazines, music, and movies can teach young people about life and the writers, artists, directors, and actors have worked extremely hard on entertaining the people. The materials found 'offensive' should not be removed. These materials can be found helpful to others. Reading material can help a young person with life. If the reader is having problems and needs help, it is possible the book he/she is reading may help them in the thinking process on what they should do. The books, movies, and music have been made by extremely hard workers, so why take away their hard work by removing their material just because a couple of people have found it offensive. One of the many times I went to the library I was looking for a book I had read before but I could not find it. I could not find it because someone else found it inappropriate and had asked that the book be removed from the shelf. This hurt me because that book was one of my favorite books to read. Some books found 'offensive' or 'inappropriate' and taken off the shelves could be another person's favorite book to read. Why take it off the shelf? People are being too much self-centered. They care about themselves and that is it. The material being taken off the shelves should be put back on the shelves for the readers who find the material entertaining. If a parent does not want their child reading a certain book then they have the authority to take the book away from that child, not the shelves. Freedom of the @CAPS1 states that anybody has the right to write whatever they want to write. If we keep taking books, magazines, music, or movies off of the shelves then we're going to get to the point where there are no books on any shelf. It is important to respect the freedom of expression and the right to access diverse material for individuals of all ages. Let's keep our shelves full of diverse content for everyone to enjoy.
175	3152	2	3	I do not believe that books should be removed from the shelves due to something offensive. Libraries are crucial in providing access to information, especially for those who may not have resources like computers at home. In today's society, where many job applications and school assignments are online, libraries offer essential internet access. As a student, I rely on the library for research and projects that require old books on history and the city. While some may find certain content offensive, it is important to consider the value of diverse perspectives and the need for access to information. Removing books based on individual sensitivities could limit the availability of important resources for others. It is essential to respect differing viewpoints and ensure that everyone has access to a wide range of information.
176	3153	2	3	Everyone has a right to read, listen, or watch what they want. Sometimes it's not always up to them. For example rated-R movies, most children under 18 cannot watch them. Either it's a law or the parents have made it a rule. Music I think is different. Some songs have a bad influence on children whether it has to do with violence or cussing, certain songs like that still give kids the wrong message. Libraries should not have those kinds of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. If people want to view those kinds of things that other people find 'offensive' they should buy them on their own time. Not everyone has a great sense of humor, so things that some people find funny, others get offended by. Even if libraries had anything that would offend someone else, it would be the reader's choice to pick a book they want to read. Sometimes it may be better if children read these articles by themselves so it'd save time from having parents explain it to them later. They might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for.   For example, when my brother watched a rated-R movie. In my brother's younger years, he was always curious and asked a lot of questions all the time. Sometimes my mother didn't know how to respond so she'd change the subject. Well, everyone knows the same old question 'Where do babies come from?'. That's the kind of question my brother was curious about. My mom never bothered to answer that question, but if she did she would make up some story. My brother was smart enough to know that what he was being told wasn't accurate at all. Finally one day he got nosy and took one of my mom's movies without asking. It happened to have the answer to his question. He was shocked and disgusted at the same time, yet he was glad to know he finally found the answer my mom wouldn't give.  In this situation I am somewhat neutral. I don't object to having things that might offend other people be removed from bookshelves but on the other hand, it might not be a good thing to put 'offensive' things in certain libraries if children can get to them. Perhaps it's what makes things not boring and makes it more interesting to the reader. Not everyone has the same opinion on things. It just may be a good thing to have these types of books whether it's stating a fact or stating their own opinion. Everyone does have a right to say their opinion, and there is nothing wrong with giving informational facts in articles or movies either.  The bad thing about having any 'offensive' things in libraries may not be a smart idea if it's where most children get their books. Parents can always have a say in what kind of book their children read or what kind of movies they watch. Some parents might not want to go through all the questions the children ask and give something to them that will explain it better for their understanding, while other parents don't want their children to see or know of any sort of things that may be 'offensive' until they're old enough to understand it better and are mature about those things. So in some cases, it might be a bad idea for things that only an adult should know to be on bookshelves in a library if a child might get ahold of it.  The quotation 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' by Katherine Paterson has its own opinion. The quotation is basically saying that even if a parent doesn't want their child to read something 'offensive,' if that parent reads it, then sometimes their children have a right to know. If the child has taken anything like that off a shelf, then once they know, they will not ask any more questions.
177	3154	2	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that it is wrong to remove offensive and other non-offensive books from the shelves in the library just because one or two students do not like them or do not want to see others reading them. Some things are okay for reading and learning, even if they are indeed offensive. It is okay for these materials to be left on the shelves if they will be used for a good purpose such as learning and not just for fun. It is important for readers to be exposed to a broad spectrum of reading materials. Not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal, but they should also be introduced to things such as foreign writing. If we took everything off the shelves that was a slight bit offensive or was not completely suited for readers, would there be many books that would keep people's attention?   In conclusion, I strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf. These materials are important for learning in some cases and keep the readers' attention. Keep these items on the shelves!
178	3155	2	3	The censorship in libraries should align with the age group accessing the materials. Children aged from 8 to 12 should be exposed to books containing profanity, as they are mature enough to handle such content without finding it offensive. However, children under 8 should not have access to books with profanity, as they are too young to understand or process such language. It is essential for libraries to maintain a level of censorship that is appropriate for the age group using the facilities, ensuring that children are exposed to content that is suitable for their level of maturity.
179	3156	2	3	I am a citizen of @LOCATION1 and I believe that while censorship in libraries is necessary, it could be improved by implementing age restrictions on certain materials. It is essential to protect younger children from inappropriate content that may not be suitable for their maturity level. I have personally experienced instances where children have been exposed to content that they should not have been exposed to at such a young age.  However, it is also important to consider the needs of individuals who require access to certain materials for research purposes or other legitimate reasons. As a young adult, I believe that older children should have the opportunity to explore a wider range of topics and learn to distinguish between right and wrong. Ultimately, the responsibility also lies with parents or guardians to guide their children on what is appropriate for them to read.  While some children may not have mature adults to provide guidance, it is crucial for libraries to establish age limits or designate certain materials for a more mature audience. By doing so, the library can strike a balance between protecting young readers and providing access to necessary resources. In conclusion, while censorship in libraries is necessary, there is room for improvement by implementing age restrictions on certain materials to ensure a safer and more appropriate environment for all library users.
180	3157	2	3	If something is found offensive, it should be removed from the shelves of public libraries. Parents expect their children to be able to access appropriate materials when visiting a library, without worrying about them encountering offensive content. Young minds can be influenced by what they read, and exposure to inappropriate language or topics can lead to confusion or curiosity that parents may not be ready to address. Public libraries should carefully consider the materials they offer to ensure that all visitors, regardless of age, are not exposed to offensive content. No one should leave a library feeling offended, and parents should not have to be concerned about what their children may come across. Libraries should be places of learning and knowledge, not sources of worry or harm.
181	3158	2	3	I feel that they shouldn't be removed due to the fact that somebody else may like that movie, book, music, or magazine. Just because we might not like it doesn't mean there isn't someone out there who does. The library should have a variety of materials to cater to different tastes and preferences. Everyone should have the right to access the materials they enjoy, even if it may not be to everyone's liking. While there may be certain materials that are not suitable for children, overall, I believe that everything should be available in the library for those who are interested. Removing items based on personal preferences would not be fair to those who enjoy them. Everyone should have the opportunity to explore different genres and types of media without censorship. It is important to respect diversity and individual preferences when it comes to the selection of materials in the library.
182	3159	2	3	Hi my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 and I'm here to talk about why I think we should have these certain materials in the libraries.  Why I think these materials should stay well because, For @CAPS3 let's say it's a certain movie or song or book or whatever just that one thing you were looking for, for ages and you couldn't find it in any other store and you just happening to go to the library just to look. Even though you know it's not there, but you just looking and you end up finding whatever it is you were looking for. And what if you wanted to look for a mysterious book and only the library had that book you were looking for. I can think of a lot of reasons why we need certain materials. well, I guess that about sums that up for me.  And in conclusion put yourself in the same shoes or even my shoes. What would you do? would you let them remove those materials or would you fight for them to stay.
183	3160	2	3	I believe that people should have the freedom to read what they want without limitations. It is important for individuals to be able to choose their own reading materials based on their interests and maturity level. Restricting access to certain books can make readers feel like they are being babysat, and it may hinder their intellectual growth. Allowing people to make their own choices when it comes to reading encourages them to challenge themselves and expand their knowledge. Ultimately, the decision on what to read should be left to the reader, as everyone has different preferences and capabilities.
184	3161	2	3	I believe that libraries should not be censored because people take offense to something. Everyone should be able to read, research, or watch anything they want at a library. I say this because everyone takes offense to something, and if people can't find what they're looking for, then why go to the library? Additionally, everybody likes different things. If we start censoring materials based on individual preferences, there would be nothing left on the shelves. People have varying tastes, and just because something offends one person doesn't mean it should be removed for everyone. If we cater to every individual's dislikes, libraries would lose their purpose, and people would stop using them. It's important to support freedom of information and allow individuals to access a wide range of materials without censorship in libraries.
185	3162	2	3	Censorship is one of the most broken laws in @LOCATION1. It is illegal to censor any publication such as books, magazines, music or movies. Censorship most often occurs with books in a school setting. Censorship should no longer be tolerated because it affects the writers, school system and especially readers. In the @ORGANIZATION1 every person has the right to express their feelings and opinions on any topic that they want to. School systems are taking away that right by not allowing them to have a certain book in a school. Schools should be a place for either all books or a place for no books at all. The faculty of a school does not have the right to decide what books are allowed in their school based on their own ideals. It is not fair to the writer to be discriminated against, and that writer must have the right to have their book read in any setting. The next group that censorship within a school system affects is the school system itself. If a school is allowed to take away one right of a group of people without punishment, then they might start taking away other rights. In general school systems and teachers are power hungry leaders of the student body of a school. They make rules just to display their power over students, and take away many of their rights. If schools are allowed to continue censoring books, then this could lead to a downward spiral of all being censored. As Katherine Paterson once said,'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children...take off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove the book I abhor...then you have exactly the same right...And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on school censorship because it is unconstitutional. The last major group of people that censorship within a school system affects is the potential readers and students. Censoring a book is taking that person's ability to learn about, and understand a certain topic that was censored. Students within a school must have the right to read what they want to read regardless of the school's beliefs and ideals. In conclusion, censorship in any setting, but especially in school must no longer be tolerated because it affects writers, school systems, and potential readers. Schools are taking away the constitutional right of all potential readers. The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on the unlawful practices occurring in schools, around the country, every day.
186	3163	2	3	What is this world coming to? We have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in libraries where anyone can check them out. Being a daughter and teenager myself, I personally have had the experience of reading some of these offensive books and magazines. The sex, drugs, and violence used to create a story have destroyed the minds of our youth. I strongly feel this disturbing and destructive material should be removed from the shelves of libraries.  I do not question whether children and teens should read, but rather what they read. I agree reading helps our youth learn and excel in schooling, but offensive books and magazines put nasty ideas into their minds and distort their way of thinking. The more our younger generation reads about these ugly things, the more curious they become. I feel they will eventually let curiosity get the better of them.  Many would say that experiencing activities such as sex and drugs is all part of growing up, but I disagree. Trying any one of these harmful activities portrayed in certain library materials could put you and your health in severe danger. It only takes one time to become pregnant or become addicted to drugs.  To better prove my point, think of your favorite book. Did you look up to any of the main characters? Did you want to be just like him/her? Well, it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model. They may save the world and be a hero by day, but authors and producers make sure they include their night life in the story as well. This tells our children that it is okay to do these things, when it is the exact opposite.  I stand by my opinion and believe offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries. This material plants a bad seed in the mind of our youth. It leads them to believe everyone, including their heroes in books and movies, does these things. Sex, violence, and drugs are not what this world was made for. Let us protect the innocence and well-being of our youth by removing such harmful materials from their reach.
187	3164	2	3	People often debate whether graphic images or words in books, movies, and other media have a significant impact on children's outlook on various topics. Some argue that such content can shape children's perceptions and should be restricted, while others believe that children will inevitably come across such material and that there should be no limitations. The latter viewpoint suggests that censorship is unnecessary, as children will eventually learn about sensitive topics regardless.  Critics of explicit content in media often cite concerns about offensive language, inappropriate themes, or stereotypes that may be harmful to certain groups. However, proponents of freedom of expression argue that authors and creators use these elements for entertainment or to convey important messages, and that their work should not be censored based on subjective interpretations.  Ultimately, the idea that restricting mature content in books or media will protect children from exposure to certain topics is flawed. Children will inevitably encounter diverse perspectives and themes as they grow up, and it is essential for them to learn how to navigate and understand these complexities. Therefore, rather than censoring content, it is important to engage in open discussions with children about what they are exposed to and help them develop critical thinking skills to interpret and analyze information effectively.  In conclusion, while it is understandable that parents may have concerns about the content their children consume, complete censorship is not the solution. Instead, fostering an environment of open communication and critical thinking is crucial in helping children navigate the complexities of the world around them.
188	3165	2	3	Dear @CAPS1,  @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1. I am a student here at @LOCATION1, and it has come to @CAPS2 attention that the @ORGANIZATION1 is thinking about taking books they find offensive out of the library. I think this is wrong. If everybody at @LOCATION1 took the books we found offensive off the shelves and threw them away, we would be left with no books to read.  I also think that no one person should have the right to decide what books are too offensive for me to read. I am sixteen years old and responsible enough to make @CAPS2 own decisions about what is too offensive for me to be reading. If I feel I should read books that others @MONTH1 find offensive then, why does that concern you? Just because I want to read the book does not mean you have to.  Also, I think that having books that might be a little offensive makes that book more interesting. If you take every offensive word out of a book, chances are it is going to be hard to sit through it. If you take all offensive books from the library, kids will be even more discouraged about reading, and I know that is not what @LOCATION1 is looking to do.  If you think that books are that offensive, try walking down the hallways. this is a @ORGANIZATION1. Kids cuss all the time, and talk about dirtier stuff than in any book I've ever read. If your looking to make children more innocent, then taking all ofour books out of the library is not the way to go about it.  In conclusion, censoring books based on their content is not the solution. It is essential to allow individuals the freedom to choose what they read and think for themselves. Removing offensive books will only limit the diversity and richness of knowledge available to us. Let's preserve the freedom to read and explore different perspectives through literature.  Sincerely, @PERSON1
189	3166	2	3	Every author has an intended audience when they are writing a book, and they write about what they think is appropriate for that certain audience. Unfortunately, sometimes other people that are not intended to read the book actually do read it even though it may not be something that they are supposed to be reading. When an author writes a children's book, it is meant for a child to read, not an adult. Also when an author writes a romance novel, it is meant for people who can comprehend what the author is talking about and can act maturely while reading it. Although some novels may not be appropriate for certain people, censorship in libraries is not the way to fix that, and it is a big mistake.  As humans we are given certain freedoms, and one of those freedoms is the freedom of press. Authors should be able to write about whatever they choose to write about. If they choose to write about subjects that are not appropriate for all age groups they still have the right to have their books in libraries. Even though everyone isn't supposed to read them, certain people are. If you take those books away because you're scared that a child might get a hold of one, then you're taking away what certain people enjoy reading.  Due to the fact that different books are intended for different age groups, libraries have different sections filled with a variety of authors. They have a children's section made primarily for children, an adult section with books that only adults are supposed to read, and a teen section for everyone in between. By having sections within them, libraries are trying to keep people reading what they were intended to read without censoring or taking away people's favorite books. Having sections in libraries is a happy medium between letting anyone read whatever book they would like no matter how inappropriate it may be, and cutting out certain books altogether.  If a person is an adult, they should be allowed to go to the library and get whatever type of book, magazine, music, or movie that they want. If a kid's parent is okay with them checking out or looking at certain things then it shouldn't matter to anyone else if they think that the material is offensive. Instead of censoring what movies, books, magazines, or music that libraries have, there should be a certain age when someone can come in without a parent and check out whatever they would like. If a person is under that age then their parents should be present while they check out so they can approve of what their child is checking out.  Censorship in libraries is ultimately pointless and shouldn't even be considered. Whether some people find certain material offensive or not, there are other ways to get that material so there really is no point to censoring anything in libraries.
190	3167	2	3	I think that all offensive materials should be removed from libraries so everyone can enjoy books, music, and movies without being offended. These materials should have their own section, locked up to prevent children from accessing them. This way, everyone can have access to a wide range of content without being exposed to inappropriate material. By segregating offensive content, libraries can ensure a fair and inclusive environment for all patrons.
191	3168	2	3	Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room. As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, explicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't.  Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, TV shows, movies, on the internet, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. There should just be a limitation on who can view it. That applies to everything that could contain offensive material.  Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off-limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be. But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree. Keeping children's minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general. Therefore, it is crucial to implement appropriate censorship measures to protect young minds from harmful and inappropriate content.
192	3169	2	3	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This strong statement by Katherine Paterson highlights the issue of censorship in libraries. In today's society, we often hear about books and other resources being banned from libraries due to unpopular views. The classic novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, has been removed from many shelves because of its language deemed offensive. However, libraries should not remove materials based on offensiveness, as it goes against their purpose and limits access to diverse viewpoints. Libraries are meant to provide information, interest, and enlightenment to all individuals. When materials are censored due to differing opinions, the library fails to fulfill its role. What one person finds offensive, another may find valuable. Children should be handled differently, with parents or guardians having the right to restrict access to inappropriate content. Libraries should provide separate sections for different age groups to ensure appropriate access. Banning books removes a part of history and restricts knowledge for future generations. Censorship in libraries limits our rights and hinders intellectual freedom. It is crucial to preserve access to diverse materials to encourage learning and understanding in society.
193	3170	2	3	I dont think we should not take books, Music, Movies, and Magazines off the shelf gets because we think they are offensive to us. If you think somthing is offensive dont get it I know I would not get somthing that I think is offensive to me.     Their lot's of books in the world that i dont like. One of them is @CAPS1 Books I hate them with all of my heart. The next kind of books that I think is offensive is @CAPS2 Books because their are lots of story that are in their that we dont read. So I think that it is a wast of paper. The last kind of books I think is offensive is @CAPS3 Books because they are hard to read them in @CAPS3.     Their are lot's of music out there I dont like. One of them is @CAPS5. I dont know why I dislike @CAPS5 but I do. The next type @CAPS6- @CAPS7. The singer in todays @CAPS6- @CAPS7 I think are no good. The last type of music is some of todays rap. I think some of todays rap uses to much bad words.     Their are lot's of movies out their I dont like. The first one is @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I did not get the hole plut of that movie. The next one @CAPS12 of the corn. Their was no way I could find out way the @CAPS12 was killing the people over @NUM1 in that town. The last movie that I did not like was ALL the @CAPS13 movies. I just did not like them ok?     I think all of these things are offensive. But I still know that people like them so I would not take them away. There are thing people like but I dont like. Their things that my friend like but I dont like. Their thing I like and they dont like. But I guess what I am trying to say is in life there are going to be things that you dont like. But you cant get rid of the things you dislike in the world.
194	3171	2	3	Our founding fathers created amendments to protect the freedom of speech, one of the greatest being the right to express oneself without censorship. Censoring offensive materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, is unnecessary and limits the ability of individuals to share their thoughts and ideas. Book burning, a historical act of destroying written works deemed undesirable, is a harmful practice that stifles creativity and knowledge. Libraries should not censor books, as they are meant to provide access to a wide range of information and perspectives. Parents should engage with their children about the media they consume rather than simply restricting access. Censorship of offensive materials is not the solution; instead, we should strive to understand and address the complexities of life. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right that should be upheld, and censorship is not conducive to the intellectual growth and development of individuals.
195	3172	2	3	Books, magazines, movies, and music should not be put in higher reaches or removed from shelves just because some individuals find them offensive. It is unfair to restrict access to certain materials based on personal opinions. People should have the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. Removing these items can hinder individuals, such as students, from accessing important information for educational purposes. It is important to respect different perspectives and not impose restrictions on what others can access. Everyone should have the opportunity to explore a wide range of content without censorship.
196	3173	2	3	Libraries are a great resource for learning, but it is important to be mindful of the content that is made available to the public. Offensive material, whether in the form of books, movies, or music, can be harmful and upsetting to certain individuals. While libraries may prioritize profit, it is crucial for them to consider the impact of what they choose to offer on their shelves. Offensive movies can be disrespectful to certain groups, offensive music can promote harmful messages, and offensive books can be disturbing to readers. It is essential for libraries to exercise caution and thoughtfulness in their selection process to ensure that they provide a safe and respectful environment for all patrons.
197	3174	2	3	I do believe that some places have magazines, books, movies, and music that need to be removed from all shelves. Just think, if you had children, would you want them getting a hold of a magazine with nude men or women in it? Yes, people tell you they have control over their kids in stores, but I know you see kids all the time walking away or roaming off to try to do what they want, and go to places they shouldn't be like magazines, for instance. Would you want to find your little one looking at a magazine with nude women in it? That's not the kind of thing kids should be finding in stores; it's not necessary.  The same goes for movies. Imagine you rent a movie from one of your many movie places and it has nudity or cursing in it. Do you want that around your kids? I know I wouldn't because kids are like sponges - they absorb everything they see and hear, and you don't want your little one walking around cussing at you. I have little cousins, and I've seen it happen many times where they cuss back at their parents, and when the parents ask them where they heard that, it's usually the same answer - TV or movies.  So, do you really think it's necessary to have all that inappropriate content around for anyone, of many ages, to see? It's not. Everything like that just needs to be taken off all shelves and destroyed because I shouldn't have to see it, and neither should anyone else. It's gross, nasty, and inappropriate for children. I say get rid of it all and do everyone a favor.
198	3175	2	3	Libraries contain a wide range of materials, including books, music, and magazines. However, not all of these materials may be suitable for all visitors. Offensive, distracting, and inappropriate material should be removed from the shelves and placed in a separate section of the public library to ensure a comfortable and appropriate environment for all patrons.  For example, young children may inadvertently come across books on sensitive topics such as abortions, which are not age-appropriate for them. It is essential to protect children from potentially harmful content by segregating such materials in a designated section. Additionally, distracting elements like loud music can disrupt the peaceful atmosphere of a library, making it challenging for others to concentrate. By creating a separate area for music listening, individuals can enjoy their music without disturbing fellow visitors.  Furthermore, magazines with inappropriate content should be completely removed from the library. Ensuring that magazines cater to specific age groups can prevent exposure to unsuitable material, maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for all library users. Implementing these measures can help promote a positive library experience for everyone.  In conclusion, by segregating offensive, distracting, and inappropriate materials into their own sections within the library, we can create a more inclusive and respectful space for all visitors. It is essential to prioritize the comfort and well-being of library patrons by carefully curating the available materials. Let us strive to foster a welcoming environment where individuals of all ages can explore, learn, and enjoy the offerings of the library without encountering unsuitable content.
199	3176	2	3	Hello, my name is @CAPS1 and I think that books, newspapers, and magazines being censored should be done but shouldn't. When I say that I mean that some books dealing with adventure or romance might have parts that need to be censored, but that's how the author made the book. It was meant to catch your attention right off the first sentence of the story.   I believe that sometimes magazines need to be censored because they are promoting bad habits for people all across the @LOCATION1 and other people around the world. Magazines in my opinion should be censored. Now some make it to where there is less inappropriate content, which is somewhat a good thing, but others pretty much just let it slide and figure it will raise the sales by however much percent they want it to be considering what they put in the magazine.   I feel that books should stay on the shelf however. Some people feel that the 'censored' parts of the story are really what catches their attention. I myself have never had an experience in this field because I'm not one to be a strong reader, but knowing how other people are, I would suggest that we censor some things, but not all.   People write books all the time dealing with something that has happened in their lifetime or something from their imagination. So we can't really help what people think about and what some people write down to be published in a book. For some readers, it is a very interesting story or passage being read from the back cover of the book, while others just want the book gone from their neighborhood library or out of their house. It all really depends on the reader.   If I could, there would be things I would censor, but not in books. It was their idea to put it in the story but some things need to be left unsaid. Some readers appreciate it, while others do not. It is really their choice to read the book and if it's not appealing to them they can simply put it back on the shelf and find another close to it. I just feel that some magazines should be censored. Constantly, you see swimsuit models and 'sexual appeal' in magazines every day when you enter the grocery store or library. I just do not think it is right for little kids to see that when they're looking for a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 book or a book about their favorite animal.   Another reason to censor magazines would be because of some religious views on what people see when they look at the magazine. People every day become @CAPS4 and being right with @CAPS5, so people will take offense to some of the disturbing images in magazines. I myself as a @CAPS6 take offense to some of these magazines, promoting being perfect and having the life sucked out of you as you read each passage.   As I have said, I am to the understanding of the books having what they have in them, because of the author's imagination, but some magazines just need to be thrown off the shelf.
200	3177	2	3	"The way I see it, movies or books should not be taken off the shelf because it should be our own right to choose whether or not to consume them. The same goes for music, like country or sad songs, which cannot be controlled like movies or books. Even if you turn off the radio or change the channel, there will always be content that some people find offensive and others enjoy. In my opinion, if there was a way to remove certain movies, I would consider doing so, especially if they are offensive or triggering to certain individuals. One example is the movie ""Shylo,"" which depicts scenes of animal abuse that can be extremely distressing for those who have experienced violence in their past. Ultimately, the decision to engage with certain media should be left to the individual, as everyone has different sensitivities and preferences when it comes to entertainment."
201	3178	2	3	We all enjoy having the freedom to read, listen, and watch what we like. How would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you? Some people believe that censored books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries. I believe you should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever you choose, but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material.  We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to. That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though. Instead, the child should talk to a parent about the censored item. The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item. Also, if those materials are removed from libraries completely, someone that is mature enough to be reading, listening, or seeing it will not have a chance to.  I remember when I was in middle school, I really wanted to read @PERSON1 novels that I saw at the library. My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age. My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read @PERSON1 novels that she approved of. She said when I was older, I could read any of @PERSON1's novels that I wanted. I found this compromise to be very fair. I knew that when I was old enough to read those novels, they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me.  We should have the right to read, listen, and watch what we enjoy, but younger children or other age groups should be monitored. That does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though. When those children are old enough to read, watch, or listen to those materials, they should be able to go to the library, knowing it will be there on the shelf waiting for them.
202	3179	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Censorship takes away from the author's freedom of expression and the reader's ability to experience a work in its original form. While some content may be deemed offensive to some, it is important to allow artists and creators to convey their messages without restriction. Removing offensive materials limits the artistic value and overall impact of the work. In conclusion, censorship should not be used to restrict access to books, music, movies, or other forms of media, as it hinders creative expression and the exchange of diverse ideas.
203	3180	2	3	Sexual conduct, language, and criminal behavior are prevalent in schools and communities, with certain books, movies, music, and magazines focusing on these themes. While libraries provide access to these materials, there is a need for stricter censorship to protect young individuals from exposure to inappropriate content.   Movies, magazines like @ORGANIZATION1, and music often contain explicit content that may not be suitable for children under a certain age. By removing such materials from library shelves, educators and parents can prevent early exposure to mature themes and discourage premature interest in these subjects.   Music, in particular, is easily accessible in libraries and can introduce children to explicit language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts. By restricting access to music with adult-rated content, libraries can create a safer environment for young individuals to explore without being exposed to harmful influences.   While enjoying magazines, movies, and music is a common pastime, it is essential to prioritize content that does not promote inappropriate behavior. By involving parents in media consumption decisions and enforcing stricter censorship in libraries, we can help guide children towards more age-appropriate and positive influences. Censorship in libraries is crucial in shaping the development of young individuals and should be a priority in safeguarding their well-being.
204	3181	2	3	The diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time. What I find appropriate, another person finds obscene and vulgar. What I enjoy in terms of media consumption may bother someone else, but that does not justify removing it from public access.   While it is understandable that certain content may not be suitable for everyone, outright censorship is not the solution. Instead, materials that some may find inappropriate can be placed in designated sections or areas within a library, making them less accessible to those who may not wish to be exposed to them.  By allowing for the segregation of materials based on content, individuals can make informed choices about what they consume, while still preserving the freedom of expression and access to information for all. It is important to find a balance that respects differing perspectives and preferences without resorting to blanket censorship. Ultimately, the goal should be to provide a wide range of materials while also respecting the boundaries and values of diverse individuals and communities.
205	3182	2	3	"There are many different people in this world, each with their own opinions about books, music, movies, magazines, and more. Just because one person doesn't particularly like horror movies, it doesn't mean that movie stores should remove horror films from their shelves. There are many people who are fans of slasher films and enjoy scary movies. It's important to cater to a variety of tastes and preferences.   I, for one, enjoy a wide range of genres when it comes to books, music, and movies. Trying new things can help broaden your horizons and introduce you to new experiences. Imagine if a bookstore decided to remove a classic book like ""The Tiger and the Pig"" from their shelves because they believed a tiger and a pig could never be friends. This would limit the options available to customers and could ultimately harm their business.   In a diverse world like ours, it's essential to embrace different perspectives and preferences. Variety is what keeps things interesting and allows people to discover new things they may come to love. So, let's continue to celebrate diversity and encourage a wide range of choices in the media we consume."
206	3183	2	3	What is considered offensive? If we took books, music, movies, and magazines that people found offensive off shelves, there would be nothing left. Everyone is different, which means they all get offended in different ways. By taking all this off shelves, we would be providing a smaller education for students around the world. Things we learn about in school, slavery, wars, and some politics could offend many people. But if we were to take them off the shelves at school and libraries, children will have no idea about history or what is going on in the current world. What about drugs and alcohol? Many parents do not talk to their children about the uses of controlled substances, so without these sources, they may never know the harm that they can do to someone's body. Everyone takes something offensive, but not everyone takes the same thing offensive. So who is to say what offends people and what does not? If that's the case, shouldn't we take all books, movies, music, and magazines away from children's schools and libraries? Adults get offended too, so should we take all of their resources away, including the newspaper? By taking away what one may call offensive, it could land us in the dark ages with no books, no local news, no movies, no nothing because not one person can say what the whole world considers offensive. Everyone has the right to read and write what they want. No one can say what offends everyone. Someone may get offended by talking about one's race, another may get offended by talking about religion, and someone may even get offended if you talk about their cute little kitty cat. Everyone looks at everything differently. So why try and control us all as one? All people think differently and they know what they want to read, hear, and watch all by themselves; they don't need someone to tell them.
207	3184	2	3	Censorship should only be implemented in environments where young children are present, such as schools and children's television programs. However, censoring materials that are not intended for young audiences, such as books, movies, magazines, and music, is counterproductive. By censoring content meant for adults, we limit our ability to explore new ideas and advance as a society. Parents who advocate for censorship of adult content are neglecting the opportunity to engage in important discussions with their children and help them develop critical thinking skills. Personal experiences also play a significant role in shaping one's views on censorship, as exposure to uncensored materials during childhood can foster maturity and understanding. While censorship has its place in certain contexts, such as children's media, it should not be used to restrict the free exchange of ideas among adults. In a society that values freedom of speech, individuals have the right to express themselves without fear of censorship based on the opinions of a minority. Ultimately, censorship should be approached with caution and used judiciously to protect children while respecting the rights of adults to access a wide range of information and perspectives.
208	3185	2	3	Book censorship is a national issue that sparks debate over what should be allowed on the shelves for children to read. While some parents may find certain content offensive, others may see it as a necessary lesson for their children. In my opinion, books should be censored on a national scale, similar to the movie industry's rating system. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of parents to regulate what their children read. Removing books from shelves based on individual preferences would leave little left for anyone to read. Therefore, parents should focus on controlling their own children's reading habits rather than imposing their beliefs on others. Ultimately, a balance between censorship and personal responsibility is key in addressing this complex issue.
209	3186	2	3	No, it would not be right to remove a book from the library just because one person finds it offensive. Decisions like this should be made collectively, considering the opinions of many people. Just because one individual is offended by a book does not mean it should be discarded. There may be others who enjoy the book and would be deprived of the opportunity to read it. It is important to respect diverse opinions and preferences when it comes to literature. If a book is offensive to someone, they can simply choose not to read it rather than imposing their views on others. Everyone should have the opportunity to access a wide range of books in a library without fear of censorship based on individual preferences. It is essential to consider the diverse needs and interests of library users when making decisions about book selection.
210	3187	2	3	The media plays a crucial role in shaping the minds of individuals, especially children. It is essential to ensure that the content being consumed is appropriate and positive to avoid any negative impact. Children are highly impressionable, and exposure to vulgar or offensive material can have lasting effects on their development.   I support the decision to remove inappropriate content from public access, whether it be in schools or other platforms. It is important to safeguard the innocence of children and promote a healthy mindset. Adults are also susceptible to the influence of media, and it is crucial to be vigilant in monitoring the content being consumed.   Overall, it is imperative to prioritize the well-being and positive growth of individuals by restricting access to harmful material. By taking a stand against negative content, we can ensure a more nurturing environment for children and adults alike.
211	3188	2	3	I think that they should remove inappropriate books and content from children's reach, as the exposure to such material can have a negative impact on their development. With the increasing accessibility of information, it is essential to monitor what children are exposed to. Implementing age-appropriate sections in libraries can help in ensuring that kids are not exposed to content meant for adults. Furthermore, parents should be honest with their children about sensitive topics like sex and drugs, as being informed at a young age can help them make better decisions in the future. Education on these subjects should start early in schools to equip children with the knowledge to navigate the complexities of the world. By being proactive in controlling what children are exposed to, we can create a safer and more informed environment for the younger generation. It is important to address these issues now before they escalate further and create bigger challenges for society.
212	3189	2	3	Books have been a part of every person's life since they learn to read. Initially, parents and teachers introduce books to children, and as individuals grow older, books become a part of their academic and professional lives. Authors write books to attract an audience, and while some may find certain books offensive, it does not justify removing them from shelves. People have the choice to stop reading a book if they find it offensive, but it should not be denied to others who may appreciate it. When it comes to children's books, parents should take on the responsibility of monitoring and censoring what their children read. However, for adults, the interpretation of a book is subjective, and different individuals may have varying opinions about the same book. Ultimately, the freedom to read and form opinions about books should be respected, and censorship should be left to individual discretion, particularly when it comes to children. Every book has its place on the shelf, waiting to be explored and discussed, allowing readers to gain unique perspectives and insights.
213	3190	2	3	I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should not be pulled off the shelves of libraries. Everyone has different tastes and interests, and it is important to provide a variety of content for people to choose from. Restricting access to offensive material can limit people's freedom to choose what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Additionally, censoring offensive material in libraries may not prevent people from accessing it elsewhere. It is essential to uphold the principle of freedom of expression and allow individuals to make their own choices when it comes to the media they consume. Ultimately, keeping offensive material available in libraries ensures that people have the opportunity to explore diverse perspectives and engage with challenging content.
214	3191	2	3	When have you ever went into a library and found a book that is so offensive that you complain or try to get that certain book off the shelf? Have you ever read a book half way through and questioned why you are reading it? Why would you read a book that you know you're not going to like?     If someone has the right and the authority to take books off the shelf that bothers them, then I have the exact same right as them. I thought everyone was treated by equal rights. When i ever do read I always read the back of the book or whats called the summary of the story so I can see if I'm going to like it or not. If I know a book is going to offend me or a magazine or even a movie, most likely I'm not going to even bother giving my attention to them.     Obviously the author doesnt like censorship or she wouldnt be arguing about it. It's obviously something that bothers her and everyone is intitiled to their own beliefs and disbeliefs. I respect people that stand up for themselves and find the hardest ways out of hard prediciments. I can say I always go to libraries and read books because I'm not a reader. But i can tell you if I ever did go to a library and i found a book on the shelf that offends me its probably going to offend someone else. So why would they even try to bother getting away with being offensive to people. Everyone is intitled to their own opinion. But i think if it's going to offend someone in praticular it's probably going to bother someone else. I'm not saying everyone is alike but most people believe in things that other people believe in. People can hav the same agreements and disagreements.     I do have to agree with @PERSON1 because she is right. You would be amazed on the amount and different things people can get offended by. I have tons of experiences of movies, books, music, and magazines that have offended me. But I didnt let it pull me down or anything. For example I stopped watching the movie, and I stopped reading the book that bothered me. You can't wear your emotions on your shoulders but you can stand up for your rights and tell people what you believe. @CAPS1't ever tell anyone that you can't believe in your opinions. If certain things offend you, @CAPS1't let them bother you just stop doing what your doing and move on to something else.     Like I said I have had alot of experiences of offensive things I have read and watched. Like awhile back I watched a movie that had a black man in it and he was locked in prison and killed in prison for being accused of something he didn't do. It was just because the time era and it was also because he was black. Thats the kind of stuff that really upsets me. Because we are all the same. We @MONTH1 look different and see things different. But our bodies function the same and we all breathe the same air. I have always gone by the saying, '@CAPS1't ever judge a book by it's cover until you read it.'     So whatever people @MONTH1 think I believe in one thing and it's to let people believe in things they want to believe in. @CAPS1't ever tell someone how to think, act, or feel. I agree with Katherine Paterson.
215	3192	2	3	When I go to a library I may find some stuff that is offensive to me. But what is offensive to me may not be offensive to the person beside me. People have different opinions based on their history, making it difficult to set boundaries on what is considered offensive. What one person finds offensive, another may see as the best thing ever. Offensive content does not have a set definition that everyone can agree on. However, there should be limitations in place to keep certain things away from certain age groups, like not allowing a kindergartener to check out a mature movie. Censorship is necessary to protect people, but ultimately, it comes down to using common sense to navigate what is appropriate. While we may never all agree on what is offensive, utilizing common sense can help solve the problem.
216	3193	2	3	Certain people believe that offensive books, magazines, or music should be taken off the shelves of libraries. I think that offensive media should not be removed because individuals have the right to choose what they want to see or hear. It is not up to others to dictate what can be accessed. Removing offensive material would limit people's knowledge and prevent them from forming their own opinions. For example, learning about historical events like the Holocaust, despite being disturbing, is crucial to prevent history from repeating itself. Society should not control what people are exposed to, as it is essential to understand both the good and bad aspects of the world. Offensive content should not be censored, but rather acknowledged and understood.
217	3194	2	3	Katherine Paterson emphasizes the importance of considering different viewpoints when it comes to censoring books. She argues that just because a book may be offensive to some, it does not necessarily mean it should be removed from shelves. Paterson suggests that a fairer approach would be to take a vote to determine whether a book should be kept or removed based on the opinions of a larger group of people. By allowing for discussion and debate on the matter, a more balanced decision can be reached. It is crucial to consider the diverse perspectives that individuals may have on a particular book before deciding its fate. Ultimately, removing a book should not be based solely on the opinions of a few, but rather on a collective decision that takes into account a variety of viewpoints.
218	3195	2	3	Library censorship is a controversial topic that revolves around the removal of offensive materials from shelves. While some may find certain books, music, or other forms of media offensive, it is important to remember that everyone has the right to freedom of speech. Denying authors, musicians, and artists the ability to express themselves would be a violation of their basic rights as American citizens.   It is crucial to understand that just because something may be offensive to one person, it does not mean it should be removed for everyone. Libraries are meant to be a resource for everyone, providing materials that cater to a diverse range of interests and preferences. While individuals have the right to avoid materials they find offensive, it is not fair to deprive others of the opportunity to access these resources.   In conclusion, while it is important to consider the feelings of those who may find certain materials offensive, it is equally important to respect the rights of creators and consumers of these materials. Libraries should strive to provide a wide array of resources, even if some may be deemed offensive by certain individuals. It is essential to maintain a balance between freedom of expression and the sensitivities of the community.
219	3196	2	3	Censorship in books and music is a significant concern in our society, particularly in @LOCATION1. Personally, I believe that instead of removing books from shelves, we should address the issues within them and move past the controversy. One example is the novel 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1,' which has faced backlash for its use of the word 'nigger.' While some may find this offensive, I believe it is important to understand the context in which the word is used rather than simply removing the book altogether.  In terms of music, particularly rap music, there are concerns about the explicit lyrics promoting violence, drug use, and other criminal activities. While I do not advocate for outright removal, I do believe that these types of music should be placed in a restricted section for mature audiences. It is essential to recognize that not all listeners of such music engage in negative behaviors, and it is a matter of personal responsibility and discernment.  On the topic of movies and magazines, I have witnessed instances where excessive nudity in films can be inappropriate for younger audiences. Similarly, magazines promoting unrealistic body standards can lead to harmful behaviors like extreme dieting and body image issues. In these cases, I believe that certain materials should be restricted or banned to protect vulnerable individuals from negative influences.  In conclusion, while some forms of media may contain controversial or harmful content, it is crucial to approach censorship with caution and thoughtfulness. Rather than outright banning materials, we should focus on educating individuals and promoting critical thinking to navigate the complexities of modern media. By fostering a culture of understanding and discernment, we can better address the challenges posed by potentially harmful content in books, music, movies, and magazines.
220	3197	2	3	I don't think censorship is right for our public libraries. In my opinion, it depends on what they are saying or showing, as well as the age of the audience. People have different preferences and interpretations, so censorship may not be suitable for everyone. Removing books, music, movies, and magazines from shelves because they are deemed offensive can limit access to diverse perspectives and information. People should have the opportunity to explore different topics and cultures through reading materials. Censorship can restrict the variety of content available for readers, ultimately hindering the learning and growth potential of individuals. Therefore, I believe that censorship in public libraries may not be beneficial as it could limit access to valuable resources and knowledge.
221	3198	2	3	"If the library is in a high school, then we are all old enough to have already seen or heard anything and everything offensive. In case we haven't, you can't shield your kids from offensive material. This hurts them in the long run. For example, when your boss gets to work and you or someone around you mess up an important assignment or task, he may use terms such as the 'F' word or other vulgar terms to describe how mad he is. If you were to just hear those for the first time being yelled at you, there is a chance you would have a breakdown or be ineffective at work. Now, I'm not saying we should all use vulgar language every day. I'm just saying that the real world doesn't have a 'clean' version. There is no mom or dad there to stand by and say, ""Oh no, that's not acceptable speech, son."" If you took a survey of the daily language of teens and young adults, almost half would say they use some form of vulgar language or inappropriate terms. We need to teach our kids and teens that it's not okay to say those things, and they need to know what is acceptable in society. But sheltering them in the library and then thrusting them into a world with daily inappropriate acts is not right. It's important to educate them on appropriate behavior and language to prepare them for the realities of the world they will face."
222	3199	2	3	Do we have the right to take books? Author Katherine Paterson proves a point by saying 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if everyone is able to just remove books from the shelf because they have something against it then we would hardly have any books at our libraries. Everyone has their own opinions. There are so many things that affect our opinions. Our beliefs, lifestyles, ways of thinking, culture, and the list goes on. I'm sure I could think of certain books, movies, music, and magazines that I don't like and could just do without. Does that mean I want to totally rid the world of those certain materials? It sure wouldn't bother me but that would be extremely selfish. Even if something is totally inappropriate and offensive, it is still information. Maybe it shouldn't go in the little kids section of a library or store but I don't think it should be removed completely. Music, especially, has a wide range from rap, rock, oldies, screamo, classical, country, alternative, and the list goes on. I despise country; I go for the alternative and classical music. I know a lot of people who love it though. All the old people I know hate all the rap. Most of it is pretty offensive but that's just how things are. So no, I don't think anyone should have the right to remove anything from anywhere just because they personally find it offensive. We can't hide from the world. I think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things. If we remove things we don't care for, others will remove the ones you like and so on. So then we're left with nothing. Just like freedom of speech, we should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what we enjoy.
223	3200	2	3	I believe that censorship should not be allowed to affect public libraries. Books are meant to stimulate the imagination and minds of readers, and removing books that are deemed offensive could prevent individuals from accessing valuable knowledge and literature. For example, the removal of classical literature or books on certain cultures could hinder education and understanding. It is important to preserve freedom of choice and access to information in public libraries, allowing individuals to decide for themselves what they want to read. Censorship in libraries could limit intellectual freedom and hinder the exploration of diverse perspectives and ideas. Therefore, it is crucial to uphold the availability of a wide range of books in public libraries, without censorship based on perceived offensiveness.
224	3201	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic of concern when it comes to the content available on the shelves. It raises questions about why certain materials with inappropriate language, racist themes, or negative influences are not removed. The library houses a variety of items like books, music, movies, and magazines, each potentially containing elements that may be deemed objectionable.  One common issue is the presence of explicit language in various materials. Whether it's books, magazines, music, or movies, the use of profanity can be off-putting for some individuals. Similarly, racist themes in content can be unsettling and offensive to many library visitors. Additionally, there may be content that promotes negative behaviors or ideas, sparking curiosity about engaging in such activities.  Advertisements within magazines can also be a cause for concern. Promotions for tobacco, alcohol, or drugs can glamorize harmful substances and behaviors, influencing impressionable individuals. Such advertisements can send misleading messages about the safety and desirability of these products, potentially leading to risky decisions.  Furthermore, the visual content in movies and magazines can be problematic. Inappropriate scenes or images may not align with personal values or beliefs, making some individuals uncomfortable or upset. It's essential to consider the impact of such visuals on viewers and readers, especially in a public space like a library.  In conclusion, the presence of objectionable content in libraries, including explicit language, inappropriate themes, misleading advertisements, and unsuitable visuals, can be a cause for concern. It raises questions about the selection and maintenance of materials on library shelves, highlighting the importance of promoting responsible content curation to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all patrons.
225	3202	2	3	"Books that are found offensive should not be taken off library shelves. Books, whether fiction or non-fiction, tell stories that are important for understanding history and society. While some books may contain content that some individuals find offensive, it is essential to uphold the right to access information and knowledge.  Removing offensive books limits the freedom of readers to choose what they want to read and learn from. Historical books, even if they touch on controversial topics, play a crucial role in educating people about the past and preventing the repetition of mistakes. It is important to distinguish between reading for enjoyment and reading for understanding, as offensive content in historical context serves a valuable purpose.  Works like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"" tackle sensitive subjects and societal issues that may be offensive to some readers. However, these books are celebrated for their contributions to literature and the insights they provide into complex themes. By censoring such works, we risk losing valuable perspectives and lessons that can only be found in literature.  Preserving the availability of all types of books in libraries ensures that diverse voices and experiences are represented. If we start removing books based on individual sensitivities, we set a dangerous precedent that can lead to censorship and the restriction of knowledge. A library without a variety of perspectives and challenging content is not fulfilling its purpose as a hub of learning and exploration.  In conclusion, the presence of offensive books in libraries should be upheld to protect the freedom of readers and promote a comprehensive understanding of the world. By allowing access to diverse viewpoints, even those that may be discomforting, we enable intellectual growth and critical thinking. It is essential to defend the right to access information and resist censorship in order to maintain a vibrant and inclusive literary landscape."
226	3203	2	3	I believe that libraries should have more censorship. Some books, magazines, and movies should be removed or grouped by age. From my own experiences of reading or seeing people read these books, I believe they should be removed because they influence violence, sexual activity, and drug use. Young children should not be exposed to those things yet.   First, I think books that contain violence should be removed. I believe that children are the easiest people to influence. I also believe that violence is the worst thing to be influenced by. Violence in books can influence killing. Fighting and killing is not good. No young child should be able to check out a book full of shooting and fighting. The book will make the kids think that's the right thing to do if they are able to check it out. Being influenced by violence will make you commit crimes. Reading a book is not worth going to jail for.  Next, I believe that all sexual activity material should be removed from libraries. Sexual activity should not be exposed to children until it is time for them to start learning about it. For example, a young girl reading about teen pregnancy not being a problem. The reader will think that is what she is supposed to do, which is wrong. Books and magazines containing sexually explicit words should not be able to be viewed by young children. Those things influence kids to do things they should not even be thinking about doing. You can at least sort them all in an adult section.  Finally, drug use should not be issued in books to kids. Children should not read or watch anything that talks about drugs in a positive way. Unless it is about saying no to drugs and not using them, children should not read them at all. Drugs make people do things that their right mind doesn't want them to do. Children should say no to drugs and to books that are influencing the opposite.  In conclusion, that is why I believe that we need censorship in our libraries. We need censorship because of violence and drug use. Also, because of sexual activity and many more things.
227	3204	2	3	"Dear newspaper and staff,  It has come to my attention that there is a discussion regarding the removal and censorship of certain books in many community libraries. I believe that this is unacceptable as it may lead to the suppression of important historical and societal information that is crucial for current and future generations to understand.  For instance, a book that holds personal significance for me is ""A Child Called It"", which sheds light on the hardships and abuse faced by a child. Such books not only provide valuable insights but also help readers develop empathy and awareness about issues like slavery, abuse, war, and discrimination that continue to prevail in society today.  Censoring or removing these books is counterproductive as it hinders our ability to learn from the past and address current challenges effectively. By being informed about these issues, we can strive to prevent history from repeating itself and work towards creating a more inclusive and just society.  When it comes to movies, I believe that while some level of censorship is necessary to protect viewers from offensive or discriminatory content, age-appropriate ratings and parental guidance can help regulate access to such material. Movies with sensitive themes should be clearly labeled and restricted to ensure that viewers are adequately prepared for the content they are about to see.  In conclusion, I urge for a thoughtful consideration of the importance of preserving open and honest content in libraries and media, while also ensuring that appropriate measures are in place to regulate access to potentially harmful material. It is essential for us to strike a balance between freedom of expression and responsible consumption, especially when it comes to sensitive and contentious issues.  Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.  Sincerely, [Your Name]"
228	3205	2	3	Everyone today gets offended daily, so encountering offensive material in a library is not uncommon. However, there are individuals whose minds remain unpolluted by such content and deserve the right to keep it that way.  One potential solution to this issue is to introduce a rating system for books and magazines, similar to that used for movies. Materials rated for adults could be placed in a designated area of the library, while lower-rated content could be displayed publicly. This way, those seeking explicit material can access it without exposing those who prefer not to see it.  Another approach could involve removing censored material altogether. Such content can have a negative impact on the mind and soul, leading individuals to unproductive behaviors. By eliminating offensive material, libraries can encourage visitors to engage with more meaningful and enriching literature, fostering a more productive society.  Ultimately, libraries must decide how to address this issue. They can maintain the status quo, segregate offensive material, or opt to remove it entirely. By taking action to minimize offensive content, libraries can create a more welcoming environment for all visitors and potentially increase attendance rates. This, in turn, may lead to a more positive and productive society for future generations to admire.
229	3206	2	3	I have heard from my family members about finding offensive books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries. While they felt tempted to remove them, they recognized that others may not find them offensive and should have the chance to read them. Personally, I have also encountered offensive material in libraries but chose not to remove them, understanding that censorship would limit access to diverse content. In conclusion, while it is natural to be offended by certain materials, it is essential to respect the diverse preferences of library patrons and not support censorship in libraries.
230	3207	2	3	Should certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. Books, movies, magazines, music are made to relay a message, express a point of view, or to perhaps state an opinion, of which everyone has a different point of view. No, books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores. All of the previously listed things are rated. Movies are rated G through NC-17, books are rated child through adult, and music if explicit has a parental advisory sticker, so just follow the ratings. If a four-year-old tried to buy two tickets to see a rated R movie, the theater would not sell him the tickets because he is not yet of age. People often bring up the point of maybe a child picking up an adult book or magazine in a store and beginning to look at it and read it. The solution to that problem is simple - create a separate room in stores that sell these items and label the room as the adult section. Have cameras nearby so if a youngster feels brave enough to tempt fate, they will be caught, or just put a desk out front of the adult section and require an ID for entrance. These are still books which are expressions of a person's dreams, hopes, desires, fantasies, and heart; they should not be denied their dream because a person deems it unfit. And most importantly, if it offends you, don't read it. Simply follow the rating rules, take necessary precautions, and if all of these rules are followed, then businesses and libraries should have no problem keeping everybody safe and happy.
231	3208	2	3	If I could remove anything from shelves of libraries I wouldn't. Would you rather your kids to learn things from the facts or learn from friends? Censoring books, magazines, movies, etc and what goes onto the shelves are mostly for enjoyment or informational. Granted you wouldn't want a five-year old reading a book made for adults, but with age kids would have to learn things. You can't always control what children read unless you plan on going with them everywhere including college and on into their adult life. Books provide facts and more reliable information than what you can hear from people. If all the books on the shelves relating to drugs or alcohol were pulled off, how would someone write a report on those things. The books were created to provide people, kids especially, with facts that no one else could share and it could help with expanding their vocabulary and knowledge. If someone were to find a book or a @CAPS1 offensive, they don't have to look at it or even pick it up. Libraries can't always suit everyone's tastes and something you @MONTH1 find offensive isn't to others. Taking a single book from the shelves would result in others taking books off the shelves and then no books would be left for anyone to read or wish to take off the shelves. If you controlled what everyone read, no one would be happy and their brain wouldn't function correctly. You'd be taking one of their rights, one of the only things entitled to them without someone else telling them they can't. What kids read is shaping their minds for their future. If you removed their favorite series or genre from the shelves, they wouldn't read or listen to music or anything anymore because it isn't enjoyable. Kids get into reading when they can enjoy what they read or listen to. So with that, I wouldn't take anything off the shelves because everything appeals to someone in one way or another. Controlling what one person reads doesn't lead you nor the other person anywhere, someone could end up being offended if you take something you find offensive off the shelves, and you can't stop the knowledge that books can provide people if they read them. In one way or another something provides information for people.
232	3209	2	3	Hi my name is @PERSON1 and I have a couple topics that I would like to talk to you about. I have been hearing a lot of people talking about libraries taking a lot of their stuff off the shelves. Well, I think that libraries around the world have a lot of information inside of them, and if we started taking information out of them, then what would be the point in having them? I believe that everything in libraries is very important, and it's hard to know if everyone wants this to happen.   One thing that I don't think libraries need is movies because pretty much every movie has a book that goes with it or is similar in content. Moving on to the topic of offensive content, I believe that everyone should be mature about negative things people may say, even if it is hurtful. By reading what people say about them, individuals may become desensitized and care less about hurtful comments over time.  Overall, my message to the world would be not to be offended by what people say to you. It's important to develop a thick skin and not let negative comments affect your self-esteem. Ultimately, it's crucial to prioritize the value of libraries and the wealth of information they provide, as well as maintaining a resilient attitude towards criticism.
233	3210	2	3	You have to admit that while you may want your kids to have freedom, not all of them are responsible enough to handle it, especially when it comes to schoolwork. As a teenager myself, I know that no matter how much you lecture them about responsibilities, they will still find ways to do what they want. This is why certain distractions need to be taken away to ensure that they focus on what truly matters during their teenage years, which is their education.  If schools allowed offensive or inappropriate materials in their libraries, students would easily become distracted. It's not just about sexual content; it's about anything that could divert their attention from their studies. While you may hope that they would save such materials for home and prioritize their schoolwork, the reality is that teenagers will often choose immediate gratification over long-term goals. They would rather indulge in gossip magazines than concentrate on their assignments.  Schoolwork should be the primary focus for teenagers while they are in school. If they want to read magazines or engage in other leisure activities, they can do so at home. Offensive books should not be available in school libraries as they only serve as distractions. However, public libraries are a different story.  In a public library, nothing should be censored because individuals visit voluntarily for various reasons. Whether it's for research, pleasure reading, or any other purpose, people should have the freedom to access a wide range of materials. It ultimately depends on the individual's responsibility to stay focused or get distracted, as both teenagers and adults utilize public libraries for different purposes.  Responsibility is crucial for everyone, especially teenagers. Therefore, while offensive or inappropriate materials may not be suitable for school libraries, they should be allowed in public libraries. Equal rights and freedom are essential, but when it comes to education, it's vital to minimize distractions and prioritize academic success. Schoolwork plays a significant role in shaping teenagers' futures, so it's important to maintain a conducive learning environment without unnecessary disruptions.
234	3211	2	3	All people have the same right to read, listen, and watch different materials without being censored by others. Each individual should have the freedom to choose what they consume, as censorship can hinder personal expression and limit intellectual growth. What may be offensive to one person may not be to another, and it is essential to respect individual differences in opinions and preferences.   Censorship restricts freedom of speech and inhibits creativity, as it imposes restrictions on what people can access and engage with. It is important to uphold the right to freedom of expression and allow individuals to make their own choices regarding the media they consume. By embracing diverse perspectives and allowing for open dialogue, we can foster a more inclusive and tolerant society. Let us continue to defend our right to access a variety of materials and reject any attempts to censor them. Our freedom to express ourselves is a fundamental right that should be upheld and protected.
235	3212	2	3	Censorship limits what people can read, watch, and listen to, ultimately depriving individuals of the freedom to choose their own entertainment. If libraries and other institutions censor materials based on the preferences of a select few, it sets a dangerous precedent that undermines the diversity of preferences and tastes in society. Instead of catering to the minority who may find certain content offensive, it is important to prioritize the rights of individuals to access a wide range of materials that cater to their unique interests. By allowing people to freely choose what they want to read, watch, and listen to, we uphold the principles of freedom of expression and individual autonomy. Censorship only serves to restrict creativity and limit the cultural enrichment that comes from exposure to a variety of ideas and perspectives. In conclusion, censorship is not the answer to addressing differing opinions and preferences, and it should not be used as a tool to control what people can access in libraries and other public spaces.
236	3213	2	3	I believe that some materials are offensive to some people, but that shouldn't give them the right to take them off the shelves. People can easily overlook offensive materials and not read them. Magazines with people's faces on the cover can be particularly invasive and inappropriate. Katherine Paterson's quote about wanting to remove books from shelves to prevent children from reading them is misguided. Libraries are meant to be a resource for learning, and taking away books limits access to important information and perspectives. It's important to allow children the freedom to choose what they read, watch, and listen to, as this can help them figure out their own paths and values. By censoring materials, we may be depriving them of opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Let's trust individuals to make their own choices and learn from a variety of sources.
237	3214	2	3	Censorship in the world we live in today is a very interesting concept. With the advent of social media, we now have thriving communities of people that want their voice to be heard, and people are listening. We now are able to tap into the huge amount of knowledge from people all around the world, allowing us to see what is really happening in countries like @LOCATION2, where media is considered treason. What do we do now that governments are starting to censor the internet? Let's start by looking at an argument that has been long talked about: library censorship.  Today, it is almost a requirement for cities to have public libraries to be considered as real cities. Public libraries, and the funding they require, are not anywhere within the @ORGANIZATION1. Even so, they have taken a place in our neighborhoods that has made them indefinite sources of knowledge and culture. One public library @MONTH1 be a source of; historical town records, children's books, novels, research papers, non-fiction books, fiction books, magazines, and many other types of entertainment and knowledge. Public libraries are, even with the widespread usage of the internet, important places for us, as residents of a city, to socialize and learn.  Libraries today @MONTH1 carry books that were in the past on the 'banned books' list, but that does not mean books are not being banned from libraries. Libraries are generally family institutions, and as being funded by the public, required to adhere by the moral and ethical standards of those who live in the area. This means that there is not one, 'national banned books list', but there are many discrepancies throughout @LOCATION1 in banning books. As culture moves more and more into more and more questionable materials, libraries are faced with a tough decision; keep up with the times and have more questionable and controversial reading material, or get lost in the past and try to cling onto the senior generation to stay alive.  Bringing new literary materials into the library that are fresh and new means that more people will return to the library again, be it young adults or older adults trying to get in touch with the current world. One major controversy of books in public libraries is the inclusion of sexual intimacy. As a new generation sprouts, fed with music lyrics by such names as; '@ORGANIZATION2', or '@ORGANIZATION3', we enter a new age where younger and younger kids are learning about sex. The authors of today have recognized this and have started to include references to sexual intimacy, but not detailed encounters. I believe this is fine, because as we move on in generations we are going to find out that education about sex; safe sex, birth control, @CAPS1 prevention and testing, is much more important than trying to keep children ignorant. Keeping these young adults involved in books and trying to continue their learning outside of school is a much larger issue we should be trying to tackle instead of trying to create silly arguments against new reading material in a public library.  Public libraries are the centerpiece for learning outside of school in many communities, small and large. Knowing this, how could anyone truly believe that it would be smart to stop including new books that would entice new patrons? Even as a commercial business, this would make no sense, simply turning people away because you have a single view of what the future is and you refuse to listen to anyone else's opinion of the future. So why is there a question on including new knowledge? Isn't it obvious that we, as a nation, should show the world that we aren't living in the past. That we are indeed the future of the world, and that our young adults will receive the best education in the world by not only learning in schools, but by being the most active readers, and by extension, learners in the world. In conclusion, it is vital to embrace new knowledge and diverse viewpoints in public libraries to ensure the continuous growth and education of individuals in our society.
238	3215	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be removed from shelves just because they are offensive. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to someone else, and individuals have the right to choose what they want to read or watch. However, if the content is extremely inappropriate, it should be restricted to adults only. Overall, I think that everything should be available on shelves, with appropriate restrictions for certain audiences.
239	3216	2	3	Libraries are a place that provides people of all ages the opportunity to access a wide range of books, movies, and music for free. While adults have the freedom to choose their reading material, it is important to consider the potential impact on children who may come across inappropriate content. Books, being read privately, can be easily separated from children's reach, but movies and music, being more public, pose a greater challenge.  Books offer a private escape into different worlds, and individuals should have the freedom to choose their reading material without restrictions. However, it is crucial for libraries to ensure that adult books are kept separate from children's sections to prevent accidental exposure to unsuitable content.  In contrast, movies and music are more challenging to control, as they are often viewed or heard in shared spaces. Children may inadvertently come across adult material, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, libraries should consider either removing inappropriate content or keeping it well away from children's areas to protect their innocence.  In conclusion, while libraries should uphold the principle of providing access to diverse content, it is essential to safeguard children from exposure to inappropriate material. By strategically organizing and managing adult content, libraries can continue to serve as welcoming spaces for all ages.
240	3217	2	3	"Whispers and comments fill the room as people move throughout the library, critiquing books and materials neatly stacked on shelves. Some believe certain materials are offensive and should be removed, but I strongly believe there is no right to argue about what should be censored in libraries.   As Katherine Paterson's passage mentions, ""And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" Everyone has a unique perspective, and what one person finds offensive, another may not. This diversity of viewpoints is important in a library setting, where materials should be available to cater to a wide range of interests and beliefs.  I once encountered books and magazines in the library that addressed the impact of slavery on colored people. While some may find these topics uncomfortable, others may see them as important reminders of our history. Censoring these materials would limit the opportunity for discussion and reflection on important issues.  Libraries are public spaces, but that does not give individuals the right to censor materials based on their personal beliefs. Instead of removing materials, people should focus on selecting items that align with their interests and values. Allowing for a variety of perspectives ensures that libraries remain inclusive and informative spaces for all.  In conclusion, it is important to consider the implications of censorship in libraries and respect the diverse viewpoints that exist within society. By preserving a wide range of materials, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for education and exploration."
241	3218	2	3	I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed from the shelves. What may be offensive to one person may not come close to being offensive to another. There are many different types of materials that hold historical significance or cultural value, even if they may be deemed offensive by some. Removing such materials would limit access to important information and perspectives. Censorship in public libraries could lead to protests and hinder people's right to access knowledge. It is important to learn from history, even the dark parts, to prevent them from repeating. Therefore, I stand by the idea that censorship in public libraries should not be allowed.
242	3219	2	3	I believe that libraries should provide any kind of book, magazine, music, and movies to the public, despite if they are found offensive. First, to support my position, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore reads and prefers different types of books and magazines. The same thing applies for watching movies and listening to music. Second, what may seem 'offensive' to one person may be perfectly fine for another, so the term 'offensive' is ambiguous in this case. There is no need for an angry public or strikes. Finally, I believe that the people have a free choice when choosing the types of books and magazines to be read, the types of movies to be watched, and the types of music to be listened to. After all, it is for their own benefit, entertainment, and learning. So, libraries should not have anything offensive removed from their shelves that are found offensive.   First, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore prefers different types of materials provided by a library. For example, one person may like to read philosophical books, and the other may like to read romance comedy books. If the philosophical books were to be taken off the shelves by the library officials, then the person who likes philosophy will not have anything to read. Yes, there are magazines available and movies to watch about philosophy, but they are experienced and learned differently than reading a book by a certain author. I had an experience similar to this with my friend. She preferred horror movies, and I historical. The horror movie she was looking for was not in the library, and later it turned out that the library did not have any kind of horror movie because they weren't popular in that city. My friend was not happy. The library had historical movies, but I ended up watching that by myself. So, libraries should not have to take away any sort of material that might be offensive to the public.   Second, the term 'offensive' in this case is ambiguous, meaning that it has multiple meanings. What may seem 'offensive' to one person may not seem offensive to another. An example: a sports magazine cover may be offensive to a child because of the picture and 'adult' words for the child. However, that same cover may be interesting to a young adult because he may be into surfing, suntanning, or volleyball. Offensive is only used in the first part, but not in the second, and the same material was used. So, should that magazine be removed? I don't think so. The solution is for the child to look at Kid's Magazines, Teen Vogue, or Teen magazines. The library should provide a section for kids so that they can read appropriate material.   Finally, I believe that people have a free choice when choosing the books to read, the type of movies to watch, and the types of music to listen to. They should be allowed to do this because of their differences and their definition of 'offensive'. People should not be forced to read the same type of book, to watch the same type of movies, or to listen to the same type of music. They should have a choice of choosing the materials provided by the library which corresponds to their personalities. After all, the materials they see, read, or listen to is for their own benefit, their own learning, and for their own entertainment. The main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer.   In conclusion, I believe that libraries should not take off any material from their shelves that are found offensive. This is due to the different people, the ambiguous term for 'offensive', and for the sake of human flourishing. Libraries are for studying, learning, and entertainment in a quiet, peaceful place. They should not discourage people to discontinue learning about the world because that would lead to a bigger and more serious worldwide problem: the lack of education.
243	3220	2	3	I believe that censorship in libraries is not the solution to dealing with books that some may find offensive. People have the right to choose what they want to read, and just because someone dislikes a particular book does not mean that it should be removed from the shelves for everyone else. It is important to respect the diverse preferences and opinions of readers, and banning books only limits access to literature that others may find valuable. Instead of censoring books, individuals can choose not to read certain materials that they find objectionable. Ultimately, the freedom to choose what to read should be protected, allowing everyone to explore a wide range of perspectives and ideas.
244	3221	2	3	Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I do not believe that. Simply because if one person is offended by a book and or materials in a library someone else will argue because they like the thing that was taken out of place for that person's beliefs and values. I believe that if you don't like what is in the library you go to then don't go back, or just keep to yourself at least don't make a scene. There are a lot of racism being thrown around in books and songs and magazines but nobody takes that away. You just don't listen to it or you don't read it. If you would like to protest something that isn't in your beliefs or something that offends you, then go right ahead. It's good to defend yourself.  I remember when I was about 11, I went to a hotel in Dallas with my family and a family friend. And the guy my dad invited to come was Mike. He isn't racist but he does joke about how people dress and he sometimes gets out of hand with his comments on the racist names, but we tolerate him. So we go to check in at the hotel and the check-in/check-out person at the counter was a young black girl. We pay for our room with no problem and we stand there patiently waiting for Mike to step up and ask for a room. My dad asked him what he was doing, because he was just standing there looking at the person behind the counter. Mike looks at us and smiles, then he pulls out a pamphlet from his shoulder bag and hands it to the girl behind the counter. I have no idea what the pamphlet said or what kind of pictures were on it, but when he handed it to her she dropped it, looked up at him with tears in her eyes, and flipped him off then walked to the back and got this man.  As this rather large man walks around the counter towards Mike my father steps in the picture. My dad starts to talk to the guy but he doesn't seem to notice my dad because he was so focused on Mike. Mike says, 'Look I was only kidding with the girl, she needs to learn how to take a joke.' My mom takes me and my brothers up to our room and tries to get my dad to come with us instead he promises us he'll be right up.  A good half an hour later my dad comes through the door with Mike close behind. I asked them what was on the paper he handed the lady, and my dad says it was an AIDS pamphlet he got from a rest stop. I looked at Mike and I said, 'Did you give that to her?' His reply was well a lot of people have AIDS but it's kind of an inside joke about 'blacks' and AIDS. So I just didn't really pay much attention to him anymore and I talked to my dad. My dad said the reason she got so upset was because her mother died from AIDS just a year ago. Which of course Mike never knew about all that. But I'm sure he learned his lesson. He should have just left her alone.  So you see these things are a problem but nobody removed us. We stayed there all weekend. Of course, her and Mike exchanged some hateful looks but we looked past that, and she moved on with her life. I still don't think you should have to remove something just because someone else doesn't like it.
245	3222	2	3	I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. It is important to consider the impact these materials may have on young children and other individuals. If a particular item does not contribute to learning or education, it should not be readily available. It is essential to separate adult content from materials intended for children. Violent content should be carefully considered, as children are already exposed to a significant amount of violence in today's society. Only materials that contain educational value and promote positive growth should be displayed on shelves for easy access.
246	3223	2	3	There are different types of books, movies, magazines, and tape recorders in libraries. Books can be fiction or nonfiction, and what may be offensive to some could be harmless to others. Thus, libraries should not remove items from their shelves based on potential offense. Customers are the ones who choose which books, movies, magazines, or tape recorders to check out, not the authors. People should have the freedom to decide for themselves what they want to read or listen to.   Furthermore, just because something may offend one person does not mean it should be removed for everyone. Historical events, for example, are important to learn about even if they may be uncomfortable for some. It is up to the individual to decide if they want to engage with certain material. If a child checks out a book that their parents approve of, the responsibility lies with the parents, not the library.   Libraries are meant to provide a variety of materials for people to explore, and removing items based on potential offense would limit the diversity of perspectives available. Complaints can be addressed, but censorship is not the solution. People have different tastes and interests, and libraries should respect that by keeping a wide range of items on their shelves for all to enjoy.
247	3224	2	3	Censorship in libraries plays an important role in protecting children and young adults from accessing inappropriate content such as violence, offensive language, and pornography. While censorship is necessary to ensure a safe and appropriate environment for all library users, it should only be implemented when needed. Parents also play a crucial role in monitoring their children's access to certain materials, as excessive censorship can hinder access to important information. When managed properly, censorship can be a powerful tool in creating a positive and enriching community. Ultimately, a balanced approach to censorship is key to maintaining a healthy and supportive environment in libraries and beyond.
248	3225	2	3	Some of the most interesting books that I have ever read are offensive in some way. I have even read excellent books that offend me. If we didn't have books and stories that offend us, then we would never really find out what offends us. That is why I don't think books, magazines, music, or anything of that nature that may be found offensive in some way should be removed from the shelves.  If you think about, almost all books can be offensive or hurt your feelings. It just depends on how you feel about what has been written. Something that is offensive to one person or a group of people may not be found offensive by another person or group of people. If we took all the books off of the shelves that someone said offended them, then there would be no books left.  Writing is something you do when you want to express how you feel, or tell a story about yourself or someone else. Some authors may do this in a very offensive manner. Others may try to sugar-coat how they feel about a person or certain idea. Either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive.  In conclusion, I feel that books that are found offensive or hurtful should be left on the shelves because, if we took all of them off, there would not be a very wide selection of books left.
249	3226	2	3	Many places display and sell offensive material, which can be found almost everywhere. While some may try to shield their children from it, the reality is that if kids are determined to seek it out, they will find a way. Not all offensive material should be removed from shelves, as some content may not be universally harmful. For instance, music with explicit lyrics may not necessarily warrant removal, as it is a personal choice whether to listen to it or not.  In contrast, movies may require age restrictions due to their potentially offensive content. However, individuals still have the choice to watch them or not, and should not complain about their offensive nature after making the decision to view them. Books, on the other hand, may be more contentious, as some authors may incorporate their own offensive beliefs into their writing, influencing readers.  Ultimately, the decision to engage with offensive material should be left to the individual, as warnings are typically provided for such content. It is important to recognize the distinction between choosing not to consume certain material and being outright prohibited from doing so. Each person has the autonomy to decide what they expose themselves to, and this choice should be respected.
250	3227	2	3	Censorship in libraries is not a good idea because it limits access to a variety of books, music, and other materials that may contain offensive language or themes. While some parents may have concerns about their children being exposed to such content, it is important to remember that these materials can also provide valuable lessons and perspectives. By censoring library collections, we risk depriving people of important educational opportunities and the freedom to explore different viewpoints. It is essential to allow individuals the choice to decide what they read and listen to, rather than imposing restrictions based on personal preferences. Ultimately, censorship in libraries hinders intellectual growth and limits our ability to learn from a diverse range of voices and experiences.
251	3228	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a very controversial issue. Many argue that it is necessary to protect certain groups from offensive material, while others believe it goes against the fundamental right to freedom of speech. However, censorship should not be practiced in libraries for several reasons. Firstly, all individuals have the right to freedom of speech, and censoring materials limits this right. Authors also have the right to express themselves and have their works acknowledged by the public, regardless of differing opinions. While censorship may be necessary in some cases, such as protecting children from inappropriate content, it should ultimately be left up to individuals to decide what they want to access. Parents should have control over what their children can access, but adults should have the freedom to make their own choices. Ultimately, censorship in libraries should be minimal, with individuals being able to access a wide range of materials to suit their own preferences.
252	3229	2	3	Have you ever been looking for a book only to find it banned from all local stores? Well, I haven't had the misfortune of being in that situation, but I could only imagine the distress of wanting but not finding that controversial book. I believe that young adults should have the freedom to read any book or news article they wish. While some may find certain books offensive or disturbing, it doesn't justify banning them completely, as there may be someone who could benefit from the information within.  It's important to remember that what one person finds offensive, another may not. While some books may not be suitable for younger children or sensitive individuals, most adults can handle a wide range of content. However, there are extreme cases where even adults may find certain books too difficult to read.  In the end, I believe that individuals should have the choice to decide for themselves what they want to read. We live in a free society, and a little controversy over a book should not be a major issue. Hopefully, in the future, we can move past the overreactions to offensive material and allow all books to be available to those who wish to read them. Let's strive towards a day where no book is banned, so that everyone, including our children, can gain the knowledge contained within those pages of paper.
253	3230	2	3	I believe that censorship of books, movies, and other forms of media is unnecessary because people have the right to access information and make their own decisions. It is important for individuals to learn from history through books and other resources to prevent similar events from occurring in the future. Libraries serve as a place for freedom of information and exploration. People also have the right to know about current events and issues through newspapers and magazines, as this knowledge can help them understand and possibly avoid similar situations. Ultimately, individuals should have the autonomy to choose what they read, watch, and learn, without restrictions imposed by others.
254	3231	2	3	"I can think of several books that I would not want a child of mine to pick up and read. One that comes to mind is called ""She Took the Blame."" The story revolves around a young girl who grows up without a father and embarks on a journey to find him. Throughout the book, she grapples with the pain of abandonment and the desire to reconnect with her father. The emotional turmoil and sense of loss depicted in the book may be too heavy for a child to handle. As a parent, it is important to consider the emotional impact that certain books can have on children and ensure that they are ready to process such themes. Children deserve to feel loved and cared for, and exposing them to stories that delve into complex family dynamics may not always be in their best interest. It is crucial to prioritize their emotional well-being and provide support and guidance as they navigate their own experiences. Ultimately, the decision to allow a child to read a particular book should be made with their best interests at heart."
255	3232	2	3	I do believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., can be offensive if they are not appropriate for the intended audience. Libraries often have sections designated for different age groups to ensure that individuals are exposed to content that is suitable for their level of maturity. It is important to be mindful of the type of material we are consuming and to choose items that will enrich our minds with knowledge. Therefore, it is essential to select materials that are age-appropriate and align with our personal values and beliefs.
256	3233	2	3	Censorship in libraries restricts the freedom of access to various forms of media, including books, magazines, and movies. When materials are censored, individuals are deprived of the opportunity to explore different perspectives and ideas. This can hinder the exchange of information and limit the diversity of content available to the public. Additionally, determining what is considered offensive enough to be censored is a subjective matter, leading to potential inconsistencies and further questions about the boundaries of censorship. Ultimately, censorship in libraries undermines the freedom of expression and the dissemination of diverse viewpoints. It is important to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and allow individuals to access a wide range of materials without unnecessary restrictions.
257	3234	2	3	A library is a sanctuary for those seeking solitude and peace while engaging in research or reading. The removal of certain materials from libraries should not be based solely on individual opinions. Everyone has the right to access the thoughts and ideas of others that are preserved in written form.  While some materials may be deemed offensive by certain individuals, they may hold value for others in terms of research or leisure reading. Removing materials simply because they are considered offensive by a few would deprive those who need access to that information. Consideration should also be given to the effort and dedication authors put into creating their work. How would they feel if their best piece was removed from shelves due to its perceived offensiveness?  It is important to recognize that media reflects society as it is, including diverse perspectives and beliefs. While certain materials may not align with the beliefs of some individuals, they may be crucial for others as part of their livelihood or intellectual exploration. Limiting access to materials in libraries would impede the free flow of information and ideas that are essential for a vibrant and informed society.  In conclusion, the materials found in libraries are the essence of our collective knowledge and identity. Restricting access to certain materials would hinder intellectual growth and understanding. It is crucial to uphold the principles of free expression and diverse perspectives by preserving a wide range of materials in libraries for all to access and explore.
258	3235	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic that raises questions about freedom of expression and the right to access diverse viewpoints. While some may argue that offensive material should be removed to protect individuals from harm, others believe that censorship limits intellectual freedom and stifles creativity. It is important to recognize that offensive material can be subjective and what may be offensive to one person may not be to another. Therefore, it is crucial to trust individuals to make their own choices about what they read and view. By allowing for a diverse range of perspectives and ideas in libraries, we promote critical thinking and open dialogue, enriching our society as a whole. Ultimately, censorship in libraries would only serve to restrict access to valuable literature and hinder intellectual growth. It is essential to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and allow for a variety of voices to be heard in order to foster a thriving literary community.
259	3236	2	3	Books, books, and more books. There are so many of these spine-bound papers, filled with everything from basic information about life, all the way to stories that capture the minds of faithful readers and take them to far-off distant worlds. If we were to take all the books in the world and line them up in a perfect row, we would be able to create a bridge of knowledge and information far enough to stretch around the moon twice and back. The problem is, that with all of this information and knowledge, there are young minds that are not yet ready to soak it all up. There is no such thing as bad information. There is only people who are not yet ready for the information they are about to obtain. So should these materials that open up doors to new mindsets, and feelings such as books, music, magazines, and movies be censored? That answer is yes.  First off, there is a certain degree of modesty and curiosity that needs to be kept in children. Children need to have a hunger for knowledge to become great learners, and intelligent minds. If the information given to them does not come in the chronological order of importance in which it needs to, this will poison their minds and twist them into something they were not yet ready to become.  Secondly, information presented to kids too early can harm them physically. Children are born with the instinct to repeat what they observe. This is a primal instinct that humans will forever have, and is essential for living life. So take movies for example. If a child watches movies that involve sexual themes, and actions, this can be very harmful to them physically. If a child experiences these things too soon, they will want to simply repeat what they saw. Then what is next? The answer to that question is easy. There will be more teen mothers than there are needed.  Lastly, premature information can harm mentally. Take music for example. Music is an even larger gateway to mental damage than movies are. This is simply a result of bad censorship. Many think that music is not as bad as movies because you cannot see anything visually, but they are wrong. Music is even worse because children can picture whatever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics. There needs to be tougher restrictions on music. Restrictions such as age for purchase should be raised. That is about the only way that explicit content can be blocked.  In conclusion, there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials. But I do not believe that the materials that can be harmful or offensive should be removed as a whole. Simply because adults do have the right to view these materials. Libraries around the world need to better their restrictions, even laws to stop poisoning the minds of our young. We people as a whole need to come together to make this happen. After all, the children are the future of our world.
260	3237	2	3	I believe in the freedom of speech and the ability for people to express their thoughts and opinions. However, when it comes to inappropriate material that can be accessed by younger children, I do think that there should be some level of censorship. It is important to protect younger individuals from being exposed to content that may not be suitable for their age. Overall, while I support freedom of speech, I also believe in the importance of ensuring that certain materials are not readily available to children.
261	3238	2	3	I honestly don't think anything offensive should be removed from libraries, children don't really know what those offensive things mean. The library is the only good place to find information or to find a book that they enjoy. If you take things that seem offensive to people; people are going to have a hard time finding any facts or anything they need. People use offensive things all the time but not everyone means to insult anyone in any way. The library doesn't intentionally insult people. The library just gives us facts about what we need to know about a person or anything like that. Some people don't know how to be mature when it comes to things like that and if they can't be mature about stuff like that then they don't need to be in the library. I would understand if the intentions were to insult someone but they're not so why should the magazines, movies, books, and music be taken out of the library. That's just not fair to others when they are trying to get some information. Slavery is an offensive thing to colored people because the colored people get called names that I will not say in this essay. Most people have matured over the years about what happened in the past. Honestly, I think people will be okay they don't need to get all bent out of shape because they see something offensive they just need to know that it wasn't intentionally done.
262	3239	2	3	I strongly believe that books with offensive content should be removed from library shelves. It is not acceptable for children to be exposed to material that contradicts the values and lessons that parents try to instill in them. Just like we teach our kids about the dangers of smoking or drug use, we should not allow media to glorify these harmful behaviors. When books, movies, or music portray offensive or dangerous actions as acceptable, it can influence impressionable minds in a negative way.   For example, reading a book that promotes racism or derogatory language can be hurtful and damaging. If readers internalize these messages and believe them to be true, it can lead to conflicts and division among people. It is essential for libraries to consider the impact of the material they provide to the public and ensure that it aligns with promoting respect, understanding, and positive values.  While some may argue that freedom of speech allows for the inclusion of all types of content in libraries, it is crucial to prioritize the well-being and safety of individuals. Offensive material can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, discrimination, and negative behaviors. As a society, we must be vigilant in promoting positive messages and discouraging content that can incite division and harm. Removing offensive material from libraries is a step towards creating a more inclusive and respectful community for all.
263	3240	2	3	What I think about all of this is that I really don't care because that is who I am. It's up to the parents if they want to remove books off the shelf if they believe that certain material such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed. I don't think a book will ever really hurt anyone; it's just a book and doesn't really matter.   If there are things that kids shouldn't know about, they should be placed in the adult section and not in a place where they can easily find it. They shouldn't put things that children shouldn't know about in the kids section. As for movies, I don't see why they should be removed. Parents have the ultimate say in what their children can watch, and some movies are appropriate for kids.   I don't know if there is bad music in the library, but I don't see rap or explicit content in the library. Overall, I believe that censorship should be minimal, and parents should take responsibility for what their children are exposed to. Letting children explore different types of media can help them learn and grow.
264	3241	2	3	Yes, I think they should remove offensive books from the shelves because young children who read these books may be influenced in the wrong way. If these books contain violence, children may start to believe that such behavior is acceptable. It is important to protect the minds of young readers and provide them with appropriate and positive content to shape their beliefs and values. Therefore, removing offensive books is essential to safeguard the moral development of children.
265	3242	2	3	Censorship is a big controversy in modern society due to the fact of so many opinions being conveyed through all the new medias in the modern world. When a person has a veiw they tend to want to share it with the world or defend it againts those who opose their opinion. Some people do not always like what is being said or take offense in the way it is presented, thus causing the government, or any authority, to remove or replace these words, photos, lyrics, or film from a select public, such as children, or the entire public. This is censorship and it has caused many debates over what is acceptable in society's media. I believe censorship is wrong. It violates the @CAPS1 peoples' rights of free speach. When a person has an opinion, they have the right to voice it anyway they want. The authorities should not be involved in what someone writes, sings, creates, etc., in anyway. Censorship takes away from the integrity and purity of a human's thoughts. Who is to say what can and can't be said? Do we just let the government tell us what we can say and what is illegal? Do we stop expressing ourselves in the way we desire because it is not appropriate? No. We, as the people, must be free to say what we want in our stories and songs, along with movies and other media. If a person does not like what they see then they can turn away or they have the right to speak out against it in their own way; but they do not have the right to opress. They should write back, convey their message and try to win support, not control. Censorship is not good for any society. People want to say whatever they want and they have the right to. Censorship is not a solution to discrimation or anger, it is only a fuel. If parents do not like something and do not want their children to experience it then do not take it from them, then they should tell them how it is 'wrong' and give them their opinion and reasons so the child @MONTH1 descide what they believe in on their own. An opinion is every human being's right and it belongs to them, not the authorities.  In conclusion, censorship restricts freedom of speech and limits the expression of ideas and opinions. It is essential for individuals to have the right to express themselves without interference or control from authorities. Instead of censoring, open dialogue and communication should be encouraged to address concerns and disagreements in a respectful manner. Each person has the right to form their own beliefs and opinions, and censorship undermines this fundamental right.
266	3243	2	3	People have different opinions on whether censored books should be allowed in public libraries. Some argue that people have the right to choose what they read, while others believe that libraries should be safe spaces for all ages. Personally, I believe that parents should have the right to protect their children from inappropriate content. Children can easily be influenced by what they read and hear, so it is important to monitor what they have access to. In the end, books should be censored to ensure a positive and safe environment for all readers.
267	3244	2	3	Some books are not suitable for kids, prompting the need for a designated section for adults in libraries. These books would not be censored, but access would be restricted to individuals over a certain age, unless approved by a parent or guardian. While some adults may not monitor their children's reading material closely, it is essential for libraries to consider the appropriateness of content for young readers. I recall instances from elementary school where I unknowingly read adult books, which could have had inappropriate content. Establishing an adult section in libraries would prevent children from accessing material that may not be suitable for their age. This practice should be implemented in all libraries worldwide to ensure that young readers are exposed to age-appropriate content, fostering a safe and conducive reading environment for all.
268	3245	2	3	I think as long as the book isn't offensive or inappropriate, people should continue to read it. However, if a book contains offensive content, it should not be read as it goes against moral standards. Similarly, music with bad language should be removed from shelves to prevent children from being exposed to inappropriate words. It is important for parents and teachers to ensure that the media children are exposed to is suitable for their age and development. By monitoring the content of books and music, we can create a more positive and respectful environment for everyone.
269	3246	2	3	I do believe that certain materials, such as pornographic content, should not be openly displayed in public libraries or places where young people can easily access them. It is important to consider the impact that such material can have on children and the values that we want to instill in them. As a society, we should be mindful of the content that is readily available and ensure that it aligns with the moral and religious beliefs of individuals. While adults have the freedom to choose what they view, it is crucial to respect the boundaries and sensitivities of others who may not wish to be exposed to explicit content. Ultimately, it is essential to promote a respectful and considerate environment for all individuals, especially when it comes to potentially harmful materials that can influence young minds.
270	3247	2	3	I believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some of my reasoning is very logical and if you were a reader I'm sure you want to read something that's true and very interesting. Libraries all consist of books from everything you can think of. Libraries are really for learning and not to offense anybody in any manner.  The reason why I believe they should not be removed is that everybody is equal and not everybody likes to read the same books. There should be offensive books because I think that there are just too many kids that would not like to grab a book and it be original and not offensive about them in some way. Books are created to read and have interest, laughter, enjoying. From some of the students at my school I spoke with said that when they are really having a bad day they turn on their music and it helps them because it makes them feel a lot better and the day gets easier for them. They say they don't have to be depressed or thinking about something that made them mad that day.  Well as in from my experience with books I can tell you somethings and sometimes that when I was feeling down how I grabbed a book. The first time I realized books are really helpful and I'm also talking about magazines, music, and movies. Well to be honest, I'm not a big reader. I enjoy listening to music because sometimes songs can relate to you and make you feel that you're not alone. Also, it helps you learn how to cope with some things that you could have never coped with before because it makes you feel relaxed. Just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book.  So my point is that you know and I know that there are music out there that is very offensive and some books that are. Does it drive us crazy that they do? No, it does not because it actually helps us. It helps us by showing us a way out from our daily stressful lives and sometimes you learn in books and songs of how other people deal with their stress. So you learn a lot of things than feel offensive about books or music. As you can tell I'm a huge music fan and there has been lots of songs that were offensive but it did not bug me much.  I hope I gave you some kind of shock that music and books shouldn't be removed if offensive. It's just music is amazing as well for books we all need our space sometimes and those two things are just there for us which is either to help us learn or feel relaxed and calm. Thank you for reading this and I hope I persuaded you enough with my reasoning. Remember music and books are a lot of fun and if you never gave it a chance, you should try it sometime. That's the end of my conclusion.
271	3248	2	3	No, I don't think books are offensive in libraries. Movies are a different story, especially if they are rated @CAPS1. Children under the age of eighteen should not be able to rent these movies without parental approval. This is why our public library should not have rated @CAPS1 movies. While browsing the movie selection, I encountered a young boy holding a rated @CAPS1 movie. I was surprised that his parents allowed him to watch such content at his age. This incident highlights the need for stricter regulations on movie rentals at libraries.  Another issue that should be addressed is the presence of magazines like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 in libraries. These magazines, particularly swimsuit editions, can have a negative impact on young readers. Seeing unrealistic body standards in these magazines can lead to body image issues and eating disorders in impressionable individuals. Therefore, it is important for libraries to remove magazines that promote unhealthy body ideals.  In conclusion, it is crucial for libraries to reconsider the content they offer to the public. By eliminating rated @CAPS1 movies and magazines like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6, libraries can create a more positive and safe environment for all patrons, especially children and teenagers. If you share these concerns, I urge you to contact your local library and advocate for a more responsible selection of materials. Let's work together to ensure that libraries remain places of education and inspiration for everyone.
272	3249	2	3	"There is a type of boundary that restricts readers from gathering knowledge about certain things in books. This is called censorship. However, what you may not have known is that it is thought about in every school and every public library. What would you do if you saw your child reading a book that contained frightening descriptions that are too horrific or too adult-like for their own good? This is the question that plagues them every year with new shipments of books. Although that seems terrifying, it is not right to take books off the shelf for a few reasons: the congressional law allowing us to have freedom of press, freedom of thought, and the fact children must take in all the knowledge they can to be the best they can achieve.  First of all, the argument that can be held is the freedom of press. This law was enacted in the time of and is still in effect today. If an individual wanted to write a book that was not for children, then he or she can do so without penalizations. Children may read it, yes, but that shouldn't be blamed on the author. If so, then that person would never get any royalties for their story and no money to support themselves. It's hard to get upset with your children for learning something wrong, but it's not right to blame the writer.  When it comes to the arguments of what to do on censorship, the freedom of thought pops into most minds. This is another law that says citizens are allowed to think as they will of anything. Just as the freedom of press, an individual can pick up that book for adults and read it, no matter the age they are. If they are discouraged by it, then by all means let them put it down. However, if they enjoy the read and the more unique wording than in children's novels, let them continue learning.  A child can absorb many things and recall them at times where adults sometimes cannot remember. This is not scientifically proven, but when you are around children constantly, you notice this. Just as a baby's mind is a sponge, it still continues to gather all of the information it possibly can during its pre-teen years. When they are allowed to read any book and not sit in front of a television screen all day, they learn more. Now someone can come along and say: ""What if the book is a fantasy?"" It's no different. The storyline is not what teaches them; it is the words and how they are used that is knowledge. An educated man can sometimes get tongue-tied with words, whereas if someone who did not do well in school or college read quite a bit, they are able to use words with great ease. It is not always the case, but wouldn't you like your own child to sound intelligent while speaking during important events?  All in all, it seems to be a great waste when censoring books for the public. There can be great things in those books that not everybody can reap. Pulling them off the shelf could mean that you impede someone's ability to learn a new word or grammatical law. If one parent could pull a book off a shelf, then another could do it, and soon you would not have any books. It would be a scary day if that happened, for it would not be something that went well in our history. Since humankind has had writing, we became more intelligent. Taking books off all of the shelves would revert us to primitive beings. So keep the books on the shelves even if children should not read them, not just because they can learn far greater with a book as a resource, but because the two congressional laws say it should be."
273	3250	2	3	Some books in libraries offended some people. But other people want to read this book. None persone have right to say this book offended me so should the libraries removed it. If some book offend soome person that dosn't me all the people will offend by this book.My opinion is they should not removed this book, because some people like to read that book. If some one don't like this book and this book offended them.They shold don't read this book and read what they like. but son't say should be removed this book. I think evey one like different books. So should the libraries but every thing the people like read it.
274	3251	2	3	If everyone in the world could permanently take a book, movie, music, etc., off the shelf because they think it is offensive, would there be any of those things left for us to enjoy? I personally think that if people could do that, they would. But is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you? No, it might not be. So, does that give that person the right to pull it off the shelf permanently so no one else can read it? I think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of their own opinion of it.  If anyone could do that, would there ever be uniqueness in people? I don't think there would be. Just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same. Thus, it shouldn't be taken away from that person if he/she enjoys listening to it.  On the other hand, I understand that some people might listen to music or read books that have offensive language and that they would not want their children hearing or reading that, but that does not mean the music or book should be pulled from the shelf. Ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language, what should we do then? You can't just take that person out of the world.  So, I guess the point I'm trying to get across is that just because you think it's offensive and don't like it doesn't mean everyone in the world thinks that. To end my article, I want you to think about what's offensive to you may not be the same for others.
275	3252	2	3	The contents of the books in libraries vary in many ways. Some are children's books, some are adult books, and some are in between. Libraries have books that spark interest in a reader. Not all books are made for a particular age group or gender. Which should not mean that a library should be picked apart because of the contents of the novel, magazines, music, or movies. A library is supposed to be for anyone that enjoys reading a variety of materials, not just a select few because some people don't like the text or the meanings behind that book, song, or movie.  In the library, in our little town, splits up the variations of the reading materials, music, and movies. There is a children's section that has all the books we all grew up with, in half the building. Also, an adult section for larger novels topics that teens and younger children would have no interest in or their parents would want them reading. Another great thing is that they have books for people in between, like myself, with teen books that spark our interest.  With the ideas that people are writing about today, we cannot possibly control what comes to their minds. Some of the greatest books that are out probably have the deepest meanings that some audiences don't prefer to listen to. But that is what is so great is that people have the liberty to go and find a book, or a magazine, or even a movie that they like. When freedom of what you read is taken away, readers will stop reading. Doesn't the administration of schools want kids to read to get their test scores up? If you take away what they like to read, doesn't that mean they will stop reading? Also, doesn't that mean the test scores will go down?  In my experience, topics that I have read about have been more grown up than my mother would like, but the fact of it is that people will read what they want. People don't like to be told no in my personal experience. Taking away topics that are well-liked even with words or contents of what they are reading is not fair to the readers. I believe that they should not censor books, music, movies, magazines, etc. because that would mean the libraries would be gone.
276	3253	2	3	If something offensive is found at the library, it should not be taken off of the shelves. While some may find certain items offensive, it is important to remember that everyone has different tastes and interests. Removing offensive items could limit the diversity of materials available and discourage authors and creators from sharing their work. It is important to respect the varying perspectives and preferences of library patrons and allow them the freedom to choose what they want to read or view. By keeping offensive items on the shelves, the library can continue to serve as a place for people to explore different ideas and perspectives. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide what they want to read or view, and the library should strive to provide a wide range of materials to cater to the diverse interests of its patrons.
277	3254	2	3	Censorship, or the removing of material deemed inappropriate or offensive, has been used as a means of controlling people's thoughts and feelings for many centuries. The @ORGANIZATION1 used it in the @CAPS2 colonies during the @CAPS2 @CAPS4 to keep the colonists loyal to the crown. The @CAPS5 used censorship not just during the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 as a brand of propaganda, but also during @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS11 under @CAPS12 guidance. Censorship is still in use in the @LOCATION1 today, as a way to 'protect the children'. The @ORGANIZATION1 tells the @CAPS2 public what we can and cannot watch on television and what we can and cannot listen to on the radio. Other organizations tell us what books we can and cannot read, what video games we can and cannot play, and what items we can and cannot buy. Such organizations, I believe, are pushing the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 and other freedom-loving nations to the edge of totalitarianism.     As Katherine Paterson stated, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' If one person has the right to control what we buy, what we listen to, and what we see, then how come we don't have that right to control the same things for them? Where do we draw the line? Eventually, all books, movies, magazines, music, and video games would be deemed offensive and inappropriate. Culture would slowly wither and die, and our lives would become drab and essentially useless, for lack of a better term.     I recently read a book titled '@CAPS14', by @PERSON2, about two periods in a boy's life: his childhood with his family in tribal @LOCATION2, and the life he had after his mother's death in the @CAPS15 capital of @LOCATION3. @PERSON2's work includes some passages that are less than angelic, and, had strict censorship been in place, these passages would have caused the book to go unpublished. @PERSON2's work gave not only myself but a multitude of others insight into the life that @CAPS16 face in the changing landscape of their @CAPS7, and it certainly made me realize once again that I have a life rich in family, friends, and comfort.     All in all, censorship is a horrid disease that slowly infects and consumes every part of our lives. If you get to censor something you find offensive, then why don't I do the same thing? Some censorship is good, and a fact of life. But we have to ask ourselves, where do we draw the line? Where's the boundary between safety and and outright police state? Censorship is just a fancy term for blatant disregard of the @CAPS17, as freedom of speech is guaranteed for all @CAPS2 citizens. As a famous colonial revolutionary once said, '@CAPS19 me liberty, or @CAPS19 me death!' If censorship continues to grow and our libraries grow emptier and emptier, then I shall take death over liberty, for liberty with censorship is no liberty at all.
278	3255	2	3	If any book, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be offensive to anybody don't even bother to look at the material. Even if you might find it interesting, in then end you find out that it is offensive to you then just take it the other direction. No material of books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the materials because authors, directors, and music writers have made it their creation. Nobody has the same views as everybody else, each person is different in their own way. Then why is it so bad when they have offended you if it wasn't intentional? Each individual has their own opinion of each material. It might be offensive to somebody else, but to another person it might not even effect their views about what they've read, seen, or heard. Others @MONTH1 have to realize that even if its written down it is not directed towards the person reading it, if they have tooken it the wrong way. Even if your just making an observation just walk away and do not let it get the best of you. Don't let anybody tell you different of your own opinion. The cenorship in libraries are not made just for you, they are made for everbody around you. If you do not like a book in the library or even think it is inapropriate then just walk away and put it down. Anything in the library shouldn't be removed, just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that somebody else will find it interesting. If you find any material offensive then maybe you should think in your head of ways to make an argument to prove the authors that they are wrong. You just have to be strong and take anything that comes your way, and you have to be ready for it. I go to the library once in a while,and most of the time i'm just looking around for something to read and I find something interesting and I pick it up. Once I start reading it, and if I feel the type of material is directed towards me and I find it offensive I just leave it along and put it down. I don't take it the wrong way because I know it isn't a serious type of matter, because it didn't have my name in the book. So, why should I get worked up about it if it isn't about me? I don't take any type of material that I'm looking at in any negative way because I know that someone else's opinion and not my own. If anybody takes it the wrong way then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic. Anybody should know that your own opinion matters than anything else or anybody else. The littlest things shouldn't get to anybody, especially if it doesn't matter. It doesn't change how you feel about the topic. The way you feel about it should not affect the way other people feel see it.
279	3256	2	3	I myself believe that censorship in libraries should not be allowed. If there is to be any censorship, it should be from the parents of a child, or if you are not a child, then you do not need to be censored. By censoring something as small as books, movies, and so on, I think it will give people a false sense of reality. Just because something is not censored does not mean it should be taken out of context either.  Think of it like this: if you are walking down a street, people will say bad words, show bad habits, and even witness death or more. Being a kid who has never been censored from anything, including books, I have learned a lot. If I went to a library to get a book and it was censored or taken off the shelf, then I would be shown a fake world. Once again, if life cannot be censored, then we should not censor anything else.  A censored book, movie, or whatever it may be could also determine how much someone could learn from it. People go to libraries to learn hard facts with proof and evidence, depending on the subject they are looking up.  These are some of the many reasons I think censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Censorship should be chosen by who you are, not by other people. In the end, we will never know what is better until we try.
280	3257	2	3	No because the writer is explaining the way the story really happened. If your kid asks you about the word, tell him/her it is not a good word to say. You can take the book back and get him/her a new one. If your child comes home from school and says a curse word, ask where they learned it from. If they say the teacher said it, you can tell the teacher you don't want your child reading that book. Cursing is a way of explaining the story better to them, I guess.
281	3258	2	3	Library censorship is a topic that sparks debate among library-goers. Some believe that libraries should have strict censorship guidelines to ensure that inappropriate material is not accessible to children, while others argue that libraries should provide a wide range of materials without censorship.   One argument in favor of censorship is that certain materials, such as explicit magazines or movies, should not be readily available for children to see. These materials can be offensive or inappropriate for young audiences, and it is the library's responsibility to ensure that children are not exposed to such content.   On the other hand, some argue that censorship limits freedom of expression and access to information. They believe that libraries should be open spaces where individuals can explore a variety of viewpoints and ideas, even if they may be controversial or offensive to some.   Ultimately, the key to finding a balance between censorship and freedom of expression lies in proper organization and separation of materials. By clearly dividing sections for different age groups and ensuring that explicit materials are not easily accessible to children, libraries can provide a diverse range of materials while still protecting young audiences from inappropriate content.   In conclusion, while censorship in libraries can help protect children from harmful material, it is important to find a balance that allows for freedom of expression and access to information for all library patrons. Proper organization and oversight are crucial in ensuring that libraries remain inclusive and informative spaces for all.
282	3259	2	3	I don't see any reason to remove books from library shelves. If someone doesn't like a book, they can simply choose not to read it. Books serve the purpose of entertaining and informing people, even if they may contain controversial or uncomfortable topics. Libraries exist to provide access to a wide range of materials, and limiting that access goes against their fundamental purpose. Ultimately, libraries should be able to offer a diverse selection of books to cater to the varied interests and preferences of their patrons. After all, people have the freedom to choose what they want to read, and libraries should uphold this principle by offering a wide range of materials without censorship or restriction.
283	3260	2	3	'@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 I like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and I can not lie, when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste and a round thing in your face you get sprung.' @CAPS2 song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men. While '@CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' tells us that love can be found anywhere. Now look closely at both lyrics you will eventually see a connection in both. The rap song @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is about a man that finds love in large gluteus maximus while the other says that love can be seen everywhere, and anywhere.  To say that music, magazines, books, and more should be banned is to say that throwing an @CAPS6 flag on the floor is just okay. Banning books, music, etc. is like censoring someone's imagination and creativity. It is like the book @DATE1, where @CAPS4 @CAPS8 is watching, and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read and even think. Taking away movies and books is not allowing people to learn from their past.  Take @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for example, though that movie is rather gory and morbid, it still tells us of the horrors of the time during @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 and that the past should never be let go. Always remember the past so you can learn from it. Had that movie been censored or removed, I personally would have never learned about the hard times of the @CAPS13 and what it can do to a person's soul and emotions.  A book, magazine, movie, etc., are all gateways to new worlds, where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is. I can say that books and songs have saved lives. The other day a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong. I was @NUM2 at the time, and I rushed through my iPod to find a song '@CAPS14 to @CAPS15 a @CAPS16' by the @CAPS17. I basically read him the lyrics and he eventually put the idea of suicide away.  While yes, there are songs & books like The @CAPS18 and the @CAPS19 that @MONTH1 have provoked people to do crazy things, even to kill. We still see more good being done and shown through reading and writing. Because they are all ways to express ourselves. A song can @CAPS15 a @CAPS16 as much as it can take one away. Even then we can see that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get censored. If a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away, it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more, it would be craved because it is an unreachable thing. In conclusion, censorship of artistic expression limits creativity and the exploration of diverse perspectives, ultimately hindering personal growth and understanding.
284	3261	2	3	The world today in the United States is hardly free. Everything that we see, hear, and read is censored. Is this good or bad? For the most part, it is good. Adults, teenagers, and young children all should only be allowed access to certain types of movies, music, books, magazines, radio stations, and so on. I don't believe they should be removed, but I do believe these materials should have limited access. Some materials are kind of hard to keep from children and teenagers, but I believe what is kept from children is up to children's parents to say whether or not the children can watch, look at, or listen to whatever it may be that is considered offensive to some people.  Parents should definitely be the ones to censor what children watch, see, hear, or read. Children, for the most part, don't know any better. Children are curious little beings. If there is something that a parent has laying around the house that the child has never seen before, that child will immediately wonder what this material is. If it were a magazine, they might look at it. I believe that there is a certain age to be allowed to look at these things because there are a lot of materials in this world that are meant for adults only.  In conclusion, not everything should be censored. The materials children see and hear are up to parents. People will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to. This is America, let's not be overly strict about things.
285	3262	2	3	Almost every person in the world has heard, said, or seen something that they shouldn't have. Most hear curse words before they can even walk. If you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries. After all it is a public place where anyone can go to read in peace. Children learn new words all their life and are bound to come across some that shouldn't be said. Yet, most will and see what happens and learn from it. If you take out things like that in the books they read, then how will they learn? The books that children read vary. The younger kids won't know what bad words are until they get older. The books that older kids read often have words in it to display a serious part of the story, or a tragic moment in the character's life. Authors usually vary their vocabulary in the stories that they write. If they are writing about a specific time period, why would they try and clean up the grammar that was spoken from that time and change what the reader might think about that era? Leave the libraries' books on the shelves no matter what is in them. Kids always see and hear something offensive no matter how hard their parents try. Books use words to display important parts of a story and our history. Books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in.
286	3263	2	3	Censorship of books is a contentious issue that raises questions about freedom of expression and individual rights. Author Katherine Paterson aptly points out that censoring books can lead to a slippery slope where eventually no books may remain on the shelves. This is a valid concern as it goes against the principles of the constitution, which guarantees citizens the freedom of the press. Allowing censorship would not only violate this fundamental right but also raise questions about who gets to decide what is deemed acceptable or not. It would lead to a society where self-expression is stifled, and individuals live in fear of being judged for their choices. Ultimately, it is crucial for us to embrace diverse perspectives and try to understand different viewpoints, as this is essential for a harmonious society.
287	3264	2	3	I believe that everyone has the right to choose what book should be banned from their children, but not from the public. Everyone has their own beliefs in what they read or watch, so the library is perfect the way it is. We cannot throw out books we find offensive because of our beliefs, as someone else might want to come along and read about a certain religion or topic. If we threw out all the books we didn't like, we would be in debt because then we'd have to build libraries for everyone instead of having one place where we can all enjoy our favorite books. If we have a problem with a book or movie in the library, we should just keep our children away from that item and inform them why they should not be subjected to it.
288	3265	2	3	A very wise man once said, 'The only way to escape temptation is to remove the temptation altogether.' Growing up in a challenging environment filled with poor influences, the individual faced numerous temptations to engage in immoral behavior. Despite the lack of positive examples and the prevalence of negative influences, they managed to steer clear of vices such as drugs, violence, and pornography. As society has evolved, the individual's parent expressed concern over the increasing exposure of youth to explicit content in various forms, including in public spaces like libraries. The parent highlighted the need for stricter control and monitoring of materials available to children, emphasizing the importance of creating safe environments free from inappropriate and harmful content. Parents should be able to trust that public resources are safeguarding their children from exposure to immoral and potentially damaging material, allowing them to feel confident in their children's safety and well-being. In a world where negative influences are becoming more pervasive, it is crucial to take proactive measures to protect and nurture the innocence of young minds.
289	3266	2	3	When I was in seventh grade, I had a mission to read every @PERSON1 book I could get my hands on. However, some of the material in her books was deemed too racy for most middle schoolers, leading our school librarian to ban them from the library. While I was initially upset by this censorship, I now understand the importance of restricting certain books in school libraries.   Books with mature content, whether it be sexual or violent, can be inappropriate for young readers who may not be ready to handle such subject matter. Parents often want to preserve their children's innocence for as long as possible, and having explicit books in school libraries can go against their wishes. Additionally, some graphic novels depicting violence serve an important purpose in educating young readers about the harsh realities of war, and should not be censored for this reason.  In contrast, public libraries cater to a wider audience, with separate sections for children and adults. Adults should have the freedom to access any type of book, marked as mature, in order to make informed decisions and expand their knowledge. While private libraries may have more control over their collection, government-funded libraries should prioritize education and access to information for all citizens.  Ultimately, the purpose of libraries is to educate and inform the public. Censorship in school libraries may be necessary to protect young readers, but in public libraries, adults should have the freedom to choose their reading material, even if it contains mature content. By allowing access to a diverse range of books, libraries can fulfill their role in promoting literacy and knowledge in society.
290	3267	2	3	"In my opinion, books should not be censored, as they should be read in the way the author intended. While I understand the need to censor songs and movies for public consumption, books should be allowed to remain in their original form. Controversial books often contain important messages and should be accessible to all readers. These classic works were written with the language of their time, and altering them would diminish their impact. Authors like Harper Lee in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" use language reflective of the era in which they wrote, and this should be preserved.   It is acceptable for songs and movies to be censored for radio and theater play to adhere to regulations. Artists may choose to modify their work to reach a wider audience, as seen in the example of changing lyrics in songs like ""@CAPS5 You"" by @ORGANIZATION1. These alterations do not fundamentally change the message of the piece and allow for broader reach.   Movies, like songs, may require edits for theatrical release, but these can often be restored for home viewing. The essence of the film remains intact, even with minor changes for public consumption.   While opinions on censorship may vary, I believe that preserving the original intent of an author's work is essential. Authors and artists create with a specific vision in mind, and altering their creations can dilute their impact. It is crucial to respect the creative choices of these individuals and allow their work to be experienced as intended."
291	3268	2	3	Books, magazines, and other forms of media may sometimes contain content that offends certain individuals. However, the presence of offensive material should not warrant the removal of these items from libraries. In fact, having access to such material can be beneficial in helping individuals learn about topics they may not be familiar with and in promoting self-control and awareness. By exposing readers to challenging or uncomfortable subject matter, books and magazines can actually serve as a tool for education and prevention. Therefore, rather than censoring these materials, libraries should consider reorganizing their collections to accommodate the preferences of all patrons. Ultimately, the availability of diverse content in libraries can contribute to a stronger, more informed community.
292	3269	2	3	Typically when you walk in to a library there are books, magazines, movies, and cds everywhere. Most of the items in the library are appropriate for children, but some are for adults and teenagers. Many people struggle with the fact that there are items in the library that are offensive to religion, have offensive language in them, or contain adult materials. In this country we have a freedom of speech and a freedom of religion which allows us to choose things that we feel are correct in certain situations such as this one.  True, there are books out there that are very offensive to certain types and religions of different people. Have you ever seen or heard of a movie that was educational yet offensive? In my opinion people should have the right to censor what the library provides for their student or child, to a certain extent. If a book or magazine or whatever it may be is offensive to someone, I believe that they should be able to choose if their student or child gets to look at that certain item. People should not take this censorship ability out of hand.  I believe that our generation is much different from ones in the past because most of the things we have to deal with are things that are most likely offensive to a certain religion and or type of person. Which in a sense is hurting the censorship of all the people who choose to take part in it. I believe that a person or authority figure at the moment should be able to take a book off the shelf if and only if they request it to the library and they approve of it.  People have the right to do what they choose, but taking away other peoples chances to read a book, or check out a movie is going a little far with that censorship privilege. I think that when a person feels that an item in the library is offensive they should have to sign a piece of paper stating why they think it should be taken out of the library and the people you believe it is offensive towards. In doing so I believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people.  All in all, I believe that the censorship in libraries is a spectacular idea because of all the bad things in the world that come out in books, movies, and cds. People have the right to change things if they believe they are wrong. They should jump at the chance if it comes to a point where they can change things for the better! Do you believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea? I do, because it gives people the opportunity to change and make things better for themselves if they believe something is offensive.
293	3270	2	3	I think that censorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere. If you do not like something said or seen in some of the materials, then do not read or watch or listen to any of them. People have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about. Some people might like rap music but other might like rock music. People that like rock music might not like rap because of some of the language used in songs. This is why some people listen to other types of music and do not listen to the type of music that they find offensive. I like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive. I have had a lot of family members say that I shouldn't be listening to such music because of the language.  Some people say that reading certain things is a preference, but what if you are sitting in a doctor's office and you would like to read a magazine that is just sitting around. If you start going through the magazine and find something you do not like or take offense to, either keep flipping the pages or put the magazine down. You have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive. The best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you. Magazines can have all sorts of stuff hidden beyond the pages, but sometimes you have to look at the cover to see what some of the things that are written in the magazine. Sometimes this can help you decide on whether or not to read it.  Movies are always fun to watch no matter what occasion. Some people like certain movies such as action, comedy, romance, or drama. Some people might not like action due to the fact that there is violence in almost all of those movies. Some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor. There are just a lot of types of movies out there and it's not the producers' fault that we do not like it. People make different movies because everyone is not alike. Some people might get offended by some of the contents of a movie, and what you could do to help with that is just by reading into the movies before seeing them. I think that censorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies are liked by different people everywhere.
294	3271	2	3	Censorship of books, music, movies, magazines, etc., is a contentious issue. While some argue that offensive content should be removed from shelves, others believe in the importance of freedom of expression. It is essential to consider the impact of censorship on individual perspectives and the broader societal discourse. Ultimately, finding a balance between protecting sensitive audiences and preserving creative freedom is crucial in navigating the complexities of censorship in various forms of media.
295	3272	2	3	Libraries offer a wide variety of books, CDs, movies, and magazines for people of all interests and ages. While some materials may be considered offensive to certain individuals, it is important to remember that everyone has different preferences. It is ultimately up to each person to choose what they want to read or watch. By respecting individual choices and understanding that not everything will appeal to everyone, library users can have a positive experience while exploring the diverse range of materials available to them.
296	3273	2	3	I for one believe that censorship of books, movies, music, and other forms of media is not beneficial, especially when it comes to sheltering children. While it is important for parents to monitor what their children are exposed to, completely shielding them from the realities of the world can have negative consequences. Children will inevitably come across mature content at some point, and it is the responsibility of parents to guide them and help them understand what they see and hear.  By allowing children to explore media and literature that may contain more mature themes, parents can facilitate important discussions about right and wrong, as well as the complexities of the world. This approach can help children develop critical thinking skills and a better understanding of the society they live in.  I believe that censoring everything only hinders a child's ability to learn and grow. It is essential for children to be exposed to a variety of perspectives and experiences through media and books in order to develop empathy, critical thinking, and a broader understanding of the world. Instead of censoring, parents should focus on being present and available to answer questions and provide guidance when needed.  In conclusion, sheltering children from media and literature is not the answer. It is important for parents to be actively involved in their children's lives, guiding them through the complexities of the world and helping them navigate the content they encounter. By allowing children to explore and learn from a variety of sources, parents can help them develop into well-rounded individuals who are equipped to face the challenges of adulthood.
297	3274	2	3	In our world today, libraries serve as a valuable resource for individuals seeking a wide range of materials. These buildings offer a vast collection of books, movies, music, magazines, and internet access to the public free of charge. While some may argue for the removal of offensive materials from libraries, it is important to recognize that what is offensive can vary greatly from person to person.  Libraries already have measures in place to ensure that children have limited access to potentially inappropriate materials. For instance, materials are organized by age group, with separate sections for kids, teenagers, and adults. Additionally, movies and music have ratings that restrict access to content deemed unsuitable for certain age groups without parental consent.  Attempting to remove all offensive materials from libraries would significantly limit the resources available to the community. It is crucial to maintain the current structure of libraries, which provides access to a wide range of materials while also implementing safeguards to protect younger patrons from exposure to inappropriate content.  In conclusion, libraries play a vital role in providing access to information and entertainment for people of all ages. By maintaining the current system of organization and restrictions, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for the community without compromising the principles of free access to information.
298	3275	2	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper, or to whom this article @MONTH1 concern.   It has become quite aware to me the problem we face in our media today. Information and how individuals seek it has evolved and is still changing at a rapid pace. Technology and new information are so vast it's extremely difficult to censor.  Two weeks ago, I took my @NUM1-year-old niece @CAPS3 to our local public library to find her a book. Once the automatic doors to the library opened, she darted straight to the movie section. I couldn't help but laugh because I knew that's why she truly wanted to go to the library. When I asked @CAPS3 what movie she was looking at, she turned the cover over with no reservation and said, ""I can't let my young niece watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6."" I thought silently to myself. Then I realized how easy it is for a child to access adult information.  I agree with the statement of @PERSON1 to some degree. I believe if we started taking certain information away completely, we would find ourselves ignorant. But when we let our children, the future of the world, vulnerable to adult information, they are greatly affected. @CAPS9 teens and violent video games, or explicit magazines. For example, my niece is able to check out any book in the library, books like @CAPS10 @CAPS11 famous book entitled '@CAPS12 @CAPS13,' which means my struggle in German. My @NUM1-year-old niece can read quite well and is very impressionable, as are many young children.  Public media outlets need to be more heavily monitored. This includes public libraries, retail stores, the internet, and @CAPS14. I believe books should be censored by content much like movies. This makes the distributor responsible and the consumer more aware of the content and its effects.   In conclusion, it is essential to protect our children from adult content in media outlets by implementing stricter censorship measures. By doing so, we can ensure that the future generation is not exposed to harmful material and can grow up in a safe and nurturing environment."
299	3276	2	3	That saying Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I disagree with that statement. I think it is the government's choice if these items should be taken out of libraries or not. So we will need legitimate reasons to take some books off the shelf.  Some people think we should take books off the shelf that teach the kids our history. People don't have that right to take away from children. In the statement Katherine made, she is supporting that very idea; taking away our kids' right to learn US history. The kids have that right to learn our very own history and some people want to take that away. Then what will our future generation be like. Some kids might not even know who George Washington is or how we got here to this very continent.  Parents also don't want us to read anything in books that have foul language or anything to do with nudity. I see what these parents are trying to do. They are trying to protect their children, but the fact is people are going to have to go through this in life and if they aren't introduced at a younger age what will they do when they are older. Some kids that have that right taken away from will have no idea what to do when they get older and the foul language in the texts of these books put voice into the books. We don't want the upcoming generations to be blind to all of this because it is the real world.  When I was in fifth grade I liked to read a lot. I really liked the adventure books such as the Boxcar Children and books like that. One time I went into the library and I picked out a book about a haunted house. The librarian would not let me check the book out because there were some texts in the book not appropriate for me. That sort of crushed my reading spirit and I really never wanted to go and check out a book by myself anymore. So adults that want to take these books off the shelves you might be stopping our generation from learning and if we don't learn then our next generation isn't going to want to read anything or learn.  These are just a couple of reasons we should not take books, magazines, movies, and music away from us. There are more people out there that have reasons too, so if you want to take this right away from us then be prepared for an argument because we will fight for this right. So you adults who want to take that book off the shelf, you better have real good legitimate reasons to take it off.
300	3277	2	3	"Censorship is a complex issue that can lead to the removal of music, books, and movies from public consumption. However, banning offensive material can have detrimental effects on the artistic expression and freedom of speech. While some argue that removing offensive content protects sensitive audiences and prevents negative influences, I believe that censorship should be avoided for several reasons.  Firstly, suppressing offensive material silences the thoughts and emotions of the creators. Banning works like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" deprives readers of the author's intended message and historical context. By censoring content, we limit our understanding of different perspectives and erode the richness of literature.  Furthermore, removing offensive material sets a dangerous precedent where any work can be deemed unacceptable. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if we continue to ban books, soon there will be nothing left on the shelves for anyone to enjoy. What may be considered offensive today could become accepted in the future, highlighting the subjective nature of censorship.  In conclusion, censorship of offensive material stifles artistic expression, limits diverse viewpoints, and threatens the availability of creative works for future generations. It is essential to respect the freedom of speech and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they consume. If we continue to censor content based on personal opinions, we risk losing the beauty and diversity of the arts that enrich our lives."
301	3278	2	3	Everyone is different and unique in the world and they have their own unique opinions. Which brings us to the arguement of censorship on anything, because what some people find offensive others may not. The censorship that I am discussing is specifically about censorship in libraries. There are three main reasons why libraries should not be censored. The first reason is the books were written so they could be viewed by the public. The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. The final reason is parents can limit what their own children read. The censorship of libraries is an absurd idea, because a few people shouldn't make the choice for everyone.    The first reason that libraries shouldn't be censored is the books were written so they would be read by the public. A library is a public place where people are supposed to get whatever books they choose. If a few people start censoring books then it will set off a chain reaction. After so many different books are censored there will be less books for peole to enjoy. All of the books that were censored were meant to be enjoyed. If books are censored some people may never even get a chance to see those books and they wont be able to learn from them. Books deserve the chance to be enjoyed like they were meant to be enjoyed and if they are censored that chance is gone.    The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. If someone doesn't like a book then they don't have to read it. They don't have the right to go censor that book, because they don't like it. Another person may enjoy that book and many others may like it as well. People should be able to choose what books they want and they shouldn't be told by others what they can and can't read. They need to let others make the decision when it comes to getting their books. People can't go around preventing other people from reading a book that they enjoyed. They need to let others think for themselves and let them read what they want to.    The last reason is parents can limit what their children read. If the parents don't want their children reading something then they can tell their children that they aren't allowed to read it. Other people shouldn't be able to censor a book, because it is innapropiate for children. The child's parents can protect them if they find the book offensive for their children. Everyone needs to worry about what they like and let the other people enjoy what they want to. Let the parents set the limit for their children and it makes life simpler. Also it allows everyone else to enjoy the books if they aren't censored just for children. Parents will worry about their children and adults can worry about themselves.    The censorship of libraries is absolutely wrong and it is also unjust. Somone shouldn't be able to say, 'I don't like this book so censor it.' I will remind you of the three reason why this is true. First the books were written so they would be enjoyed by the public. Also people people have the right to choose what they want. Finally parents can set limits on what their own children read. Books should be left uncensored so they can be enjoyed by whoever wants to read them. Everyone needs to let books be enjoyed by all and they shouldn't take away a books cahnce to be loved by censoring it.
302	3279	2	3	Some people ask, 'Should books be censored from libraries?' It is often parents who believe that libraries contain inappropriate material for their children and advocate for censorship. However, the decision to censor or remove books from libraries should be based on the subject matter of the material. Parents also play a crucial role in monitoring what their children read, watch, and listen to, rather than solely relying on libraries to censor content. Author Katherine Paterson raises a valid point that if individuals have the right to remove books, then there may be a risk of losing access to a variety of perspectives. While some movies may warrant censorship due to extreme violence or gore, it is essential to consider the context in which censorship is being proposed. Magazines and music should also be evaluated based on their content, with inappropriate material being restricted to specific age groups. In conclusion, censorship of books, music, movies, and magazines should be approached cautiously, with a focus on the subject matter and its potential impact. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with parents to guide their children's media consumption choices.
303	3280	2	3	Today I am going to talk about certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Should they be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? In today's world, it is hard to please every living soul. Everyone is going to disagree about something in their lifetime. Life as we know it, everybody lives it in a different way, and in a different place, but everybody has read a book, listened to music, and even read a magazine at a time or two. People interpret it differently than others. Therefore, I personally don't think they should take articles out of the library that you can learn something from unless it's something like pornography, then they should definitely take it out. My conclusion is that you can't please everybody. I think that you shouldn't take things out of the library that can help a student learn.
304	3281	2	3	At a local library, you can find a diverse range of books catering to various interests and preferences. While some individuals may find certain books disturbing or inappropriate, it is essential to recognize that everyone has different tastes and perspectives when it comes to reading material. It is not fair for one person's opinion to dictate what others can or cannot read.  While some may argue for the removal of certain books deemed inappropriate, it is crucial to consider that what one person finds offensive, another may find enlightening or engaging. It is essential to respect the diversity of opinions and allow individuals the freedom to choose their reading material based on their own interests and preferences.  While adult content such as pornographic material should be restricted to adult stores, books containing nudity for educational purposes, such as health-related topics, should be available for those seeking knowledge and awareness. It is important to strike a balance between protecting individuals, especially children, from explicit content while also promoting education and awareness on important issues.  In a society with varying viewpoints and preferences, it is important to uphold the principles of freedom of speech and expression. Every author deserves to have their voice heard, and every individual deserves the opportunity to explore different perspectives through reading. Let us embrace the diversity of literature and allow everyone to find joy and enrichment in the books they choose to read.
305	3282	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3:  I am @PERSON1 and I have heard there has been a discussion about different things in libraries. And I would like to let you know what I think about the whole situation. There are many things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that people believe aren't appropriate. Many people have different opinions than other people. Everyone has a different point of view and sees things differently, especially when it comes to what is appropriate for kids.  I believe if a child comes home with a book, movie, etc. and their parent does not approve, the parent should go and tell the librarian about why she thinks it isn't appropriate. The librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself to see what she thinks about it. If she finds it not appropriate, then she has the right to take it off the shelf.  If the parent talks to the librarian about why something is not appropriate and the librarian believes it is alright, then maybe she needs to just put the book, movie, etc. in a different area of the library. For example, if a little kid finds a book and the parent says it's inappropriate, the librarian could move that book out of the little kid section and put it in an older kid area.  I have actually had an experience with this. At my old school, adults were always complaining about books they didn't think were appropriate. The librarian at the time thought they were appropriate and really didn't want to take them out of the library. So she had a great idea. She took those books, the ones people were complaining about, and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk. If you wanted one of those books, you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book. It was a really good idea because if your parent wouldn't allow you to read them, you weren't tempted to get one, and wouldn't even see them. And the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all.  Another idea I have is if you see a younger kid by older people's books, movies, etc., go talk to them about why they are over there and tell them that's not their age level material. Try to direct them over to their age level area and find them a book, movie, etc. they might be interested in.  I believe that everyone has different opinions, but just because one person complains, it doesn't mean it has to ruin it for everyone. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean everyone else does too. I think censorship should somewhat be in libraries, but not to the extreme. There should be many different topics in libraries so everyone enjoys the stuff there. There should be action, adventure, humor, love, etc. Talk to people and see what they like. Just because one person complains, don't take it out right away because to another person, they might love it. Thank you for taking your time to read my opinion, and I hope I helped.
306	3283	2	3	I think that libraries should not remove music, movies, or magazines from their shelves. These items provide a form of relaxation and entertainment for people who visit the library. Removing them would take away a valuable resource for those looking to unwind and escape from their daily lives. Additionally, keeping these materials available at the library can help attract more visitors and ultimately benefit the library financially. It is not fair to blame children for the removal of books from the shelves, as they are not responsible for such decisions. People, especially children, enjoy visiting the library to read, listen to music, and explore different types of media. It would be a shame to take away these opportunities for individuals seeking solace and enjoyment at the library. Ultimately, removing such items would not only upset library visitors but also potentially harm the library's reputation and services. It is important to consider the needs and preferences of library-goers when making decisions about the availability of books, music, and magazines.
307	3284	2	3	Are you offended when you read a book and your eyes cross over a swear word? Does it bother you to hear them with your own ears? No matter how hard you try, you can not avoid the harsh language of today's society.   Have you ever walked into your library and started reading a book but decided to put it back on the shelf because of the language in the book? Many books in today's libraries have offensive language. Sometimes it gives the book character and makes the story more real to the reader, but in other cases the reader may be offended.   In my personal view, if you do not like the language of the book, put it back on the shelf. The author wrote the book the way he or she wanted it to be written, not the way you would like to see it. Some material may be inappropriate for younger readers. The maturity level of the reader definitely makes a difference when discussing censorship.   For example, I am sure many parents have a problem with the movie 'The Hangover' for its use of alcohol and drugs. Many people find this movie funny and entertaining. Should this movie be taken off the shelves because it does use alcohol and drugs?   These words and actions we try to censor are not going away. We see and hear them in everyday life, no matter where you may be. So if you don't like the language in the book, choose a different one. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide what material they are comfortable with and what they are not.
308	3285	2	3	I think that if certain materials are offensive, they should be taken off the shelves, depending on the nature of the offensiveness. If the material promotes racism, prejudice, or offends women or men, it should not be available for consumption. People should have access to reading materials and media that do not offend or harm others.  Offensive content can perpetuate negative stereotypes and attitudes, especially among impressionable children. Removing offensive material can help prevent the spread of harmful beliefs and behaviors. It is important for libraries to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all patrons.  Additionally, offensive material can lead to a decline in library usage and support. People may avoid visiting libraries that house offensive content, leading to a loss of community engagement and support. It is crucial for libraries to consider the impact of the material they provide and ensure it aligns with promoting respect and understanding among all individuals.  In conclusion, offensive material should be removed from shelves to prevent harm, promote inclusivity, and maintain a positive library environment. Libraries play a crucial role in fostering learning and understanding, and it is important for them to provide materials that do not perpetuate harmful attitudes or beliefs.
309	3286	2	3	There are people who believe that certain materials should be removed from shelves or not even created in the first place. However, it is ultimately up to individuals to decide whether they want to engage with offensive content or not. While some may find certain material offensive and advocate for its removal, others argue that it should remain available for those who are interested in exploring it. It is important to remember that everyone has the right to choose what they consume, and avoiding content that is deemed offensive is a simple solution. Instead of spending time and effort trying to ban material, individuals can simply opt not to engage with it. By allowing controversial material to remain accessible, we uphold the freedom of choice and avoid censorship. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to decide what they want to read or listen to, and taking responsibility for their own choices is key in navigating a world where offensive content may exist.
310	3287	2	3	Censorship in libraries can be a contentious issue, especially when it comes to deciding what material should be made available to the public. While it is important to protect children and young people from content that may be inappropriate for their age, completely removing books and other media from the library may not be the best solution.   One possible approach to addressing this issue is to create an alternative section in the library for material that some people may find offensive. This way, individuals who wish to access such content can do so without it being readily available to everyone. For example, books with explicit content could be moved to this section, along with music albums containing offensive language or themes, and movies with higher ratings.  By implementing an alternative section for controversial material, libraries can strike a balance between providing access to a wide range of content while also respecting the concerns of parents and other patrons. This approach allows individuals to make informed choices about the material they consume while preserving the diversity of literature and media available in the library.
311	3288	2	3	There are thousands of libraries throughout the world filled with a variety of materials for people of all ages. Some argue for censorship in libraries, but I believe that materials should not be removed or censored. If materials were to be censored, the variety available would decrease, limiting choices for individuals with different interests. Furthermore, people should have the freedom to choose what they want to look at in a library, as preferences vary widely among age groups and individuals. Additionally, every item in a library can serve a purpose for research, whether it be for academic projects or personal interests. In conclusion, the availability of uncensored materials in libraries is essential for providing diverse options, catering to individual preferences, and supporting research needs.
312	3289	2	3	In my opinion, no items should be removed from the library because people have various interests that should be catered to. While some items may not be appropriate for children, there are ways to segregate materials to ensure age-appropriate access. Removing items could lead to dissatisfaction among library patrons and potentially decrease overall library attendance. It is important to respect the diverse interests of the community and provide access to a wide range of materials to maintain a vibrant and inclusive library environment.
313	3290	2	3	Books mean a lot to people that love to read. Books have pictures, or they may even be poem books. Some books should not be on the shelves in libraries. They have offensive language and not so well of pictures. They may be learning books, but the little kids do not need to see that. I think books should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Libraries need to up their standards of what should be in the library and what should not. The books, movies, music, etc. need to be in a certain section of the library where the little kids cannot go or reach. A library is a family place, not a fun zone for adults.  On a stormy day, I went to the library with my brother to pick out a book for him. He is only six, about to be seven. He had told me he wanted to get a book about dinosaurs, but I told him to get one on space and aliens. He was very into reading. We were walking down the street when a bolt of lightning struck through the trees. 'Ekkk!' said my brother as he ran around me. We walked into the library, and the old lady at the front desk said, 'there is a huge storm coming.' We sort of ignored her and went on about our business picking out books for my brother. We walked upstairs to the children's section. My brother was looking around, and he said, 'hey, what is this?' as he picked up a naughty magazine. I rushed over to snatch it out of his hands, and he got scared. He asked, 'but sissy, what is that?' I did not respond. I told him to pick a book and come on. He grabbed one, and we were on our way to get it checked out when the lights suddenly went off. It was completely dark. 'Stay calm,' a man said. The backup lights came on, and we all went to the lobby area. We sat there for twenty minutes, and the lights came back on. Everything was normal again, and we went to check out. We got up to the front, and I turned in the magazine that my brother had found. The lady asked why I was bringing it to her, and I had to tell her the bad news that it was up in the children's section. She said, 'oh my!' My brother laid his books up on the counter, and we checked out. We walked out the front doors and were on our way home.
314	3291	2	3	Should public libraries have to censor some of the books, movies, and music they have on display? In my opinion they shouldn't have to. We as people have the right to learn, read, and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us. There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefor, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not throught the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in.   Throughout history, man kind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happend throughout history. With those expierences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensice'.  If you were to try and delete these pieces, one you would be destroying a big part of history, and two there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books.  The second reason is that poeple have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate. While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same rules apply with books and music. It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not.  The third reason is that poeple will expierence all of the things you are trying to hide. If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restraunt, in schools, just about anywhere they are. Taking out the pieces in the library, will be useless in the long run. For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead. In my opinion that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authentisity and effectiveness out of the book. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers.  In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies. If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still expierence 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in and poeple will have to accept that fact. That is why I feel that we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, that way the people reading them might be ready for the real world once it hits them.
315	3292	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine has a good view on the idea of censorship in libraries. Most books have ideas and topics that are offensive to one person or another. I believe that books that have something offensive in them should not be censored. An idea that is offensive to one person may not be offensive to the other, and vice versa. Someone who is pro life on the controversial issue of abortion may believe that a book about a teenage girl getting an abortion is offensive and against their beliefs. In truth, the author was just trying to convey how the teenage girl feels and what happens when you go through with something like that. Katherine Paterson said it well when she mentioned that no books would be left on the shelves. If every person felt threatened or was offended by just one book, libraries would have to close because no books would be left. Books on the topic of religion would definitely have to be censored as well because people of differing religions. The Bible may be offensive to someone of another religion, and because of that the Bible would not be able to be sold. If that happened there would be an ongoing battle about it. Books should not be censored because an idea that is offensive to one, may not be to another. If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall. When authors write books they are pouring their hearts out to us. If someone thinks their book is offensive and it gets censored, the author of the book would be even more offended. Their life's work could go into one book and just because a group of people do not like it, it gets taken off the shelves. I don't know about you but I would rather read a book with an interesting and maybe controversial topic than a book that seems to go nowhere. If censorship in libraries actually happened, many authors may say forget it and not even write anymore. It is very hard to write a book that pleases everyone. Also, attraction to literature would seize. People are not attracted to books that do not have a quality topic that gets them interested. Literature would have an immediate downfall if books were censored. If books were censored, the quality of learning would not be the same. Books are tools for learning and taking them away would be harmful to education. Some teenagers including me may find some of the material they read-even in school-to be offensive or have a touchy subject. I do admit that reading books for class is somewhat annoying at times, but it will help us in the future. These books have meaning, which is why they are picked by teachers for students to read. Something offensive like a cuss word is not going to keep someone from finding the meaning of the book. The quality of learning would not be the same if books were censored. A book can be offensive, yes, but one book is not going to ruin someone's life. An important thing to remember is that by taking a book off a shelf, or not playing music because of a few harmful words is like denying the creativity and compassion of an author or artist. One book that is offensive to one, may not be to another. If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall and the quality of learning would not be the same. For all of these reasons, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.
316	3293	2	3	Recently, the growing issue of censorship in libraries came to my attention. This is unfortunate in the extreme. People have a right to unmolested knowledge and censoring libraries is a direct violation of that right. Libraries are meant to be a place of learning and they should be kept that way.  History is filled with moments both glorious and inglorious. We aren't always proud of what we do or what happens but those events remain, irrespective of whether or not we choose to acknowledge it. To think turning a blind eye to the less than clean will make it go away is not only unrealistic but also totally ignorant of facts.  I realize that there are some things children should not see or hear and I'm not suggesting we expose them to these things. I'm merely saying that trying to hide them from what we deem to be unclean is neither right nor a good idea in general. We can't shelter our children forever and sooner or later they will learn things we wish they didn't. This is inevitable. Life doesn't seek to hide its darker side from us at all and to hide it from our children will serve little more than to handicap them. Do children need to be protected from some things? Yes, for a time, they do but it is the role of the individual parent to protect their child. Protect the children but don't do so at the expense of everyone else.  Why should the views of some hinder all others? Those who would presume to know what people should see and what they should not are out of touch. Those prudish enough to believe that people need to be protected from natural, from history, or from their own desires have no more right, and perhaps even less than everyone else to interfere with individual decision-making. People have a right to make their own choices on what they believe but no right to force those opinions on others.  Censorship in libraries is a hindrance to the free flow of information and knowledge. It restricts access to diverse perspectives and limits intellectual freedom. It is essential to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and resist any attempts to censor information in libraries. Let us preserve libraries as spaces for exploration, discovery, and learning without imposing unnecessary restrictions on the content available to the public.
317	3294	2	3	I believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons. I feel everyone should know the history of the world, which means racism or being offended. I feel if you are reading a book or listening to music and you hear something offensive to you, just turn it off. You aren't being forced to listen or read it, it's your choice.  Libraries should keep the materials because people of the world should know how it feels to be offended. There may be people out there that probably disagree with me, it's just my opinion. You may go to certain libraries in the world that don't allow certain people in because of their opinions on the selection of materials the library offers.  I once heard a woman at a library talking about how she went to the police about someone writing offensive things towards her religion on the internet. What happened to the person but, it's the fact that she went to the police. She could have handled the situation herself, by just confronting the person about it. I feel that the minute she started to read it, she should have turned away or got off the website. It was her decision to keep reading it. I don't see why she should go to the police, if it was just the person's opinion.  Libraries should keep the materials because maybe someone wants to know the meaning of being offensive or being offended. Libraries shouldn't have to hide this topic from anybody. People are offensive because they were raised or just born that way. Some people just have to deal with these people. They might not like it or do somethings towards them in their lifetime but, they have to live with them.  In the end, whether they want to or not libraries should keep certain materials out even if they are offensive towards people. Libraries shouldn't just change their ways for certain people that don't like the materials. There are plenty of people in the world who want to learn more on the topic. These people shouldn't be stopped by the ones who don't like the topic. It's just a part of life.
318	3295	2	3	Should certain materials such as books, magazines, movies, etc., be taken off the shelf in a library if those items may be offensive towards others? There are many possible answers to this question, but I believe that if someone does not like a certain book or finds it offensive they should not have the right to take it off the shelf.  I believe that him/her should not be able to take it off the shelf because if that person finds it offensive, there are others who would not find it offensive. For example, a person might want to read a book about abortion, but another individual is against and offended by that book or subject. If that book is taken off the shelf, it is restricting other people who would like to learn or read about that specific subject.  Another reason why I think that certain books, magazines, music, or movies should not be taken off the shelf is because if one book is offensive to some people, then another book may be offensive to others as well. So, if there are people who find some books offensive, and they are then taken away; there will be fewer books for other individuals to read.  Even though certain books may offend people, I believe the book or magazine should not be removed from the library or shelf. I think that if someone does not like a certain book, magazine, movie, music, etc., that person should not have the right for that material to be taken away. Removing such materials would limit access for others who may want to read or learn from them, ultimately reducing the variety of content available for everyone.
319	3296	2	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1,  I disagree with removing materials from the library. I personally do not think it is the library's fault if someone is offended by books, movies, music, or magazines, etc. If they did not like the book or movie, it is their fault for picking it in the first place. Children under the age of thirteen should not be exposed to inappropriate content, but it is up to their parents to monitor their choices.  Movies that are funny entertain children and teens daily, bringing joy and laughter to their lives. Music is also essential to teens, providing them with an outlet for expression and enjoyment. Books, although not my favorite, hold importance for many people, offering a gateway to different worlds and ideas.  I urge you to reconsider your decision about removing certain materials. It is not the library's responsibility to police what people can and cannot access; rather, it is up to the individuals to make informed choices. Let people have the freedom to choose what brings them happiness and fulfillment.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
320	3297	2	3	There are many books that are not appropriate for children or teenagers, though they can still check the books out in the library. They can take them home, read it, and discover some things that shouldn't be discovered at their age. Children check out rated R movies and rated PG-13 movies and unedited CDs and they learn a lot of bad things or words that they should not use at their age. The libraries are supposed to make sure you are 18 years of age before you check out a rated R movie. Also you have to be a certain age to buy CDs and games that are for the elderly teenagers. You should have to be a certain age to check out or buy a movie or anything that has vulgar language. Today kids aren't as mature as they used to be. Things today are way different. My opinion is that teenagers should have to be a certain age to rent or buy things that are bad but I have read some books that were not really all that great for my age either. I guess it is just how mature you are and ready to accept vulgar things. It should have to be your parents decision to see if you're ready or not. My final conclusion is that it depends on how mature you are and if you think you're ready. The stores and libraries should set limits on books and ages. Although some people will not agree. There should be boundaries for teenagers and age privileges and they should respect them enough not to do them.
321	3298	2	3	Many people base their actions on their own views. What may appear justified in their minds, due to their beliefs, might cause an uproar from others. One instance of this: media censorship. It happens every day, every place. Someone can take it upon themselves to, in their mind, 'make the piece better for viewing'. In reality, though, they are really ruining the experience of the media for everyone else and even impeding on the rights granted to us by the Constitution: Freedom of Speech.  First up, books in the library. Every time I go to the library and pick up some books, there is always one book with the 'bad parts' marked out. Someone had found these words offensive and decided that no one should have to see or read them. To me, it was irritating. I don't always like those words either, but having them marked out is distracting from the page and, for me, ruins the author's voice and style of writing, hence impairing what I draw from the book. Some marked-out words aren't always offensive to others, either. Simply put, if you find the book offensive, don't read it. Others may enjoy it, whether they share your views or not.  People also take the liberty of simply removing whole pieces of media from shelves just because they find it offensive. If everyone removed anything they didn't like, or found offensive, there would be nothing left in the world for anyone to enjoy. We, as citizens, have the right to make our own choices, and our choices should not be limited by the views of certain individuals. That means that if I want to read or view something, it should be available to me, so I can learn and expand my views, even if it makes someone else uncomfortable.  With nearly every disputable form of media that comes out, people harangue the producers and say the piece should have never been made. Wrong. Producers and authors can publish whatever they would like. It's called Freedom of Speech, and it is a right guaranteed to us, as citizens, under the Constitution. Clearly, if pieces like that are being produced, people read it. Plain and simple. You might not, but maybe a neighbor, or even a relative, may be offended by it and might read it. Supply and demand. If everyone found it offensive, no one would buy or read it, and because of that, it would no longer be produced. You would get your way. But, no. Some people do read it and it is produced. Again, if you don't like it, don't read it.  People should not take it upon themselves to censor what others can and can't do, see, or read. If someone wants to read a story that has 'bad words' in it, so be it. Others should not ruin the experience by marking the words out. Not only is it rude and ruining the experience for the reader, but it is also destroying someone else's property. If someone wants to view something that is against a certain religion, so be it. They have the right and no one can take that right away from them. In my opinion, censorship in libraries, whether by government or other civilians, should not be allowed. We citizens are allowed the right to make our own choices and in libraries, the public should be allowed to read or watch whatever they want. Choice is one of the principles of the constitution, and it should be protected, not limited.  In conclusion, media censorship, whether in the form of marking out words in books or removing offensive material from shelves, impinges on our rights to freedom of speech and choice. It is essential to uphold these rights and allow individuals to make their own decisions about what they read or view. Censorship should not be imposed by individuals or authorities, as it restricts the diversity of opinions and experiences available to the public. Let us respect the freedoms granted to us and embrace the variety of perspectives present in media.
322	3299	2	3	Many libraries contain books, movies, music, and magazines that can be considered offensive.  All of these libraries, however, have certain reasons to have these books.  Whether those reasons are for education or for recreation, the libraries have reasons for them.  So, the libraries that do have 'offensive' books, should be allowed to keep them because they are not offensive to everyone, and they could be beneficial to the reader.     These books that are considered offensive to some people may not be offensive to others.  For example, a person from a certain culture might find a book offensive while someone from a different background may find the same book enlightening.  It's important to acknowledge the diversity of readers and not remove books just because they offend a particular group.  Some of these books could actually be valuable to readers, providing important historical or cultural insights that would be lost if they were removed.  Overall, libraries should strive to offer a wide range of materials to cater to the diverse interests and perspectives of their patrons.
323	3300	2	3	Censorship in libraries, in my opinion, is overrated. While some may find certain materials offensive or degrading, it does not warrant removing them from shelves. Future generations need access to a wide range of knowledge and perspectives, and censorship limits this. Everyone has different opinions on what is offensive, so it is not fair for one group to decide what others can or cannot read. Instead of outright banning materials, libraries could consider creating special sections for explicit content to accommodate varying preferences. Ultimately, people should have the freedom to choose what they read, with parents guiding children's choices. Censorship should not dictate what is available for public consumption, as diversity in perspectives is crucial for a well-rounded education.
324	3301	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, my name is @PERSON1 and I think that everyone has a right to their own opinion. People may not want their kids to look at certain things but, they need to keep them where their kids can't find them. Kids in the world hear bad language, see fighting, and even see people get shot. There are a lot more bad things in life than movies, books, and music that children listen to, watch, or read.  I believe that the world can sometimes be more harmful than anything else. Adults may want kids to grow up differently than others so they need to tell them not to be listening and watching the bad things on TV. But, if their kids want to learn about things that happen that are not the greatest, then people should let them.  It wouldn't be right if people or movies or things had to change just because other people don't like it. Why should others have to change just for the ones who don't like it? There are some materials that are bad but can only be purchased at the age of eighteen. That's why people should be okay with things that don't involve minors. Having things censored ruins a lot of things; the fact that it was made that way should be kept that way.  I'm sure many people may not agree with my report but, it's something to look and think about. People wouldn't make the things they do if it was supposed to be censored. That takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things. So my answer is NO about taking things away that are not censored. Keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way.  Sincerely, @PERSON1
325	3302	2	3	I believe as a citizen of this city and as an avid library goer, that censorship in libraries is necessary. Some of the material in the libraries can be very graphic and offensive, which is not suitable for all audiences, especially children. For example, there are books and movies that depict racism and nudity, which can have a negative impact on young minds. It is important to consider the implications of allowing such content to be easily accessible to the public, as it can shape perceptions and behavior.  In our society, where technology and media play a significant role in shaping beliefs and values, it is crucial to regulate the content that is available in public spaces like libraries. Exposure to explicit language, nudity, and offensive themes can desensitize individuals and contribute to a culture of disrespect and insensitivity. Parents may not always be aware of the content their children are accessing, which makes it even more important for libraries to exercise caution in what materials they make available.  While censorship may seem restrictive at first, it ultimately serves to protect individuals, especially children, from harmful influences. By removing content that is inappropriate or offensive, libraries can create a safe and welcoming environment for all patrons. It is important to prioritize the well-being and development of individuals, and censorship in libraries plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. In the long run, we will appreciate the efforts made to ensure that libraries are spaces that promote positive values and healthy attitudes.
326	3303	2	3	"I'm writing this paper today to discuss the issue of censorship in various forms of media, including books, movies, and music. I firmly believe that there should be stricter regulations in place to control what children are exposed to. When children encounter inappropriate content at a young age, it can shape their beliefs and perceptions in a negative way.   Supermarkets and video stores are filled with a wide range of content, much of which is not suitable for children. It is crucial to limit the selection of media that children can access to ensure that they are not exposed to harmful or inappropriate material. Items that are deemed unsuitable should be removed from shelves or placed in areas that are not easily accessible to young audiences.  While there are censorship measures in place for music played on the radio, explicit content still finds its way into mainstream media. This exposure to inappropriate language and themes can have a lasting impact on individuals, especially impressionable children. It is essential to enforce strict rules to prevent underage individuals from being exposed to harmful content.  The prevalence of violence in media, such as in video games like ""Call of Duty,"" can desensitize children to acts of violence and lead them to believe that such behavior is acceptable. By implementing tighter regulations on the content that children are exposed to, we can help reduce the glorification of violence and create a safer environment for young minds to develop.  In conclusion, it is imperative that we advocate for stricter censorship measures to protect children from harmful and inappropriate content in various forms of media. By being mindful of the content that is accessible to young audiences, we can promote healthier attitudes and behaviors among future generations."
327	3304	2	3	How would you like to read or listen to something disrespecting and calling you out of your name such as, '@CAPS1 did you say to me @CAPS2'? Would you want to keep things like that in your libraries? I would, I think anything that was hurtful, harmful, or offensive should be open to the public because it's a great way and opportunity to learn. Books, magazines, and music on slavery are things I think we as a people required to read are things we are required to have. Sure it might hurt, depress, or even aggrivate some people but it also fills you with knowledge on the past. For a person of any race this is a way to feel the pain and struggle of people before us. Despite the pain or irritation this is a type of learning I would welcome in libraries. Knowledge of suicide is also something I think should be available. Because some of our friends and family have either did or attempted suicide, and without knowing about it how can it be prevented. Books on the subject would provide help for those going throughout life with suicidal thoughts. Reading about past struggles or facts about it could give them tips or ideas on how to avoid suicide. I think we need literature on this because I feel enlightenment on the subject is the only way you can avoid it. In conclusion, I think that all types of literature should be admitted and released to the public. I think this because all forms of literature offer a great opportunity to learn. I believe that only by reading the literature on past situations and struggles can you avoid or overcome struggles you face or will face in your lifetime.
328	3305	2	3	Certain books should be allowed in libraries to provide a variety of reading options for individuals. While some content may not be suitable for certain places, there is a wide range of genres available, including history, poetry, drama, romance, and horror. It is important to have diverse literature choices to prevent readers from becoming bored with limited options.  Similarly, music preferences vary among individuals, with some enjoying rap while others prefer rock 'n' roll. While some may disapprove of certain genres, it is essential to respect differing tastes and preferences. As time passes, musical preferences evolve, and what was once considered controversial may become widely accepted.  In terms of movies, there are various genres and ratings available, catering to different audiences. While some parents may restrict their children from watching certain films due to content, there are also kid-friendly options like children's shows.  Magazines offer another form of entertainment, with a wide range of topics to suit different interests. While some may find themselves engrossed in buying everything featured in magazines, others may simply enjoy browsing through them for leisure.  Overall, diverse options in books, music, movies, and magazines cater to different preferences and interests, enriching the cultural landscape. It is important to have a variety of choices available to accommodate the diverse tastes of individuals.
329	3306	2	3	If we were to take away everything that someone in the world finds offensive, there would be nothing left. Many people in different cultures find many different things offensive. It's not right to take away from others something because a select group of people take offense at it. Something being offensive isn't always a bad thing. There are many different reasons why, but removing something because of someone else's opinion isn't right.  First, whether you find something offensive or not is largely based on your culture. To most cultures, declining food is offensive. To others, eating or hurting cows in any way is a complete disgrace. If something is offensive to one person, it may be because they have a different background. You're never going to please everyone.  Second, one of the best things about the world is that you can have your own beliefs. If something was removed from the shelf at a library because someone found it offensive, I would be disturbed. I have my own beliefs that I'm sure not everyone agrees with. Some of my beliefs would be offensive to certain people. That doesn't mean I should have to stay silent about my beliefs, does it? No, of course not. I wouldn't want anyone else's beliefs forced on me. I'm sure no one wants my beliefs forced on them. By removing things from a shelf because someone took offense at it, you'd be removing freedom of speech from the shelf also. That's not only wrong, it's illegal.  Some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it. Some people would be offended by a cover with a pentagram. That doesn't mean they should be taken away. It's good to get offended sometimes. It often makes people stand up for what they believe. To me, it's a reminder of why I believe what I do. I may be angered by what I see. I'm sure the terrorist group is greatly offended when they see the flag. We wouldn't stop waving it, would we? That'd be absurd! Just because someone takes offense at something doesn't make it wrong. It never has. It just means they have different beliefs. We should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed.  I personally believe that removing things from the public eye merely because they're offensive would be wrong for many reasons. So many people find so many things offensive. It'd take away everything if we removed each and every one. Removing offensive items would also be an intrusion of freedom of speech. Plus, many things that are offensive often remind us of who we are. We should be strong enough to look away and not fight about it. I don't think they should be removed. I want my library to be what it was made to be, a mixture of cultures and backgrounds. I don't think anything should be removed unless it directly causes harm to people.
330	3307	2	3	During school one day, all of our teachers informed the class that most of the books in the library were going to be removed from the shelves. The reason behind this decision was that some parents had been complaining about the content their children were reading. However, the students in our class strongly opposed this idea. They believed that the books in the library were beneficial for their learning and exploration of different interests and potential career paths.  The students felt that the books available in the library allowed them to dream and aspire to be something in the future. They argued that by limiting their access to a variety of reading materials, their ability to explore different subjects and career options would be hindered. They believed that it was important for children to have the freedom to choose what they wanted to read and learn about, as it could shape their future goals and aspirations.  If the school decided to remove the books from the shelves, the students feared that they would lose motivation to learn and may not be able to discover their passions. On the other hand, if the books remained accessible, the students were confident that they would continue to be curious and enthusiastic about learning, leading them to have a clearer idea of what they wanted to pursue in the future.  In conclusion, the students believed that keeping the books on the shelves was crucial for their academic and personal development. They hoped that their voices would be heard, and the school would consider their opinions before making a final decision. Ultimately, the students' dreams and aspirations were at stake, and they were determined to fight for their right to access a diverse range of reading materials in the library.
331	3308	2	3	Everyone has their own opinion on censorship in libraries. I think that what libraries choose to put on their shelves should not be censored. Every human being does not have the same taste in what they read, listen to, look at, and watch. In today's generation, everyone has their own opinion on censorship. I do not agree with censorship because not everyone likes the same things, has the same thoughts, has the same lifestyle, and wants to learn the same things. Everyone is an individual and is different in their own way. If libraries wanted to censor what they put out, not everyone would get to read, listen, and watch what they wanted. Having libraries censor things would make people feel left out. For example, if the library only put out romance things, then what would the action lovers do? A library is for anyone and everyone who goes to it. One specific type of person does not go to the library. Everyone grows up in a different lifestyle. Children do not choose their parents. Some parents censor what their kids read and watch, and some do not. Kids who have parents that do not censor what they choose to get at the library might have different interests. Not everyone likes the same things. In school, most of the time everyone learns the basic information that is required. Outside of school, there is so much more to learn. People can go to libraries and learn about different things that they want to learn about. What people choose to study in their free time can range from drugs and sex to art. If libraries censored what people can read, watch, listen to, not everyone would get to learn extra information that they wanted to. Libraries cannot censor their materials! I do not agree with libraries censoring what materials they choose to put out for the public. People are different, and that is okay. If libraries choose to censor things, then not everyone would have equal opportunities. Parents can censor what their kids read if they want. Not every parent chooses to censor what their kids get at the library; therefore, kids have different interests. Human beings do not always want to learn the same things. The libraries who choose to censor what they put out are not letting everyone have an equal chance to learn. Please let people be who they want to be! Do not censor what libraries put out such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Libraries should remain a place where everyone can access a wide range of materials without fear of censorship.
332	3309	2	3	I believe it is wrong to remove books from library shelves even if they are found offensive. I have three reasons to support this statement. These reasons are knowledge, different sections of the library, and freedom. If a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive then the next person who comes along looking for that book cannot access it. In life, there are many things that can offend people, but that's life, you have to learn to let those things go. Everyone has a right to form their own views and opinions on things, but they cannot if they do not read other people's opinions. Reading expands our vocabulary, at any age. Libraries are everywhere and have different sections. If you are concerned about your children finding books that you do not want them to see, then take them to a library with sections. All libraries are broken down into sections. We live in a society that values freedom, and people rely on public libraries for access to books. Censoring books limits people's ability to explore different perspectives and ideas. It is essential to allow everyone the freedom to read whatever they wish, to contribute to the wellness of society. Let's not pretend everything is perfect and instead embrace the diversity of thoughts and beliefs found in literature.
333	3310	2	3	Cooling the Flames of Censorship in Public Libraries  Censorship in public libraries would be an insult to the institution. A library, a citadel of knowledge, should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey. One point of a library, the destination of researchers, is to offer information that must be sought: for those who cannot find the information in their homes without fear, for those who cannot ask their questions without retribution, the library stands as a pillar of safety. Books are incapable of judgment.  To censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress. A freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the world, precludes the idea of this censorship.  If any book is subject to criticism or opposition, are not all books worthy of the same? To value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen. Libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings. The point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them, and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works.  From personal experience, censorship in the library has cost me precious time, and has stolen from me parts of my life. Growing up in a small town, where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set, any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless. When I visited my school's library, as a child searching for answers about my sexuality, I found little aid. Around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love, but never did I find a fairy tale of two princes. It was not until I left the school that I found that such books did exist in my old school library, but kept removed, off the shelves, restricted. More insulting than finding books of LGBTQ+ issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately.  Here lies the problem. Some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear. Such is the point of censorship: ignoring an issue or a life-choice to the point of extinction. But books cannot shout their values. They cannot shove information down our throats. Books must be read, we must give our consent to their knowledge. Unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares, we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance.  If my library had done its job and given me the guidance I sought, I would have grown so much more easily. I would have learned not only how to express and accept myself, but I might have grown to more easily accept others as well.  In the past few years, with the effects of global events reaching the newest generation, the world has searched for ways to pay homage to the victims of violence and tragedy. What the world finds, however, is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies. In trying to construct a monument, society finds that they have little to build off of. The products of murder and book-burning have resulted in an emptiness, a void. Architects have created what may be called 'anti-monuments', commemorating a void to posterity to memorialize what was lost. One of the most powerful, to me at least, appears in the form of a negative bookshelf: a solid wall, with gaping holes in the form of book spines, ranging across the rows. Such is the knowledge lost from book-burning. We cannot even describe what is lost, for the knowledge has vanished. We must ask, what are we missing? What views, what prose, what beauty has been taken from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it?  This is the effect of library censorship. To remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame. Once it is gone, it will be forgotten. To protect our posterity, to enlighten our descendants, we must work to preserve all books, any book that appears offensive, or disgusting, or brave, or new. Let the reader decide its value. Let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind. Give the book a chance for it may have a power that is unrealized. Leave the libraries as they are, as the monuments to the preservation and progression of knowledge and wisdom.
334	3311	2	3	Have you ever wondered how libraries select their books? The process of censorship in libraries is crucial for ensuring that children are not exposed to inappropriate material. Censorship plays a vital role in shaping the social environment and influencing the music of our generation.   Censorship in libraries is necessary to protect children from accessing books that contain explicit content. Without censorship, children may stumble upon books that are not suitable for their age, such as those containing violence or sexual content. Parents may not always be aware of the books their children are reading, which highlights the importance of librarians taking a stand and censoring harmful material.  The impact of uncensored books extends beyond children, affecting social conversations in schools and workplaces. Uncensored books can lead to discussions centered around topics like sex and violence, shaping the social interactions of individuals. By censoring books, libraries can help create a more positive and constructive social environment.  Furthermore, the presence of uncensored music in libraries can also contribute to a culture of violence and negativity. Music that promotes violence can influence individuals' attitudes and behaviors. Censoring music in libraries can help prevent the spread of harmful messages and contribute to a safer and more positive society.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is essential for safeguarding children, shaping social interactions, and influencing cultural norms. By advocating for censored books and music in libraries, we can create a more wholesome and nurturing environment for all individuals. Let us strive for a world where libraries promote education, creativity, and positivity without the damaging influence of uncensored material.
335	3312	2	3	'@CAPS1', the woman shrieked as she had just received a fierce, sharp, and quick stab in the back by her abusive husband. This is the kind of violence children read about all around the @CAPS2. To think all of the inappropriate stuff children see around the @CAPS2 in television, the internet, and even what classmates are talking about isn't enough, well you are wrong. Some of the things you read and hear about in books are totally unacceptable. This is why books and magazines need to be censored in libraries all around the @CAPS2.  In our community library in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, we have magazines that are very graphic. Kids will read these over any learning or interesting book. Many kids draw disrespectful things in them. As if that wasn't ignorant enough, they also rip them in half and do many other destructive things to them. One of the reasons why there is so much trouble with criminal people in the @CAPS2 is that kids these days feel they are allowed to vandalize books, which leads them to believe they can do whatever they want. Kids read about things that aren't necessarily educational. Having a zombie apocalypse scenario in a school library teaches them nothing of value. Allowing them to take these books home and share inappropriate content with their siblings teaches them negative behavior. It is important to censor or remove some of the inappropriate reading materials in libraries to protect children from harmful influences.  Another issue is the financial loss schools face due to damaged books and stolen property. The dirty pictures kids draw in magazines and books also contribute to this problem. Schools could save a significant amount of money by not allowing these books to leave the library. This would prevent damage, theft, and inappropriate drawings, allowing the saved funds to be used for more beneficial purposes.  Promoting well-behaved children across the @CAPS2 can be achieved by implementing censorship in libraries. By restricting the removal of books and magazines from the library, children would not have the opportunity to damage, steal, or deface them. Enforcing rules and boundaries would instill a sense of respect in children. The money saved from preventing damage and theft could be redirected towards more educational resources.  Considering the information provided, it is crucial to reflect on the importance of censoring books and magazines in libraries to protect children from inappropriate content and to promote respect and responsible behavior. This approach not only safeguards children but also allows for better allocation of resources towards their education and development.
336	3313	2	3	I believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries. There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems, but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others. There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library. Since a library is public lots of people go in to get books. What is to stop a kid to getting to one of these books, or movies you can find in libraries? Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuendo? What can you do about this problem? You could censorship the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another problem. The idea of censorship might sound okay, but really it's not the right thing to do. Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top. If you are an adult and you're in the mood to read something with a little violence in it, you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books. Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read. So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf? Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it? You could just put age restrictions on the books. If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent. That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone.
337	3314	2	3	People all judge things differently. That's why I feel that libraries should keep those kinds of books. What may be found as an offensive book to one person might not to another one. If there are people saying that certain books are offensive, then they should take them out of the library. You shouldn't take one book out because one person thinks it is offensive.  What might be offensive to one person may interest another. The person that doesn't think it is should have the right to read the book. That would be taking the rights for people away because a person finds it offensive. The person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more. They will never get to learn about it if they take the book out because one person finds it offensive or doesn't like it.  I personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and may have some violence in them. If the library took these books or movies out because a mother saw her son or daughter reading or watching them, it would be wrong. The mother would be taking away what I like to read and watch. That's not fair at all. A way to solve this issue is to have certain areas for each type of age group; therefore, they would be watching or reading types of things acceptable for their age group.  I understand the fact that some people take things offensively and that they don't want their children to pick up a book or movie that isn't acceptable for their age group. They have to understand though that sometimes people like those types of things, and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them. It is like taking rights away from people because they don't agree with what is happening. It wouldn't be right at all to take those books out of the library.  All people have different views about things. You can't change a thing if one person doesn't like it. People have the right to pick up a book if they want to or not. Not everyone is the same, so not all people are going to think the same way. I like things that some people might not like, that is just how human nature is.
338	3315	2	3	Over time, libraries have been used as a big resource when doing reports, researching, renting movies and simply trying to find something new to read. They have been used as a gateway for an extensive world of reading and learning. All libraries should have the right to have the content they please to have on their shelves. No book, music, movie, magazine, etc., should ever be denied a place on the shelf because of its content.  Sex, drugs, violence. There are many books over these topics that many people may find offensive or just completely oblivious. Every mind is different when it comes down to what it likes to read, watch, or hear. No mind is the same, so no mind will ever like exactly the same thing. Whenever someone wants to go buy a book about safe sex, it should not be denied to them because the library does not allow it. It should be placed in a different section of the library.  Many books that people find as explicit content to them may not be to others. When I was in middle school, I heard a lot about sex and drugs. I never knew what it felt like or how it felt. What I did know was that I could get accessible information from my local library. What happens when a child wants to know more than she does? She looks and researches it. If I would have been denied access to books about sex or drugs, I would have probably never been warned about the outcomes or the seriousness of them both. When you walk into a library and observe, not everyone is reading a book about rainbows and unicorns. Many people read books about real life, books that they can relate to. Many of those books that many people read are those that others call explicit. The purpose of a library is to have access to books, magazines, music, and movies of all kinds of content, regardless of others' concerns.  Also, Libraries can do many things so that certain contents may not be near others. They can organize their topics and genres. Explicit, or eighteen or older books, movies, magazines or music can be placed in a back room or simply on another side of the library, far from the reach where kids and children are able to access.  In conclusion, I believe with my strongly supportive ideas that books, magazines, music, or movies should not be removed if found offensive because every book has a right on the shelf no matter what. No book should be removed because someone may find it offensive. If a person finds something offensive, they should take it up with the author or publishers, not the library, for they only let people borrow the content.
339	3316	2	3	Censorship is a highly debated topic, with individuals often having strong opinions on what should or should not be accessible to the public. While one person may find certain content objectionable and believe it should be removed from public view, it is essential to consider the perspectives of others who may have a different opinion. In a diverse society, it is inevitable that not everyone will agree on what is acceptable or appropriate in terms of content.   Freedom of speech and expression are fundamental rights that must be upheld for all individuals, regardless of their personal views. It is important to recognize that while one person may find certain material offensive, there are likely others who appreciate and resonate with it. Implementing systems such as content warnings, ratings, and alternative versions can help individuals make informed choices about the media they consume, allowing for a balance between freedom of expression and individual sensitivities.  Ultimately, the key is to respect the differing opinions and beliefs of each person while also ensuring that a variety of perspectives and voices are represented in the public sphere. It is not fair or practical to censor content simply because it does not align with the views of a specific group. By maintaining an open and inclusive approach to diverse viewpoints, we can create a more equitable and understanding society where all individuals have the opportunity to express themselves freely.
340	3317	2	3	In libraries, there are books that contain racism and explicit content, which may not be suitable for all viewers, especially young readers. Some books can promote racist ideologies or contain graphic descriptions of sex, which could negatively influence young minds. It is important for parents to monitor what their children are exposed to and for libraries to consider placing such books in separate sections for older audiences. While some argue for censorship of certain materials, others believe that these works serve as a reflection of societal change over time. Ultimately, it is crucial to strike a balance between freedom of expression and protecting young readers from harmful content.
341	3318	2	3	New section in the library Have you ever seen a movie or read a book that you did not want your kids/family to read? I know I have, and sometimes there is no stopping them from seeing or reading those books/movies. I don't necessarily think the offensive books should be removed, but I think they should be relocated to a different part of the library. This section of the library should only be accessed by an adult, or with an adult's permission.  Little kids see stuff that their peers are doing and want to be just like them so they do the same stuff. What the kids don't realize is that most of it is fake, and the things that happen in movies aren't really true. By having this separated section of the library, it gives parents the chance to get the racist, drug/gang filled, and murder books away from the children. This will be good for every race too! If an African American family does not want their child to be reading books about slavery or gangs, they can keep them out of the section of books where slavery and gangs are. Some books are really emotional and can trigger a person's emotions. If someone is going through a really hard time and they read a book about suicide, they are more likely to think about killing themselves.  I think by separating the bad influencing books from the good influencing books it will help a lot. People under the age of 18 are not permitted to be in this section of the library without a parent, or parent signature. So come on down to the library council on Monday and vote for the new section of the library! Thank you for your time.
342	3319	2	3	Censorship in libraries is akin to cutting off the world's air supply, stifling readers' imaginations and hindering their ability to express themselves. Libraries already do a good job of ensuring that books are appropriate for different age groups, so further censorship is unnecessary. By removing certain materials, it only draws attention to why they are being restricted, leading readers to demand more freedom in their reading choices. Books are meant to inspire curiosity, learning, and excitement, and limiting access to certain content only serves to restrict the mind. As a child, I experienced being redirected to age-appropriate books in the library, which was a reasonable approach to censorship. Ultimately, censorship in libraries is unnecessary and goes against the fundamental purpose of libraries in fostering exploration and intellectual growth. Readers should be allowed to explore a wide range of materials without unnecessary restrictions.
343	3320	2	3	There is a certain amount of responsibility when it comes to censoring all the different types of media and literature. Deciding whose responsibility that is can be a difficult task. Children can be strongly influenced by all media out there and making that material has been made easily accessible. When someone comes of age to make decisions that affect their life then they should be able to. Shop owners should be able to sell whatever they want in order to make a living.  When children go to a library usually they will not do so alone. Parents can decide what their child is allowed to take home or not. When a child comes to their parent with a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive or inappropriate it comes to the parent to decide whether or not they want their child to be exposed to that material. If the parent allowed for their child to have access to offensive media then that can give the child the idea that what they are looking at or reading is alright.  If someone has come of age and has all the other freedoms that everyone else has they should be allowed to buy, read, and watch what they want. To prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material you should have to show some sort of identification proving it.  A shop owner or businessman/woman should be able to sell whatever he or she wants to in order to make a living as long as it stays within the boundaries of the law. Having someone who does not work in the law or a person who is not a legal guardian or parent of someone who is not of age should not tell someone not to buy, read, or watch something just because it might be offensive or offend that one person.  I conclude that in order for a someone to tell another person not to buy or rent material that person would either have to be law enforcement or their legal guardian as long as they are not of age. There is no reason why people should not be able to access material that is not against the law. If someone is offended by some literature then they should try to make it against the law.
344	3321	2	3	Censorship is a topic that sparks heated debates in today's society. Views on censorship vary greatly around the world, with some countries imposing strict censorship to control information and prevent their citizens from knowing what is happening globally. This creates a closed-off environment where people lack awareness of important events outside their borders. While censorship may not always be as extreme, it still plays a significant role in various aspects of society, from media content to classified military information.  The debate over censorship has been ongoing for years, with no clear resolution in sight. It is a highly subjective issue, with arguments for and against censorship based largely on personal opinions. Some argue for the necessity of censorship to protect individuals, especially children, from harmful content, while others believe in the importance of freedom of expression and access to information.  In my view, censorship should be minimal, if not completely abolished. Artists and creators use certain words and themes to evoke emotions and convey messages effectively, and censorship can hinder their creative expression. Instead of censoring content, individuals can make informed choices about what they consume and expose themselves to, especially when it comes to children. By exercising our freedom to choose, we can avoid content that we find objectionable without restricting others' access to it.  In a society that values freedom, we should extend that freedom to the realm of censorship. Rather than imposing restrictions on content, individuals can make conscious decisions about what they engage with. By embracing our right to choose, we can avoid unnecessary debates and conflicts over censorship. Ultimately, the power to say no and make informed choices lies in our hands, allowing us to navigate a world filled with diverse content and perspectives.
345	3322	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1,  Should certain books be removed because some people @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read? No, I do not think they should be removed. I honestly think all they all should be put in different sections of the library by age.  Like all the children books and magazines should be in one section. The young adult and or teen books and magazines should be in a section by itself. Then the adult books and magazines should be in their section. Even the autobiographies and documentaries should be in their section too.  It would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read. For example, if you're a teenage girl looking for a book about a high school girl with a crush on a boy, it'd most likely be in the section for young adults.  So yes, the parents that are concerned about their children's viewing of certain books should be able to say something about it. But what if one teenager is looking for a book about a famous person's autobiography for a school project. Even though it includes how they used to be into drugs as a teenager. That person shouldn't have to fail if they can't find it in a library because some concerned parent didn't think it was appropriate.  Like I said the best thing to do is put all the books in subcategories by age. It would make things easier and faster to find the book of your selection.
346	3323	2	3	It seems as though inappropriate materials are prevalent in today's society, appearing in various forms such as magazines, books, and music lyrics. However, the question arises as to whether libraries should censor these materials based on the morals and values of certain individuals. While it is understandable to separate offensive materials from areas accessible to children, complete censorship based on personal beliefs is unjust. Each person has their own set of morals and values, and it is not fair to restrict others from accessing information based on individual opinions. Libraries should aim to provide a diverse range of materials, with potentially offensive content clearly marked in a separate section. Ultimately, it is important to respect differing opinions and allow individuals the freedom to choose what they read without imposing personal beliefs on others. Let libraries be a place of knowledge and learning, where individuals can explore a variety of perspectives and ideas without censorship.
347	3324	2	3	Libraries should have censorship to protect young children from being exposed to inappropriate content. This is necessary because such material can teach children negative things and lead them astray. Additionally, it can have a harmful influence on their behavior, as they may share what they have seen with others and encourage them to engage in inappropriate activities. Ultimately, there is no valid reason for children to have access to such material, and implementing censorship in libraries can help ensure that they are not exposed to harmful content. By restricting access to inappropriate material, libraries can create a safer environment for children and help guide them towards a positive and healthy future.
348	3325	2	3	I think that censorship in libraries isn't needed. The grounds for censorship are often opinionated and biased. Two readers of the same book could view the material completely differently. Readers choose to read a book and are likely aware of the general plot before starting due to the summary on the back. People can make their own decisions about what they read. If certain books are deemed inappropriate or offensive, they are most likely in teen or adult literature. In such cases, readers should be mature enough to handle the content or decide not to continue reading.  Saying that material is unsuitable for a younger age group is valid, but children should be accompanied by an adult when checking out books. Content that some find unacceptable would likely be intended for a mature audience, so younger readers encountering it would be the issue. Teens and adults reading such material are likely capable of handling a few foul words or innuendos in the plot.  Offensive material can be viewed differently by different audiences. What one person finds offensive may not be the same for someone else. Difficult situations in literature can help prepare us for the challenges we may face in life and encourage empathy and action to make a difference.  Stories that depict tough realities should not be censored as they can educate and inspire change. Libraries should remain open to all who wish to explore these narratives. Books serve a purpose in shedding light on difficult topics and showing readers that they are not alone in their struggles. Our actions following exposure to such stories define who we are, and it is through understanding and confronting harsh realities that we can work towards a better future.
349	3326	2	3	I believe that certain books should not be on library shelves, but ultimately it is up to the library to decide what to offer. If a book is deemed inappropriate for children, then it should be kept out of their reach. However, books on important historical topics like slavery and the Holocaust should not be censored just because they may be difficult or uncomfortable to read about. Parents should have the right to control what their children read, but they should not impose their beliefs on others. It is important to recognize that people have different perspectives and to respect the diversity of opinions. If someone strongly opposes certain books, they can take steps to have them relocated or removed, but they should not impose their views on others. Ultimately, it is important to uphold the freedom to access information and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they read.
350	3327	2	3	Dear @PERSON1,  I wanted to discuss with you the issue of offensive books in libraries that are accessible to children. It is concerning that some books intended for adults are available for children to read without any restrictions. These books should be removed from the shelves to protect young readers from inappropriate content. Instead, libraries should focus on providing age-appropriate and educational material for children to enjoy.  Parents also play a crucial role in this matter. It is important for parents to voice their concerns and protest against the presence of offensive books in libraries. By advocating for the removal of such material, parents can ensure that their children are not exposed to content that is unsuitable for their age. Creating a list of offensive books and restricting access to adults with proper identification can be a step in the right direction.  Furthermore, libraries should carefully consider the books they make available for children to borrow. It is essential to promote reading materials that are beneficial for their development and growth. Parents need to be aware of what their children are reading and guide them towards age-appropriate content that will enhance their understanding of the world around them.  In conclusion, it is crucial for libraries to take action in ensuring that children are not exposed to offensive material. By providing suitable reading material and listening to the concerns of parents, libraries can create a safe and educational environment for young readers. Let us work together to protect our children from harmful content and promote a love for reading that will benefit them in the long run.  Sincerely, @CAPS1
351	3328	2	3	In my opinion, censorship should not be allowed in libraries. People should have the freedom to choose what they want to read without restrictions. Censorship can lead to disobedience and a negative atmosphere in the library. It can also discourage people from visiting the library if they feel like their choices are being controlled. Libraries should be welcoming and quiet places for people to enjoy reading, studying, and completing tasks. Ultimately, individuals should have the autonomy to decide what they want to read, and censorship should not be imposed on them in libraries or any other public spaces.
352	3329	2	3	I do believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries to protect children from inappropriate content. It is important to ensure that children are not exposed to explicit material such as adult magazines or books with explicit language and themes.   Parents and librarians should work together to create designated areas for adult materials that require identification to access. This will help prevent children from stumbling upon content that is not suitable for their age.   While adults may have the freedom to read about mature subjects like sex and drugs, it is crucial to shield children from such content. Exposing children to inappropriate material can lead to negative consequences at school and home, as they may mimic the behavior they see or face disciplinary actions.   Therefore, it is essential for library staff to be mindful of where they place materials to ensure that children are not inadvertently exposed to content meant for adults. By taking proactive measures, we can create a safe and age-appropriate environment for all library visitors.
353	3330	2	3	Eventually, everyone sees or hears offensive things. However, the government has taken it upon themselves to try and keep youth from seeing it. They believe the parents should tell their children about everything while they try to make it one big secret for kids. But, if kids are introduced early, we would not have to keep it a secret anymore. Libraries and all types of media should not be censored.  Kids always ask questions like 'where do babies come from?' and adults, wanting to avoid an awkward conversation, make up stories or do not tell them the whole truth. Imagine a world where the government let the media say whatever they want. Yes, at first it would be vulgar but the government would then have the right to teach about sex and drugs in school. More kids would be educated, so less of them would be curious enough to do any of that stuff.  That is not to say that newscasters should curse everytime they are on television. It is merely suggesting that instead of having a metaphorical black curtain over half the news, they report the whole truth. They have freedom of speech, and we have a right to know.  At first, people would think it was a terrible world. But, eventually, with right leadership, it would help make a more truthful environment. Kids would learn about sex and drugs in school, and have a safe environment to answer their questions if they have any. Drug use and rape would go down. Then, talking about 'offensive' topics would be non-existent so kids would not be embarassed if they had questions. This would change the world for the better.
354	3331	2	3	The library is a place where dreams and imagination come to life through books. However, the issue arises when books meant for one age group are accessible to all. This can lead to young children stumbling upon inappropriate content, offensive material being exposed to certain races, and events depicted in books that may not be suitable for all ages. It is crucial for libraries to consider the impact of the books they provide and ensure that they are appropriate for all audiences. By taking measures to segregate books based on age appropriateness, the library can create a more inclusive and safe environment for all visitors. It is essential to prioritize the well-being and comfort of all library users by being mindful of the content available to them.
355	3332	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. Children are exposed to such content outside of school, so removing them from libraries or stores would be pointless. Instead of censorship, individuals can choose to avoid offensive material and seek out content that aligns with their values. Furthermore, removing books or movies on controversial topics hinders academic research and limits access to diverse perspectives. It is essential to promote critical thinking and responsible consumption rather than banning materials based on subjective opinions. In conclusion, censorship is not the solution to dealing with offensive material, and individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices about what they read or watch.
356	3333	2	3	Censorship in Libraries  I believe that censorship in libraries should be minimal. Just because something is deemed offensive by some individuals does not mean it should be removed from the shelves. Everyone has their own perspective and what one person finds offensive, another may find valuable.  Libraries are meant to provide a wide range of materials to cater to diverse interests and preferences. Restricting certain content would limit the variety of books available, ultimately alienating potential readers. A library should aim to be inclusive and offer something for everyone, even if it means including materials that may be considered controversial.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries should be approached with caution. It is important to consider the diverse needs and preferences of library patrons and provide a wide selection of materials to cater to them. By allowing for a variety of viewpoints and content, libraries can truly fulfill their role as sources of knowledge and information for all individuals.
357	3334	2	3	Have you ever been in a library and thought to yourself, 'hey, this book looks pretty good.' But once you read it, you deemed it as inappropriate for younger people? I have, but unlike some people, I don't blame it on the libraries. I blame myself for picking it up in the first place. Some people do not want to take responsibility for their actions, and so they blame it on the library for carrying a certain author's books, a band's songs, or a magazine's articles.  This brings me to say that books, music, magazines, newspapers, etc. should not be taken off the shelves of libraries. Just because some people do not like the content that they hold, doesn't mean that it can't be helpful or entertaining to others. I think it should be a matter of choice, like choosing which outfit you want to wear in the morning. There are too many options, like when it comes to books, movies, music, and magazines. If something strikes you as inappropriate, then simply take it back and exchange it for something better.  One experience I can think of that is a good example of this is when I was 10 years old. My mother took me into the library and I found a book, 'A Child Called It.' I showed it to her just like any other time we had gone to the library. Only this time, she did not want me to check it out. She saw it as too harsh of a book for me to read at the time, she wanted me to wait until I was older. It was about child abuse and she saw it as a very inappropriate book for my age, at the time. But she didn't blame it on the libraries, asking why they would carry such books where children could reach them.  Other mothers and fathers are the same way, as I found out. My best friend's parents had been the same way with her. Only instead of a book, it was a music CD that she had wanted to listen to. They thought that she should not listen to it because the lyrics in the songs were too 'sad' for her to hear. They agreed that if she were just a little older then she could have borrowed it. They did not blame the library. If someone else wanted to listen to it, or have their children listen to it, then it was their own personal choice.  I do not believe that libraries should have censorship. They can have different sections, such as adult, children, and young adult. But I believe that they should not have to take books, music, magazines, etc. off the shelves just because of certain people. It should be a person's personal choice. If they do not like the item that they picked up, they should take responsibility for their actions, and not blame others for their mistakes.
358	3335	2	3	I think books, movies, music, and magazines that are offensive should not be pulled from the shelves. If you find something offensive, then don't pick it up; it's that simple. It is all according to your own personal opinion. Sure, there are some things that are very offensive to certain people, and those people will try to put a stop to it. But I think that is wrong because it may be offensive to you, but it might not be to someone else. It could be helpful to many people, and at the same time, it can be offensive to a lot of people. If you are one of those people who find something offensive, then don't pay any attention to it and find another subject or topic. For someone to take another person's right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong; everyone has their own opinions and rights.
359	3336	2	3	"There are some books that should not be removed from libraries due to censorship. Past experiences with censorship have shown that it can lead to a book being toned down. In the book ""Fahrenheit 451,"" for example, books are being burnt, causing society to fall apart. Censorship often stems from individuals with a more conservative background who do not want children exposed to inappropriate language.  One recent example of censorship involves the book ""Huckleberry Finn."" The main word being targeted for removal is ""nigger"" because some people find this word offensive to their race. Committees are attempting to remove the book from school shelves.  I believe that censorship should not be enforced simply because parents do not want their children exposed to certain words in school. Eventually, children will learn these words on their own or hear them elsewhere. They may even learn them from their own parents or from television. I personally feel that committees should cease attempting to censor everything, as they cannot control how adults speak around children and young adults. Ultimately, censorship can hinder a full understanding of the world and limit intellectual freedom."
360	3337	2	3	Katherine Paterson, a well-known author, presents an idea with which I strongly agree. She states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf left for any of us.' If everyone has the right to remove certain books that they find inappropriate, there may not be anything left for people to read. Although it is a good thing for parents to have a voice and stand up for what they believe, books should not be banned. Many people have different views on what is right and wrong. Some may suggest that a certain book is obscene, while others may be offended by a different book. If every parent had the right to get a book banned, there could come a time when no books meet the approval of the parent. Some of these books present great learning opportunities to students. Books often allow students to think in different, new ways. They can learn from a new point of view. Often times, a student can look at his or her own morals and values, which is a good thing. If a teacher finds a book which they think is appropriate, parents should respect the decision of this teacher. They may suggest another reading, or offer other ideas, but to go as far as getting the book completely removed is not right. While removing books for reading may be going too far, things such as movies could go the other direction. Personally, my parents would be horrified to see grotesque, inappropriate movies set out in broad daylight where everyone can look at them. I think that this difference between books and movies is a simple thing: Books do not normally have an inappropriate cover, while bad movies often do. Because of this, even the people who do not wish to view the movie are often forced to see images which they find disturbing. If one was to walk past a book they did not intend to read, they do not have to be appalled at the cover as they pass. Although parents care about the things their children read, books should not be banned. Although other things may have affects on youth, books are a different story. They allow one's self to dive deep into thought, to make observations, and to form opinions. They are a key to growing, learning, and discovering.
361	3338	2	3	First off, I do like censorship laws to an extent. However, the government cannot ban everything that they deem inappropriate. I think it depends more on what the family deems inappropriate. I do not think they should have any completely inaccessible areas in libraries for children of younger ages. I believe that the viewer should have a family member's consent to view said content. I also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests, then they should just not look at it. They are not required to look at it so if they do not like it, then they do not look at it.  However, if the library does not consent to holding the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., then they do not have to and the viewer can go somewhere else. And if they do have the books, music, etc., then they can put limits and ratings on them. But I do not think that an adult could go in and complain about inappropriate material. As I said before, if they do not like it, then they are not required to look at it.  I actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials. One parent should not have the ability to take away others' privileges to books, because they deem it inappropriate. Just because they do not like the content, does not exclude all others from enjoying it.  Also, if a library does have an age restriction on certain materials, then appropriate acts of discipline should be taken for the viewer of said materials. However, if the viewer has an adult family member with them and has their consent, then I think they should be able to view the material, regardless of ratings. In conclusion, censorship laws should be applied with consideration for individual and family preferences, rather than imposing blanket restrictions. Each person should have the freedom to choose what they consume, with parental guidance and library regulations serving as important factors in ensuring appropriate content access.
362	3339	2	3	There are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this world. Some are funny, sad, weird, scary, etc. And then there are some that are questionable to others on whether it was even necessary to even put the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices. We are all entitled to our own opinion. When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than others, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect? Some things may come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world. I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something. I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. Everybody's different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read. Then what will we do? There's such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered whether it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. These materials are what keep people connected with each other. I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it give a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music. Every voice deserves to be heard, and every individual deserves the opportunity to connect with others through shared interests and perspectives. By embracing diversity in materials and allowing for a wide range of voices to be heard, we can foster a more inclusive and understanding society where everyone's opinions are valued. Let us continue to explore, discover, and appreciate the vast array of expressions and ideas that exist in the world, without imposing limitations or restrictions on what can be shared and enjoyed.
363	3340	2	3	There are many books, movies, and music in libraries, catering to a wide range of tastes and interests. While some content may be deemed offensive by certain individuals, it is important to remember that libraries offer a diverse selection to accommodate the varied preferences of their patrons. It is crucial for parents and guardians to guide children towards age-appropriate material and set a positive example for them to follow. Ultimately, libraries are shaped by the demands and interests of the community they serve, reflecting the diverse perspectives and preferences of society. It is essential to promote understanding and respect for different viewpoints, even if they may not align with our own, in order to maintain libraries as inclusive and enriching spaces for all.
364	3341	2	3	Libraries should have whatever they want in the library. Everyone has their own thoughts on things. If you don't like what they have on their shelves then don't go there anymore or pick up something you like. Everyone is different so you can't just take offensive stuff off the shelves, it might be offensive to one person, but not to someone else. Materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, provide facts and information. Removing items just because they are offensive to some individuals is not the solution. The diversity of materials in a library caters to the varied interests and needs of different people. It is important to have access to a wide range of content for research, education, and personal enrichment. Restricting or censoring materials based on personal preferences limits the freedom of choice and access to information. It is essential to respect the diversity of opinions and allow individuals to make their own decisions about what they read or view. Embracing this diversity enriches the library experience and promotes intellectual freedom for all.
365	3342	2	3	Libraries provide us with knowledge, entertainment, and peace. You can go there to learn, do research, rent movies, music, and books, or simply find a quiet escape. However, some people may find certain materials offensive and question whether they should be removed from library shelves. In my opinion, these materials should not be removed as they offer different perspectives and can spark curiosity.  Books, movies, and music can contain content that some individuals may find offensive, such as explicit language, controversial topics, or sensitive themes. However, censoring these materials would limit access to diverse viewpoints and hinder intellectual freedom. History books, for instance, may depict harsh realities that some find disturbing, but they are essential for understanding the past and learning from it.  Moreover, what one person finds offensive, another may find thought-provoking or enlightening. Offensive content can evoke strong emotions and stimulate deeper discussions and reflections. By keeping these materials available, libraries can encourage critical thinking and open dialogue on complex issues.  Instead of removing offensive materials, libraries can consider categorizing them appropriately and providing clear information about their content. This way, individuals can make informed choices about what they want to explore. It is important to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and respect the diversity of perspectives within society.  In conclusion, while some may find certain materials in libraries offensive, it is important to preserve intellectual freedom and the diversity of viewpoints. By maintaining a wide range of materials, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for learning, entertainment, and personal growth. Offense is subjective, and it is essential to recognize and respect the varied opinions and preferences of library users.
366	3343	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I adhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that the books and other items should stay in the shelves of the library that censorship in libriaries is unnecessary. As Katherine Paterson stated there will be no books left on the shelves if you take every book off that someone in the community finds offensive. What is offensive to one person may not be considered offensive in another persons point of view. Children, teens, and adults have their own right to choose whatever book they want to read, movie they want to watch , or music they want to listen to. If it is a child or a young teen then I believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch. In my case I am not allowed to listen to offensive music or watch rated R movies but that shouldn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library. Just because that is what my family believes to be right does not mean it is the only way to live.   A person has their own rights to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. They can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong. If they think that a book is offensive then they don't have to read it, they have the right to say no and put the book back on the self. If they think that the book is appropriate then they can read it and there is no law stating that they have to share the book with anyone else. If there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it there is no reason you have to agree with it. Every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with.   If you are a parent to a child and you are uncomfortable with them reading, listening, or watching something that is offensive you should set the rules early in life with them. Parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching inappropriate movies. Therefore, if you are comfortable with your children seeing and hearing offensive things then you don't have to worry about what is out there in the community. The things that your children are watching, reading, listening to isn't a problem and if it becomes a problem in the parents eyes then they have the right to stop the children from reading the offensive books or watching the bad movies and listening to the music that the view as offensive. Every parent and family is different, as long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in then there is no need for censorship in libraries.   In my family I am not allowed to listen to offensive music. Offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics. The words that my family considers offensive may be different than what other families consider offensive. I know that I don't want to and can't listen to those certain songs but that does not mean that I can't be friends or be around people that listen to that kind of music. Just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken of the shelves of the library or any other place. What my family believes in may not be the right thing in another family's view. Every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to. My family also believes that at my age right now I should not watch rated R movies. If you took all the rated R movies off the shelves, then half the movies would be gone and that is not fair to the people who enjoy rated R movies. What my family believes may not be what other families believe in. I know what I stand for and I will do what I think is right and I won't listen to offensive music or watch rated R movies. In no way though does that mean that other children, teens, adults shouldn't enjoy that kind of music and those movies.   In conclusion, I believe that censorship should not be used in libraries. It is every person's own right and they are capable of making decisions that they think are the right thing to do. Parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch, read, or listen to. They can monitor what their children are reading, watching, or listening to and if they find it offensive they can stop their children. It is not necessary to take the items off the shelf. In my family, my parents find some types of music and movies offensive and I know when I go to the library or any other place that I won't get those items. I will get the

Children exposed to inappropriate content may mimic the behavior they see, leading to social difficulties and a distorted sense of what is acceptable. Similarly, adults can also be influenced by offensive media, potentially adopting harmful habits or beliefs. This can result in emotional distress and even violent tendencies. Removing offensive media from libraries would help create a more positive and healthy environment for individuals of all ages. By eliminating access to inappropriate content, we can promote a society that is free from the negative influences that such media perpetuates. Ultimately, the removal of offensive media from libraries would contribute to a safer and more enriching world for everyone.
368	3345	2	3	All of us have the right to express our thoughts, beliefs, and feelings. Freedom is a precious gift that belongs to each of us, and no one can take it away. However, it can be challenging to understand and accept the opinions of others, especially when they differ from our own.   Libraries are valuable resources where we can find a wide range of material to answer our questions. While some content may be offensive or uncomfortable for some, it is essential to consider the potential value it may have for others. If we had the power to remove any material we found objectionable, the library shelves would be empty.   Music is another form of expression that can be divisive. Some may consider certain genres to be rude or inappropriate for children. However, it is unfair to judge people based on their musical preferences or other forms of media consumption.   It is crucial to remember that no one is superior to anyone else, and we must respect each other's feelings and perspectives. By working on understanding and empathy, we can create a more inclusive and harmonious society.
369	3346	2	3	Should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? I think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive. If it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person. Everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not.     I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive. They were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine. But, they shouldn't argue over it because, like I said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive.     In conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves. Everyone has different point of view. The author probably didnt mean for the book or magazine to be offensive.
370	3347	2	3	Censorship in the world is a contentious issue, with many arguing that certain material is unsuitable for public consumption. However, I believe that individuals should have the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever they choose, as long as it does not violate any laws. While some may access material that is illegal or harmful, it is not fair to punish everyone for the actions of a few. The freedom of expression is a fundamental right enshrined in the constitution, allowing people to explore a wide range of ideas and opinions. While the government may have the authority to regulate certain content, this should not extend to limiting individuals' access to information. People should have the autonomy to decide for themselves what they find offensive or objectionable, without fear of censorship. Ultimately, the right to freedom of expression should be protected, allowing individuals to engage with diverse perspectives and ideas without unnecessary restrictions.
371	3348	2	3	I think that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they have anything to do with drugs, sexuality, and violence. There are many reasons why I think that those materials should be removed. One reason is because young children can easily access them and learn inappropriate behaviors. Another reason is that libraries should be safe spaces for families, free from explicit content. Furthermore, such materials should be kept in restricted areas for limited access. From personal experience, I have seen how inappropriate content can be harmful. In conclusion, it is essential to consider the impact of these materials on individuals and society as a whole.
372	3349	2	3	There are tons of books in the library that people today find offensive to young readers. However, these materials should not be removed from the shelves. People have the right to read what they choose, and censoring books would limit access to diverse perspectives and stories. Removing offensive books would be a slippery slope, as many works could be deemed offensive to someone. It is essential to respect individuals' right to choose what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Censorship limits access to valuable and thought-provoking content, ultimately hindering intellectual growth and exploration. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a wide range of materials in libraries to cater to diverse tastes and preferences.
373	3350	2	3	I don't think that they should be removed from the shelves. Everyone has a right to read it at some point in time. To where no little kids can rent the book. If they are complaining about how it's vulgar or sexual, then you shouldn't take it away. Try something else such as an adult section. One person may love a book that has some violence in it, and on the other hand, you may have a person who is really religious and can't stand to see it.  There are many viewpoints on this topic. The parents who don't want their kids to be exposed to this type of lifestyle may have valid concerns. However, some people don't think about it being as bad as the next person. If it's a book you dislike on a bookshelf and you don't like it put out in plain sight, should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down?  Some people don't know what their kids like to read. If they have the final thought on what gets taken down, it may affect the kids' reading habits. What if your kid wants to read a horror book, and you choose not to let those kinds of books on the shelf anymore? Then they may not want to read the books that are left up on the shelf. I'd rather read a book that interests me than a book that I dislike.  My point of view on this topic is simple. I don't think the parents should be in control of what we read as long as it's appropriate. I think the decision should be left for the government to say which book should and shouldn't be taken away.
374	3351	2	3	When it comes to censorship, I believe that very few things should be removed. Just because something is offensive to some does not mean it is offensive to all. Material should only be removed if it offends an overwhelming majority of people. If something offends you, you can simply choose to ignore it rather than demanding its removal. When it comes to books, music, movies, or magazines, almost anything should be allowed, except for material that depicts nudity or drugs and alcohol. A little cursing or violence is acceptable, but it should be kept away from young children. Parents should take responsibility for monitoring what their children are exposed to, rather than demanding censorship. Everyone should have the freedom to express themselves without fear of being censored. In a free society, people should be able to read and write what they want without facing ridicule or censorship. Freedom of speech and creativity should be protected, even if some may find the content offensive. Let's respect each other's rights and allow for diverse viewpoints and expressions to coexist in a tolerant and open society.
375	3352	2	3	Yes, inappropriate content in books, music, and other media should be removed to protect children from exposure to harmful material. Children should be exposed to educational and age-appropriate content that aligns with their learning and development. Parents should monitor and regulate what their children are exposed to, ensuring that they are not reading, listening to, or watching anything that is inappropriate for their age. It is crucial to create a safe and healthy environment for children to thrive and grow without being negatively influenced by inappropriate content.
376	3353	2	3	My thoughts on censorship in libraries is yes some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should be taken off of the shelves if they are offensive. If they are left on the shelves some very small child or teens could come up and reach for a book and find that it has bad things in it that are meant for adults. The child will ask the caregiver that they are with what does this picture mean, and they will most likely not know what to say at that moment. Parents and caregivers are not always up to explaining or want to explain as soon as they have to about things sometimes. Everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates. Some things should be taught when we are young like how to brush our teeth, but some things should be left until we are older like having babies or drinking. When parents going through the explanation of something like making babies you do not want it to be when they are only five years old. With books in a library with pictures of men and women questions like that do get asked to young. Libraries are public places and should be safe for any age no matter whether they are young babies or adults. Public schools have libraries in them also, and I would not want a child reading a book with bad or offensive things in it. It does not just have to be a book with bad things in it, but it could also be something to do with religions. Everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. If you have grown up a certain way your whole life, and a kid picks up a book dealing with another religion they will ask someone about it. Young kids and teens can always find things that they should not at certain ages, but why not make it less by not letting a library be censored? When you were younger your parent did not want to take you to the library and be asked an offensive question because of a book, music, movie, or magazine. It has worked for so many years, so we should not have to change it now.
377	3354	2	3	I dont believe that it should matter what books are in a library. If you think a book would be offensive to you, dont read it. If you were to read a book with opinions about a cirtian race or religion, just keep your opinion to yourself. Most people make a big deal about cirtian things to get attention.      If a library was split up into sections about topics and such, it would help a lot, and it would be a quicker way to get your books and get out to make room for others. I honestly have not seen a @CAPS1 in a school library, but its probly because I did not spend much time lookin for it. And if there isnt one, its probly because someone complained about it.     If you are religious, you should have the right to be able to read what you want. Theres all kinds of weird books in the library, and a lot of people just look at them for the fun of it. I dont know why some people have so many problems with certian things. Like I said before, if you dont like it, dont read it.
378	3355	2	3	I don't believe any of those materials are offensive if found in a library. But if the children look somewhere else to find those things, then they will find them anytime. The offensive materials are out there to be picked up by some people, including children. The books aren't offensive if found in the adult area, as children would not be interested in reading them due to their length and lack of pictures. Music may be offensive but is typically found in the adult area as well. Children are not usually interested in music at that age, so they would not be exposed to it. Movies and magazines with offensive content can be found anywhere, but they are less likely to be found in a library. One may come across offensive materials like magazines in a library, as they cover a wide range of topics. While some books may be offensive, they can serve as a learning experience by showcasing the consequences of certain actions. It is important to consider the purpose of these materials and the lessons they may provide, even if they may be deemed offensive by some.
379	3356	2	3	Is the censorship in libraries really necessary? In my opinion, it is, but only to a certain extent. I believe that most people who frequent libraries know what types of materials are more suitable for adults versus teenagers or children. Censorship helps to protect youth from being exposed to inappropriate content that could influence their behavior. However, if censorship were to be relaxed, a system of age-appropriate ratings could be implemented to guide parents and children in making informed choices. By introducing ratings like those used for movies, children could be steered towards materials that are suitable for their age group. This approach could help parents and children make better decisions about the content they consume and prevent negative influences. Overall, a balanced approach to censorship in libraries is essential to protect the well-being of young readers and ensure a positive learning environment.
380	3357	2	3	"Books, movies, music, and even social media are all essential forms of learning and entertainment in our society. They provide valuable insights into the past, present, and future, allowing individuals to broaden their knowledge and perspectives. While some content may be uncomfortable or offensive to certain individuals, it is important not to censor or restrict access to these materials.  For example, the book ""Huckleberry Finn"" contains language and themes that may be considered offensive, but it is a crucial piece of literature that sheds light on the historical context of slavery and societal attitudes of the time. Attempts to ban or censor such works only serve to limit our understanding of the past and hinder our ability to learn from it.  Similarly, movies and music that may contain controversial or provocative content should not be censored. It is up to individuals to make informed choices about what they consume and engage with. By allowing access to a diverse range of content, we enable people to make their own decisions and form their own opinions.  Ultimately, censorship limits our freedom to explore different perspectives and ideas. It is important to embrace diversity in media and literature, even if it means confronting discomfort or offense. By promoting open dialogue and critical thinking, we can continue to learn and grow as individuals and as a society."
381	3358	2	3	People see libraries as a valuable source of knowledge and information, but some may find certain content offensive. While libraries should strive to provide a wide range of materials, including those that may be controversial, it is important to consider the potential impact on the community. If there are items that are widely deemed offensive, it may be necessary to address these concerns with library staff. Ultimately, the goal should be to ensure that the library remains a welcoming and inclusive space for all members of the community.
382	3359	2	3	I think that if you feel like they are saying bad things, you should not read the books or magazines, listen to the music, or watch the movies. If something offends you, just avoid it because what may be offensive to you might not be offensive to someone else. It's a part of life to come across things that we may not agree with, so why dwell on it? Taking things off the shelves just because they are offensive to some people is not the solution. People have different tastes and preferences, and we should respect that. Instead of trying to censor everything, we should focus on what we enjoy and let others do the same. It's important to remember that we can always choose what we expose ourselves to and not let negative comments affect our beliefs.
383	3360	2	3	Libraries should not be able to remove books, movies, and magazines from their shelves just because some children might be offended. Doing so could alienate the children who enjoy those materials and deter them from returning to the library. For instance, if a library removes popular books, movies, or magazines that many children love, it could lead to a decrease in library usage.  Instead of removing materials, libraries should implement a policy where parents must sign a permission slip for their children to check out certain books, magazines, or movies. This way, parents can have control over what their children are exposed to, and libraries can continue to offer a wide range of materials for all ages. By having age restrictions and parental permission in place, libraries can ensure that children have access to appropriate materials while still offering a variety of choices.  In conclusion, libraries should not censor their materials based on potential offense. By implementing a permission slip policy and age restrictions, libraries can continue to provide a diverse selection of books, movies, and magazines for all patrons to enjoy.
384	3361	2	3	Some people think that certain books, movies, magazines, or music should be removed from libraries because they may be found offensive. I believe that libraries should not rid their shelves of 'offensive' material.  What really makes something offensive? If someone were to tell me that it looked as if I've lost weight, I would find that offensive. The person wouldn't have meant it that way, though. Although I would have found it slightly rude, another person may have found it to be a nice compliment. With this logic, can one really conclude that anything is truly offensive? By saying something is offensive, you're stating your own opinion. Even if they aren't the same as everyone else's, everyone is entitled to their own opinions; equality is something most people find very important. Because of this, one person's definition of offensive shouldn't be held higher than another's. If we rid libraries of 'offensive' material, that is exactly what you would be doing; you'd be making one person's definition of offensive superior to another person's.  I also believe libraries should not get rid of 'offensive' material because by doing so, they would probably be getting rid of a lot of interesting material. Let's use my religious beliefs for an example. I am a Christian. Basically, I do not believe in 'Buddhism'. If someone were to write a book about my religion, I would find it interesting. Some may find it to be offensive, though. So if a library got rid of that book because someone found it offensive, I wouldn't want to go there as often. When I go to a library, I want to find a book that I'd enjoy reading. If all the material that is found offensive was taken out of the library, would there really be anything left? If so, I doubt many people would find it interesting.  I also believe this because by taking a book off the shelf because you find it offensive, wouldn't you be offending the author? As I said before, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Because of this, libraries should allow authors to speak their minds. By taking their books off the shelves, you'd be offending them. They took their time and effort to think about and write that book, and for you to offend them by taking it off the shelf, you'd be contradicting the entire purpose of removing it from the shelf.  In conclusion, I believe that nothing can truly be defined as offensive. Also, people should be able to speak their minds. Therefore, libraries should not attempt to rid their shelves of 'offensive' material.
385	3362	2	3	Dear @CAPS1:   Have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library? Would you want your children influenced by these findings? These are the questions you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries.   As a concerned citizen, I am writing to you to reflect my opinion on censorship in libraries. In my own personal experiences, I have come across magazines, books, and music that are offensive. I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries. There are many people who may still want access to these materials, so my suggestion is that there should be a separate room designated for offensive materials. By having a separate area, we can keep these materials away from young children. When I become a parent, I want the library to be a kid-friendly place. In order to make that happen, we need to find a solution for these materials or not have them at all. Libraries should be welcoming to everyone: from college students studying for exams, to young children exploring the world of literature, to elderly individuals seeking peace and quiet. The presence of offensive materials can be a distraction and hinder the inclusive environment that libraries should strive to maintain.   Libraries serve as places for learning and exploration, where individuals can discover the wealth of resources available to them. For young children, libraries are like fairy tale lands where anything is possible and the impossible can become reality. If there are materials that parents do not want their children exposed to, they may feel uncomfortable bringing their child to the library. It is crucial for libraries to be kid-friendly environments so that individuals of all ages can fully enjoy what they have to offer.   In conclusion, offensive materials should not have a place in libraries. All individuals should be able to enjoy the offerings of a library without being exposed to content that may be inappropriate. I urge you to consider these points.   Kind regards,   @PERSON2
386	3363	2	3	They need to remove the bookstores from the library because students want a wide variety of books available, including Spanish books and books from different cultures. This allows students to learn new languages and explore different perspectives. Additionally, the library should consider removing music and movies, as some DVDs may be damaged or missing.   Many people believe that libraries should be free for everyone to access. Libraries around the world should consider lending books to those in need without any cost. It is essential for libraries to reach out to the community and showcase the resources available, including books, DVDs, and magazines.   To attract more readers, libraries should offer a diverse collection of materials and create a welcoming environment. By providing unique and interesting DVDs for rent, libraries can cater to a wider audience and encourage more people to read. Overall, libraries should continue to evolve and adapt to meet the needs of their patrons.
387	3364	2	3	Censorship is important when it comes to the media that people consume, such as books, movies, and music. However, completely removing offensive material from library shelves is not the solution. People have different opinions and what may be offensive to one person may not be to another. If everything deemed offensive is removed, there would be very little left for anyone to read, watch, or listen to.   Currently, there are measures in place such as ratings for movies and video games, as well as censoring of explicit language in music played on the radio. These actions allow individuals to make informed decisions about what media they consume. While some may argue that this is not enough, complete censorship would limit people's choices and potentially make others upset for not having access to the content they desire.  In conclusion, censorship can be effective without completely removing all media from shelves or the public sphere. It is important to strike a balance between protecting individuals from offensive material and allowing freedom of choice in what media they engage with. By maintaining a level of censorship that is mindful of diverse opinions, we can ensure that a variety of content is available for all to enjoy.
388	3365	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic of debate, with some arguing for restrictions on certain materials while others advocate for unrestricted access. Libraries are known for their diverse collection of books, magazines, movies, and music, catering to a wide range of interests and age groups. While some may argue that certain content is inappropriate for certain age groups, others believe that all materials should be available to the public.  It is important to have a variety of materials in libraries to cater to the diverse needs of the community. While the internet provides access to a vast amount of information, books are seen as more reliable sources as they have to go through a publication process. However, concerns may arise about children accessing inappropriate materials in libraries.  To address this issue, some suggest segregating materials based on age appropriateness and placing adult content in designated sections that are not accessible to children. This way, parents can feel more comfortable knowing that their children are not exposed to content that they deem inappropriate. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to monitor and guide their own and their children's reading choices.  In conclusion, while censorship in libraries is a complex issue, it is essential to strike a balance between providing access to a wide range of materials and ensuring that content is age-appropriate. By implementing measures to segregate materials and educate the public on responsible reading habits, libraries can continue to be valuable resources for all members of the community.
389	3366	2	3	Should certain materials be removed from library shelves just because they contain uncensored content? No, they should not be removed. While not everyone may appreciate such materials, it is important to respect individual preferences and allow people to make their own choices. In today's society, where people are exposed to all kinds of content, it is crucial for teenagers to learn to make their own decisions and navigate through different viewpoints. Censoring materials limits access to information and hinders intellectual growth. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to decide what they want to read and explore. Let us embrace diversity and freedom of expression in our libraries.
390	3367	2	3	The censorship of certain media is a highly debated topic, often boiling down to individual opinions rather than solid arguments. What one person finds offensive, another may not, making it challenging to determine when censorship is justified. Some content may intentionally provoke controversy, while others may inadvertently go against societal norms. Ultimately, the decision to censor material lies with the general public, influenced by current trends, ethics, and societal issues. If something goes against too many of these factors and upsets a significant portion of the population, it is likely to be removed from public access. In the end, censorship in libraries and other platforms is shaped by the collective opinions of society, reflecting the values and beliefs of the time.
391	3368	2	3	It is concerning to find inappropriate content in books, music, movies, and magazines in the children's section of libraries. Material containing profanity, sexual content, or offensive language should not be easily accessible to young readers. Parents should be able to trust that the items in the children's section are age-appropriate and suitable for their children. It is essential for libraries to be mindful of the content they offer to ensure a safe and positive environment for young readers.
392	3369	2	3	"All kids have their own style of books, whether they like scary, funny, or romance books, but can we really take that as an offense? Removing certain books from the shelves can impact more than one person, as some individuals may be mature enough to read more ""grown-up"" books or magazines. Libraries cater to different tastes and age groups, so finding the right book may require a bit of searching. It's important to consider how peer pressure can influence reading choices, as individuals may feel the need to conform to what their friends are reading. Books with offensive content should not automatically be banned, as everyone has the right to choose what they want to read. Instead of removing books, individuals can simply ignore those that they find offensive and seek out titles that align with their preferences. Libraries offer a diverse range of books to suit everyone's tastes, so it's important not to judge a book by its cover and to explore different genres to find what resonates with you."
393	3370	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' - @PERSON1     If one thinks about it books are such a magical escape from everyday life. They can take one anywhere they want to go at any time. Imagine a world where books are a luxury or where they are simply not present at all. I feel as if this would become an all too real reality if we censor books.      Where would the line be drawn saying a book is unfit to be read or placed into circulation. This would hold the world back since we could not express ourselves through our writing. So much would be left unsaid. I believe the quote stated above is quite true. If we place censorship on one book everyone has a right to ban other books as well. Just because certain books, movies, and magazines are deemed offensive to some, does not mean they should be banned for all. No one should be withheld from a book due to age, race, gender, or any other factor.      If one has ever been prohibited from doing something due to age or size the feeling is not pleasant. No one necessarily said anything mean or hurtful it just feels as if restrictions and boundaries were set for no particular reason. I have felt this way multiple times. I remember one time in particular. I went to Disneyland with a group of my cousins and their friends. Since I was the youngest I was also the shortest. I could not ride many of the rides there due to my size. I knew why those height requirements were set, for my personal safety. This makes sense, but why should one be required to be a certain age to watch a movie or watch a TV show. Honestly some people are more mature than others and grow up faster. Everyone is different. Everyone has a different personality and different perspective, there is no need to ban a book for everyone when we are all different. One should not be ineligible to read a book or magazine or watch a movie. Not wanting to is totally different from not getting to.       The popular book To Kill A Mockingbird was banned at one time in the United States simply for using the 'n-word'. This angers many especially when one ponders how much slavery as well as the Civil Rights Movement affected and shaped us into who we are today. America is a great nation because of the people who fought for equality. Do we need to have a reminder to not repeat history! Why should we restrict ourselves and limit our own personal freedoms? If anything is to be banned, I believe it is censorship.
394	3371	2	3	When one person is given the right to do something, then everyone else should have the same right. However, there are instances where individuals may abuse their rights. I believe that all forms of media, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, have a place on library shelves and should not be removed simply because they may be found offensive. Almost every piece of media will contain something that may offend someone, but it is important to consider the overall purpose and message it conveys.   I believe that every book, song, movie, or magazine serves a purpose, and if that purpose is deemed worthy of publication, then it should be made available to the public. Even if something is considered offensive, there may still be a valuable message within it that is worth sharing. While I have come across media that I personally found offensive, I have also recognized the underlying good message that it aimed to deliver.  In my opinion, no one should have the authority to remove any form of media from library shelves. Everything has a purpose and a message that can be meaningful to different individuals. It is essential to allow people the opportunity to explore and interpret various forms of media for themselves. By keeping a diverse range of content available in libraries, we can promote open-mindedness and critical thinking in our society.
395	3372	2	3	Yes, I think they should be removed from the shelves. Some books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are overrated and young children visit the library. They should have shelves for kids, teenagers, and grown-ups, each with their own section for their age group. Young kids are already exposed to inappropriate content, so it's important to have age-appropriate materials available. Parents should also take the time to discuss these topics with their children and provide guidance. Teenagers should have access to suitable content as well, avoiding themes of violence and explicit material. Overall, having designated sections for different age groups can help ensure that everyone has access to suitable and beneficial materials at the library.
396	3373	2	3	I honestly believe that everything should be allowed in libraries. The freedom of speech should be upheld, and individuals can choose not to engage with material they find offensive. While some content may be inappropriate for certain audiences, it can simply be relocated within the library to ensure it is not easily accessible to children and teenagers. Banning books or magazines based on their content is not the solution. Instead, proper placement and organization can help address concerns while still upholding the principles of freedom of speech. Libraries should strive to provide a diverse range of materials while also considering the needs and sensitivities of their patrons.
397	3374	2	3	Have you ever found a book offensive? Many people can say they have. They might not agree on the point of the book or certain viewpoints in the text. When this happens, people stop reading the book and other books in the same category. Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offending to certain people. Everyone has opinions, what would be left without books? At my public library, citizens of my city can request certain books, movies, music, or magazines to be put on the shelves. We are very blessed to have this available because if someone cannot afford certain books, they can always rely on the library. Many people have been very thankful for this system. If certain people at the library do not want to order certain books requested by citizens because they find them offensive, what would happen? More people would stop going to the library because there would be no materials sparking their interest. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Just because one person does not approve of a book does not mean that book should not be offered at the library. There are thousands and thousands of books on display at the public library, that does not mean you have to read all of them. There are also many different genres of novels, movies, music, and magazines. Everyone has interests in different types. If people all liked the same things, would not life be boring? In conclusion, certain materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offending to certain people. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. If a specific book is requested and one person finds it offending, the book should stay in the library. There are many different genres of books, music, movies, and magazines. Imagine if the library did not have a certain type of novel you enjoyed, would you continue to go?
398	3375	2	3	I think libraries should not remove offensive material from their shelves. While some people may find certain content offensive, others may still want to learn about that topic. Censorship can lead to conflicts and restrictions on what people can read, listen to, or believe in. It is important to allow for diverse viewpoints and opinions, even if they may be controversial. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and should be able to access a variety of perspectives. Ultimately, it is best to let individuals decide for themselves what they choose to engage with and not impose restrictions on access to information.
399	3376	2	3	Materials should not be removed from libraries. It should be left up to a person to decide what they see or view. Books, music, movies, etc., are materials used by everyone, and for some, a library provides a haven where they can access such resources. Removing materials limits individual choice and can hinder education. People have varying opinions on what should or should not be available, making it challenging to reach a consensus on censorship. Parents have the responsibility to monitor what their children read or watch, not libraries. Therefore, it is best to allow individuals to make their own choices when it comes to accessing materials in libraries.
400	3377	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be removed from libraries, unless they contain explicit content like nudity or excessive profanity. It is important to have a variety of resources available in libraries to cater to different interests and educational needs. While some content may not be suitable for young children, there should be mechanisms in place, such as age restrictions or parental permission, to control access to such materials. People should have the freedom to choose what they want to read or watch, as long as it does not harm others.  Removing offensive materials from libraries may limit the diversity of available resources and hinder individuals from accessing valuable information. Libraries play a crucial role in providing knowledge and entertainment to the public, and restricting certain materials goes against the principles of intellectual freedom. It is essential to balance the need for censorship with the right to access information. Overall, libraries should aim to offer a wide range of materials while implementing appropriate measures to regulate access to potentially sensitive content.
401	3378	2	3	People believe that censorship is important in libraries to prevent children from being exposed to bad language and inappropriate content. However, I disagree with this viewpoint. I believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves just because they contain cuss words or other controversial material. In a world filled with many negative influences, it is essential for children to learn about the realities of life. Exposure to different perspectives and experiences, even if they contain some rough language, can help individuals develop critical thinking skills and empathy. Ultimately, I believe that people should have the freedom to choose what they read or listen to, as long as it does not harm others or themselves. Letting individuals make their own decisions about what content they consume is crucial for promoting independence and personal growth. Therefore, I support the idea of keeping a variety of materials available in libraries and allowing individuals or their parents to determine what is appropriate for them.
402	3379	2	3	Dear @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3,  I am writing to address a concerning issue regarding the lack of book returns at our school library. Many students are failing to return borrowed materials, causing distress for those who need them for assignments. This negligence not only affects current students but will also impact future classes.  It is disheartening to see students disregard the importance of returning books, magazines, and other resources. While overdue fees and replacement costs are imposed as consequences, it is evident that these measures are not effective in ensuring compliance. The lack of returned materials hinders the academic progress of students who rely on them for their studies.  I believe that involving parents in emphasizing the importance of responsibility and accountability in returning borrowed items could help address this issue. By instilling a sense of ownership and respect for communal resources, students may be more inclined to fulfill their obligations.  In conclusion, it is essential for students to understand the significance of returning borrowed materials promptly. Failing to do so not only hampers the academic success of fellow students but also deprives future classes of essential resources. Let us work together to cultivate a culture of responsibility and respect for shared resources in our school community.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
403	3380	2	3	No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive. People have the right to choose what they want to read or ignore. Censorship in public libraries is not fair to those who may be offended by certain materials, but they always have the option to avoid them. It is important to be strong in one's beliefs and not let others' opinions bring you down. In life, there will always be people who disagree or have hurtful things to say, but it is essential to stand tall and not let them affect you. Embracing diversity of opinions and beliefs is crucial in a public space like a library, where everyone should have access to a wide range of materials without fear of censorship.
404	3381	2	3	I do not think that books should be taken off shelves just because it's offensive or because others don't like it. If everyone took the books, music, and movies off the shelves that they didn't like, then all that would be left would be empty bookshelves. I believe that the library has the right to keep whatever they want on the shelves. Some may say that the library has inappropriate books to check out, or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they don't like and read it. I think that's why the library has the shelves marked in sections for example, adult, young adult, children, and reference.  I've never seen a book that was offensive to me in a library, which brings me to another point. Everyone has an opinion, if a book is offensive to you it might not be offensive to someone else. For example, say that you saw a book on animal mating and you thought it was a bad book for the library to have because little kids might pick it up. Well, that is your opinion because if a biology teacher saw a book like that, then they might want to check it out.  Another thing is that the library has certain books for a reason. Say that there is a book in the library that is about slaves, this book might be offensive to some but it is there to inform people about slavery. What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others.  In conclusion, I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because it is offensive to you. Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it. That's why I think that books should not be taken off shelves.
405	3382	2	3	There are people in the world who might be offended by various types of literature, movies, music, or etcetera. I understand this, but I don't think they should be banned just because someone else doesn't agree with it. Other people might like it or they might like it themselves if they give a chance. Before you go saying that you don't like something maybe you should give a chance. Maybe try looking at a a few pages of a book you once heard about. Watch at least one or two episodes of television show. Before you make an ultimate decision about something, give it a chance first. Some people don't some media because it goes against their beliefs. If this is the case then just ignore it. If you don't like certain type of music don't listen to it. Maybe it is a movie your not particularly fond of then don't watch it. In conclusion, people should learn to give some things a chance. They should also shouldn't get rid of something just because they themselves aren't fond of it or find it offensive. That said, I don't believe that certain media should be banned.
406	3383	2	3	"For many students, composing essays in a public school library can be challenging due to the difficulty in finding necessary information. This issue is not a result of lack of funding or quality of teachers and staff. The main obstacle hindering students from creating thought-provoking essays and analyses is the extreme censorship imposed on libraries and schools. Many relevant topics and materials essential for understanding our evolving world are being restricted, depriving future leaders of valuable knowledge.  Examples of this censorship include the removal of books like ""@PERSON1,"" ""@PERSON2,"" the ""@CAPS1,"" and other classical works. While some parents argue for the removal of these books due to concerns about discrimination, racial supremacy, inappropriate language, or violation of the separation of church and state, these reasons may no longer be sufficient in today's changing environment.  Many of these banned books provide unfiltered perspectives from historical periods, offering valuable insights beyond the viewpoint of the dominant social groups. It is crucial to preserve diverse perspectives in our centers of knowledge to prevent repeating past mistakes. Shielding children from these realities by censoring libraries may ultimately hinder their understanding of the complex world they live in.  Parents who seek to protect their children's innocence by banning certain books must acknowledge that the media exposes children to similar content more extensively. Censoring libraries limits children's access to essential knowledge needed to comprehend the intricacies of our society. It is more beneficial for children to confront and understand reality than to navigate the world uninformed.  In conclusion, censoring libraries restricts students from gaining a comprehensive understanding of the world. Embracing diverse perspectives and acknowledging the complexities of history is crucial for educating future generations. It is through knowledge and understanding that we can equip our children to navigate the challenges of the world with clarity and insight."
407	3384	2	3	Should offensive material be removed from the library? I think no, and there are many reasons as to why I disagree with this idea. Many books, movies, and magazines are not meant to offend people, but just to express the author's perspective. Removing such material would limit the diversity of content available to readers. People have the freedom to choose what they read or watch, and if they find something offensive, they can simply choose not to engage with it. Censorship of offensive material goes against the principles of freedom of expression and intellectual freedom that libraries should uphold. It is important for libraries to offer a wide range of perspectives and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they consume. Instead of banning offensive material, it is better to promote critical thinking and open dialogue to address differing opinions and perspectives. In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from libraries as it is essential to maintaining intellectual freedom and fostering a diverse range of ideas and viewpoints.
408	3385	2	3	There are big debates today over whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive. Plenty of arguments are made from maybe somebody's own experience, observations, and/or reading. I have read plenty of people's concerns regarding @CAPS1 issue, and there are some valid points to be made from both sides of the story. No matter what your opinion on @CAPS1 issue is, there will always be someone who opposes of it. You see censorship of offensive language on television, but here is my take on whether or not censorship should take an effect on books, music, movies, magazines, etc. The first point that I would like to make about censorship is that people all across the world have come in contact with something that they @MONTH1 have thought to be offensive. When kids are old enough to understand what other people are talking about, they will come in contact with things that they take in offense at some point in life. I know from my own personal experience that you will see things that people think should be censored. Although I come from a religious family who does not like to offend anyone, I am old enough to realize that not everything in life is going to work out your way all the time. When you honestly think about it, you cannot censor out things that you hear in person, so why censor things in certain materials? The second point I would like to make about censorship is that no matter how much you try to censor certain materials, people will still find a way to take things offensive. There are certain things in life that you cannot control, and being insulted or offended is one of them. Even the most popular man or woman on the planet has been offended at least once or twice. It isn't about trying to censor every little thing that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. Maybe it is about the people learning to deal with a little criticism. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work i abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is a quote from Katherine Paterson that makes a big statement. Almost every well-written book that you will find on the shelf has something that should be censored. What would those books be without those statements? To conclude @CAPS1 debate on censorship, plenty of arguments have been made about the views of censorship. Many observations, personal experiences, and/or readings have been done by many different people. Truth is, there will always be people who disagree on @CAPS1 subject, but that is just the way things are. We @MONTH1 never know who is actually right or wrong about @CAPS1 topic. We do know though, that judging form the previous points above, it is very unlikely that certain materials will be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.
409	3386	2	3	Have you ever imagined a world without movies or music to entertain you? A world that has no books to read or magazines to inform you about the latest gossip and fashion? If certain materials are banned from being seen or read, there will be a lack of creativity, self-expression, and diversity. Without the freedom to explore different ideas and opinions, society will become homogeneous and dull. It is essential to preserve all forms of creative expression, even if they may be considered offensive to some, in order to maintain a vibrant and diverse culture. Creativity will be stifled, and individuality will be lost if we continue to censor and restrict access to certain materials. Let us cherish the variety of perspectives and ideas that different forms of media offer, as they enrich our lives and make the world a more interesting and dynamic place to live.
410	3387	2	3	Any individual has the right to choose what they want to consume, whether it is censored or uncensored media. Censorship in the media varies, with some outlets offering both censored and uncensored options for consumers. Parents play a crucial role in determining what their children can access, whether through monitoring their media consumption or utilizing parental controls. However, it can be challenging to completely shelter children from explicit content, as they may encounter it elsewhere. Ultimately, everyone has different views on censorship, and it is important for individuals to have the freedom to choose what aligns with their preferences. By offering a range of options, stores cater to diverse needs and preferences in the media landscape.
411	3388	2	3	@CAPS1 is the freedom of speech, allowing individuals to access, express, and consume various forms of information without restriction. While it grants us the liberty to voice our opinions and beliefs, it comes with a responsibility to consider the impact of our words and actions. As Americans, we have the privilege to speak our minds, but we must also be mindful of the consequences of spreading harmful ideologies.   It is essential to exercise caution in disseminating information that may incite violence or promote destructive behaviors. Certain books, such as those advocating for terrorism or substance abuse, should be removed from shelves to protect the well-being of our society, particularly our youth. The media we consume plays a significant role in shaping our perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors, influencing how we interact with others and the world around us.   Ultimately, while freedom of speech is a fundamental right, it is crucial to use it responsibly and ethically. Our words have the power to inspire positive change or perpetuate harm, and it is essential to consider the impact of our expressions on others. By promoting thoughtful and considerate communication, we can contribute to a more inclusive and respectful society for all.
412	3389	2	3	People should not take all the books out of the library because it deprives others of the opportunity to access those materials. Implementing a limit on the number of books that can be checked out at one time, as well as setting specific return deadlines, can help ensure that resources are shared fairly among all library users. Additionally, it is important to respect the work of authors and creators by keeping their works available for others to enjoy. While certain materials may be deemed inappropriate and should be removed from shelves, it is crucial to maintain a balance between censorship and access to diverse content. By following these guidelines, we can promote a more equitable and enriching library experience for everyone.
413	3390	2	3	I believe that all the uncensored books, movies, music, and magazines in a library should be taken off the shelves and put into a single room in the library and be labeled as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The children that go into the library at most libraries have a space where it's just kids' books, but when the kids go with their parents or someone older up to the teenager and @CAPS1 @CAPS2, they may not know what they are looking at when they pick up a random book or video.   Some people may think it shouldn't be like that because they are wary of who might see them go into a room marked @CAPS1 @CAPS2. However, if you don't want anyone to see you go into that room, you simply don't go in. By secluding the @CAPS1 content, children can be kept from accessing inappropriate material and potentially being influenced at a young age.   As for music, it's challenging to prevent kids from listening to music with explicit content, such as rap. Parents should take responsibility for monitoring what their children listen to and educate them about the consequences of certain actions portrayed in music. By setting boundaries and providing guidance, parents can help steer their children away from negative influences.   In conclusion, segregating uncensored material in libraries can help protect children from exposure to inappropriate content. Parents play a crucial role in monitoring their children's media consumption and guiding them towards positive influences. By working together, we can create a safer environment for children to grow up in.
414	3391	2	3	'@CAPS1'@CAPS2 say that word!' That is exactly what I said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon. Personally, I am an advocate of not saying curse words. Yet, my brothers are influenced by things, such as the media, to say them. Should we allow the media to sprinkle words like this on to magazines and books? Or should the items containing these things be removed from the library's shelving units?  Magazines are one of many ways that we get the latest gossip on the most interesting scandals. They also appeal to a lot of people across the world. Most of those people are adults of age. Libraries will most often place the magazines on the shelf so that they can rake in some adult customers. Most of the content of the magazines are pictures of half-dressed women or men and explicit language on the covers these days. Should that be the new normal? I don't think so.  I enjoy reading. I personally think that reading is better than sitting on the couch and watching mind-numbing T.V. But, the material of some books have gotten to be where every other word is a curse word. Or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read. It used to be that books were read to learn something new, or to open your mind to a new culture or piece of information. In these times, though, it seems arduous to come across a good book that is like the classics. As though day by day, we are replacing the majestic words of authors for common words that anyone can use. Replacing such books like these on the shelves for anyone to read isn't right. It shouldn't even be allowed.  With electronic devices such as the MP3 player and so on, most of the music comes from online sites where you purchase the song directly. Most parents don't know half the songs that the children buy, especially when they buy it at home. With the internet in many libraries, kids can plug in their device and buy songs with offensive language or graphic material without anyone knowing. Why don't the librarians put restrictions on the sites? The answer is that they can't. And, even if they did, children would find a way to get around the restrictions. So, personally I think that they should remove the availability of being able to download and purchase music at the library. Or take out the awful language altogether in songs. Because the language that they use is not needed.  Although times are constantly changing and things are different than they used to be, with a little help we can restore it to where it used to be. Kids using such foul language is an issue that needs to be taken seriously. From my own experiences, I know that it is a growing problem. But, maybe if we put censorship in libraries then some or most of the problems can disappear. From magazine articles, books, and even songs explicit language and graphic scenes are almost everywhere. So, speak up and talk to someone about the idea. It might just start a revolution. Let's work together to create a better and more wholesome environment for everyone.
415	3392	2	3	Everybody has their own opinions on censorship, with some people preferring to avoid books and movies with profanity while others enjoy them. While some may find certain content inappropriate and wish for it to be removed, it may not be the case for everyone. It's important to remember that what offends one person may not offend another. For example, while some may find magazines featuring nude women disrespectful, others may view it as creative and beautiful. Ultimately, if something offends you, the best course of action may simply be to avoid it. In a diverse society, it's impossible to cater to everyone's preferences when it comes to censorship.
416	3393	2	3	Should certain materials be removed from your public library? Not everyone has the same views as each other. What might be offenses to you, might be enjoyable to someone else. I personally don't believe that anything should be removed from a library, just because something you might not like someone could really enjoy. If you don't want to learn about something you shouldn't take that away from others who do.  I think that if they do start removing things from library shelves they should still be allowed to be viewed to those who want to. Even if you just put them away would be better than taking them out of the library completely. More and more books are banned everyday, and I personally don't think that's fair to the growing generation who don't get to enjoy the things the old generation have.  So I believe that no books should be removed from library's. If you don't believe or enjoy something doesn't mean someone else won't.
417	3394	2	3	"What is appropriate in libraries these days? The opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across @LOCATION1.  Censorship has taken a turn in public libraries, but still has been strictly forbidden from school libraries. Personally, I think that there is a difference between vulgar and inappropriate items in a public library versus a school library.   A public library is a place for anyone and anywhere to come and find an item that they are interested in. As we all know, everyone is different and has their own interests, so they should be able to find the book, music, etc. for them. The problem is, how do the libraries keep these uncensored objects out of children's hands? The answer should be simple. For thought, maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections, each with their own subject matter. These different sections could include Children's, Young Adult, and many more different titles. This setup is often used in well-known bookstores and libraries such as Barnes & Noble and Library of Congress. Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as school libraries.  School libraries are a whole different idea. School libraries are made to help assist the students' academic achievement, nothing more and nothing less. However, I also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students. For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have stricter censorship than high school libraries. The students in high school should be mature enough to handle uncensored material without creating a huge scene, like we all know younger students would do. I have personally seen and witnessed a few so-called 'inappropriate' books on the shelf at my high school library, but the readers of the book have been mature about reading it. I believe that some offensive and vulgar items can be interesting and educational. It is all a part of growing up.  The censorship in our libraries today varies from each library to the next. School libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content. I think that it is a person's own personal decision dealing with which library they go to. If a family with young children wants to go to the library, the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children. Therefore, there should be no problem in running across a 'bad' book. The author, @PERSON1, states, ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf... And then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone."""
418	3395	2	3	The Author should be the judge on whether or not they want their book censored. I believe that libraries shouldn't have to take out books with offensive language. If the author likes how it was originally made, then that's how they would like to present it. It would be taking away a Right in the society. If you were to write a book and somebody says you can't put a certain word. That isn't up to the public to make a decision.  It's almost like rewriting history. It would be like having someone take out a word in the Bible. If any word is changed, it is an incorrect interpretation. It just changes the entire subject. You cannot reword what's been written.  Public views are starting to take over the world. Instead of letting the facts be the facts, people want to adjust things so it is less offensive. Next thing you know there will be a replaced word for slavery. Slavery is a strong, bold word that represents a horrible thing. If somebody switched that word, it could lead to it happening again. I say with all my heart that people need to respect what has been written and leave it that way or don't read it.
419	3396	2	3	First of all, Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, that question should not be asked ever in life. There are many people out there that read and listen to things that you might not like at all. When I first saw this question, I thought to myself that if everyone thought the same way, this world would be boring. Therefore, there should not be any books or music removed from any shelves because we all have different tastes and preferences.  I know that people have different interests and hobbies, and just because something offends one person, it doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else. It is important to respect diversity and allow people to enjoy what they love, even if it may not be to everyone's liking.  In conclusion, I believe that people should not remove anything from libraries, even if it is offensive to some. These materials help others pursue their passions and interests, and everyone deserves the freedom to choose what they want to read or listen to. Let's make decisions that do not harm anyone and uphold the principles of tolerance and diversity. Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.
420	3397	2	3	One person's strong negative opinion affects everyone else. That doesn't seem logical or fair. A library is a sanctuary for people to go read their favorite books for free, containing books from all types of genres. There is a book for everyone in the library; it's a matter of finding it. Therefore, finding a book offensive or unsuitable does not give one the right to take that privilege away from everyone else. Books have a way of putting our minds at ease, whether that's because it's an escape or measured on how enjoyable it is to read. Books found offensive to one person could have a completely different impact on the next reader; some may even find the books relatable. For example, if there was a scene that one reader thought was too graphic or horrific for other readers, there may be someone out there who would find this scene enjoyable because they can relate to it. People who aren't capable of relating to such a scene would only find it as inappropriate and try to remove it from another's reach. One person's opinion is not of any more importance than the next person's. The book '@CAPS1' is a professionally written, fictional novel that has been praised for its quality, hence the numerous awards won. Although, this book contains a rape scene and numerous other inappropriate events that this woman was succumbed to throughout her life. Even so, it is still on the list of suggested college level reads for English classes. It is disappointing to think that people nowadays focus on the graphic scenes in a novel, versus the exceptional writing style. If all readers were able to look past the surface among these scenes, less books would be contemplated on shelf removal. One person's negative interpretation of a novel affects everyone else's right concerning the censorship in libraries. Readers are fully warned beforehand of the maturity of the contents. The books are ranked, critiqued, summarized (back cover summary), and even sorted in a library. If one finds a book offensive, look in a different section. Books are sorted by genre for that reason as well; different genres appeal to different people. This applies to the maturity of the reader as well. Books are sorted according to what appeals to what age. If you find a book offensive, instead of having it removed from the shelf altogether, look in a section for younger people, or a different genre completely. If someone finds the book offensive, the fault is not of the book being there, but of the person being in the wrong section. The main problem concerning book censorship in libraries is not the content, but how the interpretations differentiate towards such content. On this issue, the other readers' opinions on specific books being removed are being significantly overlooked. For one to complain about a book's contents automatically give someone else the right to protect the book's contents. For libraries to remove books in order of censorship is viewed as favoritism and is completely against the rights the location has stood for.
421	3398	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic, with some advocating for certain materials to be restricted while others argue for unrestricted access to all content. I believe that as long as materials are properly categorized and age restrictions are in place, individuals should have the freedom to access a wide range of materials. Libraries play a crucial role in research and education, and limiting access to certain materials can hinder the learning process. By implementing age restrictions and creating designated areas for different age groups, libraries can ensure that individuals have access to the materials they need while also protecting young audiences from potentially inappropriate content. It is important to balance the freedom of speech for authors with the need to protect individuals from materials they may find offensive. Overall, censorship should be approached with caution, and measures should be taken to allow for a diverse range of materials to be available in libraries while also ensuring the protection of vulnerable audiences.
422	3399	2	3	Libraries should not remove a book from the shelves just because someone finds it offensive. If a book is popular among a group of people, it should not be taken away just because one or two individuals have a different opinion. It is important to respect diverse perspectives and allow everyone the opportunity to access a variety of literary works.  When it comes to music, movies, and magazines, libraries should also be mindful of the content they provide. Materials should be age-appropriate and free from explicit or harmful content. It is crucial to consider the impact these media can have on children and young adults, ensuring that they are exposed to positive and educational material.  Overall, libraries play a significant role in providing access to a wide range of resources for the community. It is essential for them to maintain a balance between freedom of expression and responsible curation to create a safe and enriching environment for all patrons. By being vigilant and considerate of the content they offer, libraries can continue to serve as valuable sources of knowledge and entertainment for people of all ages.
423	3400	2	3	People may find certain things in libraries offensive, depending on their beliefs and cultural background. For parents, offensive content in libraries, such as inappropriate movies, can be a concern when it comes to their children. One way to address this issue is for parents to monitor their children closely and ensure they only access age-appropriate materials.   Sometimes, individuals may feel offended by certain items in the library, especially if others make a spectacle of it. In such cases, it's best to ignore the offensive material or address it calmly with library staff. Constructive feedback can lead to positive changes in the library environment.   Ultimately, everyone has different sensitivities, but it's important to handle situations with respect and open communication. If something in the library is truly offensive, it's best to address it politely and professionally. In the end, it's essential to focus on living life without letting minor library issues affect one's overall well-being.
424	3401	2	3	I do not think books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed because they are offensive. There are books, movies, and music that offend everyone, and if we took them all away, we would have nothing. There is no reason for all that. That's why I say we do not take away offensive materials.  First, if we took away all the offensive materials off the shelves, they would be empty. As well as the library, the movie store, and everything else. If something like a book or movie offends you, I feel bad for you anyways, but just put it down and don't worry about it.  Second, I don't think we should remove offensive materials off the shelves because of what they mean to us. They show us the good and bad, the right and wrong; that's what books are for. Books are important to this world, as well as movies and magazines and such. But to some more than others. You can't get mad at a book or a movie, so just learn from them.  For instance, say we did take away all the offensive materials, what is that going to do? Is it going to make the world a better place? I don't think so. I think we need stuff like that on earth to show and to teach us the way to be, to educate and informate.  In conclusion, I do not think offensive materials should be removed. We would have nothing, and the libraries, movie stores, and books would be empty. We would also be pretty misinformed about life. So we should not remove offensive materials off the shelves.
425	3402	2	3	In the world, there are just some things that our children should not be exposed to. I believe that the media such as music, magazines, and movies set a high bar for the individuals in our society. I highly disagree with what the media feeds to our minds as to the way our looks and lifestyle should be.  The library is a place where most children go to feed their imaginations with colorful books with morals; but the library is also where adults go to free their minds of work and to escape many of life's responsibilities. Most children from ages 8 to 12 draw a curious mind to the very adult world and seek to find answers. Now the library is not a place where a child can receive adult information right? Wrong! the library shelves are open to any and everyone's advantage. A child can just as easily come across the wrong track to take one's innocence. Some parents in society believe that their neighborhood is a perfect harm-free environment to raise children. Little do parents know, it is a very uncensored world and at any time a child can learn of its existence.  The media draws its attention to captivate our children. We have to watch what we let our kids watch, listen to, and read. For example, the girl in the magazine who just recently got a nose job because her nose was too big is feeding the idea to your eight-year-old daughter. She believes that she can receive surgery to fix her big nose that the kids at school tease her about. Maybe your son listens to rap or rock music that condones the use of violence, drug, and alcohol use. He will think it's okay to pick fights at school with other children or curse the teacher. Or the movie with the sex scene in it could give your child the idea to go out and practice what was taught.  In our society, there should not be an image that our children should try to sustain. We should teach our children that life is better explored through Disney's 'Frozen' or through the wonderful adventures of 'The Chronicles of Narnia'. Parents should feed kids' imagination and not feed their 'image'. Life for our children should be about fun, knowledge, and life experience; but not everything that is on the shelves of our local library. Let us protect our children from the negative influences of the media and guide them towards a path of positivity and growth.
426	3403	2	3	Every time you walk into a library, you are surrounded with books and other learning or reading material. Yes this material is helpfull in finding things to pass the time or to help understand a certain subject, but some have been found offensive. Stories such as romance novels or vulgar horror and action stories have been viewed as innapropriet to some ages. These novels contain anything from brutal horror, to adult material, or foul language. Parents argue that these books should be removed from the libraries.   I do not agree. I beleive that such books and novels can be a great help to the immagination of others and get the mind flowing. Yes i do agree that some novels are not age apropriate for young children, but that does'nt mean that they should be removed. I think that if people are so worried about their children reading these books that they should either go into the library with their child, or simply give the child a certain area that they are allowed to pick a book from.   Another way of avoiding these wrightings getting into the wrong hands is to section off the more aggressive and adulterated books to a certain spot in the library and allow only age apropriate people inside. An age restriction of thirteen years and up would be a responsible decision. An age younger could be innapropriate for them, but any older and it could keep them from learning and expanding their mind to it's full potential.   The point of this writing is to show that removing these books and novels from the libraries is not going to help anything. if anything it could hurt us by not allowing our minds to reach newer and higher limmets by learning and understanding the complexity of these novels. sectioning off these novels in an age apropriate area or having parental discression will help to keep the age correct for the books that they get.
427	3404	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic that often sparks debate. While some argue that offensive books should be removed from shelves to protect children, others believe that adults should have access to a wide range of materials. As a child who frequented libraries, I never encountered anything offensive. My reading preferences leaned towards sports biographies and magazines about sports and cars, so I rarely delved into controversial topics. If offensive books exist in libraries, they are likely hidden from children, and adults who seek them out can inquire about their availability. Therefore, in my opinion, libraries should not have to remove potentially offensive material as long as they are not easily accessible to young audiences.
428	3405	2	3	We see them. We read them. We gossip about them. Books that are found with inappropriate language, pages with the word 'sex' on them, disturbing thoughts and ideas, cuss words, it's all there, but yet they are still in our libraries. My views on censorship is that, yes, our libraries should be more modest and not have books on the shelves with these things in them. The books in libraries across the country that have found and profane ideas in them is one of the direct faults in our teenagers today.  In my personal experience with this, I have come across books that have had inappropriate language in them. I have also read books assigned to me at school that have had descriptions of sex and bad language in them as a third grader. As a young boy, I would go home to my parents and show them the content of the book and how spiteful it was. I've always been raised in a conservative home and seeing these things not only in schools but on the bookshelves in libraries I believe is uncalled for. I know that there are so many things that could offend people. Racism, sex, cussing, rules, religion, but you need to eliminate the main things. It is impossible to please everyone. These ideas in magazines, books, in movies, and even in music has changed the world upside down. Even when I was young, we were taught no cussing allowed, and yet you see this all the time in books.  In our country, of course, we have the freedom to do what we want. Authors have the right to put profane language in their books, and even dirty ideas. However, libraries are not forced to keep this content in their libraries. I believe that we should keep the future in mind, that if we teach them this material, they are going to grow up in a world with no morals at all, and the world will become worse than it already is.  In the quote by Katherine Paterson, I believe that she has made a strong point. If we take the books off of shelves, then our students, children, grandchildren won't be taught properly, and then there would be no education at all. However, I believe that from this quote even she agrees we fear what our children read. So yet, why do we keep these books in our libraries? I believe that if we take these certain books, magazines, movies, songs, and internet sites off the computers, and out of libraries and schools, teenagers wouldn't be traveling down the road they are.  Today, the world has turned to a disaster. The kids we saw years ago were on the right path. Now those same kids are smoking pot, having sex, getting girls pregnant, abortions, miscarriages, things that are not appropriate. And I truly believe that this content students read in schools and libraries has something to do with it all. It is now in the hands of the future, whether our kids grow up to be the future or the joke of the country. We need this fixed.

Censorship only fuels curiosity, as individuals are naturally inclined to rebel against restrictions. Additionally, censoring books hinders learning by sheltering individuals from real-life situations and language. In the unfiltered world we live in, where offensive language and topics are a reality, it is essential for individuals to be exposed to varying perspectives and beliefs. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right that should extend to literature, allowing individuals to express their thoughts and ideas. While some may find certain content offensive, it is crucial to approach such material with maturity and open-mindedness. Ultimately, censorship of books is not the solution to addressing offensive content, as it restricts individual freedom and inhibits learning and growth.
430	3407	2	3	Books play a significant role in people's lives, whether for educational purposes, entertainment, or other reasons. However, some books can be offensive to certain readers. The question arises whether offensive material should be removed from shelves. There are arguments against this notion.  Firstly, individuals have different perspectives on what constitutes offensive material. What may be offensive to one person may not be perceived the same way by another. Some readers may find certain language or descriptions necessary for the context of a book, while others may deem it offensive. This subjectivity highlights the challenge of determining what should be considered offensive and subsequently removed.  Moreover, individuals are generally taught to recognize and avoid content that they find offensive. It is essential for readers to exercise their discretion and stop engaging with material that they find objectionable. This self-regulation can prevent unnecessary censorship and allow individuals to make informed choices about their reading preferences.  Additionally, even if certain material is offensive to some, it should not automatically warrant removal. Removing books based on individual offense could lead to a slippery slope where any content could be deemed offensive by someone. This could ultimately limit access to diverse perspectives and ideas, stifling intellectual freedom.  In conclusion, while some books may contain offensive material, it is important to consider the subjective nature of offense, the importance of individual discretion, and the implications of widespread censorship. Instead of removing books based on offense, promoting open dialogue and understanding different viewpoints can lead to a more nuanced approach to dealing with potentially offensive material.
431	3408	2	3	Every parent has their own opinion upon topics like this; but even if you were to censor out books, movies, music, etc., your child would still be allowed to find that book or movie on the internet uncensored. Yes, parents believe that having things censored will be better for their children, but children have much more technology and much more access to uncensored music. As each day goes by, the minds of children become more and more curious about what the world has to offer.  The more parents keep their children away from things in life, the more chance they have of their child sneaking out or just not being the person you thought they would be. Every person is their own person; I personally would say to just leave the books, music, movies, etc. on the shelves of libraries; children will find out anyways, whether it is from friends or the media.  It's not to say that your child will become corrupt if listening to such music, but I believe that at a certain age parents should have talks with their children about things happening in the world, because children will not remain children for long and parents will not be able to control them forever.  Everybody was a child at one point in time, and I am pretty sure that most parents disliked when their parents kept them away from things they wanted to do or see, but life isn't fair, and these are just one person's opinions. Whether you decide to take all the music and censor it out or if you do the same to all the books and movies, there will still be unhappy adults and unhappy parents. No matter what happens, children will find their way around these things; it never fails.  There will always be some way your child can get around you, always going to be some way your kids will get past your rules; just think about it, if they disobey you once, they will most likely do it again. It is in a child's nature. So, like I said before, every parent and every person has their own opinion on topics like this. Personally, I say just leave it and let the parents of these children handle it the way they would like to, because you cannot please everybody.
432	3409	2	3	Books, music, and movies should not be removed from shelves simply because they are found offensive. These forms of media serve as outlets for expression and creativity, allowing individuals to share their thoughts, emotions, and perspectives with the world. While some may find certain content offensive, it is important to remember that art is subjective and can have different meanings to different people. Instead of censoring or banning these works, it is crucial to engage in open-minded discussions and debates, allowing for a better understanding of diverse viewpoints and promoting freedom of expression. Censorship should only be considered in extreme cases where content is truly harmful or dangerous, rather than simply being deemed offensive. Embracing the diversity of ideas and opinions in literature, music, and film is essential for a society that values creativity, critical thinking, and the exchange of ideas.
433	3410	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves in libraries or any other place. I believe that if someone wants to know more information about something, the library or the arts should be able to provide it for them. Removing these materials would discourage people from visiting these institutions, which serve as important repositories of our history and achievements.  Libraries and art spaces offer a glimpse into our past, showing us where we have been and what we have accomplished. Without access to a diverse range of materials, we would be limited in our understanding of the world around us. While some may find certain materials offensive, they may hold valuable historical information for others.  Many people rely on books, magazines, and music to gather information and gain knowledge. Everyone has a right to access information about the past to understand how we arrived at our present. By censoring materials that may seem offensive, we risk losing valuable insights into our history.  I believe that all information should be preserved in libraries, museums, and art galleries, as each piece has its own unique history and significance. By keeping a wide range of materials available, we can ensure that future generations have a comprehensive understanding of our collective past. It is important to embrace diversity in information and knowledge, rather than hiding or censoring it. After all, knowledge is power, and we should strive to learn and understand as much as we can about the world around us.
434	3411	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from public libraries to protect young children from inappropriate content. If a child were to stumble across an inappropriate magazine, the images could stick in their minds and potentially lead to negative outcomes. While some may argue that fictional books are just entertainment and not to be taken seriously, it is important to consider the impact of exposure to offensive material on young, impressionable minds.   Although there are sections in libraries designated for adults, they are not always monitored, making it easy for children to access material that is not suitable for their age group. In today's society, children are already exposed to a lot of graphic content through various forms of media, so limiting their access in public libraries may be a necessary precaution.   While some may argue that children will eventually become desensitized to offensive material, it is important to consider the potential harm that exposure to such content can have on their development. It is better to err on the side of caution and remove potentially harmful materials from public libraries to protect the innocence and well-being of young children. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a safe and appropriate environment for children to learn and explore without the risk of being exposed to inappropriate content.
435	3412	2	3	Offensive materials in libraries can be concerning, especially when children come across them unintentionally. While libraries should have the freedom to offer a wide range of topics, it is important to consider age-appropriateness. Organizing materials by age groups can help ensure that children are not exposed to content that may be harmful or inappropriate for their level of understanding. By categorizing books and resources based on age, libraries can still provide access to a variety of information while protecting young readers from potentially harmful content. This approach can help children explore and learn in a safe and suitable manner, promoting a positive and enriching library experience for all visitors.
436	3413	2	3	I don't think anything should be taken off the shelves at libraries, especially if it is educational for children. Libraries offer a wealth of knowledge that can benefit young minds in various ways. Children can learn a lot from the books available at libraries, and they can find answers to their questions and help with their studies.   As I grew up, I relied on the library for resources and information for school. The educational materials found in libraries are invaluable for children's learning and development. It is important to remember that not everything can be found on the internet, and some information is best accessed through books.   Parents should not remove valuable resources from libraries that can help their children. The content available at libraries is carefully curated to be educational and beneficial. Many scientists and researchers have found valuable information in books, proving that libraries are essential for research and learning.   In conclusion, libraries offer a wide range of educational materials that can benefit children in numerous ways. It is important to preserve these resources and allow children to access them for their academic and personal growth. Removing materials from libraries would only hinder children's opportunities to learn and explore new ideas.
437	3414	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, do not need to be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive. People build their character through their reactions of how people treat them. Books and movies do not need to be taken off of shelves in libraries if they are found offensive because there are a lot of things in the real world that are offensive. It is your choice in what you want to read, listen to, or watch. Trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time. The quote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us', by Katherine Paterson, is a perfect example to conclude the reasons why books should not be taken off the shelf. In conclusion, if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offend you, simply do not check them out. You do not need to get rid of them because somebody else may want to check them out.
438	3415	2	3	No i do not think that books and other materials should be taken off the shelves of a library if someone thinks its offensive. Everyone has a different opinion on what books they like to read. I think that if you dont like the book and think its offensive that you shouldnt get the book and just leave it there because someone else might like that book and want to read it. Not everyone likes the same books but every book in a library is there for a reason. The library screans all of the books that they get in and wouldnt buy something if no one asked for it or if it wasnt a good book to have. I think that everyone has a right to read what they like to read and that no one should have the right to take books off of shelves in a library because what if someone is looking for that book and the library is the only place that has it. Then where would people spend their time reading and enjoing the books that they have an intrest in? If everyone could just pull a book off a shelf when they thought it was offensive there wouldnt be any books left on the shelves and no one would have books to read. I also think that if you dont like the selection of books on the shelf that you shouldnt be lookin in that section, go to another part of the library and look at the types of books that you like to read. Theres something for everyone in a library. This is why i think its not a good idea to be able to take books off of shelves, no one would have any books that they like to read if everyone did that when they saw something 'offensive'.
439	3416	2	3	I think that there are some books out there that really do need to be taken on the library shelves and just be put in book stores for ones own useage. Then there are other books that people just need to be more mature about like history books talking about wars, slavery and books with curse words in them.  School libraries such as the elementary and high school should have books according to their age groups. If the librarian knows the book is not something a young kid should read then they shouldn't let them check it out. The music, magazines and movies should also be age appropriate for the age groups. Too little children do not need to hear curse words every five seconds in a song.  Movies should be age appropriate too. That's why libraries have sections for babies, toddlers, pre-teens, teens, and adults so if you're really concerned that your child or even just yourself are going to find an offensive book or one that's not good for the age group then stay in your own section. Let's say you're a teen and there's a book that is not right for you to read and is for older people, then you should be able to tell a librarian and maybe they can move it out of that section.  Every person feels differently about what's offensive and not offensive though so libraries shouldn't have to take out every book that offends one person because it's not fair to the rest of the people. Besides, no one's making you check out that book.
440	3417	2	3	I believe that censorship in libraries is unnecessary, as individuals should not have the authority to remove items from the shelves. The decision to keep or remove materials should rest with library managers, who can consider all perspectives. Libraries should offer a diverse range of content to cater to different preferences, and patrons should respect the library's collection choices. Ultimately, the freedom to access information should be upheld, and censorship should be minimized to promote intellectual freedom and inclusivity in libraries.
441	3418	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,  I strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are young children who may come across books, movies, music cases, or magazines that contain inappropriate content, and we must protect them from exposure to such material. It is essential to consider the impact that these items can have on young, impressionable minds.  Children are like sponges, absorbing everything they see and hear. Exposing them to explicit content at a young age can shape their beliefs and behaviors in ways that are not conducive to their development. As responsible adults, we must ensure that children are shielded from harmful influences and guided towards positive and wholesome content.  Companies should take responsibility for the messages they are promoting and the impact it may have on young audiences. It is not enough to prioritize sales over the well-being of children. By offering edited versions of products or selling them online where parental supervision can be better managed, companies can still cater to adult audiences without compromising the innocence of children.  As parents, we must be vigilant in monitoring the media our children consume and actively seek out age-appropriate content for them. By creating a safe and nurturing environment for our children, we can help them grow into well-adjusted individuals who are not desensitized to violence, explicit language, or inappropriate behavior.  In conclusion, it is crucial to protect children from exposure to offensive materials and ensure that they are surrounded by positive influences that foster their growth and development. By collectively taking a stand against harmful content, we can create a safer and more nurturing environment for our children to thrive in.  Thank you,  @PERSON2
442	3419	2	3	"I myself believe that books should be removed from shelves due to offensive content. I also find it disrespectful when people ignore others while reading. Reading, to me, is often boring and tiring unless the book is engaging. I suggest removing certain movies as well, especially those with mythical creatures like Harry Potter and Twilight. Music, on the other hand, is easier to relate to and can reveal a person's character. I prefer listening to music over reading or watching movies. Some of my favorite books are ""Blood is Thicker"" and ""Until We Meet Again."" When it comes to movies, I enjoy the Fast and Furious series, The Lion King, and The Karate Kid. As for music, I listen to a variety of artists who excel in their craft and connect with their audience. In my opinion, music surpasses books and movies in popularity, as evidenced by album sales and surveys. Therefore, I stand by my belief that music is superior to other forms of entertainment."
443	3420	2	3	Sometimes, it is important to have appropriate material on the shelves of stores or in a library. However, there is value in keeping offensive materials available as well. Many people are drawn to offensive content, whether in music, movies, books, or magazines. This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as finding a reflection of their own experiences or seeking entertainment that pushes boundaries.  Offensive music, for example, can influence the style and behavior of listeners, especially young people. Movies and television shows with offensive content can also provide valuable lessons or advice for those who are open to learning from them. Books, on the other hand, offer a wide range of genres and themes, including reflections of real-life experiences that some readers may relate to.  While magazines often thrive on gossip and false information, they still have a place on shelves for those who enjoy that type of content. Overall, the availability of offensive materials in stores allows individuals to choose what they want to consume and can cater to a variety of interests and preferences. Ultimately, the decision to keep offensive materials on shelves can provide valuable opportunities for learning, reflection, and entertainment.
444	3421	2	3	@PERSON1, an author, once said; 'All of use can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In other words, she @CAPS2 prooving the fact that books should not be censored in any form of way, in which I take the affirmative side on.  To begin with, censorship @CAPS2 simply the banning of certain things that are thought to be offensive. An example of this would be the society in the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1' by @PERSON2. In this book, @PERSON3, the main character and eventually the protagonist, @CAPS2 a firefighter that cause fires instead of putting them out. The government believes that books are dangerous because they cause people to become knowledgable so as a result, they order people to burn them, making society ignorant and a potential 'slave' to their government. Despite loosing his job and almost being killed by the goverment, @PERSON3 rises to understand that books have true meaning and that what the government @CAPS2 doing @CAPS2 wrong.  This topic now poses a question: '@CAPS2 all censorship bad?' Of course not. Some censorship should be allowed as a matter of fact. For example, any form of media whether it @CAPS2 books or magazines that portreys hatred toward a certain religion or group should be censored by the government because according to our constitution, people have the right to believe and practice whatever they wish (also know as 'freedom of speech'). However, the majority of censorship does not take a good side. In the political world today, censorship @CAPS2 applied to people who speak out against their government or leader due to the fact that they had been dishonest or ruthless to the people. Even in our country today, the government applies this which in some cases violates the constitution because people have the freedom of speech, but to a certain extent only.  Overall, the negative outcomes of censorship outweigh the positive outcomes. Censorship causes people to become uneducated which on the other hand makes it illegal for a person to speak out against something even if it @CAPS2 wrong. On the other had, censorship towards things that portey hatred @CAPS2 not bad either. In conclusion however, bad censorship causes people to become uneducated, at the end resulting in pure ignorance.
445	3422	2	3	I find it interesting that people believe it is their responsibility to dictate what should and should not be available in libraries. If someone doesn't like a book, they can simply choose not to read it instead of trying to censor it for others. While I understand concerns about inappropriate magazines, ultimately it is not up to individuals to decide what is right or wrong for others to access.  When it comes to music, I agree with removing certain explicit content from libraries, especially if it is harmful for children. The influence of violent or hateful music on society cannot be ignored. Movies, on the other hand, are generally well-regulated in libraries, and I have no major complaints about their selection.  Overall, libraries are doing a commendable job in managing their collections. While there are things I might personally change, as a young individual, my opinions may not carry much weight. I will always love libraries, and if something doesn't appeal to me, I simply choose to avoid it, which I believe is how everyone should approach library content.
446	3423	2	3	'Should libraries censor reading material's to students at school.' That is a yes and no question because reading is good for people of all ages; it just depends on whether the topic is suitable for a certain age group. Yes, I do think they should censor reading material, but to an extent. They need to have books for kids in certain age groups - like sections for young kids, teens, and adults. If a child wants to read more graphic material, they must have permission from their parent. The reason I say this is that there are things that get published by authors that are meant to be read by certain people. In conclusion, while censorship in libraries is important to ensure age-appropriate material, it is also crucial to balance this with freedom of choice and access to diverse reading materials.
447	3424	2	3	"Regardless of the type of book, whether it be religious texts like the Bible or controversial novels like ""Lolita,"" the debate over banning books continues to be a contentious issue. In a society that values freedom of speech and press, it is crucial to uphold the right to access information and diverse perspectives. Attempts to ban books not only restrict individual freedom but also hinder intellectual growth and the exchange of ideas. While certain content may be deemed inappropriate for specific audiences, censorship should not be the solution. Instead, individuals should have the autonomy to choose what they read, watch, or listen to, enabling them to form their own opinions and values through critical thinking and exploration of diverse viewpoints. By embracing freedom of expression and rejecting censorship, we can foster a society that values intellectual diversity and encourages open dialogue, ultimately leading to a more enriched and enlightened community."
448	3425	2	3	I believe everyone has their own choice when it comes to taking a book off a shelf. You should know what you're picking up. If you think it might be offensive to you, then set it back on the shelf. It's as easy as that. Taking offensive articles off shelves of libraries just because a couple of people are unhappy ruins everyone's opportunity to maybe find what they were looking for. Censorship in libraries is just unnecessary. Everyone should be able to take care of themselves. Read the title before you pick up the book. It could give you a good hint on whether or not it might offend you. Children, on the other hand, should be overseen by an adult just to make sure they don't pick up anything that should not be viewed as a child.  Taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else. Not everyone is offended by the same material. For some, it may be pictures. For others, it could just be words. But this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world. It just cannot be avoided. So why take it out of libraries.  If it's really offensive in any way, put a warning sticker on the book. It will warn people that the book may contain material that could offend the reader. It will benefit both sides of this argument. People will be less offended because they won't unexpectedly pick up a book and be offended. But the people who enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them.  Everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book. You should have an idea of what you're picking up. Just because you made a mistake and picked up an offensive article, why take it away from others who enjoy reading them? Everyone is exposed to offensive material through everyday life. So why have censorship in libraries? It's not accomplishing anything.
449	3426	2	3	I believe that it is important to censor the materials that our children have access to in libraries. Young minds are impressionable, and exposing them to inappropriate content can have a negative impact on their development. By controlling what our children read and see, we can ensure that they are not exposed to harmful ideas at a young age. It is our responsibility as parents and educators to protect our children and guide them towards positive influences. Censorship in libraries is necessary to safeguard the future generation and promote healthy growth and development. Let us all unite in support of censorship for the well-being of our children.
450	3427	2	3	Do I think we should have to take books off of shelves? No, we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves. Think of it in your own perspective. For example, say you like horror books. If someone else doesn't like horror and you do, and they take it off of the shelves, how mad would you be. I like magazines. Magazines like @CAPS1 @CAPS2, or @ORGANIZATION1. If there is a bad picture or anything in it they took it off. My perspective is that if you don't like what you see then put the book, magazine or whatever it might be up. Don't just sit there and complain, because how would you feel if the same thing happened to you? I have had personal experience with these kinds of problems. At my school, we used to have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1. Just non-hurtful things. All it took though was one person to complain about it, and boom! They were gone. @CAPS1 fanatics like me don't like to see our favorite things gone. So really, what is the problem? The problem is that people can't handle what they see. It is understandable to a certain point. Like if your a very religious person, then yes, I understand that you couldn't look at those things. But when you do it just to spite someone, then that is very hurtful. Finally, I just want to say that if you have a problem, keep it to yourself. Just because you don't like something, doesn't mean someone else won't. You wouldn't want it to happen to you.
451	3428	2	3	First comes censorship along with its totalitarian prowess, second comes the downfall of humanity. We have all seen the horrors of totalitarianism over time. From the Nazi regime of Germany to the banning of books in the Soviet Union. It always brings a violent end.  Fahrenheit 451, written by Ray Bradbury in the mid-twentieth century, foreshadows a dark future if censorship takes hold of humanity. When people are forbidden from accessing books, their history is rewritten by the government, leading to a distorted reality. Propaganda already distorts minds, but censorship of knowledge would be catastrophic.  It is essential for people to know their history and origins. Censoring books one by one erases knowledge and allows the government to manipulate the truth. What should be kept hidden from view? While some content may be unsuitable for children, full censorship leads to the eradication of knowledge and the imposition of a false reality.  I firmly oppose censorship in all its forms. People have the right to access information and make their own choices. While parents can protect their children from certain content, overall censorship contradicts the values of freedom in Western democracies. Totalitarianism has always failed, and only through freedom can people defend their rights.  Words should not be feared. Differences in beliefs will always exist, but we must uphold freedom of expression and accept diverse perspectives. If we succumb to censorship, we risk losing the right to independent thought. The fate of humanity rests on our decision to embrace freedom over censorship in these crucial times. The future remains uncertain, but our choice will shape it.
452	3429	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,   I believe that if a book is deemed offensive, it should be removed from library shelves. The presence of controversial books often leads to conflicts among library patrons. In order to prevent disputes, libraries should consider stocking multiple copies of popular books to meet the demand.   It is not uncommon for individuals to compete for a single copy of a book in libraries. In such cases, it may be fair to allocate the book to the first person who reaches it. However, if conflicts arise between patrons, those involved should be removed from the library premises and face potential bans from returning. This approach can help maintain order and prevent unnecessary altercations over books.   Libraries should aim to have more than one copy of a book, especially in the case of highly sought-after titles. For instance, if a popular book series like '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1' is available in the library, it is essential to have multiple copies of each installment. This practice ensures that everyone has a fair chance of accessing the books they desire without causing tensions or conflicts.   Failure to provide sufficient copies of a book can lead to various issues within the library community. Scarcity of popular titles may result in disagreements and potential confrontations among patrons. By addressing this concern through adequate book availability, libraries can create a more harmonious environment for all visitors.   In conclusion, addressing offensive materials, providing multiple copies of popular books, and managing potential conflicts are crucial aspects of maintaining a peaceful and accessible library environment. It is essential to consider the needs and preferences of library users to promote a positive and inclusive reading experience for everyone.   Sincerely,   @PERSON1
453	3430	2	3	It is ultimately up to individuals, especially parents, to determine what they find offensive and what they do not want their children to be exposed to. Libraries and stores should not be in the business of censoring materials, as different people have different standards and sensitivities. It is the responsibility of parents to monitor what their children are exposed to and make decisions accordingly. Removing items from shelves based on potential offensiveness is a slippery slope that can lead to censorship and limited access to diverse perspectives and ideas. It is important for individuals to take personal responsibility for what they consume and what they allow others to consume, rather than expecting institutions to make those decisions for them.
454	3431	2	3	Every book has a meaning or message that all should know about. Taking a book away from a library shelf can decrease of knowledge from someone that might need that information. Just because a book may have certain views that can be offensive does not mean it should not be allowed on a shelf. A book should not be discriminated by what the contents may have source of a reader. Positive and negative books should all be allowed on shelves for anyone who has an interest.  As for music and movies that could be placed in the same category, it can be reasonable. It's really not necessary to have them in a library because it's a place known for peace, quiet, and relaxation. If music or movies become a hazard, then they should not be welcome in the library. On the positive side, music and movies have a way of comforting some while having a good book at hand. It is understandable to have a little variety with some knowledge within the eyes of a book.  Magazines are another non-necessary object that is placed in the library. Magazines can have a mixture of good and negative things contained in them. Not all magazines have something that can be used for education. Most magazines are known for entertainment and updates on well-known people around the globe. Magazines should be removed from the library.  The library should be an environment of learning, and only materials that will be helpful instead of entertainment for pleasure. Removing a book from a shelf is like decreasing knowledge that could have been known. Therefore, removing books should not be allowed, no matter the content of the book. As for music, movies, and magazines, they should be limited for usage in the library.   In conclusion, the library should be a place where individuals can access valuable information and expand their knowledge. All forms of media should be carefully considered for inclusion, ensuring that they serve the purpose of education and enlightenment for all visitors.
455	3432	2	3	'@CAPS1 Should be Taken off the @CAPS2'  @CAPS1 should be taken off the shelves? Nothing. At least thats @CAPS1 I think. For any book you can find some bad thing about it. People cannot keep bad things away from kids; it doesn't work like that. Whether it is cursing, sex, gore, racism, teens will find them and I think it would be better if they were found in a book instead of real life.  Most young adult books have cursing. There is no way around it. Teens hear cursing every day, at home, school, or even at work and yes it is offensive and no there is nothing you can do to stop it. It is there and part of our life.  Most adults think that if they don't shelter teens, then they will find all this bad stuff in music. What adults don't understand is that teens do whatever they want to be happy. The music of today is very offensive, but that is what is 'hot' in the music world right now.  Ok say a kid was from a run-down home and all he had was a radio, and that radio only got one station and the station was pop music, which most parents don't prefer. That pop music would make the kid happy. Would you really take that away from him just because it is offensive?  Sex: a lot of really good books have sex in them, but if a kid is at home reading about sex then he or she is not out doing it. Plus, sex makes books better. I read books that contain rape and other sexual acts but I've never done it, only read about it.  Race is another big deal. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is an amazing book and every kid should read it so they can learn. That is the whole point in reading, so you can learn. We need to learn about those kinds of things.  Keeping us sheltered is not going to protect us, it only makes us want whatever we can't have even more. Music, books, magazines, and other stuff help us learn; don't take that away from us. If we don't like it, we will not read it or listen to it. Don't choose for us; let us learn on our own. It is our life. Let us make our own mistakes.

However, there are certain restrictions in place that may hinder individuals from fully enjoying all that libraries have to offer. While some argue that these restrictions are necessary to maintain order and preserve resources, others believe that they unfairly limit access to certain materials or services.   For instance, the rules surrounding borrowing items from the library can be seen as a double-edged sword. While responsible individuals benefit from having access to a wide range of materials, those who are careless or forgetful may face fines or restrictions. Some argue that if certain items are off-limits to certain individuals, they should not be available at all in the library to avoid disappointment or conflict.   To ensure fairness and accessibility for all patrons, libraries should consider organizing their collections in a way that caters to different age groups and interests. By creating designated sections for kids, teenagers, and adults, libraries can better meet the diverse needs of their community members. This approach can help streamline the borrowing process and minimize conflicts over restricted items.   In conclusion, while libraries play a vital role in providing resources and promoting literacy, it is important for them to strike a balance between maintaining order and ensuring equal access for all. By carefully considering the needs and preferences of their patrons, libraries can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.
457	3434	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1,  I am writing to express my agreement with Katherine Paterson's stance on certain types of books that should not be available in public libraries. I believe that books containing explicit sexual content or any material that could potentially harm a child's innocent mind should not be accessible to the public. Such books have the potential to leave a lasting negative impact on young readers, shaping their thoughts and perceptions in ways that may not be beneficial.  It is important to prioritize the well-being and mental development of our youth by ensuring that the books available in public libraries are appropriate for their age and maturity levels. By limiting access to books with inappropriate content, we can help safeguard the innocence of children and guide them towards more positive and enriching reading experiences.  For instance, imagine a scenario where a young boy seeks out action books in a library, only to be confronted with materials that are not suitable for his age. This could lead to confusion and potentially harmful influences on his developing mind. By filtering out inappropriate content from library shelves, we can create a safer and more conducive reading environment for children.  In conclusion, I urge @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 to consider implementing stricter guidelines on the types of books available in public libraries, focusing on promoting wholesome and enriching reading materials for our youth. Let us work together to protect the innocence of children and foster a love for reading that is both safe and beneficial.  Sincerely, @PERSON2
458	3435	2	3	This statement is not correct. People should be allowed to read, listen to, or watch whatever they want, even if it may be considered bad by others. Everyone has different tastes and preferences, so it is important for individuals to have the freedom to choose what they want to engage with. Whether it is books, movies, or music, people should have the right to access a wide range of content.  While some may find certain material offensive or inappropriate, it is ultimately up to the individual to decide what they want to consume. If someone does not like a particular book, movie, or song, they can simply choose not to engage with it and find something else that better suits their preferences.  However, when it comes to magazines that contain explicit or harmful content, it may be more appropriate to restrict access to them. Magazines that promote unhealthy behaviors or ideologies should not be readily available on shelves where they can easily be accessed by anyone, especially young people.  In conclusion, while people should have the freedom to choose what they read, watch, or listen to, there may be certain exceptions when it comes to magazines that promote harmful content. Overall, it is important to respect individual preferences and allow people to make their own decisions about the media they consume.
459	3436	2	3	I believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from library shelves just because they contain offensive content. People are drawn to entertainment that may include sexual or violent themes, as it captures their interest. Restricting access to such materials would limit people's freedom of choice and their ability to explore diverse perspectives. It is important for individuals to be able to make their own decisions about what they want to read, watch, or listen to. While some may find certain content offensive, it is ultimately up to the individual to decide what aligns with their personal values and beliefs. Libraries should continue to provide a wide range of materials, including those that some may find controversial, to cater to the diverse interests and preferences of their patrons. Ultimately, everyone has the right to choose what they consume, and libraries should respect and uphold this freedom.
460	3437	2	3	If you get offended by books, magazines, music, or movies, then simply avoid consuming them. Censorship should primarily be for young children, and adults should have the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. Removing vulgar words or content from society is not the solution, as censorship cannot eliminate them entirely. It is the responsibility of parents to control their children's exposure to inappropriate content. Ultimately, individuals should take personal responsibility for their own consumption and avoid what they find offensive.
461	3438	2	3	The books in the libraries that I have read so far don't seem like they would be offensive to anyone. I haven't really listened to the music in the libraries or watched the movies, and the magazines seem fine too. That doesn't mean that there isn't anything that could be offensive to other people, but if there is, then I think they should be removed from the libraries. However, if every potentially offensive book, music, movie, and magazine were taken out, many items would be removed, which wouldn't be fair to those who enjoy them. Some people may understand that certain materials could be hurtful or offensive, but others may not care.  It is important to consider the impact of keeping offensive materials in libraries, especially if they could harm children. While some materials may not be that bad and can be enjoyed by many, those that are truly harmful should be removed to ensure that the library remains a safe and welcoming space for all visitors. Ultimately, it is essential to strike a balance between preserving freedom of expression and protecting individuals from harmful content.
462	3439	2	3	I think that most books, magazines, or any kind of reading material that has offensive content is acceptable for consumption. People need to be exposed to different perspectives and ideas, even if they may find them offensive. It is common for books to contain curse words or discuss controversial topics such as drugs, but this should not deter people from reading them.  It is important for individuals to broaden their horizons and understand different viewpoints, even if they may not agree with them. While some may find certain content offensive, it is up to the individual to decide whether or not to engage with that material.  In my opinion, books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media should not be censored or removed from shelves simply because they contain offensive content. What may be offensive to one person could be thought-provoking or enlightening to another. It is essential to respect the diverse perspectives and opinions of others when it comes to consuming different forms of media. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to make their own choices about what they read, listen to, or watch.
463	3440	2	3	Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned? As stated in our constitution, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also, we have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question.  In the United States, it is stated that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason, places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on their shelves. Even if some of the content is inappropriate, it still serves as a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read, and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken off the shelves, we would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines are beneficial to some and offensive to others. However, for those who would find this beneficial, do we want to simply go against our constitution and deprive them of that information?  Another topic in the United States is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelf, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell their kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that may seem inappropriate to some aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelf. However, some may come across a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on a child who is not supposed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.  As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example, I was restricted from watching rated R movies or things with inappropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood, I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do whatever they would like and that it has no effect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privilege to view them.  In conclusion, removing materials, such as books, music, and movies, is completely absurd. As I said before, doing something like this would be going against our constitution. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials, end of case.
464	3441	2	3	The library is a valuable resource for information, offering a wide range of books, music, movies, and magazines. It is essential for libraries to carefully curate their collection to ensure that they do not carry any offensive or misleading materials. If such items are found, it is important to report them to the librarian or manager so that appropriate action can be taken. Overall, libraries play a crucial role in providing access to knowledge and should be maintained as welcoming and reliable spaces for everyone in the community.
465	3442	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. These materials often reflect real-life experiences and can serve as a guide for individuals facing similar challenges. Books that discuss difficult topics like teenage pregnancy, violence, and drug abuse can provide valuable insights and help readers make informed decisions. Additionally, these materials can offer a sense of connection and understanding for individuals who may be hesitant to seek advice from others. Overall, offensive materials should not be removed as they can offer valuable lessons and perspectives on the complexities of life.
466	3443	2	3	Censorship or not? That is the question. Many people may not realize it, but what they read and watch greatly affects them. If children watch a scary movie, then nightmares seem to occur more often. If teens read a book where parties seem cool and bad things are glorified, they too start to see bad as good. What if the article you are reading right now contained offensive language and inappropriate ideas? Most people would be offended and complain. If you saw an old man walking down the street yelling out obtrusive things, you would be mad and tell him to quit. So then the question is raised, why is it alright for us to watch movies like that? Yes, books and movies should be censored.  Children are very naive at a young age. When a child starts getting exposed to violence, illegal acts, alcohol, and drugs in books or movies, they start to think it's okay. For instance, when I was younger, I watched the movie 'Scarface.' The movie contains a profanity every other word, so it seems. I saw my favorite actors in the movie saying bad words, so I figured it was alright. It's not okay for a child to talk offensively like that. One day I even heard a little boy quoting lines from the movie. The movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive. It made me sad to hear an innocent little boy talking about things that are way over his head.  Teenagers that listen to music from certain artists are getting bad messages. Although these rappers are seen as modern-day music heroes, they shouldn't be glorified the way they are. Their songs are all about smoking weed and getting high. They make it seem cool. So teenagers think, 'if they can do it, so can I!' They start to engage in activities that were once frowned upon. If teenagers weren't exposed to this kind of music, they wouldn't be as apt to take part in such things.  As for adults, their movies and books should be censored too. One might think that once they're older they can do what they want, but that's not the case. Let me throw out an example to you. Let's just say a husband and wife are watching a movie together. It's great until a rather inappropriate scene comes on. Not only does it make things awkward, but it sends out the wrong message. When adults or unmarried people see their favorite actors being naughty on television, it makes it seem right. They start to lose the concept that you are supposed to remain abstinent until marriage. After all, it is the only way to remain free of any diseases.  If movies, books, magazines, and music continue to be left uncensored, the world will become a giant brouhaha. People will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong. We are on the brink of violence and total chaos. If we continue to let our children and ourselves watch these types of movies and whatnot, things will get ugly. Yes, if libraries or stores find anything offensive on their racks, then they need to censor it before it corrupts any more minds. Censorship is necessary to protect individuals from harmful influences and maintain a society that upholds moral values and standards.
467	3444	2	3	I do not believe that movies, books, music, etc. should be removed from shelves. People should be able to choose what they want to listen to, read, or watch based on their own maturity level. Parents can monitor and restrict what their children consume, but adults should have the freedom to make their own decisions. It is important to respect individual choices and not censor materials based on personal preferences. People have the right to avoid offensive content and should take responsibility for their own media consumption. Overall, censorship should be limited, and individuals should have the autonomy to choose what they engage with.
468	3445	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed as it restricts people's right to choose what they read and listen to. Everyone has different opinions and what may be offensive to one person may be enjoyed by another. If censorship were to be implemented, it would limit the variety of material available and hinder freedom of expression. As author Katherine Paterson pointed out, if one person has the power to remove a book they find offensive, then everyone else could do the same, leaving nothing left on the shelves for anyone to enjoy. It is important to preserve the freedom to access a wide range of materials in libraries without censorship.
469	3446	2	3	The quote that Katherine Paterson declares a very strong point and is completely true in my eyes. Everyone thinks and functions differently so therefore something offensive to one person might be completely fair and good in another's point of view. Everybody thinks differently and as you go to school or work every day you find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns. For instance, their clothing. Belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words. So what do you think? Do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think it's offensive or terrible? In my opinion, no. Every book, magazine or anything in the media can send out a different message in everyone's personal thoughts. For example, one movie could touch someone in a very special way and at the same time, someone right next to them could think it's disgusting and cruel. I have actually had a real-life situation where this has been a conflict. During the years of my seventh-grade experience, there was this PlayStation game that I loved to play and enjoyed playing every single day with all of my friends. My mother, and pretty much the entire @LOCATION1 found it very offensive. It was really awkward and annoying that one of the things I loved is something that they tried to ban and not allow it to be sold from local stores. Now being in my shoes how do you think that felt for me? I thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate. That's like taking somebody possessions and telling them your opinion on them and then ditching them into the trash to rot and vanish forever. I believe that you should be able to read anything you would like in the library without the fear of your next favorite book being taken off of the shelf because a group of people protest from the language or whatever they think is offensive to them in the novel, because the next time you know it, everything will be gone from the shelves since everyone has different opinions. If you don't like the novel, then I assist you to return it, and to never read it again. I feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable. So what do you think as readers, is it fair to be able to read whatever you want or do you think if you or someone finds it offensive, you can take it off of the shelves?
470	3447	2	3	"Throughout the world, there are thousands of people with various opinions. If one person thinks an art piece looks unique, another may not see any true beauty. But when people hardly understand the concept of other people, they should not be exposed to books or movies that could be defined as offensive. Some people don't know what it is like to be truly offended.  When I was in middle school, I was a shy, fragile, young girl. I had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings. For the first couple of weeks, I felt like an outcast; like an outsider looking in. I didn't fit in with anyone's group. Everyone seemed to have already had friends for years and here I was, a new student with no friends to communicate with. I was isolated and was desperately trying to find someone to be my friend. I wondered if something was wrong with me; if I had a bad odor or was dressed in an out of style fashion. I tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color. It seemed as if I wasn't even noticed. Before I knew it, school was halfway over. I was still a nobody. Then @PERSON1 came along and made me a somebody.  @PERSON1, who had just moved to my school, looked bold and confident. At first, people waved a friendly hello but nothing more. As I sat at my empty lunch table, @PERSON1 approached me and asked to sit down. I couldn't refuse the offer so I nodded a sincere yes. The entire lunch period, we sat talking. We had a lot in common and I was glad to have made a friendship with @PERSON1. Months went by before I realized @PERSON1 and I were great friends. I knew I could trust him with all of my secrets. Even though @PERSON1 and I were close, I felt as though he was always hiding something. Occasionally I would have enough courage to ask if there was anything he needed to tell me, but as the same as every answer before, it was a no.  @PERSON1 and I had always walked to my house after school. But on one afternoon, something felt wrong. The air seemed to linger for miles. We didn't talk until we got inside my house. Suddenly @PERSON1 spoke and said, ""Are people so cruel?"" I was shocked by this question for I didn't know how to respond. @PERSON1 sensed that I had no clue what he was talking about so he continued. ""I'm gay."" I was appalled. Not because he was gay, but because he had never told me. I asked, ""What happened?"" He sat on the couch then and told me about how he was in the library overhearing some of our classmates reading a book about people making fun of gays'. I felt awful for @PERSON1. It wasn't his fault he was gay.  I believe that certain books, movies, or music that are offensive to people should not be allowed on shelves. Some have never been offended. Some always offend people for many reasons. Everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended. We, as a community, should love one another and respect them. Not read or listen to things that can hurt someone's inner feelings."
471	3448	2	3	Dear Newspaper,  I do believe that certain books, magazines, or any other form of reading material should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive. It is important to consider the potential impact of media on individuals of all ages. Children and teenagers, in particular, can be influenced by explicit content, leading them to potentially mimic what they see or read. As they grow, they are shaped by their surroundings and the media they are exposed to.  While not everyone will act out what they see or read, it is crucial to acknowledge the power of media in shaping our thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, it is necessary to have certain materials displayed in confidential locations or with age restrictions to ensure that individuals are mature enough to handle the content.  By being mindful of the potential impact of media on human lives, we can take steps to protect individuals, especially young people, from harmful influences. Thank you for considering this important issue.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
472	3449	2	3	Many people find certain books, music, or magazines offensive or inappropriate for some young readers. Many believe that this material should be removed from libraries completely to prevent it from corrupting young minds and influencing their behavior. However, others argue that individuals have the right to choose what they read or listen to, and that removing such material infringes upon that right.  Those in favor of removing offensive material from libraries believe that exposure to it could lead young readers to make poor decisions and become more aggressive. They argue that libraries should be a place for learning and growth, free from potentially harmful content. On the other hand, proponents of keeping such material available assert that individuals should have the freedom to choose what they consume. They argue that learning about controversial topics in a safe environment, like a library, is better than being exposed to them elsewhere.  In my opinion, while it is important to respect individuals' rights to choose what they read, it is also crucial to protect young readers from potentially harmful material. Therefore, I believe that offensive books should be kept in a separate section of the library or placed out of reach of young readers. If parents want their children to learn about such topics, they can take the initiative to explain them in a suitable manner. Ultimately, everyone should have the freedom to make their own choices regarding what they read or listen to, but precautions should be taken to ensure that young minds are safeguarded from inappropriate content.
473	3450	2	3	"While there are many books out there that offend various groups of people, there are some that deserve to be eradicated completely. As the saying goes, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. One such book that comes to mind is ""The @ORGANIZATION1,"" which provides instructions on building bombs, using firearms, and promoting hate towards those we do not understand, such as their religion or appearance. This book is filled with disgusting propaganda advocating for the elimination of certain groups of people, and its presence on shelves is sickening.  Another book that should be removed from circulation is written by the notorious @PERSON1, responsible for sending countless individuals to their deaths in gas chambers and camps during a dark period in history. This book is rife with messages of hate, targeting specific groups and advocating for their extermination. While the removal of such books may be seen as censorship, it is necessary to prevent the spread of harmful ideologies and prevent history from repeating itself.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries should be implemented to remove books that promote hate, violence, and discrimination. By removing such toxic literature, we can prevent the perpetuation of harmful ideologies and ensure a more inclusive and peaceful society for future generations."
474	3451	2	3	The library is a public space that should cater to the diverse interests of its patrons, providing a wide range of books, movies, and magazines. It is not fair to remove offensive materials simply because a few individuals find them disturbing. Everyone has different tastes and preferences, and it is impossible to please everyone all the time.  If the library were to start removing items based on individual complaints, it would set a dangerous precedent. It would be impossible to keep everyone satisfied, and the library would risk alienating a significant portion of its user base. It is important for the library to maintain a diverse collection to serve the needs of all its patrons.  Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide what they want to read or watch. If someone comes across something they find offensive, they have the option to simply choose something else. It is not fair to impose one person's preferences on everyone else. By keeping a wide range of materials available, the library can ensure that it remains a valuable resource for all members of the community.
475	3452	2	3	In all honesty, let people read and listen to whatever they find interesting. Everyone should have the freedom to choose what they want to read or listen to, regardless of the content. While some may argue that certain books should not be shared with certain people, the power of freedom allows individuals to make their own choices. It is important to consider a person's ability to comprehend the content of a book or song before deciding whether or not they should have access to it. While movies are rated for specific age groups, books and music can be valuable learning tools and forms of self-expression. Ultimately, everyone should have the freedom to explore different topics and express themselves through literature and music.
476	3453	2	3	I enjoy reading very much and have read several books during my high school career. Three of the best books I have read covered topics such as drugs, rape, and partying, with inappropriate language. While some parents may find these books offensive and request their removal from school libraries, I believe it is important to uphold freedom of speech and press. Everyone has different opinions, and what one person finds offensive, another may not. Children often have differing views from their parents and will read what they want regardless.  It is crucial to respect individual opinions and allow access to a variety of materials in libraries. Books are categorized by age appropriateness, so children can access materials suitable for their age group, while teenagers should be mature enough to handle more challenging content. Restricting access to certain books limits the choices of those who enjoy reading them.   As an adult, I will encourage my children to make their own choices and provide guidance on what I expect from them. Ultimately, the decision to read a book with explicit content should be left to the individual, as reading a book does not equate to condoning the actions depicted. Overall, censoring books based on subjective opinions of offensiveness is unjust and limits the freedom of readers to explore diverse perspectives and experiences.
477	3454	2	3	I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf. They are certain books, music, movies, magazines that people find quite offensive. There could be a few books that have some awful material in it. The pictures in magazines, on CD cases or on movie/DVD cases would have stuff that people find really offensive. I have never actually seen anything like that before, but it does happen in schools all around the world. People might not get what certain materials want you to do, but they get offended and tell someone about it. They would most likely tell people to not get it and tell the school that they were offended by the material. Certain materials should be removed from the shelves.
478	3455	2	3	"Librarys have the right to decide how censored they want their material on their shelves to be. Much of this material may be considered offensive to certain people. However, some materials may be as offensive to one person, it may not be offensive to another. Americans have freedom of speech, and writing, and many other rights. A library should have the right to put whatever materials it would like on their shelves. There will always be offensive songs, books, movies, and magazines. However, some materials may be found offensive to someone, it may not be found offensive to others. A library may not be able to please everyone.  ""But if they have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then they also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And we have no books on the shelf for any of us"" (Paterson). Paterson is simply explaining that if someone finds something offensive and wants it removed from a shelf then soon all books will be removed, and there will be nothing left at all on the shelves.  A library is a place for everyone to come and find what they are looking for without any disturbances. A person probably isn't looking for something offensive. Therefore, coming across something that is offensive may be disturbing; however, they should be able to try to ignore it. It is that person's choice to choose that library to attend to. So they will choose to maybe find offensive materials. If someone does not wish to come across offensive material they should choose not to go to the library.  Americans have the right to be free, so does a library. If a person comes across an offensive piece of material it should be ignored. A library cannot please everyone by taking out all of its merchandise that may be considered offensive. There simply would be nothing left. People should be aware that they may come across some offensive materials when going into a library, so it will always be the people's choice of attending that library. In conclusion, libraries should have the freedom to choose what materials they want on their shelves, and individuals have the choice to ignore offensive material or choose not to visit the library if they find it objectionable."
479	3456	2	3	I believe that some material should be removed if it is very offensive. However, I also think that if it is helping someone learn, it should stay on the shelves. Everyone has different opinions on what is offensive or appropriate, so it is important to read the cover of a book or other materials to see if it is suitable for you. Libraries should consider putting warning stickers on items with graphic or vulgar language to inform people beforehand. This can help reduce the need to remove books from the shelves. In my opinion, warning signs can help prevent incidents like the one I experienced when I was younger, where I unknowingly read a book with inappropriate language. I believe this approach can benefit not only my own family but also other library visitors. It is essential to ensure that materials are age-appropriate and respectful of different audiences.
480	3457	2	3	In today's world, being a child is not easy. With thoughts and ideas constantly racing through their minds, children face the stresses of school and daily life. However, the last thing on a child's mind is whether the literature they are reading is offensive. While some may argue for increased censorship, I believe that it would only serve to make our future generations more sheltered and closed-minded.  Currently, censorship is prevalent in music and movies, yet children still find ways to access inappropriate content. Censoring media does not prevent children from being exposed to unsuitable material; rather, it often leaves them unaware of the true meaning behind the content they consume. Additionally, with the internet providing easy access to a plethora of information, censorship becomes even more challenging to enforce effectively.  Instead of relying on censorship, parents should engage in open discussions with their children to help them navigate the complexities of the world. By fostering communication and providing guidance, parents can empower their children to make informed decisions and understand the implications of the media they consume.  In conclusion, censorship may shape the future to some extent, but it is not the solution to raising well-rounded and informed individuals. Encouraging open dialogue and critical thinking skills in children is key to helping them navigate a world filled with diverse perspectives and content. Ultimately, censorship may offer a temporary solution, but true empowerment comes from education and open communication.
481	3458	2	3	Hello! My name is @PERSON1. I am writing to you @DATE1 because there is much conflict on the issue of whether materials in the library that are deemed offensive should be removed from their shelves. I believe that these materials should remain where they are.  People often get worked up over small things in life, but it is important to realize that there will always be things we don't like, and that is inevitable. In the case of offensive materials in the library, instead of demanding their removal, people should simply choose not to engage with them and move on. It is crucial to understand that not everyone will share the same opinions and preferences.  I advocate for leaving these materials in the library because individuals have the ability to overlook them if they choose to do so. We must learn to accept that we will not always agree with everything we encounter, but that should not lead to unnecessary conflict or demands for censorship. It is essential to learn to let go and move forward, recognizing that differences in opinions will always exist.  Ultimately, it is important for people to understand that they will not always get their way in life, and it is crucial to learn how to navigate through situations where our preferences may not align with others. Therefore, I urge individuals to refrain from making a big deal out of minor issues like offensive materials in the library and instead focus on moving past them without unnecessary confrontation. Let's learn to coexist peacefully, respecting differing perspectives and leaving room for diverse opinions to exist harmoniously.
482	3459	2	3	I do not believe that books should be censored. If a book is on the shelf in a library, then anyone should be able to pick it up and read it. I have never come across an offensive book in all my experiences at libraries, and I believe that if a book is deemed offensive, it wouldn't be displayed for everyone to see. Reading is important for sharpening the mind, and individuals should have the freedom to choose what they read without censorship. If someone doesn't like the selection at a library, they can simply go elsewhere or order books online. Libraries have more important issues to focus on than individual preferences, and censorship limits intellectual freedom. In conclusion, books, magazines, movies, and other materials should not be censored, and individuals should have the freedom to choose what they read and view.
483	3460	2	3	As many would agree, censorship is a growing topic of concern throughout the world. I personally feel that censorship is necessary to a certain extent. If one feels the content of music, a movie, or a book is questionable, he or she has the option of reading, listening, or watching.  Among many debated materials, movies have ratings, just as music has 'bleeps'. Movies are rated 'G' for all audiences, 'PG' standing for parental guidance, 'PG-13' for parental guidance for ages 13 and older, and lastly 'R' meaning that anyone under the age of 17 is either suggested or required to have an adult present during the viewing of the film. At home, the ratings are all based on the parent's preference. At the movie theatre, the restrictions become a sort of law. Anyone below the age of thirteen is not permitted to see a movie that is 'PG-13' or 'R' unless accompanied by an adult (anyone 18 or older). Depending on where you are, the restrictions may be more or less harsh. Ultimately, the rating system is intended to force parents to choose what is and isn't appropriate for their child.  As for music on the radio, all 'curse words' are 'bleeped' out. If a person wants to buy their own music, artists are required to make two of the same album, one with censors and one without. Thus creating a decision usually for the parents, assuming they are the ones to buy the album or the music for their child.  When it comes to books, there are no ratings, just genres letting the reader know who the author's intended audience is. Types of genres include 'adult', 'young adult' and 'children' sections in libraries and book stores. Just like music and television, the final choice in the purchase is all dependent on the parents.  Even though many restrictions are put in place, there are still some faults to the system. Obviously if you are 17 or younger, you most likely won't have identification. This leaves the person working at the movie theatre the option to let in who they believe to be of age. Looks can be deceiving. Buying music from the internet doesn't require any type of identification either. How can they prove your age? When purchasing a book, not many cashiers would stop a child and say, 'that's inappropriate for you'. Maybe kids of all ages should have identification. Although these are all underlying problems in the censorship system, it seems to all lead back to the parents.  Censorship is a huge topic of discussion for the parents of today's young and growing society, but in reality, if they have an issue with the content, they themselves will either rid of the material or prohibit the use and or purchase of it. All in all, it's about the parents and their personal preference.
484	3461	2	3	No books should be taken off the shelf. Everyone has different tastes when it comes to books, magazines, movies, or poetry. If someone finds something offensive, they can simply choose to ignore it and find something else that suits their preferences. Variety in tastes is what makes each person unique. Personally, I enjoy horror novels for the excitement they bring with their themes of killing and suspense. While I'm not an avid reader, I do appreciate the thrill that horror novels offer. Transitioning to different genres can be challenging, as each type of literature has its own unique appeal. For example, poetry can be complex to understand due to its use of elaborate language and metaphors. Renowned poets like @PERSON1, who gained fame posthumously, have left a lasting impact with their work. In essence, individual preferences vary, and diversity in reading choices enriches our world.
485	3462	2	3	How often do you find a book or a magazine that you don't want children or someone to read? I mean I find them everyday for example, how people use their language like swearing or even the TV show they watch. I also hear when I'm with my friends or in a crowd of people. You hear them every day even if you don't want to, but you do.  I do believe libraries shouldn't even have that in where children can reach them or even in the library period. It's a public place and no one wants to see anyone with those books in the library. What would happen if a child got a hold of one and they were looking at it and if it gave them nightmares or if it deals with crimes, rap, or mishaps with something wrong.  Sometimes what children read, they will say it or they will do it. so if a child sees it they might think it's alright to do it or they might think it's amazing or cool to do and they might do it. Also again, you hear it on a daily basis like swearing. Let's say your child hears or reads horrible language and they might say it to you or some of your friends, and you won't know where they heard it or who told them.  The movies even have something to do with it too, because all the movies are together from kids to adult movies. They should separate the movies or even get rid of the movies because the children could look at the case and see something scary or drug-related, something that you don't want your children to see or even hear about.  Even though you hear them daily, you should never get them from the public library or even any public place where children are around. They need to take those books that describe anything about crime, drugs, or even movies. That's why I think they should get rid of those books and movies off the shelves and keep them away from children.
486	3463	2	3	I think they shouldn't remove material from libraries if it's found offensive. People find different things offensive that others do not. If you started taking these things out, there's a good possibility that you'll lose everything, books, and your people.  One example I say this is because, some people are offensive about movies that have violent scenes in them. Others like the violence in those shows. The library might be the only way someone can get a hold of something they like.  Another example is, magazines can contain material you don't want your kids around or seeing. That same magazine could help a student with an assignment at school. Kids might need the material that is offensive; it could help them through life.  In conclusion, I do not think we should take movies and books out if someone finds it offensive. Some of the offensive material could be used to help students in their education. Other offensive material some adults enjoy reading or watching. Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean the next person that comes in will.
487	3464	2	3	People should not have the right to limit freedom, imagination, or self-expression, especially when it comes to book censorship. Censoring books not only restricts creativity and knowledge but also goes against our constitutional right of free speech. By censoring books, we are stifling imagination and sending the message that thinking outside the box is wrong. It is crucial to uphold our right to choose what we read and write, as it is a fundamental aspect of freedom in a democratic society. Limiting freedom of speech through book censorship sets a dangerous precedent that can lead to further restrictions on our rights. Therefore, it is essential to protect the freedom of expression and resist any attempts to censor books.
488	3465	2	3	In my own personal opinion, I believe that music, books, magazines, and other forms of media should not be censored in libraries. If they are allowed to be illustrated, then they should be available for reading or listening by anyone. The content of these materials should not be restricted, as it undermines the purpose and message of the creators. Age advisories can be used to guide appropriate audiences, but overall, the freedom to access these materials should be preserved.  I have observed people expressing concerns and complaints about the content of music, books, magazines, and movies. However, I fail to see the reasoning behind such objections. Restricting access to these forms of media only limits the exposure to different perspectives and ideas. Instead of censorship, providing guidance and information about the content can help individuals make informed decisions about what they choose to engage with.  In conclusion, I believe that censorship in libraries should be minimal, with a focus on providing access to a diverse range of materials. By allowing for the free exchange of ideas and creativity, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for education, entertainment, and personal growth. Let's embrace the richness and diversity of media available to us, while respecting individual choices and preferences.
489	3466	2	3	Censorship can be described as limitations or restrictions, which can be seen as a form of censorship. However, when it comes to books, movies, or music in libraries, censorship should not be supported. Some may find certain works offensive due to language or content, but it is argued that such elements can provide educational value by reflecting the reality of the time they were created. By censoring such works, we are essentially hiding reality and sheltering individuals from the truth. It is important to consider whether censorship is the right choice, as it may prevent individuals from understanding the world as it truly is. Ultimately, censorship can hinder individuals from developing the necessary skills to navigate the complexities of the real world.
490	3467	2	3	Censorship is a contentious issue when it comes to books. The act of removing or restricting access to certain materials based on their content can be seen as a violation of freedom of expression. As Katherine Paterson aptly put it, if we start censoring books that we personally find offensive, then eventually there won't be any books left for anyone to read. Books are a form of artistic expression, and authors should have the right to share their thoughts and ideas without fear of censorship. While some books may be deemed inappropriate by some individuals, it is important to remember that everyone has different tastes and beliefs. Instead of banning books, individuals can simply choose not to read materials that they find offensive. Ultimately, censorship hinders our ability to learn and grow by limiting access to diverse perspectives and ideas. It is crucial to protect the freedom of expression and ensure that books remain accessible to all who wish to read them.
491	3468	2	3	If someone is looking for an offensive book, they are going to find it, whether it's collecting dust on a library shelf or is brand new in a book store. The same goes for an offensive movie, magazine, or any other media. Removing offensive items from library shelves will only push people to seek them out elsewhere. Different people have varying opinions on what is offensive, so what may be offensive to some may not be to others.  The Satanic Verses is a prime example of a controversial book that many found offensive due to religious beliefs. However, removing such books from libraries would deny others the opportunity to read and enjoy the story. Additionally, most offensive items have redeeming qualities, and it is rare for something to be offensive throughout.  While there are certainly materials that may not be suitable for younger audiences, implementing age restrictions or relying on parental supervision is a more effective solution than outright removal. Removing offensive material from libraries would only lead to more complaints and censorship issues. It is best to leave such material available with a disclaimer for users to approach at their own discretion.
492	3469	2	3	Censorship in school libraries is a topic of debate, with some arguing for strict restrictions and others advocating for more freedom. While it is important to consider the age-appropriateness of certain materials, completely removing books from libraries may not be the best solution. High school students are often mature enough to handle more mature content found in books, which can provide valuable insights into real-life situations. Authors often write about difficult topics to connect with teenagers and offer perspectives on challenging issues. While some may find certain content offensive, it is important to remember that books can also serve as a form of escapism for others facing hardships. Ultimately, it is crucial to strike a balance between censorship and freedom of expression in school libraries to cater to the diverse needs of students.
493	3470	2	3	"Censorship in Libraries  Censorship is a contentious issue in libraries, with many books being deemed offensive and banned from shelves. Some refer to these banned materials as ""@CAPS1,"" and there is even a week dedicated to reading these prohibited works in schools. I personally participate in this challenge because I believe that banning books can have both positive and negative consequences.  From the perspective of authors, it is disheartening to have their hard work banned or removed from libraries shortly after publication. This can undermine their efforts and make them feel undervalued. People often fail to consider the impact on the creators behind the banned materials, which is essential to acknowledge.  Parents also play a crucial role in the censorship debate. Discovering inappropriate content in a book their child is reading can be unsettling, leading them to demand the removal of such materials. However, simply banning books does not prevent children from accessing them elsewhere, and it can leave them feeling confused and as though they have done something wrong.  While removing banned materials from library shelves may limit access to them, it can also prevent individuals from being exposed to potentially harmful content. This could dissuade children from seeking out these materials and lessen their interest in them.  In conclusion, my perspective on censorship is negative, as I believe authors should not be penalized for expressing themselves through their work. It is crucial to consider the various viewpoints surrounding censorship and its impact on libraries. I will continue to support authors whose works have been banned and hope others will do the same."
494	3471	2	3	Censorship in public libraries, allowed? I believe it should be, with a few different viewpoints. For one, why should books be removed from shelves just because some people do not like the plot of the series? There are over a million of us out there, and we all have different tastes and preferences when it comes to reading. Some prefer peaceful, warm-hearted stories, while others crave more intense and thrilling reads. Just like we all have different tastes in food, music, and movies, our preferences for books vary as well.   With such diversity among readers, it is important to recognize that what may be offensive to one person may be cherished by another. Instead of completely banning certain books, why not provide labels or sections that clearly indicate the content, allowing readers to make informed choices? By doing so, individuals can still freely access the books they enjoy without imposing their preferences on others.  Books are like religions to many people - deeply personal and meaningful. Just as we respect each other's religious beliefs without judgment, we should also respect each other's literary preferences. We may not all be the same, but books have a way of bringing us together and helping us understand and appreciate our differences. Therefore, censorship in public libraries should be approached with caution, ensuring that individuals can freely access a wide range of reading materials while respecting the diverse preferences of all readers.
495	3472	2	3	Books are a form of history, each telling a story from the past. In history, we don't block any offensive events that take place, so why should we remove any books that have offensive material in them? It would be wrong to strip kids of any learning tools. Books are a very important learning tool in today's schools, and there is something new in every book that a kid can learn from. So even taking away one book could make a kid learn one less thing, and doing this on purpose would go against everything that schools stand for.  There are many different genres of books, but not everybody loves every genre. If a person only likes to read young adult books because it relates to their culture, which most likely will have offensive language and events play out. If you were to take this away from a young adult in school, once more this person would be missing out on books because now they are not interested in any of the books in the library.  If you can even think of just one instance that could strip a student away from a learning opportunity, you shouldn't do it. But the fact is there are many reasons why you shouldn't remove any literature from library shelves. It is essential to provide students with a wide range of reading materials to cater to their diverse interests and backgrounds. By restricting access to certain books, we limit their exposure to different perspectives, hindering their ability to learn and grow intellectually. In conclusion, preserving the freedom to access a variety of books, even those with potentially controversial content, is crucial in fostering a well-rounded and informed student body.
496	3473	2	3	Libraries should not remove items simply because some people find them offensive. Different people have varying preferences when it comes to reading material, so removing items can limit the selection available. A smaller selection of books may result in fewer people finding a reason to visit the library. It is important to maintain a diverse collection to cater to the needs and interests of a wide range of individuals. By keeping a variety of materials available, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for their communities.
497	3474	2	3	Can books, music, movies, and other materials be perfect for everyone? Everyone has their own opinion and beliefs on what materials are good, and what are not acceptable for the human mind. All over the world, young kids, young adults, and adults are reading books, magazines, listening to music, and watching movies. Those are all hobbies most people enjoy doing. Everyone reads different kinds of books, whether it's mystery, romance, or bible-based books. People read. Removing books, magazines, and other materials off the shelves in a library leads to an unsuccessful empty library.  When people come and search for a book to read, they search for what they think they will enjoy. If they enjoy one thing, another person might not. They might find a book offensive, but does that mean everyone else is offended by the book as well? Taking that book out leaves the person who would enjoy that book stuck searching for another book. Everyone is different, everyone has their own story, just like these books do.  Magazines are like books, they are meant to be enjoyed. I believe some magazines might not be appropriate for some people, But that doesn't mean they should take it off the shelf. It means that person should simply not read it. Magazines are made for all people to enjoy, that's why there are so many different kinds. They want to fit each magazine personally to each individual.  Music is the number one entertainment people enjoy. There is a reason why there are so many different genres. The music industry tries their best to sort the music to your taste. Just because one song has stuff in it you don't like doesn't mean you can delete that song from everyone. Music is used for many different ways. It relaxes you, pumps you up, it is used for parties, events, and so many other things. All songs are different so you can use them however you want. To ban music because someone doesn't like it, changes music forever. There would be no music to listen to.  People should be able to watch what movies they want. That's why there are ratings on movies. What is acceptable for teenagers may not be acceptable for young kids. That's why they should not watch it. If people banned all the movies they thought were inappropriate, there would be no rented movie stores, theaters, or success in the movie production industry. Everyone should know what kind of movies they like, and they should just watch what they like and leave the other movies for the people who enjoy them.  No, books, magazines, movies, and music cannot be perfect for everyone. Materials bring all different kinds of subjects and stories for everyone. Each material brings enjoyment to different people. To ban all the materials you believe are inappropriate will leave the shelves empty. What kind of library is that?
498	3475	2	3	I as a student, a child, and a citizen of the United States believe that every book should be allowed in any library. Books, movies, music, and other forms of media are essential for learning about the world around us. Each book offers a unique perspective and can provide valuable insights into different cultures, ideas, and experiences.  While some books may contain content that some people find offensive, it is important to remember that everyone has different tastes and opinions. Just because a book may not be to your liking does not mean it should be banned or restricted for others. Freedom of expression is a fundamental right, and it is important to respect the diverse range of voices and ideas that exist in the world.  In conclusion, I believe that all books should be available in libraries for people to explore and learn from. By embracing the diversity of literature, we can broaden our horizons, challenge our beliefs, and gain a deeper understanding of the world we live in. Let us celebrate the power of books to educate, inspire, and unite us as a global community.
499	3476	2	3	Dear newspaper, In my opinion, censorship in libraries should not extend to materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more. Censoring materials in libraries can lead to various problems, and I believe that it is not the best approach to managing content in these spaces.  Many libraries around the world implement censorship on their materials, often to protect children from explicit content. While I agree that children should not have access to inappropriate materials, I believe that censorship is not the solution. Instead, libraries can restrict certain materials to adult-only access or provide supervision for children using computers to ensure they are not exposed to explicit content.  Censorship in libraries can create issues such as limiting access to information, hindering children's educational opportunities, and preventing individuals from gaining valuable knowledge. By imposing censorship, libraries may deter potential customers who seek information on a wide range of topics, including those that some may find controversial or offensive.  Materials that some may find offensive can also be valuable sources of information for others. Just because a certain topic or perspective is deemed offensive by some does not mean it should be removed from library shelves. It is important to consider the diverse needs and interests of library patrons and ensure that a variety of materials are available to accommodate different preferences and learning styles.  In conclusion, I believe that censorship should not be enforced on materials in libraries as it can lead to the loss of valuable information. While certain content may not be suitable for all age groups, there are alternative ways to manage access to such materials without resorting to censorship. It is crucial to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and ensure that libraries remain inclusive spaces for all individuals to explore and learn.
500	3477	2	3	I think that all books, music, movies, magazines, and anything offensive should be removed from shelves to protect the innocence of children who may come across such material. While there should be a designated area in libraries for adults to access potentially offensive content if they choose, it is important to consider the impact of such material on young minds. Racist or derogatory language in books can be hurtful and perpetuate harmful stereotypes, making it essential to ensure that all library users feel respected and valued. Additionally, explicit content related to drugs or other sensitive topics should be kept separate from materials accessible to children. By creating a designated section for adult-oriented content, libraries can cater to diverse preferences while safeguarding the well-being of all patrons.
501	3478	2	3	Censorship is a significant aspect of libraries, impacting various materials such as books, movies, magazines, and computer access. While some individuals may find certain content offensive and advocate for its removal, others argue that exposure to such material can be educational. The library serves as a hub for individuals of all ages to access a wide range of resources, and strict categorization based on age groups helps in regulating access to inappropriate content. Parents play a crucial role in monitoring their children's library activities, ensuring they are exposed to suitable material. Moreover, while some may prefer a quiet atmosphere, others enjoy engaging in conversations about books and other topics. Creating designated areas for socializing within libraries could cater to varying preferences. Overall, libraries offer a welcoming environment for individuals to explore diverse content, with the freedom to choose what aligns with their interests and values.
502	3479	2	3	A library is a place to go and find books, music, and other things. It's a big resource with a huge variety of help for people. If books, music, or anything else on the shelves were found offensive, they should be removed. They should have a section for those materials, and access would require a librarian's permission to prevent offense to anyone. Leaving offensive material on the shelves could be disrespectful to cultural beliefs or inappropriate for the youth. Therefore, it is necessary to remove such items. Libraries should cater to everyone's needs and ensure a safe and comfortable environment for all visitors.
503	3480	2	3	It is not necessary to restrict certain books in libraries based on age. While some may argue that certain content may have a negative influence, it is important to consider that exposure to diverse perspectives and ideas can help individuals discover their interests and form their own identities. Movies and CDs with graphic content may be more understandable to restrict due to explicit language and violence. However, books allow for personal interpretation and reflection, making it less necessary to restrict based on age. Instead of restricting access, libraries can label content appropriately to inform readers about the material. Overall, allowing access to a variety of books can help individuals develop a sense of self and foster a diverse and enriched society.
504	3481	2	3	Many books in libraries contain profanity, which can be seen as a way for writers to effectively convey their points. While some readers may find the use of strong language offensive, it is important to consider the context in which the words are used. Children should be guided towards age-appropriate reading material to avoid exposure to offensive language. Adult books may contain more explicit language, but this is generally accepted by mature readers. It may be beneficial to segregate books with offensive language in a separate section of the library for adult readers. Overall, while strong language in books may not be suitable for all audiences, it can serve a purpose in conveying the intended theme or message.
505	3482	2	3	All libraries have books for all readers regardless of age, with materials arranged alphabetically by the author's last name. It is important to consider the graphic content in reading materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines, and some may need to be removed. To prevent children from accessing inappropriate materials, bookshelves should be organized by age group, with clear distinctions between sections. Parents play a crucial role in ensuring their children select age-appropriate books, and should take responsibility if a child mistakenly chooses the wrong material. By enforcing these guidelines, children can learn to make appropriate selections and avoid accessing content that is not suitable for their age.
506	3483	2	3	In many libraries, there are books, movies, magazines, and music that some people find offensive. However, just because something is offensive to some does not mean it should be removed from the shelves. These resources serve a purpose for those who are interested in them, provide valuable information for research and education, and contribute to increasing people's intelligence.  People have different preferences and interests, so what may be offensive to one person could be valuable and enjoyable to another. It is important to have a variety of resources available in libraries to cater to the diverse needs and tastes of the community. By allowing individuals to choose what they want to read or watch, they can avoid material that they find offensive and focus on what they find interesting and helpful.  Furthermore, libraries play a crucial role in providing access to information for research and education. Books, movies, magazines, and music in libraries can be valuable sources of information for students, researchers, and the general public. Removing offensive material would limit the availability of important resources that are needed for academic and personal growth.  Moreover, exposure to a wide range of materials, even those that may be considered offensive, can help to expand people's knowledge and understanding of different perspectives. Reading books, watching movies, and listening to music can enhance vocabulary, communication skills, and critical thinking. By engaging with diverse content, individuals can become more intelligent and open-minded.  In conclusion, while some may find certain books, movies, magazines, and music offensive, it is important to preserve these resources in libraries. They serve a variety of purposes, from catering to different interests and providing valuable information to helping individuals develop their intelligence and broaden their perspectives. By keeping offensive material in libraries, we uphold the principles of freedom of expression and ensure that individuals have access to a wide range of resources for learning and personal development.
507	3484	2	3	I think that people who find them offensive just need to stay away from them type of books, music, movies, and magazines. Some of the books people need to know about. Take the concentration camps for instance, people need to learn about them so we can prevent that horrible event from happening again. I think that by letting people read those types of books it helps us understand and learn what happened in the past. So we need to keep the books on the shelf and let people learn if not we could be in danger. They can be in danger by someone being like @PERSON1 and killing millions of Jews just because they look different. Also like slavery just because they are a different color doesn't mean they are not human. So keeping them on shelves could help our future. Also if you are disturbed by music or movies then simply don't listen/watch them but let other people who are interested in them learn. My mom thinks that bloody-scary movies shouldn't be allowed to sell in stores but I told her that's what some people like watching and that people need to watch some of them to try to not let anything like them happen ever. In conclusion, we should keep some of these bad books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelves so we will fight to keep horrible historical events from happening again.
508	3485	2	3	I do not believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves. Wherever you go in the world, whether you like it or not, you're going to come in contact with things you don't find appropriate or offensive. The world is far from perfect, and one reason I don't believe they should be removed is because it would be unconstitutional. The freedom of speech and the press was not meant to be tampered with. If a specific library thinks certain articles are inappropriate, a simple solution would be to place them in a designated section and warn people about their content.  Furthermore, children cannot be sheltered their entire lives; they need to face reality, and books can provide valuable insight. Kids today are resilient and can handle content that some may deem inappropriate. Parents must accept that their children will be exposed to offensive material in our imperfect world, as it is a natural part of growing up.  In addition, censoring libraries would go against the principles of freedom and expression that our country is built upon. The amendments guaranteeing freedom of speech and the press are fundamental rights that should not be compromised. People rely on these freedoms for more significant issues than the content of books, and censoring libraries would be a disservice to our nation.  Ultimately, it comes down to the responsibility of those running the libraries. Instead of removing controversial materials entirely, they can simply segregate them to a specific area and provide warnings for those who may find them objectionable. By doing so, individuals can choose to avoid such content while still allowing access to a wide range of information and perspectives. Censoring libraries would only limit access to diverse viewpoints and stifle intellectual freedom, which is contrary to the principles of democracy and open discourse.
509	3486	2	3	I believe that in libraries, certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if they are offensive. If someone does not like a particular item, they always have the option to choose something else. During my visits to libraries, I have never encountered anything offensive, and if someone finds certain items objectionable, they can simply avoid them. People have the freedom to choose what they want to read or listen to, and as long as it aligns with their preferences, it should not be a problem. Everyone has different tastes, and it is essential to respect individual choices when it comes to accessing library materials. In conclusion, libraries should continue to offer a diverse range of materials, even if some may find them offensive, as it allows people to make their own choices based on their interests and preferences.
510	3487	2	3	"Everything is offensive to someone. There is no way to make sure nobody is offended unless you have nothing to offend anybody at all. If there is something on the shelf, someone can find something offensive in it.  Moderate censorship is acceptable for the young, but there is a line, even though it is hard to find sometimes. Obscene images that are illegal to view by a minor are acceptable but those that are legal should be seen without censorship. Censorship for those who understand is unacceptable, although select items should be viewed under supervision. To strip the rights of a person is not acceptable.  The government has given people freedoms. One of those freedoms is the freedom of speech. This basically means I can say whatever I want and support whatever I want. A book is a form of speech. Although some speech is looked down upon, it should not be censored. Censorship is just basically saying, ""you cannot say this."" That moves on to, ""you cannot say,"" then, ""you have no say.""  In developing countries, such as Congo, if you go to the government and say what they are doing wrong and that you are against them, they shoot you. A better word for that would be they censor you. If you write a book saying how Obama could be a better president, but someone finds it offensive, what happens? They censor you. Now you get no say in the matter because the supporters of Obama don't want you to. Do you see much difference?  Supervision is a powerful thing. Guess what it can do better than censorship. With supervision, children can still learn about topics but are not simply thrown into the obscene areas of it. A person is a human being. That includes children. They have a right to learn without the influence of others, but censorship denies them of that right.  Censorship should not be used in libraries. It takes away freedoms and opportunities for children. It causes violence among people. It scars culture, and ignores religion. Although censorship has the ability to do more damage than any single person, it is not ""bad."" Censorship was created to protect people from things that they feel to be wrong. But good intentions do not keep wrong consequences at bay."
511	3488	2	3	With new things emerging these days, there is a call for a certain level of organization in libraries to categorize subjects appropriately. The aim is not to remove or destroy any materials, but rather to ensure that there is a fair system in place. It is important to consider that people have varying opinions and sensitivities when it comes to the content of books, magazines, and other media in libraries. By implementing a system of organization, individuals can easily navigate and avoid materials that may not align with their preferences or beliefs. This can help mitigate any potential offense or discomfort that certain materials may cause. While reorganizing library materials may require significant effort, it is a worthwhile endeavor to ensure that everyone can access materials that resonate with them while also respecting the diverse preferences of library users. Ultimately, the goal is to create a system that promotes inclusivity and allows individuals to make informed choices about the materials they engage with. Thank you for considering this proposal, and I hope that steps can be taken to explore this further and potentially implement changes in library organization.
512	3489	2	3	I believe that any kinds of books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Everyone is different and has their own beliefs and understandings. For example, if someone were to go to the library and purchase a book about the famous and deceased @PERSON1, and the other person did not like @PERSON1 and did not understand his cultural background they would take it offensive to come across that book on the shelf. If everyone had a say on what books or other materials were put on the shelves of libraries, we wouldn't have any libraries.  If everyone kept their opinions to themselves in libraries everyone could possibly remain happy and have no arguments. Everyone could express themselves every day, in their own way. In a library, no one can judge you for your beliefs, culture, or opinions. In a library, you have the right to have an open mind and experience a wide range of perspectives. Libraries are truly unique spaces where individuals can freely explore and express themselves without fear of judgment.
513	3490	2	3	The material that some people believe shouldn't be viewed by children should not be removed from library shelves solely for that reason. The library serves a diverse group of individuals, including adults who also have a right to access a wide range of materials. Children are exposed to inappropriate content in various settings, and it is essential to teach them how to navigate such information rather than sheltering them completely. Monitoring children's selections and guiding them towards age-appropriate materials is a more effective approach than removing certain items altogether. Additionally, removing materials not suitable for children could limit the library's offerings and discourage adult patrons from using its resources. Balancing the needs of both children and adults in the library is possible through thoughtful curation and supervision. In conclusion, rather than removing materials, it is important to find ways to accommodate different age groups while upholding the library's role as a place of knowledge and learning for all.
514	3491	2	3	I personally believe that there should be no censorship on books entering a country. It is important to allow all books to be available for readers, regardless of their content. People who are offended by certain material can simply choose not to read it. I have come across some books with surprising language, but nothing that I found personally offensive. Books serve a unique purpose, and authors publish them for the public to interpret as they wish. It is important to respect the freedom of expression and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they read.
515	3492	2	3	In this lifetime, we all have our own opinions about topics and problems in the world. One question that often arises is whether censorship in libraries is a problem or a right. While some may argue for the removal of certain books to protect children from inappropriate content, it is important to consider the constitutional right to access information freely. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed, as it goes against the principles of free speech and access to knowledge.  Personal experiences, such as being discouraged from reading a particular book at a young age, can influence one's views on censorship. However, instead of removing books altogether, setting age-appropriate boundaries or creating rating systems similar to movies could be a more effective solution. By categorizing books based on content, individuals can make informed decisions about what they choose to read.  It is crucial to remember the importance of freedom of expression and the role that literature plays in shaping our understanding of the world. The Constitution guarantees our right to speak, have opinions, and access information freely. By finding a balance between protecting children from harmful content and upholding our constitutional rights, we can ensure that censorship in libraries does not compromise the availability of diverse perspectives and ideas.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries should be approached with caution, balancing the need to protect children with the fundamental right to access information. Rather than removing books, implementing age-appropriate guidelines or rating systems can help create a more inclusive and informed reading environment. Let us preserve the integrity of literature and uphold our constitutional rights by finding alternative solutions to censorship in libraries.
516	3493	2	3	I think books that have explicit content such as nudity, curse words, or gang-related violence should not be easily accessible to children. These themes are not appropriate for young readers as they depict behaviors and situations that are not suitable for their age group. Children should not be exposed to topics like drugs, sex, or gang violence at a young age. Therefore, it would be best to either place these books on a separate adult shelf or remove them entirely from circulation. If adults wish to read such material, they can seek it out themselves. It is important to protect young minds from harmful influences and ensure that they are only exposed to age-appropriate content.
517	3494	2	3	NO, I believe that books and other materials should not be removed from shelves just because they are deemed offensive. In a free country, everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression. While it is important to ensure that the environment remains appropriate and respectful, it is also crucial to recognize that everyone has their own opinions and perspectives.  If we start removing books that offend certain individuals, then we risk losing a vast array of literature. Different people have different views and what may be offensive to one person may not be to another. Some offensive content can also serve as a reflection of our past and show how far we have come in terms of progress.  While it is understandable that some people may feel offended by certain material, it is also important to consider the broader context. If certain groups who are directly affected by offensive content are not raising concerns, then perhaps it is not necessary to remove such material. It is also worth noting that many forms of media, including movies, books, and magazines, often depict sensitive topics such as slavery and violence.  In my opinion, instead of removing offensive material, it is important to engage in open discussions and critical thinking. By exposing ourselves to different perspectives, even those that may be uncomfortable, we can learn and grow as individuals. It is crucial to understand that offensive content is a part of our history and culture, and we should approach it with an open mind rather than seeking to censor it. Ultimately, it is through diversity of thought and exposure to various viewpoints that we can truly educate ourselves and promote understanding in society.
518	3495	2	3	I believe that certain books, movies, music, and magazines should be taken off the shelves, to those who they are offending. I myself have not come across any books, movies, or music that have offended me. I believe that we should organize our books, movies, and music in a different way perhaps.  First of all, people who are offended by certain books and movies should speak up, and do something about it. Finding a way to reach a happy medium. If everyone could take a certain movie or book off of the shelf there wouldn't be any left in my opinion. If people find it offending they should stay away from those certain types books or movies.  Secondly, there are people like me who are not offended at all from these books, music, and movies. Its not fair for the ones like me to not be able to read, listen, or watch what we want to. If someone doesn't like the movie we loved, and they take it away it's not fair and buisnesses will lose customers.  Lastly, to find a happy medium between the offended and the people like me. I believe we could organize our books, movies, music, and magazines in a different way. Instead of organizing by author they should be organized by age restrictions. Just like rated R movies, or rated M video games. Books and music can be organized in this fashion also. It would be easier for people who are offended to stay away from the ones they don't want to be around.  In conclusion, I believe that allowing any one person to take a certain book, movie, or music off of a shelf is not very smart. One, its not fair for people who are not offended. Two, buisnesses will lose customers. Three, there is a better way to solve this problem.
519	3496	2	3	Dear Newspaper editor,  I have recently been faced with a situation that has made me feel rather uncomfortable at my local library. I saw a rather graphic magazine being displayed in front of the entire library. Now I know that those magazines are, for some, a point of interest, but to others they seem a tad bit crude. It also came to my attention that magazines aren't the only form of crude merchandise on the shelves of our local libraries. They are also littered with movies, books, graphic posters, along with what I find to be explicit music.  I know that it would be unreasonable for me to ask for the removal of the merchandise, but I would like to display a compromise that could come into play. What I believe to be crude, for some, may be acceptable, but why should I have to be uncomfortable at a public place, while others are unfazed. I believe that I have come up with a very simple compromise that would benefit me, as well as keep the merchandise available.  Most, if not all, should know that there are children's sections in most libraries. So, what if we were to place all the explicit material in its section? This way, customers who seek the material now know where to go to receive it. This way would lower the discomfort of going to our public library.  The benefits of this compromise seem endless to me. This way, children are left with a safe environment to pick out their books, and adults that find it explicit have a comfortable surrounding to enjoy their excursion to the library. I am not trying to benefit those who seek the material, but I think it would. This way, all the material they want can be found in one place, and they won't have to go searching the entire library for it.  I think I speak for most when I say that our public libraries need to be a safe, family-friendly environment, not only for children but for those who wish to enjoy their library experience.  Thank you for your time,  [Your Name]
520	3497	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' This statement implies that there are books on the shelves that parents do not want their children to access. Perhaps parents should screen the books beforehand or remove them from the shelves entirely. In my opinion, any books containing offensive content should be removed. If a book is based on a true story, even if it is offensive, it should still be available for everyone to read as it is a part of history. When it comes to music, only songs with excessive bad language should be removed from shelves. Children should only watch movies that are age-appropriate, and magazines should not be accessible to them. My own childhood experiences involved strict rules about avoiding media with inappropriate content, but I was allowed to read any book I wanted because the bad words were not understood by me. It seems that the speaker wants to preserve all books on the shelves, as everyone has the right to access them, but this would mean that potentially harmful content would remain available. Parents need to be more vigilant about their children's media consumption to ensure they are not exposed to inappropriate content. In conclusion, it is important to consider the content of books, music, movies, and magazines available to children and take appropriate measures to restrict access to anything deemed unsuitable.
521	3498	2	3	In a library, censorship should be controlled by the people who visit the library. If it is a public library, the visitors should have the right to choose which books go on the shelves. The library should not remove books based on the beliefs of one person; instead, a committee should be set up to decide which books to purchase. Books that are considered controversial or offensive should still be available in the library, as everyone has the right to choose what they want to read. School libraries, however, should be managed by the school administration or board to ensure that the books align with the educational objectives of the institution. Ultimately, the library's collection should be diverse and inclusive, allowing readers to explore a wide range of ideas and perspectives.
522	3499	2	3	Today I will inform you about the reasons why bosses or managers should remove books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries that are offensive to some people and kids.  One reason for removing such materials is that children often pick up magazines or books while their parents are shopping, and these items may contain inappropriate content that the children should not be exposed to.  Additionally, offensive content related to a person's culture or traditions can be found on the covers or within the pages of these materials. This can lead to individuals feeling insulted or misrepresented, causing unnecessary distress.  Furthermore, the presence of offensive material in libraries can be concerning, especially when young children are exposed to it. Libraries should be safe spaces for learning and exploration, and the inclusion of offensive content can detract from this purpose.  In conclusion, it is important for bosses and managers to remove offensive books, magazines, and movies from shelves in stores and libraries to ensure a safe and appropriate environment for all individuals, especially children.
523	3500	2	3	I don't think they should take down any book because they were donated to us in the first place. Also, I don't think they should take them down because it helps us learn about what other people went through in their lifetime. Look at it and try to live life as you would in another person's shoes. Try to see where they come from and their lifestyle. I'm not a big reader or anything, but once I get that one book that catches my eye and sounds good to read, I look at it and if it is good, I would take it and read for a long time because I want to know what happens next in the book. So I keep reading and reading and like in the middle of the story my teacher makes me stop reading. I would read as long as it takes but it just has to be the right book for me. I like all kinds of books from sports to sad emotional books. I like reading out loud to myself; it helps me understand a little bit better.
524	3501	2	3	There should not be any style of censorship in the US. I am a strong believer in our country's commitment to freedom of ideals and speech. Censorship goes against the principles that our nation was founded on, and it restricts our ability to explore different ideas and perspectives. While some forms of censorship, such as movie and song ratings, may be necessary to protect children, overall, censorship in libraries and other public spaces should be avoided. Instead of banning books, a rating system or warning labels could be used to help individuals make informed choices about the material they consume. Censorship limits our freedom and hinders our ability to be informed citizens. Let's uphold our constitutional right to freedom of expression and resist censorship in all its forms.
525	3502	2	3	Movies, books, music, magazines, and more all have their own way of expressing their content depending on what the author is discussing. If the author chooses to create something that you do not agree with or find offensive, then it is best to avoid that particular piece of material. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and has the freedom to express themselves. While opinions may have consequences, individuals still have the right to create the content they desire.  When a book is published, it is made available to the public, typically through libraries, where individuals can choose to read it if they wish. If a book is deemed offensive by some, it should not automatically be removed from shelves, as others may find value or enjoyment in it. The same applies to movies and other forms of media – if something is offensive to you, you have the choice to not engage with it.  It is important to remember that not everyone will share the same views on what is considered offensive. While it is valid to voice concerns about offensive material, ultimately, individuals have the freedom to choose what they consume. If a piece of material is widely considered offensive, then it may warrant a discussion about its availability. However, the decision to read or watch something ultimately lies with the individual. In a world with diverse perspectives, it is impossible to please everyone, but individuals can make choices that align with their own values and beliefs.
526	3503	2	3	Censorship is a controversial topic with differing opinions on its necessity. While some argue that censorship is essential to protect individuals from offensive material, others believe that it infringes on the freedom of expression. Personally, I do not believe that censorship is necessary. People should have the maturity to choose what they consume and avoid what offends them. If everything offensive was removed, there would be little left for people to access. Ultimately, censorship is a matter of individual responsibility and maturity in handling potentially offensive material. Everyone has the right to their own beliefs and should be able to navigate content without external restrictions.
527	3504	2	3	I think it should be that way about every thing. If something is offending you then you should say something about it. If the public finds something offensive, it should be considered for removal. Growing up, my dad always told me to avoid things that I didn't like. I believe that if something offends you, you should either change your ways or avoid it. While I personally don't get offended easily, I understand that some people do. It's important to be mindful of others' feelings. If something offends you, it's best to stay away from it. However, if a large number of people are offended by the same thing, it may be worth considering removing it. Ultimately, it's important to respect others' feelings and be open to different perspectives.
528	3505	2	3	I do not think that anything is really offensive, so I wouldn't really care what they have on the shelves. I do not easily get offended, so I don't know what some things would be offensive, but I guess that Black people would be offended by a racist book? I don't think that porn or anything involving nudity should be used in school libraries because some parents are very strict about that kind of stuff, and that is very inappropriate for school. I think some parents take it over the top with what's inappropriate and what's not.  Libraries that are just public libraries are totally different and should be able to have any movies and any books. It should not be a big deal what they are about. If people don't like it, they don't need to look at it or get it.  So, I think that libraries should have all different kinds of books and movies. If people don't like it, they can leave and don't have to worry about it. That is what I have to say about that problem. I hope that this has changed or persuaded you a little bit.
529	3506	2	3	I personally believe that offensive material should not be removed from shelves because it is the responsibility of parents to monitor what their children are exposed to. Parents should set boundaries for their children and educate them on what is appropriate for their age group. Additionally, in today's world, it is nearly impossible to completely avoid offensive material as it is prevalent in various forms of media. People also have the right to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to without facing judgment. One solution could be to place offensive material on higher shelves to make it less accessible to younger audiences while still allowing adults to make their own choices. Ultimately, censorship should not be the go-to solution, and individuals should be empowered to make informed decisions about the content they consume.
530	3507	2	3	"How can writing be offensive? Many people find swear words in writing or violence to be very offensive. Yet others find that those things make their writing more interesting. Writing can cover all aspects of life and give us ideas like racism and other inappropriate thoughts. It seems like in today's writing you can pick up just about anything and someone will find it offensive. That means if we censored our libraries to the extreme there would be no books left. It is just like Katherine Paterson says in the quote, ""...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" We can't deny that books and any other writing place ideas in our head. That idea is a seed and we can either choose to water that seed and let it grow or cause it to die out. I believe we have a choice to either accept or deny those offensive ideas in our head. If we find something offensive, simply set the book down and use that better judgment. We know what is right therefore we decide what is ok to read. Everyone sees things differently. What about children, can we trust their better judgement? I fear that children don't have as great of judgment as more mature adults. The responsibility of judgment lies more on the parents of that child than the libraries. The libraries place books for kids in a certain section to make sure they find appropriate books for their age. Both the adults and children get to find books that fit them and don't offend them. If libraries did do censorship it would deny us our rights and freedom to speak our minds clearly without a haze being placed to confuse it. We as a country were built off the radical and offensive things written about the past. Those words are what fired us up to become an independent country. Just think if they would have censored those ideas. Would we still be here today? What it all comes down to is not that we should censor our reading but that we should use our better judgment."
531	3508	2	3	In today's society, it is easy to find small things that offend people, whether it is politics or religion. The truth is that no one can keep everyone happy. A major debate in today's world is whether people should have the right to remove books, music, movies, or magazines from our shelves because they are found offensive to one person. The answer is no. Three important reasons support this answer: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the realization that everyone can find something offensive.  When the country was finally free from oppression, a main goal was to have freedom of speech. This was a significant achievement for the nation. Allowing people to remove material from our shelves would go against the very freedom we fought for. People today rely on being able to express their opinions to participate in their government.  Another fundamental right that citizens value is freedom of the press. The ability to write how they feel is a cornerstone of the country. Without this freedom, wouldn't we regress to the old ways that our ancestors fought to change? This is a crucial question to consider when making decisions about censorship.  Finally, a critical factor to consider is that everyone has an opinion on something. It is simple to find someone who is offended by the smallest of things. What happens when someone deems a piece of art offensive to their religion? Should we remove it from the shelves and apologize to the offended party? If we were to allow this, would there be any books, movies, music, or magazines left for us to enjoy?  It might be tempting to remove a book from the shelf just because it offends you, but what happens when this privilege extends to everyone? Therefore, when making decisions on censorship, careful consideration and thoughtful analysis are essential. We must always remember the rights we have as citizens: the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press. Additionally, we must contemplate how our decisions will impact future generations. Let us tread carefully in this matter to preserve the liberties that our predecessors fought so hard to secure.
532	3509	2	3	From my experiences as a student, I don't believe taking offensive material off the shelves is necessary. It gives a deeper look into information about these things. Also, you can't escape explicit material. These things are a part of life, something you can't run and hide from. You just have to accept the fact that it's there, and it's not going away. If you think your children are going to start doing those kinds of things after reading them, talk to them about it. You can't protect your children from offensive material. At least not forever. It's important to trust that individuals can make their own choices and learn from the media they consume. Ultimately, censorship of such materials only limits freedom of expression and prevents important conversations from taking place.
533	3510	2	3	I believe that there should be censorship because we live in a society that values freedom, and censorship is necessary to maintain order. People who find a book offensive should simply choose not to read it, rather than trying to ban it for everyone else. If a book is deemed offensive by a minority of people, it should not be removed for the majority who enjoy it. Instead, libraries could consider creating separate sections for controversial material to accommodate everyone's preferences. Ultimately, individuals who are sensitive to certain content should take responsibility for avoiding it rather than imposing their views on others. Freedom of expression is crucial, and censorship should be handled in a way that respects the diverse perspectives in our society.
534	3511	2	3	Many parents have had the experience of taking their children to the library only to find inappropriate content in books, magazines, or movies. This can be concerning as it exposes young minds to offensive material that may not be suitable for their age. It is important for public libraries to maintain a safe and welcoming environment for people of all ages, especially children. Therefore, it is crucial for libraries to remove any books, magazines, or movies that contain offensive or explicit content. By doing so, parents can feel more comfortable allowing their children to explore the library without fear of them coming across inappropriate material. Ultimately, the goal is to create a positive and educational space where everyone can feel at ease and enjoy the resources available.
535	3512	2	3	Libraries are public spaces that offer a variety of entertainment options to cater to the diverse interests of individuals. While some may have reservations about certain materials due to mature content, I believe that banning such content is unnecessary. People have the right to choose their form of entertainment, and what may not appeal to one person could be enjoyed by another. Criticizing and restricting certain materials limits artistic expression and deprives individuals of job opportunities in the creative industry. Ultimately, if a piece of entertainment is being published and consumed by a portion of the population, it should not be banned from public access. In conclusion, it is important to respect the diverse preferences of individuals and uphold the freedom of expression in the realm of entertainment.
536	3513	2	3	In libraries, censorship is necessary to some extent. Libraries do a good job of sorting materials, but there can still be offensive content within topics. As a child, I discovered inappropriate books and music while exploring the library. I believe there should be separate sections for more mature content to protect younger visitors. Libraries should consider implementing some level of censorship to ensure that all patrons can enjoy their experience without encountering inappropriate material.
537	3514	2	3	The quote by Katherine Paterson is a reminder that if we were to remove everything in the world that offends someone, there would be very little left. This is evident in situations where people call for the removal of books or magazines that they find offensive. However, it is important to consider the value of preserving historical information and the importance of free speech. Ultimately, actions speak louder than words, and it is crucial to critically think about the consequences of removing materials that may be deemed offensive.
538	3515	2	3	My views on censorship may differ from others, as I believe that a rating system for books, movies, and other materials in libraries would be the best approach. This system would provide parents with the information they need to make informed decisions about what their children are exposed to. Instead of banning books, they could be labeled or placed in a separate section to indicate potential inappropriate content. This way, everyone's needs could be met to some extent, without completely removing valuable materials. Disagreements are inevitable, but a rating system could help mitigate conflicts and allow for more freedom in decision-making. Ultimately, censorship should not involve outright removal of materials, but rather thoughtful consideration and communication to address concerns.
539	3516	2	3	Books are gateways to other worlds, offering readers the opportunity to escape their troubles and immerse themselves in different experiences. With a wide range of topics available, books have the power to educate, inspire, and entertain. However, the freedom to choose what to read is being threatened by the banning of books in schools. When books are removed from shelves based on the opinions of a few individuals, students lose the right to make their own choices.  The content of a book is ultimately up to the author, and readers should have the autonomy to decide what is appropriate for them. By censoring books deemed inappropriate by some, we not only restrict access to valuable literature but also undermine the trust and judgment of students. Students are capable of discerning what is suitable for them to read, and it is important to respect their autonomy in making these decisions.  As author Katherine Paterson aptly puts it, if we start removing books based on individual opinions, we risk depriving everyone of diverse reading options. Books play a crucial role in shaping students' intellectual and emotional development, and it is essential to preserve their right to choose what they read. By upholding this right, we ensure that students have access to a wide range of perspectives and ideas that can enrich their learning and personal growth.  In conclusion, the freedom to choose what to read is a fundamental right that should be protected in schools. By allowing students to make their own decisions about what books to explore, we empower them to learn, grow, and engage with the world around them. Let books remain on the shelves, serving as windows to different worlds and opportunities for personal enrichment.
540	3517	2	3	I believe that there are certain books and magazines that should not be displayed in libraries. This is because some materials may contain themes of racism, violence, or other offensive content that is not suitable for all readers, especially children. As a parent, I would not want my children to be exposed to such material at a young age. Therefore, it is important for libraries to carefully consider the content they make available to ensure a safe and appropriate reading environment for all patrons. By being mindful of the materials on display, libraries can create a welcoming space for everyone to enjoy without encountering potentially harmful or offensive content.
541	3518	2	3	There are many materials in libraries that are offensive to certain people. While they should not be removed from shelves, they could be placed in a separate section to accommodate those who may find them inappropriate. Offense can stem from various sources, such as jokes, political views, or issues related to sexuality. It is essential for individuals to learn how to navigate and cope with these differing perspectives as they grow and develop. By providing access to a diverse range of materials in libraries, individuals have the opportunity to educate themselves about the world around them and understand why certain topics may be considered offensive. Restricting access to such materials could also lead to individuals feeling offended by the limitation of their knowledge and understanding. Therefore, creating a separate section for potentially offensive materials in libraries allows for both freedom of information and respect for differing sensitivities.
542	3519	2	3	"Some books are offensive to some people. But everyone has the right to read any book they want. I believe we shouldn't censor books that are found offensive in schools. If people find a book offensive, they can choose to read another book or discuss their concerns with their teacher. Personal experiences with offensive books can vary, but it's important to remember that what may be offensive to one person could be meaningful or enlightening to another.   I have encountered books that I found offensive, but I understand that different books resonate with different individuals. It's all part of the learning experience. I have had peers express discomfort with certain books they were assigned to read in school, especially those dealing with sensitive topics like suicide. In these cases, it's important to communicate with teachers and find alternative reading options.   One book that stands out to me is ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" a novel that has faced censorship in some regions due to its themes. Despite the controversy, I found the story of a white lawyer defending a falsely accused black man to be powerful and enlightening. The book sheds light on the racial injustices of the past and the importance of standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity.   Censorship limits the freedom to explore different perspectives and learn from diverse narratives. It's essential to consider the opinions of others and not restrict access to valuable literature based on personal biases. High school students, on the cusp of adulthood, should have the opportunity to read a wide range of books to broaden their understanding of the world. Letting individuals decide what they want to read, or discussing concerns with educators, is a more constructive approach than imposing censorship.   In conclusion, censorship hinders intellectual growth and deprives individuals of the chance to engage with challenging but important material. It is crucial to uphold the freedom to read and make informed choices about the books we consume. Let's encourage open dialogue and diverse literary experiences in educational settings to promote critical thinking and empathy."

While there are valid reasons for censorship in certain contexts, such as protecting children from inappropriate content, it is important to consider the implications of restricting freedom of speech and expression. Parents should have the primary responsibility for censoring what their children are exposed to, rather than relying solely on government intervention. By offering both censored and uncensored versions of material, we can accommodate a range of preferences while respecting the rights of creators to express themselves freely. This approach allows for a balance between protecting children and upholding the principles of freedom of speech and expression in society.
544	3521	2	3	If materials are found to be offensive in a library, they should be removed to protect children who may be negatively impacted by such content. Young children, especially those under the age of ten, can be greatly influenced by offensive materials, such as those containing profanity, sex-related humor, or violence. It is important to consider the potential effects these materials can have on young minds.  Parents may unintentionally expose their children to inappropriate content by checking out materials that are not suitable for their age. This can lead to children being exposed to language or behavior that is not appropriate for their age group. Libraries should take responsibility for ensuring that materials available to the public are suitable for all age groups.  Individuals with religious or personal beliefs may also be offended by materials that contain profanity or inappropriate conduct. It is important to respect the diverse beliefs and values of library users by either removing offensive materials or providing warnings for those who may find them objectionable.  In conclusion, libraries should carefully monitor the materials they offer to the public and take action to remove offensive content. By doing so, they can ensure that libraries remain safe and welcoming spaces for individuals of all ages and backgrounds.
545	3522	2	3	People have different opinions on what one may find extremely offensive, another may not care or even laugh at it. In this next paragraph, I will explain the reasons why censorship should not be allowed in libraries. One of the first things is our freedom of speech. If we truly have that freedom, censorship violates it completely. Some people may be offensive, but it is important to remember that they are entitled to their opinions. They have the right to speak for what they believe in, whether it be through magazines, books, newspapers, movies, or music. The author or artist may use these mediums to spread their ideas and beliefs. Another reason is people's opinions. Does one person really speak for an entire gender, country, culture, race, or religion? Whether they are of low status or of great power, someone may think differently and miss out on something they could have been inspired by or learned from. It is not right to deprive communication through these mediums. A man may find a book offensive to himself or his family, but another man just like him may find the book funny and joke about it. People think differently from each other. Personal experiences also play a role. Maybe a near-death experience causes someone to write a book, or a bad breakup inspires someone to create a song. These experiences help inspire people, and no one can tell them it is wrong just because they find it offensive. All these factors should be considered. No one person or group of people have the right to take away our freedom. I am against censorship in libraries, and I hope you are too.
546	3523	2	3	When going to the library parents should be able to trust that their child is actually going there to study, not to look up bad books, movies, or magazines. Too many books and movies are showing that relying on violence is a good thing. For example when children are searching for a good book they aren't looking for something boring, they're looking for something that catches their eye. Most of these books resulting to violence. The more kids read about this, the more they think violence is okay.  Also magazines like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or '@CAPS3 @CAPS2' are now showing stories of drugs use, teen pregnancy, or death of famous @CAPS3. @DATE1 our world has been increasing in the drug use of teens and adults, also the pregnancy rate of teens has went up dramatically in the past few years. These two things are not okay. I personally believe the reason these two topics have went up is because kids are thinking it's fine since they're reading about it in the new magazines, or seeing it on a tv, or reading about it in a book.  Kids or teens are believing it's easy to have a child at such a young age, or using drugs is cool because all the hot famous @CAPS3 are using them, which is shown in the magazines and books. But what kids aren't understanding is that it's really not as easy or fun as the movies, books and magazines are making it sound.  What happened to the library's that had information that was actually helpful in school? I understand that @CAPS3 are wanting to read about famous @CAPS3 and what's new with them. But when all of these types of books, magazines, and movies are put into our libraries it is limiting the amount of actual helpful information kids need for school or adults are needing for work. When I was younger,  I would go to the library and I either went thier to study or to check out a good book. Not a book about violence, murder, or teen precnancy. Kids need to be able to rely on the libraries for a good book or information that will help them in school, not on topics that don't relate to school at all.  As author, Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. I believe she is correct, these types of books, magazines, and movies that we don't want our kids finding need to be removed from the shelves of our libraries.
547	3524	2	3	Who is to label a book offensive? What one might find appalling, others may find a novel or passage to be rather interesting. All books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people. Libraries banning books, music, movies, or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests.  Books such as The Catcher in the Rye, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and To Kill a Mockingbird have been removed from many library shelves. Though some people may find these books offensive, many others find them either enlightening or think they should be readily available. I have read a decent amount of each of the above readings, and have found the books to be full of remarkable things which have taught me a lot. If books are banned from libraries, it almost seems as if they're limiting our education.  Why would a book be published, or written for that matter, if we were not intended to read it? Any book could be offensive to any one person. Any article, song, or film could be offensive. But, there will always be a crowd it appeals to. And that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word. Censorship in libraries has gone on too long, it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them.  The solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub-categories. First by subject, down to the author. Therefore, books that may be offensive are listed as such, but are still available to those who want to read them.  Censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day. People should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it. All books are written to be read, and with the division of such books, everyone can agree upon this: books help us grow. Growth is not meant to be limited, nor is freedom.
548	3525	2	3	People have a choice on the types of literature they want to read whether it offends them or not the choose to read it. Books should not be removed from the shelves of libraries. They need to try to avoid the books that may be offensive to them. Now if they can't, then that's not the library's fault. Books should not be removed for many reasons.  One of the many reasons books should not be removed is because individuals know the risk they take when entering a library, and that's their decision that they are making and sometimes decisions have consequences. When and if they are offended, they will know the types of books that offended them, so they would just have to do a little better job of avoiding those books.  Another reason would be the libraries don't know what offends people; it can be one little thing in a book but that doesn't mean that book should be removed from the shelves. Also, just because one person thinks it's offensive doesn't mean that others will. People aren't all offended by the same thing; some people are offended by little things, meaning they're offended easily, some aren't offended so easily, that means it may take more serious things than a book to offend a person.  Another reason books shouldn't be removed is because students need them for projects and school assignments. Some school assignments require you getting a little offended, especially if you're African American and you get an assignment on slavery or something during that time. But we need to learn about past experiences and our history, and we couldn't do that if some people are trying to remove some of those books from the shelf. You may get offended, but there is no reason to remove that book that others will need at some time. Find another way to solve that problem.  There are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone. There is no need to completely remove the book. Another solution would be to maybe separate the books, meaning put the books in a different location of the library if they get more than a couple of complaints of being offensive. Also, when someone checks out a book, the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and it's possible that it may offend them. That's why removing books from shelves isn't the cause for concern.
549	3526	2	3	Certain books, music, and magazines can be found offensive and harmful to children, influencing them in negative ways. It is important for parents to be vigilant and keep their children away from such content to ensure they grow up to be successful and well-rounded individuals. By limiting exposure to violence, drugs, and unrealistic beauty standards, we can help shape a better future for our children. Encouraging positive influences and steering clear of harmful media can lead to a more promising and fulfilling life for our youth.
550	3527	2	3	There are plenty of books that people don't want their children reading. Books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1' is a book I had read and it was very out there and straight forward. But I would have to disagree I think those books deserve to be read. It shows kids that not everything is perfect.  People complain about how they think books are bad or things people say on @CAPS3 or in music is bad but if you don't want to listen to them, don't let your kids listen to it. If parents are so worried about what kids are reading or learning because of the world we live in now, lock them up. But I do have to agree with one thing, there are a lot of bad things in music and magazines but I think it can be avoided and not be caused to corrupt a kid.  I'm very into music and some music I don't listen to because of the things in it but I don't let that music or magazines change my opinion on things. I don't think people should be able to take books off the shelves because it doesn't give other students or people to read them. Some people get inspired by books about drugs, not to use them but to know that there are people out there that have overcome situations just like them.  I like reading books about teenage problems and like to know all the different ways people have overcome them and see how they live. If people can get offended by a book or movie I don't think they have a right to take that away. I think people that feel offended by books, magazines, and movies should stay away from them if they are offensive to them because everyone has an opinion and not everyone thinks the same things.  With all the bad or good movies or books out there, I'm certain someone at least feels offended by one or two books or movies but that isn't a reason to want to take it down. Because once you do that someone will take a book you thought wasn't offensive and it will make you mad. I think if people stayed away from things that offended them and stayed close to books that they liked we wouldn't have much of a conflict unless you get that picky, always wanting to start a fight person to find something else to be picky about with the books or magazines or movies.
551	3528	2	3	Do you think having inappropriate or offensive books, magazines, movies, or music should be found in a public library? Some books could be very offensive to people, and when they take their children or younger siblings to the library, they don't want them looking at that. Others prefer looking at it, which would anger them if they were taken away. Not all parents find some of the things in libraries offensive, even if they may be. Having music, magazines, movies, or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it.  Even though having children look at something they shouldn't could be bad, it's also bad and unfair to those who only come to the library to view those things. It shouldn't be taken away from them. If parents don't want their children seeing those things, they shouldn't take them to that section. Some adults don't enjoy seeing it, which can be understandable. No matter what, someone wouldn't be very happy about the decision.  In libraries, there is usually an adult section and kids section. If an adult doesn't want their child seeing something, they could simply take them to the children's section where it won't be seen. In the children's section, it's hard to find things that would be considered 'offensive' to adults. For the adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things, they could be in a section far away from the children. Taking things that people like away from someone is wrong, and it would be mean to take that away from those who enjoy it.  Recently, the world has been turning into something it shouldn't. Some of the most disgusting and cruel things happen every day, and you could probably find this news in a library. It's understandable if you wouldn't want your child around that, but it's wrong to take away those things from the people that love that stuff. For example, scary movies could be very disturbing and too violent for a young child, but they could be an adult's favorite thing to watch. That's why, if you put the more offensive things in a different section, the kids wouldn't notice it was even there.  If children were put into a different section, they wouldn't even notice the offensive things adults find. Taking away the things some adults may find offensive is like taking away the children's section, unfair. It wouldn't be fair to take away something that some adults or teenagers only come to the library for. Not all adults would understand both sides, but I can see where both sides are coming from. If I had children, I wouldn't want them seeing things that are offensive, but I would keep them away from it instead of promoting against it. Having music, magazines, movies, or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it.
552	3529	2	3	There are millions of books and other media in libraries all across the world. Millions of people read and listen to those materials every day. Some people like certain books or media and dislike others. Many people dislike certain materials because of their content. Everyone has the right to read and watch what they want and not everyone will read or watch the same materials. Although some materials may be offensive, they should not be removed from the libraries.  Books and other media should not be removed from library shelves because what some people find offensive does not offend other people. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs and opinions. If someone wants to read a book or watch a video, they should be able to. What is offensive and what is not is a personal choice and it all depends on that person's point of view. If someone thinks the content in a book, song, or movie is offensive, then they should not read or listen to it.  Materials should not be removed from libraries because they can be used to learn history and other things that people should know about. Take, for example, the Holocaust. There are thousands of books on the Holocaust and many movies as well. These materials should not be removed from library shelves because even though some people find them offensive, they can be used to teach people how horrible it was so that it does not happen again. People should inform themselves about something before they view it so that they are not offended by the content inside. Some content in history is very mature and should only be viewed by mature audiences.  The offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there. Most content that some people find offensive is for adult audiences. There are not children's books that talk about things that parents would find offensive to their children. The content has a right to be there. If the author or publisher took the time to create the work, then they should receive credit for making it. In the United States, there is freedom of speech and people should be able to say what they want to say. If the content is too offensive then it should be removed but only under special circumstances.  The content in libraries, offensive or not, should not be removed. People can read or watch whatever they want. Many people have many different opinions on what should and should not be in libraries. The libraries are public and they are shared. No one person has the right to dictate what should and should not be in libraries. If it was not for libraries, the people in society would not be as smart as they are. Ultimately, the diversity of opinions and materials in libraries enriches our society and should be preserved.
553	3530	2	3	Censorship in libraries is essential to protect young children from accessing materials that may be inappropriate for their age and level of maturity. By withholding books, movies, music, and other media that contain explicit content, libraries can help ensure that children are not exposed to harmful material. Setting age limits for certain types of materials can also help parents make informed decisions about what their children are exposed to. Overall, censorship in libraries should be allowed and enforced to safeguard the well-being of young patrons.
554	3531	2	3	One day, a concerned individual walked into a library and noticed that some books in the young adult section may not be age-appropriate due to their content. This observation raised the issue of censorship in libraries and the need for stricter categorization of reading material. Some books and magazines may contain inappropriate themes or language that could be harmful to children and young adults. Implementing a rating system for books, similar to movies, could help guide readers towards age-appropriate content and prevent access to material that may be unsuitable for certain age groups. Additionally, increased supervision by librarians could ensure that individuals are aware of the content they are checking out and prevent unintentional exposure to mature themes. By taking these measures, libraries can better protect the well-being of their patrons and provide a safer reading environment for all.
555	3532	2	3	This essay is to describe my opinion on if certain materials that can be offensive should be removed from shelves in libraries. I think that overall, anything taken as offensive to anybody should be taken out of libraries. If they are very offensive, then they should be removed, but if they are just mildly offensive, then I think they should stay. The library welcomes people of all ages, and materials that can be offensive for children may not be taken as offensive to adults. Children have access to everything in the library, so if they come across something that their parents find offensive, the library could be at risk of being sued. Removing materials that are not suitable for all ages can help reduce this risk.  Libraries are meant to provide information, so having offensive materials that do not contribute to knowledge is unnecessary. Libraries should focus on containing encyclopedias, dictionaries, and books that provide useful information to people. In conclusion, materials that can be offensive to anyone of any age should be removed from libraries. Libraries should stick to their core purpose of providing information to the public.
556	3533	2	3	Should books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive to the public be removed? No, I strongly disagree. While some individuals may find certain content offensive, it is important to remember that everyone has different preferences and opinions. Removing materials based on the objections of a few would limit access for those who may benefit from or enjoy them. It is essential to respect diverse perspectives and allow for a range of content to be available to accommodate the varied interests and needs of the public. Ultimately, censorship should not dictate what is available for consumption as individuals should have the freedom to choose what they read, watch, or listen to based on their own preferences and beliefs.
557	3534	2	3	No, I don't think that books or any other material should be taken off shelves in libraries just because some people might find them offensive. If a parent doesn't want their child reading a certain book, they can simply advise their child against it. Removing books altogether denies others the opportunity to learn and gain knowledge from them. Education is vital, and books offer valuable lessons, even if they contain content that some may find objectionable. It is important to preserve access to diverse perspectives and information in order to foster learning and growth. Letting individuals make their own choices about what they read is essential for promoting understanding and critical thinking. So, books should not be censored or removed from libraries based on individual sensitivities.
558	3535	2	3	"Censorship in libraries is crucial in both schools and public settings. Some media, such as movies, books, and magazines, can have a significant impact on children. Violent and inappropriate content can influence kids in negative ways, leading them to believe that such behavior is acceptable. For example, movies like ""@LOCATION1"" depict graphic violence and racism, which can distort a child's understanding of right and wrong.   Similarly, magazines promoting guns and hunting can give children the wrong impression that carrying weapons or hunting animals is normal. This can be dangerous if kids are not mature enough to comprehend the consequences of such actions. Books, too, can start innocently but escalate into disturbing and violent themes, potentially glamorizing harmful behavior.  Therefore, it is essential to restrict access to age-inappropriate content in libraries to protect children from being exposed to harmful influences. By implementing censorship or age restrictions, we can ensure that kids are exposed to appropriate material that promotes positive values and healthy development. Ultimately, safeguarding children from harmful media is a responsibility that cannot be overlooked."
559	3536	2	3	I believe that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. If someone finds something offensive, they can simply choose not to engage with it and find something else that interests them. Everyone has different opinions and sensitivities, so it's important to allow individuals the freedom to make their own choices about what they read or view. Removing offensive materials would limit access to a wide range of perspectives and ideas, which is essential for a diverse and inclusive society. It's crucial to respect varying viewpoints and allow people to decide for themselves what they want to engage with in a library setting.
560	3537	2	3	Censorship in Libraries  Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' There are many books, magazines, and movies out there that contain content not necessarily appropriate for young children. Part of a parent's job is to ensure their children are safe and looking at materials appropriate for their age level. However, this does not mean taking materials off of library shelves for everyone. Censorship in libraries rids people of their freedom to choose. Also, content that is inappropriate for children may be fine for adults to read. It is the responsibility of the parent to censor what their child takes off the shelf.  All people have certain rights allowing them to express themselves and to be free. People have the freedom to choose, whether it is books, magazines, movies, or music. Everyone is different and this causes the interests of each person to be different, also. Libraries offer a variety of materials and this allows people to choose what they want based on their interests. Censoring the content on the shelves of libraries may be a good idea for children, however adults have the right to choose what they want to take from the shelf. Would you like to have a portion of your freedom taken away? Censorship would greatly lower the freedom of everyone and their individuality.  Furthermore, censoring what is on the shelves of libraries limits the range of materials that are available to patrons. There is content out there that children should not see; however adults have the right to choose what they want to read and come in contact with. Although certain materials are not meant for children to see, adults may find it enjoyable and interesting. Libraries offer a large range of materials and this allows people to express themselves and find entertainment. There are many different types of books and music out there and censoring these would greatly limit the variety.  In addition, parents have the responsibility to watch over their children. They choose what their child wears, where they live, and where they attend school. It is no different when it comes to books, movies, and music. Each parent has a different style of parenting and they choose what works best for their child. If one parent finds something to be offensive or inappropriate, they shelter their children from it. However, another parent may not have a problem with it. The content children choose from library shelves should be at the discretion of the parent. After all, you cannot shelter children from everything.  Censorship in libraries results in more problems than solutions. It rids patrons of their right to choose and their freedom. Censoring materials also greatly limits the variety of content available for people to choose from. It is not the responsibility of the law to choose what children can and cannot read, but rather the parent's job to watch over what they take off the shelf. As citizens of the world, we have rights and freedom allowing us to act as individuals. Censoring the materials on library shelves results in very little materials left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'
561	3538	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic of debate in today's society. While some argue that libraries should have the freedom to stock whatever materials they see fit, others believe that censorship is necessary to remove offensive or immoral content. I personally believe that censorship in libraries is important, but it should be done in a thoughtful and controlled manner. Libraries should establish clear standards for the type of material they want to offer, and adhere to those standards when selecting books and other resources. However, it is crucial that these standards are not set too strictly or too leniently, as finding the right balance is essential. Overall, while censorship in libraries is still relevant, it should be more regulated to ensure that the materials available align with the values and expectations of the community.
562	3539	2	3	Author Katherine Paterson argues that censorship should not be allowed in libraries, as it can lead to the removal of books and other forms of entertainment that some may find objectionable. She emphasizes that everyone has the right to their own opinion, but if censorship continues, there may be no books left on library shelves for anyone to enjoy. Censorship limits the freedom of authors and artists to create as they choose, and it deprives individuals of the opportunity to make their own choices about what they read or view. Paterson warns that if censorship is not addressed properly, it could result in a loss of valuable knowledge and entertainment for future generations. It is crucial to protect the diversity of literature and allow individuals to access a wide range of perspectives and ideas. Ultimately, censorship in libraries should be abolished to preserve the richness and variety of books available for all to enjoy.
563	3540	2	3	Censorship is a law that is often disregarded, particularly in libraries where certain books, movies, music, or magazines may be restricted. This not only impacts the freedom of expression for writers and creators but also limits the knowledge and exposure of individuals, especially within the school system. The right to express beliefs and feelings on various topics is a fundamental right in the US, and censorship can hinder this right. Libraries and schools should not restrict access to certain materials based on personal preferences, as it goes against the principles of respect and freedom of information. The government should take a more active role in enforcing laws against censorship to prevent discrimination and allow individuals to explore a wide range of ideas and perspectives. Ultimately, censorship should not be tolerated or ignored, as it infringes upon the rights of both creators and individuals seeking knowledge.
564	3541	2	3	Do you think that books with vulgar content should be available in libraries? While some may argue that such books should be removed from shelves, it is important to consider the historical and moral significance behind them. The banned book list includes titles like @PERSON2, @PERSON1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 @PERSON2's @CAPS4, which have been challenged for various reasons. However, the presence of offensive language or themes does not necessarily warrant censorship. It is ultimately up to the individual to decide whether or not to engage with such material. Just as movies are rated for content, books could also be labeled accordingly. Banning books with controversial elements limits intellectual freedom and deprives readers of diverse perspectives. In conclusion, the availability of books with offensive content should not be restricted, as readers have the autonomy to choose what they consume.
565	3542	2	3	I think censorship in libraries is wrong. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to enlighten, inform, and entertain readers. Just because someone finds something offensive in a book, movie, or magazine doesn't mean that it should be censored for everyone else. People have the right to choose what they want to read or watch, and limiting access to certain materials because of personal preferences is unfair to others who may not have the same concerns. Everyone pays taxes to support libraries, so they should have the freedom to access a wide range of materials without restrictions. It is important for individuals to take responsibility for monitoring what their children read and watch, rather than imposing censorship on the entire community. Ultimately, censorship goes against the principles of freedom of expression and access to information, and should be avoided in libraries.
566	3543	2	3	In Katherine Paterson's writing, she expresses her concern about children picking up books that may be offensive. While it is important to be mindful of the content children are exposed to, there could be sections in libraries designated for certain age groups that are not accessible to everyone. This way, children can explore books that are appropriate for their age without the risk of stumbling upon material that may not be suitable for them. By having more vigilant library staff members monitoring the shelves, we can ensure that children are guided towards age-appropriate reading materials. This approach can help prevent situations where children accidentally come across books that are not meant for their age group. Ultimately, creating separate sections in libraries for different age groups can help provide a more tailored and safe reading experience for children.
567	3544	2	3	There are some movies, books, music, etc. that can be found offensive to certain individuals. If a person is of the appropriate age for a particular form of literature, they should have the freedom to engage with it. If something is deemed offensive upon reading or viewing, then perhaps it was not the right choice in the first place. Entertainment mediums such as books, music, and movies are created with the intention to entertain, and if that purpose is not fulfilled, then it may not be suitable for that individual.  Personal experiences of being offended by a movie, for example, can stem from various reasons. In my case, I watched a film that depicted the degradation of women, which deeply offended me as I realized these characters were someone's loved ones. It made me reflect on how I would feel if it were my own mother in that situation. While authors may not intend to offend their readers, there might be ways to present their ideas more thoughtfully.  It is important to remember that everyone has their own perspectives and ways of interpreting information. If a particular book or movie is offensive to one person, it may still be appreciated by another. Expressing why something is offensive can lead to constructive dialogue and potentially prevent similar instances in the future. Parents, in particular, should be mindful of the content their children are exposed to, as it can have a lasting impact on their development.  In conclusion, if something is found offensive, it is crucial to learn from that experience and communicate the reasons behind the offense. While it may not be necessary to remove offensive content from shelves, individuals can make informed choices about what they consume. Ultimately, entertainment should serve to entertain and uplift, rather than offend or harm.
568	3545	2	3	I believe that censorship is a very debatable subject for many. However, I think that it is important to consider the impact of media on children and the influence it can have on their behavior and attitudes. While adults should have the right to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to, children need to be protected from content that may be harmful or inappropriate for their age. By implementing censorship, we can help safeguard children and promote a healthier environment for their development. Ultimately, censorship, when applied thoughtfully and appropriately, can play a significant role in shaping our society for the better.
569	3546	2	3	To whom it may concern; As a student who enjoys reading, I believe that books, movies, and magazines containing explicit material should not be taken off the market. We have the right to free speech and the freedom to choose what we want to read or watch. While some may find explicit content disturbing, others may find it appealing. It is important to remember that we have the choice to avoid such material if it does not align with our personal preferences. Parents also have the authority to monitor what their children are exposed to and set guidelines accordingly. If we were to start removing books and other media containing explicit material, we would risk limiting our options and stifling our freedom of expression. It is essential to respect the diversity of opinions and allow individuals to make their own choices when it comes to reading and viewing material. In conclusion, the availability of books, movies, and magazines with explicit content should be preserved to uphold our right to freedom of expression and choice.
570	3547	2	3	To who it may concern,  I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves of a library if they are found offensive. While some materials may be deemed offensive by certain individuals, others may have a different perspective. I think that if something is considered offensive, it should be placed in a special section where mature individuals can access it. Books are valuable to many people in the United States, and just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it should be banned for everyone.  Many people enjoy reading materials that others may find offensive, and it is not wrong for them to appreciate something that has been written. Just because a book or magazine contains content that someone finds objectionable does not mean it should be removed. I believe that there should be sections in libraries for different age groups, allowing parents to control what their children have access to.  Creating a specific section for offensive materials in libraries may require more work, but it would be a solution that accommodates everyone's preferences. Libraries are already organized, so it would not be difficult to designate a separate area for controversial materials. This approach would allow people to access what they want while respecting the views of others.  In conclusion, I strongly believe that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. People have different tastes and interests, and it is important to provide access to a variety of materials for a diverse audience. By creating a designated section for controversial content, libraries can cater to the needs of all patrons without restricting access to valuable resources.  Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.
571	3548	2	3	I believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like. Censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not. By giving everyone the freedom to enjoy what they like will make a lot of people happier. The wants and needs of people vary from one extreme to the other. What one person loves, another may hate. This should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way. Taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it. By doing this, not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want. Censorship should not take part in any library. Entertainment cannot always please everyone. It will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say, so the problem should just be left alone. Arguments to remove material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse. Opinions will vary with what I have had to say. I strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in. Censorship definitely has its positives and negatives, but for the most part, it is wrong and should not have a role in any library. Cutting down people's availability to their interests will only lead to frustration. You cannot please everyone, so in that case, censorship will just have to be looked beyond.
572	3549	2	3	Libraries hold many books and movies with a wide range of genres and styles, including fiction, nonfiction, historical, fantasy, and adventure. While some of these materials may be perceived as offensive to certain groups, it does not necessarily warrant their removal from shelves. One such example is the book 'The Birth of a Nation', which portrays blacks as slaves and uses offensive language, reflecting a time when such attitudes were prevalent. Similarly, the movie 'Slumdog Millionaire' has faced criticism for its depiction of a boy from a slum being mistreated, potentially perpetuating negative stereotypes about intelligence based on socio-economic background. Despite these concerns, these works continue to be available in libraries and stores due to their historical significance and artistic value.  While some individuals may find certain books or movies offensive, it is important to consider the context in which they were created. For instance, the book 'Gone with the Wind' presents conflicting views on slavery during the Civil War era, which could be unsettling to some readers. However, these works provide valuable insights into the past and spark important discussions about societal values and progress. Rather than censoring materials based on potential offensiveness, it is essential to preserve diverse perspectives and encourage critical thinking among readers.  In conclusion, the presence of potentially offensive content in libraries should not automatically lead to censorship or removal. By allowing a variety of voices and viewpoints to coexist, libraries uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and promote a deeper understanding of complex issues. While it is crucial to acknowledge and address concerns about offensive portrayals, the value of preserving diverse literary works outweighs the discomfort they may cause to some individuals. Letting books and movies remain on shelves enables readers to engage with challenging topics and broaden their perspectives, contributing to a more informed and inclusive society.
573	3550	2	3	Would you ever read a book about the @CAPS1 times if your @CAPS2? Are you going to read about how people of your religion and maybe even your family were tortured? Probably not. If you're a person of color, would you want to engage in a book that talks about slavery? Not likely. And if you're a mother, would you want to read a novel or magazine about abortion? Would you let your child read that book? Of course not. So why are these books on the shelves? They're there to drown us in the knowledge they hold.  Whether we are learning about criminals, racism, or wars, there will always be someone who is against it all. When we read, we look for books that spark ideas and images in our heads, that bring us enjoyment. Most of us don't quite understand why others refuse to read such books or even hold in their hands a book that challenges their beliefs. Beliefs are important to people, regardless of their age, gender, sexuality, or race. It's just a way of life.  Some stories are there for our entertainment, some evoke emotions, and some are there for our knowledge. Authors write based on events that have happened or what they predict could happen in the future. They try to help us understand the world around us, not to offend us. Books can affect people in many ways, both positively and sometimes negatively. It's something that authors can't always control, so we can't blame anyone for being offended.  I believe that libraries should have these books on their shelves. They are good for us. No, I don't mean we should literally consume books. We should take the time to read some of those so-called offensive books. Even if you may be hesitant, reading these books can help us understand how terrible times were in the past and how some things are still unjust. Take abortion, for example. Books about abortion shed light on the impact it has, not just on the women who undergo it, but on society as a whole. They appeal to our emotions in a way that makes us think twice about life's decisions.  Books should be kept on the shelves for our own well-being. When faced with a choice, we will know what to do. Books help us differentiate between right and wrong. They are placed on shelves not for profit, but to educate and inform. I trust that you can grasp the message I am trying to convey. So, head over to your library and pick up a book about something that intrigues you. Who knows, you might find a book that challenges your perspective and makes you reconsider the information it holds.
574	3551	2	3	In my opinion, I do not believe that anyone has a choice in what children or any other age group chooses to read. It is not up to the general public to say what is right or wrong. When society says that every single child is not allowed to read a certain book, or listen to a certain song just because it is found offensive to some people. There are laws against restricting what a person can or can not view. There is a level of media that is not as appropriate as it should be but that does not mean it has to go away completely. Some of the reasons society can not sensor everything are because of the fact that not everone is offended by everything, it is up to the parent of the child to say what is right or wrong, and lastly individuality is comprimised if the choices we have are limited. When someone gets offeneded by the media that is out there, that does not neccessarily mean that another person is also offended. When I do not like a video, or a book, or any other type of content, someone else should not have that content censorded because my opinion is in the way of what they enjoy. I know that personally I would not want someone to take away my favorite book so my child could not read it. Content that is out in the public will always be unsafe to read by someone else's views. Just like I will not believe in what other people believe in, but, I will see that it is valued by others and should not remain a censored topic. Books that are considered inappropriate, should be decided to has censoreship by the parents of a young child. Decisions like that should not be left up to a group of people that has opposite views. Whe children are growing up and are taught the values that know today, it is their parents that teach them and not a society full of people which have different kinds of opinions. There is a saying by an author and it says 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' and all that means if we all would have the power to remove a book or any other content from the shelf that we do not like then their would not be any books left. I believ in that saying and I also believe that many others will as well. Individualaity is when one person has differnt traits of feelings than another human being. We all have choices of the books we read and the musice we listen to and that is why we all have individuality. When people start to thnk that they are allowed to remove a certain song or book because that is not what they want other people to see, then everyone will do the same and no one would have that song they enjoy or the traits that make them differnt because they are the only one that likes that song. If there were not any of us left on this earth that has something that they enjoyed and no one else that also enjoyed the same thing, then we would all be pretty boring. I have learned from experience that being the person that has something different about them is not a bad thing and is actually a good thing in some cases. Also from experience I have learned that a boom that is no longer on the shelf that someone has removed is not a good feeling. I would not want the same happen to all of the other books in the world. It is a very good thing to practice the art of understading, and to have an open mind when it comes to a certain material that another person happens to enjoy. In the future, when I find a book that may not be a book I would want my children to read, I will just let the topic go and remember that everyone has their own opinions. So in conclusion I just want to let everyone know that books that are seen as inappropriate or offensive to one person, may be seen as a good thing to another.
575	3552	2	3	Take it @CAPS1? How do you take it when people come out with magazines, movies, or music that is extremely offensive to you? How can you stop your children or the younger generation from watching these things? The truth is we cannot stop them; there is so much pornography and inappropriate content out in this world that it is easily accessible. It is all over the internet, and controlling what children are exposed to can be challenging.  If you find something very offensive in a store or online, you should have the right to voice your opinion, and it should be taken seriously. Inappropriate content should not be displayed in public places where children can easily access it. It sets a terrible example for kids, and some people should be more mindful of the impact of their actions.  Every day, online advertisements for adult content can be seen on various websites. It is concerning how easily accessible this content is on public platforms. There should be regulations in place to prevent such explicit content from being displayed on websites that are accessible to all, especially young children.  While the media industry often prioritizes profit, there is still a demand for entertaining and humorous content that does not rely on explicit or offensive material. It is possible to make money without resorting to controversial themes, and there is an audience for lighthearted and humorous entertainment.  In conclusion, it may be challenging to completely eradicate offensive content from the media, but by voicing concerns and advocating for more appropriate and positive content, we can hope for a shift towards more responsible media representation. It is essential to continue protesting against offensive content and strive for a media environment that is more mindful of its impact on viewers, especially young audiences.
576	3553	2	3	Libraries are valuable repositories of a wide range of materials, including books, music, movies, and magazines. They cater to diverse interests and preferences, providing something for everyone. It is important to respect the freedom of choice and not impose personal preferences on others. If certain materials are deemed offensive by some individuals, they can simply choose not to engage with those particular items. It is not fair to restrict access to materials based on individual sensitivities. Ultimately, libraries should have the autonomy to curate their collections based on the needs and interests of their patrons. It is essential to consider the greater good and the principle of intellectual freedom when addressing concerns about library materials. Let us embrace the diversity of content available in libraries and celebrate the richness it brings to our reading experiences.
577	3554	2	3	Offensive materials should not be removed from library shelves. Individuals who find certain materials offensive can choose not to view or check them out. If someone is offended by specific content, they can request for it to be placed on higher shelves. It is essential to remember that offensive material can still be valuable sources of information for others. Removing such materials could deprive people of important resources for research or learning. Additionally, with the easy access to information on the internet, simply removing offensive materials from libraries may not prevent individuals, especially children, from encountering such content elsewhere. Therefore, it is important to maintain a diverse collection of materials in libraries, allowing individuals to make informed choices about what they wish to access.
578	3555	2	3	If you saw a book on the shelf of your library that took offense to you in some way or another how would you react? Would you simply pass the book by and go on searching for another, or would you be so taken by it that you demanded it be removed from the shelves immediately? Every school, public library, movie theatre, magazine stand, and any form of media in this world will do or say one thing or another that someone is not going to like. It could be in a magazine in the do and don'ts section and you get slightly offended because you do something that is on the don't list or something about a specific race. Everyone, one time in their life, has been accidentally hurt by other peoples words and publishings in the world, but I do not think that is ever going to stop.  All forms of media are for learning and entertainment purposes. These things out there in the world are not for one specific group of people, they are for everyone. Every individual person has their own opinion and not everyone else is going to agree with that person. Just because one person does not agree with which hairstyle is hot right now doesn't mean that they should take it out of their magazines for all of their viewers. To me, that is just ridiculous.  So, say you stumbled across a book about the @ORGANIZATION1 in the library and you are a person from Negro descent. Would you get offended? Or, say you were watching a show that was talking about slavery a hundred years ago, would that anger you? If I were a person of Negro descent it wouldn't make me mad at all, because it is just history, history that happened a long time ago that does not pertain to me. We could not toss those books out anyways because without those history books at school we couldn't learn about our history. History is important to everyone and if we didn't learn about it and they did toss those books out how would we prevent history from repeating itself?  When I was a young child my father used to hit my mother, so my mother takes offense to anything in the media that has to deal with abuse. I tried to have my mother watch a movie with me called '@CAPS1'. The movie is about a girl who is abused by her mother and has her father's babies and she finally gets out of it and betters her and her children's lives. My mom said that she couldn't watch it with me because, 'it hit too close to home.'  Everyone is going to become offended in their life by the media. The media does not look at you as a whole, just as a population of people. When one person doesn't like something it doesn't mean it should be taken out or erased from history, it should just be rewritten or refilmed. You cannot control what everyone else says or does in books or movies, you have to just be in control of how you look upon it as. That is what I choose to do and I would say it is working out great.
579	3556	2	3	No, because people have different preferences when it comes to books, movies, music, and magazines. Removing certain materials from libraries could deter individuals from using those facilities. While some may advocate for the removal of certain content, others may value the diversity of options available. If there are concerns about children accessing inappropriate material, it is ultimately up to parents to monitor and regulate what their children read, watch, or listen to. It is important to respect the varying tastes and interests of library patrons to maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment for all.
580	3557	2	3	I believe that there should be some censorship, but not too much censorship when it comes to libraries. Each person has their own interests and should be able to find something in their library to suit their interest. Certain materials may be too strong for libraries and can be found in stores instead. While some materials may push the line of content, they should still be available for those who enjoy them. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and forms of entertainment, and libraries should cater to a diverse range of interests. In conclusion, there should be a balance in library censorship to ensure that individuals can find materials that align with their preferences.
581	3558	2	3	I believe that books, music, movies, or any other materials that may contain offensive content should not be removed from library shelves. Everyone has different preferences and opinions, so just because something may be offensive to one person does not mean that it will be offensive to everyone. It is important to respect the diverse interests and viewpoints of individuals. If a particular book or material is not to your liking, you always have the option to not read or consume it. By leaving these materials available, people have the freedom to choose what they want to read or listen to. Ultimately, censorship should not limit access to diverse perspectives and ideas. It is essential to recognize that what may be offensive to one person could be enlightening or thought-provoking to another. Let people make their own choices and form their own opinions when it comes to reading materials.
582	3559	2	3	Censorship in books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries is a topic that sparks debate. While some content may be considered graphic or inappropriate by some, it is essential to recognize that everyone has different tastes and preferences. Books, for example, can cover a wide range of topics, from romance to crime, and it is important to respect the diversity of readers' interests. Similarly, music can vary greatly in content, with some genres focusing on explicit themes while others offer more wholesome messages. It is crucial for parents to guide their children in making appropriate choices regarding the media they consume. Movies, too, can range from family-friendly to adult-oriented, and it is up to individuals to decide what they feel comfortable watching. Magazines serve as a source of information and entertainment, but parents should be mindful of the content their children are exposed to. Ultimately, while there may be content that some find objectionable, it is important to remember that censorship should not be used to limit access to diverse perspectives and artistic expressions. It is essential to approach the issue of censorship with an open mind and a respect for individual preferences.
583	3560	2	3	Offensive reading materials should not be taken off the shelves in libraries. While some content may be deemed inappropriate for certain age groups, it is important to allow individuals to make their own choices and exercise responsibility in their reading selections. It is essential for parents to be actively involved in guiding their children's reading choices and discussing sensitive topics with them. Removing books from libraries will not address the underlying issues of immaturity or inappropriate behavior. By providing guidance and support, individuals can navigate potentially offensive content in a responsible manner. It is crucial to promote maturity and accountability in handling challenging material rather than resorting to censorship. Ultimately, individuals who can handle such content should not be restricted due to the actions of a few immature individuals.
584	3561	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from library shelves just because some individuals find them offensive. Everyone has their own personal opinions on what is acceptable, and what one person may deem offensive, another may find enjoyable. Instead of removing materials, libraries should provide a wide range of options for people to choose from. If multiple complaints arise about a specific item, then perhaps consideration should be given to its removal. However, having ratings and different sections in the library allows individuals to make informed choices about what they want to read or watch. Removing materials based on personal preferences limits access to diverse content and can disappoint those who enjoy them. Therefore, I believe that censorship in libraries should be approached with caution and only implemented in cases of widespread objection.
585	3562	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People have different views on what is offensive, and what may be offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. It is important to respect the diverse perspectives and tastes of individuals. If something is offensive to someone, they can choose to ignore it rather than trying to censor it for others. Libraries and other establishments typically screen materials for extreme offensiveness, so there is already a level of control in place. Instead of focusing on what is offensive, we should focus on understanding and respecting each other's differences. In a world with billions of people, it is impossible to please everyone, but we can strive to coexist peacefully by accepting and tolerating varying viewpoints and preferences.
586	3563	2	3	According to Katherine Paterson, who wrote an article about censorship in the library, we should not have the right to freely take books, magazines, movies, or other materials off the shelf. Allowing individuals to remove items based on personal offense could lead to a lack of variety and options for others who may appreciate the content. Everyone has different preferences, and what may be offensive to one person could be enjoyable to another. Additionally, the impact on businesses, such as stores and libraries, would be detrimental if items were constantly being removed. It is essential for individuals to communicate their concerns about offensive material to library staff rather than taking matters into their own hands. Ultimately, the responsibility falls on parents to monitor the content their children are exposed to. Therefore, we should not have the unrestricted right to remove items from shelves as it would limit choices and potentially harm businesses.
587	3564	2	3	There are a ton of books out in the world that have a deep meaning and a sense of compassion. But, other books can have mean or hateful effects on the person who is reading it. Censorship, taking books, movies, magazines, etc. off the shelves so a person cannot read or watch them, is a very positive thing.  In many cases, censorship is a great thing. It protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age. In libraries, the librarian should censor the books for younger people so they do not read the awful and hurtful things the book is saying.  Like books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored, too. Some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young person's head. This could cause an effect on that child and they may start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing.  Movies should also be censored. When I was little, my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age. I barely had any nightmares because I was never exposed to that kind of writing when I was a child. On the other hand, my friend's parents were not the best at censorship and allowed her to watch or read whatever she wanted. She had many nightmares from the movies or books that she read.  Now since I am older my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things. In my experiences with this type of material, I have had some nightmares and have personally been offended by some books. Although censored books may have a great story behind them, the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs.  Thousands of books are censored each year. Many of them have to do with different religions or races that people have different opinions on. Libraries need to censor books to protect the innocent minds of young children.
588	3565	2	3	@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 People have different preferences when it comes to books, music, movies, and other forms of entertainment. It is important to remember that you are not obligated to consume anything that you do not like. Therefore, there is no need to remove items from shelves just because someone finds them offensive. If a particular book or movie is not to your liking, simply choose not to engage with it. It is unfair to expect the company or the author to cater to every individual's preferences. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and it is essential to respect that diversity. Removing items from shelves based on personal offense is unnecessary and could potentially limit others' enjoyment. Instead, focus on selecting what aligns with your interests and leave the rest for those who appreciate them. Ultimately, it is crucial to consider the bigger picture and not let minor disagreements escalate into unnecessary conflicts. Let's embrace the variety of choices available and respect each other's differences in tastes.
589	3566	2	3	Should offensive or graphic books be removed from the library? Well, in my point of view, I think books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are amazing, exciting, and fun to read or watch, and they should not be removed from the shelves in the local library. People have various tastes in books such as drama, romance, action, and many others, which also apply to movies, magazines, and more. The public should not be punished for one's interest in certain themes, and individuals should have the freedom to choose what they want to read or watch.  I personally enjoy reading scary books as they give me chills and provoke deep thoughts. Others in my community may have a similar interest in such books. Without access to a wide range of materials, people may become disinterested in libraries, leading to potential boredom and even an increase in crime rates. Everyone in the community has the right to explore different genres and forms of entertainment.  If some individuals find certain materials disturbing or offensive, they should simply avoid them and seek out content that aligns with their preferences. It is not fair to impose personal opinions on others who may enjoy such content. Books and other forms of media are meant to be enjoyed, and creators share their stories with the intention of sparking imagination and creativity in their audience.  In conclusion, people should be able to enjoy whatever material they prefer without censorship. If you are someone advocating for the removal of offensive or graphic content, I encourage you to explore different genres and see how it can broaden your perspective. Let's embrace the diversity of literature and entertainment available in libraries for the enrichment and enjoyment of all.
590	3567	2	3	There are many types of reading materials available in libraries, catering to a wide range of interests and preferences. While some materials may be considered offensive by certain individuals, I believe that they should not be removed from the library altogether. Instead, age-appropriate sections should be designated to ensure that children are not exposed to content that is meant for adults. Additionally, clear signage can help individuals make informed decisions about the materials they choose to engage with. It is important to strike a balance between providing access to a variety of resources and ensuring that inappropriate content is not easily accessible to young audiences. Ultimately, libraries should strive to offer a diverse selection of reading materials while also taking measures to protect the well-being of their patrons, especially children.
591	3568	2	3	I do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book, magazine, or movie offensive. I believe that if a person decides to take a book off the shelf because he/she is offended, they are obviously paranoid. If a few cuss words are found in a book and a person doesn't want their children to read that book, then don't allow them to get it. Don't make all of the other people suffer. Censorship is an unnecessary solution to something that isn't even a problem. You know what they say, 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.'  First of all, people have a variety of opinions. Some people think that violence is ok and some people don't think it's ok. If one person decides to put a book off the shelf because they find it offensive, what will the next person think? They may find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book. Then it would create a big conflict.  Lastly, parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature. They also need their kids to know the difference between right and wrong. If they don't read books or movies with violence or cuss words when they're young, what will they do when they discover it when they're older? As a child, it is a time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong. Shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults.  Censorship is the same thing that Hitler did to prevent people from thinking for themselves and discovering that his tactics were a great evil to society. In other words, censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in a free society. The citizens of America have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong. It's one of the ideals that help make this country great.
592	3569	2	3	Censorship is a topic that sparks debate, with opinions varying on its necessity depending on the audience. While some argue that censorship is essential to protect young children from exposure to inappropriate content, others believe that adults should have the freedom to make their own choices. Teenagers often fall somewhere in between, craving the excitement of mature themes but still needing guidance. The internet poses a challenge to censorship efforts, as it offers unfiltered access to a wide range of content. Ultimately, the decision on what to censor often falls to parents or guardians, who must consider their own values and beliefs. In the end, censorship is a subjective matter, with individuals holding differing views on what is acceptable for consumption.
593	3570	2	3	Each book in a library bears its own relation to each person that enters that library. Whether the books relate well or poorly to each person is not something for a mass of people to decide. Every person has a different outlook on what makes a story interesting. There will not ever be a book that every human being agrees to be both appropriate and vivacious. Designed with distinctly different minds, people want to read distinctly different books, written by distinctly different authors. People should maintain a right to choose which books he or she wants to read. Never, will one book bind the world. Minds of human beings are too complexly separated. For example; reading 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee in my English class last year was more than appropriate, though rather boring for the majority of the class. Books of racism, religion, and sexual content intrigue a person's mind, or otherwise disgust one's. Finding satisfactory books for everyone in a community to agree simply will not ever be done. There will always be that one person who declines to agree. It is a choice. It is a choice for each person to read what he or she wants to read. If you force something upon a society of readers, then what will they have left for their own minds' freedom? Face it, forcing an atheist to read an emotionally comprehensive novel of the Christian faith will not be stood for by the reader. Cursing, to some people, brings a book to a realistic point. To others, however, it draws them further and further away from the story. A choice should remain a person's right; especially to read a book written to be read. Finding an appropriate book is not the problem. That has yet to become the problem. The only problem is finding appropriate books that are both compelling and enthralling. I find 'Lolita' in the Library to be dangerously inappropriate. However, it captivates my mind beyond other dimensions. Others that I know choose not to read it because of the offensive content. Do I find it offensive to some? No, but I understand where others could find it offensive. There is no way to approve a book to not be offensive, because it is not offensive to every person who reads it. To reiterate, the mind of human is a unique one, that identifies with no other. To sum up the full idea of this position; every person should be given the choice to read what he or she desires. Give each person the choice, and the rebellion will settle down. Removing a book from a shelf just puts the craving in the hearts of certain people to read it; sometimes completely rebelliously. Katherine Paterson is extremely correct by saying that taking a book from a shelf every time someone wants one banned will not leave books for anyone. As a person, I am well associated with my mind, and it desires the freedom of choice. Every human mind desires the freedom to choose. Give people the choice. Remove no books from a shelf, and let the outcome draw in whoever is interested in whatever they may be interested in. Let readers have their freedom.
594	3571	2	3	"In society today, people take things in very many different ways. So things that might help one person, may offend another. In libraries, there are different kinds of books; fiction, non-fiction, etc. So if you don't like a particular book, maybe you should try looking in a different area. I do not think books should be removed from the shelf because the book has offended a few people.  We are blessed to live in a country where we have freedom of speech. Authors have the freedom to write what they would like to. They work long hard hours getting a book ready to be published, and then someone wants to take it off the shelf because it offended a few people? I do not think that is right.  ""One man's junk is another man's treasure."" I think this quote goes along with this topic very well because the book may not mean something to one person but it may mean the world to someone else.  You never know what people may need to hear. Maybe an alcoholic is at a point in his/her life and is ready to change, and someone has a book about a recovering alcoholic. Now, this kind of book may offend a few people, but it may save a family, a friendship, or maybe even a life.  Take Anne Frank for instance, her journal is now a book. Now this may offend a few people that might have been there or maybe don't like Anne Frank, but her story has the right to be told. Yes, there is violence in it, and I understand that maybe you don't want your ten-year-old to hear about how they used to treat Jewish women, but the story has the right to be told, and should be told.  I do not think that the librarian has the right to take a book off the shelf at the library just because it has offended a few. There are lots of different kinds of books, if the books you are reading offend you, look for a different type of book."
595	3572	2	3	I think a lot of books are good to read because they can provide new knowledge and perspectives. Some books may have characters with contrasting views, adding depth to the story. Magazines often give insight into different lifestyles. It's important to choose books that are meaningful and positive. Books that teach about life and success can be particularly impactful. While action-packed books can be exciting, it's essential to also read books that offer valuable insights. Ultimately, the best book is one that enriches your understanding and helps you grow.
596	3573	2	3	In our society today, there will always be things that some people disagree with or dislike. However, just because someone takes offense to something, it should not be removed from the shelves. Removing items based on personal opinions limits the selection available to everyone. History should not be erased from books and movies, as it teaches us valuable lessons from the past. People have the right to choose what they read, watch, or listen to, and should not be restricted based on someone else's opinion. It is important to have a wide selection of materials to choose from for enjoyment and knowledge. Therefore, items should not be removed from shelves just because someone finds them offensive.
597	3574	2	3	Practice makes perfect. You can do it! The United States is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country. In the 19th century, people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland. In America, we practice freedom of speech. If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc., it would defeat the entire purpose of America and its democracy. Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes. Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, that's why it's wonderful that there is a variety of everything. If you start banning or censoring certain things, then how will people learn? There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know what to do or not to do if in that situation. When you censor 'bad things,' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination. I agree that for children, there should be warnings for material that parents may find offensive. For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same. Of course, it's up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations, but banning something altogether is not necessary. I personally learned a lot of things from what I've seen on television. What's on television may be considered 'street smart' education, but that is good. Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage. If television was censored, then people would not know what to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen it before. If books, movies, magazines, music, etc., are removed from shelves, then America is not practicing what it preaches to the many people who come here in search of freedom. Practice makes perfect. You can do it!
598	3575	2	3	Censorship should be a crucial factor in determining which materials are included in library collections. To ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content, books, movies, magazines, and CDs should be carefully reviewed for offensive material. If a particular item is found to be offensive to at least ten children, it should be removed from the shelves.  Librarians should have a designated section for potentially problematic materials, such as those containing explicit language or references to drugs and alcohol. This will help protect young readers from stumbling upon unsuitable content. Additionally, age categorization of materials can assist in guiding children towards age-appropriate content as they grow and develop.  While it may not be possible to catch every single item with objectionable material, taking proactive measures to remove the most explicit content can make a significant impact. Parents should also play a role in monitoring their children's access to media by checking ratings and content warnings before allowing them to engage with certain materials.  Overall, a balance between censorship and freedom of choice is necessary to create a safe and appropriate environment for young library users. By being vigilant and proactive in curating library collections, we can help protect children from exposure to harmful content.
599	3576	2	3	I believe that some books should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive, especially if they contain racist content that could incite violence or discrimination against certain groups. It is important to consider the impact of such materials on the community, and removing them can help prevent conflicts and promote a safe and inclusive environment for all individuals, regardless of their background. In the end, it is essential to prioritize respect and understanding among people to ensure a harmonious society.
600	3577	2	3	Many people have many different thoughts and beliefs. Some people may believe that a movie or song needs to be removed, but others may disagree, and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away. If there was a book on a shelf in a bookstore that you didn't agree with and thought should be removed, and you removed it, then you are taking away from someone who may enjoy that book. If everyone removed things from life that they didn't enjoy, then there would be very little to enjoy.  For example, I personally love horror movies. I love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though it's just a movie screen. I'm sure there are people in this world who think horror movies are wrong. If those people were allowed to just remove them forever, I, and many other people, would be sadly disappointed. I also love video games. Video games are a huge part of my life, and I know for a fact that there are people who highly disagree with some of the content of them. If people could take video games away because they didn't agree with them, I would be crushed.  I am also aware that people may just be worried about their children watching movies, listening to songs, or reading books that are not appropriate for them. I understand that the parents want their children to be supervised, but removing the books, movies, and songs is not exactly the answer. Movies and books can easily be censored. Many movies and songs have language filters and some movie programs now have parental options that allow the parents to decide what movies they want to allow their children to watch. Parents can also supervise their children when they download music onto an iPod or phone, and depending on where they are bought, books and magazines may require parental consent. Video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game.  We can't just go around removing everything we don't like because it is not fair to those who may like it. We live in a world with many different ideas, thoughts, and beliefs, and we all need equal rights to share them. It is important to respect diverse opinions and interests, even if they differ from our own. By promoting open-mindedness and understanding, we can create a more inclusive and harmonious society where everyone can enjoy the things they love.
601	3578	2	3	Today in society, there are many different views on various topics such as religion, race, and upbringing. Libraries, as a reflection of society, contain a diverse range of books that cater to different perspectives. While some individuals may find certain books offensive or discriminatory, it is important to maintain the integrity of libraries and leave things as they are for several reasons.  Firstly, individual preferences differ, and what may be offensive to one person could be valuable and enlightening to another. It is essential to respect the diverse opinions and preferences of library patrons and allow them the freedom to choose what they wish to read or engage with.  Secondly, books that address sensitive topics such as discrimination play a crucial role in documenting history and showcasing the progress that has been made in society. Removing such materials would hinder the ability to learn from past mistakes and understand the changes that have taken place over time.  Lastly, a library is meant to be a comprehensive collection of knowledge and information, catering to a wide range of interests and perspectives. By censoring or removing materials deemed offensive, the essence of a library as a place for exploration, learning, and discovery would be compromised.  In conclusion, it is important to preserve the diversity and inclusivity of libraries by maintaining a wide range of materials, even if some may be considered controversial or offensive to certain individuals. By upholding these principles, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for education, understanding, and enlightenment for all members of society.
602	3579	2	3	In our public libraries, we can find books that cover topics such as slavery, drugs, gangs, prostitution, and violence, all of which are important aspects of our history. Censoring these materials would mean erasing crucial parts of our past, which could lead to a dangerous cycle of repetition. Libraries serve as invaluable resources for educational purposes, research, and personal growth. They offer a diverse range of materials that can enrich our understanding of the world around us.  Books on slavery, for instance, remind us of the dark chapters in our history and the importance of learning from past mistakes. By censoring such materials, we risk forgetting the struggles and hardships faced by those who were enslaved. Similarly, stories about gangs and violence shed light on the realities of crime and its impact on society. Rather than shying away from these uncomfortable truths, we should confront them head-on to build a better future.  In addition to books, libraries also provide access to movies, documentaries, and music that offer valuable insights into various subjects. From documentaries on historical events to films highlighting societal issues, these resources play a crucial role in broadening our perspectives and fostering critical thinking. Music, too, serves as a form of expression and can be a source of inspiration for many individuals.  While it is essential to consider age-appropriate content for young readers, outright censorship is not the solution. Implementing age restrictions and parental guidance can help ensure that children are exposed to material that is suitable for their level of maturity. By preserving our history and allowing access to a wide range of materials, libraries contribute to the intellectual growth and cultural awareness of individuals in society. Embracing our past, no matter how challenging it may be, is key to shaping a more informed and enlightened future.
603	3580	2	3	I dont think books that would affend people should be on the shelf. some of the books that maybe on the shelf @MONTH1 hurt some ones feelings. But i also think people should be able to read what they want to read. many people wouldnt read a book that they think would affend them. There are many kinds of books not all book will be bad or affend people. but books that are not appropriate for young kids or teens shouldnt even be in school librarys. In public librarys i think it should be ok to have every type of book. and have different books in different place's. like having the young adult section and the adult and children section. I think scrotion books should be sold in book stores like i dont think they should have inappropriate books in children book store's. They should have a different store for certain books. And parents should monitor what their children are reading and take part in the book by helping them understand what the book is saying. There are lots of parents that dont really care about what their kids read, and to me that's their business but my opinion is that they shouldn't let their kids read what they want. Parents should be with the child when he/she is picking out a book. But if it is a teen @DATE1 and older, i think they would be old enough to choice what they want to read. by the time they are that age they have matured enough to read and understand things much easier.
604	3581	2	3	Hi, I'm Henry, and I agree that offensive books should be removed from school and public libraries. I believe that material that can potentially upset or offend individuals, such as books, magazines, movies, and music, should not be easily accessible to the public, especially to children.   I have personally come across books that have offended me or made fun of certain groups, and as someone who values inclusivity and respect for all individuals, I feel strongly about removing such content from libraries. It is important to consider the impact these materials can have on people's feelings and perceptions.  In addition to books, magazines can also contain harmful content that may influence individuals negatively, leading to potential issues like increased crime rates. By replacing such magazines with more positive and educational ones, we can promote a healthier and safer environment for everyone.  When it comes to movies, the prevalence of inappropriate content is a concern. While there are some good movies out there, the majority seem to focus on violence and other negative themes. Finding a way to address this issue and promote more positive and uplifting films could help create a more wholesome entertainment industry.  Overall, by being mindful of the content we consume and ensuring that libraries and media outlets provide material that is respectful and uplifting, we can contribute to a more positive and inclusive society. It is essential to prioritize the well-being and values of individuals when it comes to the media we engage with.
605	3582	2	3	"Why censor something that someone worked hard on? People put up money and countless amounts of time to write this, and yet you want to censor it. There is honestly no need to censor anything in the library because there are certain sections for certain people. This whole conversation shouldn't be happening in the first place. People just like to nitpick about what they cannot handle, for instance, the word ""nigger."" I don't like it at all, but I can handle it, so I just shut my mouth and suck it up. I feel like all the critique and immature people just need not to read or not go to the library, but that's only my opinion. So, stop acting like little children. The authors want their work on shelves and not being banned, raved, and ranted about. In conclusion, stop being immature, and if you don't like it, don't read it. Always think about what you're doing before you decide."
606	3583	2	3	I do believe that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Encouraging young children to consume inappropriate content can have negative effects on their development and understanding of what is acceptable. Parents have the right to control what their children are exposed to, and it is important to consider the impact of media on impressionable minds. Ultimately, it is crucial to prioritize the well-being and moral upbringing of children by monitoring the content they have access to.
607	3584	2	3	Taking the stance on what we read is essential. Everyone will encounter a book at some point in their life, and while some may find certain content offensive, it is crucial to consider factors such as maturity and genre. Books are typically categorized by age appropriateness and genre, helping readers understand where they stand in terms of content. Additionally, the era in which a book is set plays a significant role in the language and themes used. Authors must be mindful of this when writing. Ultimately, the key is for readers to assess their own maturity level and choose books accordingly. Therefore, I firmly believe that removing books from shelves based on individual sensitivities is not the solution. It is through understanding and maturity that readers can navigate the literary world effectively.
608	3585	2	3	Should we take off books that are offensive? I think that we should not take them out if they are offensive. If we do take off the offensive stuff off the self then there are not any more on the self. If all of us could take off the book, movie, or music that in fensive to us then there will be no books, movies, or music on the self.   First off all, there will be no war books, movies, or music on the self. All the hippys will take the war stuff off because they dont like war. They will say that it infensive on them on take them off. I think that we should read about war and witch them because it is a good way to learn our mistake. If we don't learn the mistake of war we will lose and we wont learn how we loss and we will go into war over and over again we will win some and lose alot because we wont learn how we lost.   Secondly, all the music that are good and bad will be taken off the self. All the mothers that are to protactive they will take them done. It have bad language in it and a bad theme to it. If they take them down how can the football players, solders, and fighters can be ready for the fight if they don't have the songs that they like to listen to and get pump for the fight.   Finally, they will take out all thethe books of star wars and forgetten ralms. Some people don't like them because they think that it wont come true and they will take them out and say that it infensives them on there thinking wise. Star wars is a good book and movie and forgetten ralms is a good book maker company.   All of this is why i don't want this to happen. All the good music, books, and movies well go away and the people who like them well get mad.
609	3586	2	3	Everyone can think of something they dislike or do not want to see. However, just because one person is offended by something does not mean they should have the right to have it banned or taken away. Should the preferences of a few individuals dictate what is available to everyone else? Imagine if a group of people walked into a library and demanded that all books, magazines, music, and movies be removed because they personally did not like them. Is it fair for them to impose their views on others who may enjoy those materials?   If someone dislikes your house, should they have the right to demolish it just because it offends them? Giving individuals too much power to change things based on personal preferences would only lead to chaos. It is important to find ways to coexist peacefully without infringing on the rights and preferences of others.  In situations where there is disagreement over what should be kept or removed, a compromise can be reached by relocating items to different areas where they can be accessed by those who appreciate them, while also accommodating those who do not wish to be exposed to them. By finding common ground and respecting each other's preferences, we can create a harmonious environment where everyone can coexist without unnecessary conflict.  In conclusion, it is essential to consider the diverse preferences and opinions of individuals without allowing one group to impose their views on others. Finding ways to accommodate different tastes and interests can help foster a more inclusive and tolerant society where everyone can enjoy their own choices without infringing on the rights of others.
610	3587	2	3	Yes, books with derogatory terms, racial slurs, or disrespectful content should be removed from circulation. However, the stance on music containing explicit language or sensitive topics is less clear. While exposure to such content can be concerning, children will inevitably come across it in various forms. It is essential for parents to guide their children and teach them right from wrong when it comes to inappropriate language and behaviors. Ultimately, individuals should be aware of the impact of the media they consume and take responsibility for their choices.
611	3588	2	3	If I were to write about a newspaper that children should not be looking at books and should be taken off the shelf. The reason I say that is so our children are not getting ideas from a book that is not appropriate for them. I think that is the main reason there are more girls getting pregnant at a young age. I think if we were to take off the naughty books, there would be less girls pregnant. I really think it could work if we would take all of the naughty books off the shelf and make it a law that you had to be a certain age to look at them. I would like to see a change in the way we look at naughty books. I think you should be a certain age to look at books that are naughty. It would be a good thing to try for a while. I think it would work because it would not be shown to our children and they would not want to have babies as a teenager. This is the way I think it should have been done in the first place. We would not have so many problems in the first place. The thing is, I think that it would not be too hard to raise a child at a young age if we would not have to see things that we shouldn't have seen.
612	3589	2	3	"Censorship is a growing problem in today's world of literature. Censoring limits the author's ability to fully express their ideas as originally intended. Katherine Paterson highlights the danger of eliminating what is deemed ""wrong,"" as it could lead to a society devoid of what is truly ""right."" In the novel Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury explores the consequences of censorship, depicting a society where books are burned to suppress controversial opinions. The protagonist, Guy Montag, realizes that this censorship has made the society ignorant and devoid of critical thinking.   In this dystopian world, people passively accept information fed to them by the government and media without question. Education is reduced to rote memorization, devoid of critical thinking or questioning. This lack of independent thought leads to a society that is content but ultimately unhappy. The people are oblivious to the realities of their world, including acts of violence and impending war.  Censorship ultimately results in a clueless and ignorant society, unable to think for themselves or make informed decisions. In the novel, the consequences of censorship culminate in the destruction of the city, as the population remains unaware of the impending danger. It is clear that a society devoid of free thought and the ability to question is doomed to failure.  Parents and individuals must recognize the dangers of censorship and the importance of critical thinking. Shielding individuals from difficult topics or controversial ideas does not protect them; instead, it hinders their ability to learn and grow. Education should encourage questioning and independent thought, rather than blind acceptance. Only through open dialogue and the free exchange of ideas can a society truly thrive."
613	3590	2	3	I believe that books, movies, music, magazines, etc. should not be removed from shelves just because they are deemed offensive by some individuals. Allowing personal opinions to dictate what should be available for others to read, watch, or listen to would limit people's access to entertainment and learning opportunities. It is important to consider the diverse preferences and perspectives of a wider audience before deciding to remove any form of media. Taking away something simply because one person finds it offensive is not a valid reason to restrict others from accessing it. It is crucial to assess the content objectively and consider the potential value it may offer to different individuals before making any decisions about its availability. Ultimately, censorship based on individual sensitivities should be avoided to ensure that people have the freedom to choose what they want to engage with.
614	3591	2	3	Offensive or Acceptable?  Who can truly determine if a book, movie, music, or magazine is genuinely offensive? While there are some obvious cases where content may ridicule or insult certain beliefs or lifestyles, such as in movies that mock religion, is a story about a fantasy world really offensive?  I recall a friend from my youth whose parents prohibited her from reading the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling due to religious reasons. At the time, I couldn't comprehend why such captivating books were off-limits to her. However, as I've grown older, I realize that her parents strictly adhere to their beliefs and view anything beyond the teachings of their faith as inappropriate for their child. Yet, for many other families, the Harry Potter series offers an escape into a world of magic and imagination. Should a beloved book be removed from shelves just because it offends a few families? Personally, I believe it shouldn't.  While my family enjoys the Harry Potter series, some families may not share the same sentiment. It's all a matter of personal preference and perspective. If we were to remove everything that could potentially offend someone, we'd be left with a bland and uninteresting world devoid of creativity. Diversity in opinions and tastes is what makes art and entertainment so compelling.  Music, for instance, serves as a form of emotional expression and connection across generations. Each era has its own defining sound, shaping the cultural landscape. If we were to eliminate offensive materials from public spaces, the shelves would be barren, depriving us of the richness and variety that art provides.  Everyone has their own triggers or sensitivities. While I may find certain scenes in movies distressing, others may perceive them as enhancing the storyline. It's a subjective matter. Just as my friend's family may object to fictional wizardry, there are individuals who find solace in the idea of a magical realm existing alongside our own.  Ultimately, diversity is what makes the world vibrant and engaging. Each person is unique, with their own set of beliefs and interests. What may be offensive to one individual could be cherished by another. While some content may warrant removal due to its harmful nature, it's essential to respect differing viewpoints and allow for a range of perspectives in our society. After all, it's this diversity that makes life intriguing and enriching.
615	3592	2	3	As said before, there would be no books for anyone to read if everybody removed what they felt was offensive. The libraries would have a very watered down material base, and there would be no reason to use this place anymore. Some material is not suitable for young ages, but there is much advanced material that can be learned; thus, the libraries should separate their books only as they do already.  Some material may seem too advanced for others, but these materials are necessary to advance academic growth. For example, some people may think that schools should not read certain books due to racism in the south. However, this was true history, so there should be no restrictions on that type of book. If there were such restrictions, schools would lack much of history's best literature.  Just as movies have age ratings for the general population, books should also be categorized by age appropriateness. For instance, some books may be labeled for ages 13 and up, while others may be for ages 18 and up. These standards help keep youth from accessing material they are not yet ready for. This concept should be applied in libraries where offensive material is a concern, although it is already done to some extent.  There is no need to further divide the sections in libraries beyond the existing categories of young adult, adult, and youth. These divisions already help separate material that may contain sensitive topics like drugs, sex, and alcohol.  While censoring media can benefit youth in some ways, there comes a point where sheltering them too much can hinder their academic development. It is important to strike a balance between protecting youth from inappropriate content and allowing them access to materials that can expand their knowledge and understanding of the world.
616	3593	2	3	Some books, music, magazines, and movies found in libraries can be offensive to some individuals due to various reasons such as language, content, and themes. While some may find certain materials offensive, it is important to recognize that censorship is not the solution. Removing offensive content from libraries would limit access to diverse perspectives and artistic expression. Instead, individuals who find certain materials offensive can choose not to engage with them, while others can still have the opportunity to access and learn from a wide range of resources. Ultimately, freedom of expression and the availability of diverse content are essential components of a thriving library environment.
617	3594	2	3	Censorship is the act of blocking or restricting access to certain content that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive. In the context of libraries, censorship can be a contentious issue, but there are valid reasons why it can be justified.   One reason for censorship in libraries is to protect children from exposure to inappropriate material, such as pornography or graphic violence, which can be found in magazines, movies, and books. By censoring these items, libraries can ensure that children are not inadvertently exposed to content that is not age-appropriate. This can also help prevent potential blame being placed on library staff for not monitoring children's access to such material.  Furthermore, censorship in libraries can extend to music, where explicit lyrics or inappropriate content may be present. By censoring music, libraries can prevent children from being exposed to vulgar language or themes that may not be suitable for their age group. Similarly, movies with explicit or disturbing scenes can be censored to protect young viewers from harmful content.  In addition, certain books that contain sensitive topics, such as religion or death, may be censored in libraries to avoid offending individuals who hold differing beliefs or find certain content distressing. By carefully selecting which books to include in their collection, libraries can create a safe and inclusive environment for all patrons.  In conclusion, while censorship in libraries may be a contentious issue, there are valid reasons for implementing restrictions on certain materials. By censoring books, music, movies, and magazines, libraries can protect children from inappropriate content, prevent offense to individuals with differing beliefs, and create a safe and welcoming space for all patrons.
618	3595	2	3	Libraries are for children, and adults of all ages. Because all people have different views on life, different beliefs, and different feelings, it makes it hard for libraries to please everyone. There are also different genres that people enjoy reading. Some enjoy romance and comedy, while others like to read action books or mysteries. Today, libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials. They have kids, fiction, informational, and many more. They also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines. But, if there are magazines, books, or movies, that should be viewed only by certain ages, the library should put a warning sign in the areas where those materials are located.   On the back of movies there is a rating on how bad the movie is. Why not put a rating on the back of books and magazines? This way people can know what to expect if they read it. It would also help them decide if they even want to read it. Ratings on the back of magazines and books would help distinguish what age is appropriate for it.  Once, when I was visiting the library, there was a man in the check out line, right before me. He was returning the book that he had just read and checking out the new one he had already picked out. When it was finally his turn in line he stepped up to the counter and explained to the sweet, old, lady at the front desk, what he wanted to do with his books. She simply understood that he wanted to check out and return one. As she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked, 'Did you like your book?' He replied 'It wasn't what I expected. It was completely inappropriate.' As they discussed a little more it turned out that there were tons of curse words throughout the entire book. This is one example of how people don't know what to expect when they read a book.  I don't think that libraries should remove materials off the shelves that people have complained about. They should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books, magazines, or movies. Some people may not mind reading a book with a few curse words here and there, but others may find it outrageous. Libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities. Why take a book off if only a few people find it offensive? No one makes those people read those books, it's by their choice. Libraries need to figure out some way to reassure people that they will enjoy what they are reading and not be offended by it.
619	3596	2	3	Should They or Should They Not? What do you think? Music, books, movies, and many other forms of media have often been questioned for their content and whether or not children should be exposed to them at a young age. While some argue that certain materials should be restricted, others believe that children should have the opportunity to learn and make their own choices. In my opinion, I believe that censorship is not the answer, and children should be allowed to explore and learn about the world around them.   One of the reasons I support this view is that children need to learn about both the good and the bad in the world. Shielding them from certain content may only make them more curious and eager to explore it further. For example, some music may contain explicit lyrics, but children may already be exposed to similar language in their everyday lives. By allowing them to listen to such music, they can develop a better understanding of the world they live in.   However, there are valid concerns about exposing children to inappropriate content. As a parent and a teenager myself, I understand the importance of monitoring what children are exposed to. While I believe in giving children some freedom to explore, there should also be boundaries set by parents. It is ultimately the responsibility of parents to guide their children and ensure they are not exposed to harmful content at a young age.   In conclusion, while I believe in allowing children to explore and learn, there should also be age-appropriate restrictions on certain materials. Parents should play an active role in monitoring what their children are exposed to and guiding them in making informed choices. By implementing age limits and parental guidance, we can strike a balance between freedom of expression and protecting our children from harmful content. Let's take a stand and ensure that children are given the opportunity to learn and grow in a safe and responsible manner.
620	3597	2	3	Some people think that offensive books should be taken off the shelves, but others believe that this should not be allowed. I do not agree with removing certain materials, such as books, movies, and magazines, from shelves. If we were to remove every offensive book, there would be few books left for people to read. Removing offensive books would result in a rapid depletion of the available reading material.  Without books, people's eyesight could suffer as reading is essential for maintaining good vision. If individuals do not like certain books in a library, they have the choice not to select those particular books. Therefore, offensive books should not be removed from shelves as it would limit people's access to diverse reading materials.  In conclusion, the removal of offensive books would have negative consequences on the availability of reading material and potentially impact people's eyesight. It is essential to preserve the variety of books in libraries to cater to different preferences and interests.
621	3598	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a contentious issue, with some arguing for the cleaning up or removal of offensive details from certain materials. While historical documentaries and books may require uncensored content to accurately convey information, there are other items, such as magazines and movies, that could benefit from censorship. Uncensored materials should only be used if they serve a specific purpose, such as conveying a message or historical accuracy. Ultimately, the decision to censor library items should be based on whether the uncensored content is necessary or simply offensive. Censorship in libraries can be important in certain situations, but it should be carefully considered to ensure the preservation of important information while also respecting the sensibilities of library users.
622	3599	2	3	Have you ever imagined going to the library and picking up a magazine from the shelves, only to find it filled with offensive content? Well, Katherine Paterson and I experienced just that when we visited a library together. We discovered several magazines with offensive writing, pictures, and comments that we found unacceptable. When we brought it to the attention of the librarian, she was unaware of their presence on the shelves. This situation led us to believe that offensive materials should be removed from public spaces.  Offensive content, whether in movies, music, or magazines, can have a negative impact on youth. It can influence their behavior, thoughts, and actions, leading to potential trouble and violence. Parents need to be more vigilant about the media their children are exposed to, as it can shape their perceptions and attitudes. It is essential to address these issues and take action to ensure a safe and positive environment for everyone.  Next time you encounter offensive material, speak up and voice your concerns to the appropriate authorities. It is crucial to advocate for the removal of such content to protect individuals, especially the younger generation, from harmful influences. Let us work together to create a more respectful and wholesome community by eliminating offensive materials from public spaces.
623	3600	2	3	Parents should tell their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages. That is where my opinion will start, and tell why it is that way. I will talk about why I disagree with this statement. Also, give reasons on why i feel this way about the statement.   I really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like. The library is where they get the books from. So, just because a parent does not want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean that the book shouldn't be there. I think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book.   If the parents explain, kids will understand why it is not good for them. Those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting. I think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them, then they are old enough for it. Also, the young kids that should not be reading these books should have and adult or guardian with them, therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate.   Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it. This is taking a right away from us, and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once. If these books are so horrible than why would people still be writing them? So, if they have not bothered people that bad yet then there is no reason for people to not like it now. People should be able to do what they enjoy and not have that taken from them.   This is my opinion of the statement. Many people may not agree but I just tried to make people see my point of this statement. Then everyone can help stop people taking things away from the community that makes them happy. Also, I hope people can still have their rights and not let a couple people take it away from them.
624	3601	2	3	Television, news, drama, life, and controversy. These are just a few of the things books are written about. Some subjects are considered to be vulgar and inappropriate for young audiences. Many people believe that their children have a right to learn about all the things books can offer, but is that really such a good thing? Books have been an important tool for students for a long time. However, not all books should be considered appropriate for all audiences. Stories about knights and princesses are great for young people, but other stories about the darker sides of life are normally kept away from the hands of children. Books are censored for all sorts of reasons. Some of these reasons are frivolous and should not keep a book from reaching its full potential. The truth is that there is a line that should not be crossed, and some books cross this line and are banned. Great. However, some books do not 'cross the line' and are banned regardless. Honestly, careful consideration must be taken before the decision is made to ban a book or to leave it on shelves.  If a book is written with only minor obscenities by a recognized author, and it is banned, then the author faces no serious pressure as the banning will be well known and consumers will still purchase the book just for a chance to read it. However, if an author who is relatively unknown writes a well-put-together piece that contains a few spots where the author may have made a somewhat vulgar reference, and the book is banned, the author is in serious trouble. This author can no longer have the luxury of having their book in libraries so that their work may be recognized. Banning books is hindering authors everywhere from being able to make a name for themselves.  Books that are especially vulgar should definitely be banned. No child should be reading a book that has an intended audience of purely adults. Children should be protected from such material, and book banning provides this service. If a child has a burning desire to read a book, they can simply ask their parents to buy it for them, assuming the parents agree that filthy books should be okay for children to read.  If a book can provide good discussion in a classroom setting, and is mostly 'clean', then it should certainly be available for everyone. Just because a book contains a few areas where inappropriate references are made doesn't mean that students shouldn't be able to read the book. If the learning material a book offers 'outweighs' the negative effects the book may have on a student, then the book should be available for students to read. However, because one cannot effectively compare knowledge and harmful effects, this is a difficult statement to make.  Honestly, it is too difficult to say whether small problems in a book should be considered vulgar enough to ban a book. Many books should not be as available as others, but using a new system to find which books to limit would be too difficult, and keeping the current one would make more sense than any other alternatives. In the end, a system that caters to the most sheltering of parents is the best one. Ultimately, the decision to ban books should be made with careful consideration of the content and its potential impact on readers.
625	3602	2	3	I believe there should not be censorship in libraries because it hinders people's access to information. Libraries are meant to provide a wide range of books for individuals to explore, learn, and form their own opinions. When books are censored or removed based on personal preferences or beliefs, it goes against the fundamental purpose of a library. Students, researchers, and the general public rely on libraries to access diverse perspectives and knowledge, and censorship limits this access. It is essential for libraries to remain unbiased and inclusive by offering a variety of materials for everyone to explore. By upholding the principles of intellectual freedom and open access to information, libraries can continue to serve their communities effectively and promote a culture of learning and understanding.
626	3603	2	3	I am neutral on this subject because it does not matter to me whether they put new books, movies, music cds, or magazines on their shelves or if they take them off. Also it does not matter to me if I have to pay for the things that I check out from the library. Also it does not matter at all if I had to pay a late fee for the books that I checked out from the library. Also I do not care about any noises that go on in the library. Also it does not matter to me what kind of books they have in the library. Also it would not matter to me how the library is run. Also I would not care if I had to be quiet in the library it would not matter to me. Also I would not care how long that I would stay in the library. Also it would not matter to me if I walked or drove or rode my bike to the library. Also I would not care if the policy in the library was not the right way to run it. Also if I got kicked out of the library I would just go to another one. Finally, it would not matter to me if I got ten books or movies from the library I would not care.
627	3604	2	3	I think that the books should not be removed because people know what they are reading and if they don't like the book, they should leave it. There is no reason that people would want to remove any book for any reason because a lot of people like different kinds of books. If a book is removed, it could upset those who enjoyed it or have sentimental value attached to it. It would also be costly to replace books, leading to a waste of paper and potential loss of revenue for the bookstore. Overall, removing books may not be a good idea as it can have negative consequences for both readers and the bookstore.
628	3605	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a contentious issue in society today, with some individuals taking offense at certain pieces of literature they come across. However, it is important to consider the context in which these works were written and the rights of authors to express themselves freely. If someone encounters a book that they find objectionable, they can simply choose not to read it rather than calling for its removal from shelves. Authors have the right to have their work published and available to the public, just as individuals have the right to express their own opinions on the matter. Instead of directly censoring literature, people can voice their concerns through writing, creating websites, or conducting polls to gather support for their views. Removing books from libraries can have negative consequences, such as hindering research and limiting access to valuable information. Therefore, it is essential to consider the broader impact of censorship and strive for a diverse range of perspectives in library collections. By promoting open dialogue and understanding, we can ensure that all voices are heard and respected in the literary world.
629	3606	2	3	Curse words, alcohol, drugs, and pornographic content are all things that parents may not want their children to be exposed to. However, shielding children from these realities may not always be the best approach. It is important for parents to educate their children on what is right and wrong, and to guide them on the right path. While restrictions on certain materials may help in limiting exposure, censorship is a complex issue that may not always be the best solution. Ultimately, it is important for parents to be vigilant, observant, and actively involved in their children's lives to help them navigate the challenges of the world.
630	3607	2	3	In libraries and bookstores worldwide books are written and published with subject matter ranging from odd or inappropriate, to serious or violent. These books are written to target emotions in the reader that spark excitement and humor, horror and empathy among many others. However, though these books are made for a specific purpose, it is sometimes unclear as to how the book is appropriate for the eyes of a young reader, or even a mature reader. These books appear unappealing and offensive. However, though they don't appeal to you as a reader, how could this book be censored without the unanimous disapproval of everyone? Censorship of these books is unjust because of the right of free speech and press, because all subjects are deserving of being written, and most importantly because target audiences deserve books written in their interest regardless of their approval. The first reason that their should be no censorship of novels and works of literature is because writers deserve the freedoms of speech and press. They are aloud to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in. Though many times they have used subject matter that is highly provocative or inappropriate, they still have the capacity and the legal ability to write about what they wish. To stop them from writing their own opinionated stories is similar to the censorship of books in nazi @LOCATION1. Millions of books were burned and hundreds, if not thousands of writers were executed for conveying opinions in their work that conflicted with the ideas of their government. Even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader. The next reason that books should not have censorship is because new ideas cover topics that have never been discussed. Books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written. The variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular. For thousands of years, written text has been a way to understand and connect with cultures and people through written language. And though stories @MONTH1 not be written in a manner that would be appropriate for a child, it doesn't mean that the story shouldn't be written or read. Its use should simply be monitored so that only those capable of accepting or understanding its message are capable of reading it. Lastly, censorship is simply unjust because without it there is a better chance to discuss and attempt to describe stories that target a vast crowd of people. Though the materials found in a story @MONTH1 be horrific to a parent, it @MONTH1 be a preferred form of literature for a different group of people. And to limit the literary subjects that people prefer could be parallelled with limiting a person's voice of opinion. It simply isn't reasonable to allow only a single category of work, with only a few varieties of messages, for only a select group of people. Variety is what separates a person's opinions, and makes their being different than another's. Therefore, censorship of literature should not be enforced. Writing topics should be open to all people, because whether they are offensive or not they convey a purpose. And because writers have the right to illustrate their points through a literal medium, there should never be a limit on these rights. That is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf.
631	3608	2	3	Well do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all music you listen to is offensive? Who can say what is offensive to everyone? Who can tell you what you think is offensive or not? How can you be your own person if people are making decisions for you about the books you read, the movies you watch, and the music you listen to? I'm going to tell you about why I think that no certain materials such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should be taken off library shelves because someone finds them offensive.  Who can be the ultimate decision-maker in deciding if something is offensive to everyone? Everyone has their own meaning of offensive. Everyone thinks that different things are offensive to them. How can you say that one thing is offensive to one person and is also offensive to another person? I think if one person thinks that something is offensive to them that is okay, that is their own opinion, but maybe the next person that walks by and sees the so-called offensive material will love it. You should not be able to make someone else's decisions for them if they want to read an offensive book, watch an offensive movie, and listen to offensive music that is their choice not someone else's to make for them.  If every person took a book off the shelves that they thought to be offensive then we would no longer have any books on the shelves. Some people think that certain music, books, and movies are offensive, and other people think that the books, music, and movies are cool and interesting so what do you do then? I have learned over the years that not every person will agree with your opinions on everything and you won't agree with them, but yet you both still have your own opinions. You both are allowed to decide what you do and don't like. You both get to choose what books you read, what movies you watch, and what music you listen to. So why should we let anyone stop us from being ourselves?  You can never say that any one thing is offensive to everyone because no one person can be everyone. You can't talk for someone else because everyone has a voice for themselves. So do you think that every book you read, every movie you watch, and all the music you listen to is offensive? Well you may not think so, but someone else somewhere is trying to take that out of the libraries because they have a negative opinion about it, but is that fair?
632	3609	2	3	Imagine your child or someone very close to you, just starting to navigate the complexities of adulthood. They may become curious about things like alcohol, influenced by peers discussing its allure without understanding its dangers. To prevent tragic outcomes like alcohol poisoning, open dialogue and education are crucial. Censorship in libraries would hinder this essential discussion. While some may argue that certain topics are inappropriate for young audiences, maturity levels vary, and individuals can learn from others' mistakes. Books, movies, and other media may contain sensitive content like sex, drugs, and profanity, but these can serve as educational tools. By exposing individuals to challenging subjects, we equip them to make informed decisions and avoid repeating past errors. Avoiding censorship in libraries ensures access to diverse perspectives and fosters critical thinking skills. Ultimately, open dialogue and exposure to a range of ideas, even controversial ones, are essential for personal growth and societal progress.
633	3610	2	3	Offensive books do belong in the library, just in a completely different area, away from the children. If we all chose a book that we didn't want in the library, there would be none left. So, since everyone has a different opinion about what is offensvie and what isn't, who's to say what can and can't be in the library?   When I was little, my grandma would take me to the library almost every week. I noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and was fine with others. My parents did the same thing, but they had different opinions on what was okay for me to read and what wasn't. Grandma wanted me to get religious books and my parents were okay with that and things like 'Harry Potter' and 'Nancy Drew'.   Even at home, everyone's opinion is very different. For instance, when it comes to music at my house; my dad likes country, my mom likes metal, my brother likes alternative, my unlcle likes rock, and I like a combonation of all of it.   That just does to show how different people have different opinions; some more strict than others. If we relied on peoples' opinions to keep our librarys free of offense, there would be nothing in it.
634	3611	2	3	If you take any of these books off the shelves, that would be like taking away some of our childhood. That wouldn't be the nicest thing to do. Even if you did take some of them off, then what would we show our children when they ask what was your favorite book as a kid? We will have to tell them that the library doesn't have those books anymore; they had to make room for other books. So if you would please understand, we got to read all of our parents' favorite childhood books. I mean, how would you feel if you couldn't share that with your kids? I would be upset because my parents told me, and I went out and got them from the library, and I loved them too. So please, if you can, leave the books alone.
635	3612	2	3	A library is a place where people can access books, movies, music, and other materials for research and entertainment purposes. In my opinion, there should be minimal censorship in libraries to ensure that there is a wide range of resources available for patrons. While some level of censorship may be necessary to protect children from inappropriate content, excessive censorship would limit the freedom of information and ideas that libraries are meant to provide. It is important to balance the need to protect individuals from offensive material with the value of intellectual freedom and diversity of perspectives in a library setting. Ultimately, maintaining a low level of censorship in libraries allows for a rich and varied collection of resources while still protecting patrons from harmful or offensive content.
636	3613	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a contentious issue that revolves around the removal of certain materials based on individual preferences. However, it is important to consider that what one person dislikes may be valued by others. Libraries offer a diverse range of books, music albums, and movies, catering to various age groups and tastes. While one person may not enjoy a particular book or album, it does not mean it should be removed for everyone else. People have different preferences, and materials should be available for all to access.  In libraries, materials are often categorized based on genres, age appropriateness, and maturity levels. This organization helps individuals find what they are looking for and ensures that content is suitable for their age group. While some may not appreciate certain genres or themes, it does not warrant the complete removal of such materials. What may not appeal to one person could be a treasure trove for another.  It is essential to recognize that individual opinions should not dictate what is available in libraries. Materials should be accessible to all, allowing people to explore and discover content that aligns with their interests and preferences. By embracing diversity in materials, libraries can cater to a wide range of audiences and provide enriching experiences for all visitors. Let us appreciate the variety of materials available in libraries and respect the diverse tastes and preferences of individuals.
637	3614	2	3	I believe that it is unfair to ban any sort of materials from the library. Withholding information from children only hinders their ability to learn and understand the world around them. It is important for children to have access to a wide range of information so they can ask questions and learn from trusted sources like their parents. By sheltering children from certain topics, they may end up learning inaccurate information from peers or the internet. It is crucial for parents to be open and honest with their children, guiding them to differentiate between right and wrong. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of parents to provide proper supervision and education to ensure their children are well-informed and equipped to navigate the complexities of the world.
638	3615	2	3	No because all people like to read different books. Some of the books that people want taken off bookshelves are considered to be part of history. Books help people advance in their reading skills and also help them find new things out. When I was in middle school I always liked to read @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 books. When I asked the librarian if they had any of their books they said no. They thought that kids in middle school shouldn't be reading books with cuss words in them and violence. I don't think it should matter what kids read because you can't make a kid read something that he's not interested in because everybody is different all people like different types of books. There's all kinds of books like for example there's mystery books, fiction books, non-fiction books, historical books, etc. The books you use in classrooms are considered books but there not books you read every day. I think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book. When I was in elementary and through junior high we had to take reading tests on the computer. In seventh and eighth grade we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour. We also a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most. That was part of our grade in our English class. It was never a problem for me because I loved to read. Now there are some books that libraries should take off the shelves. For example any book that involves nudity or lots of violence. Now that's just for kids that are under the age of thirteen. Now there isn't that many of books out there for little kids to read. There's more adult books than little kids books. All I have to say is that watch what your kids read. Don't keep them from reading books because that will affect them later on in life. If they don't like to read persuade them to try it. I also think that more kids would read if they saw their relatives reading too. Just remember kids and adults of all ages reading is a good thing no matter what you decide to read.
639	3616	2	3	In this persuasive essay, I argue that offensive material should not be banned from library shelves. Taking such material away would limit the diversity of available content and potentially deprive individuals of valuable learning experiences. Furthermore, the subjective nature of offense means that what may be offensive to some could be considered acceptable by others. It is essential to consider the broader implications of censorship and the impact it could have on intellectual freedom. Therefore, I believe that maintaining a wide range of material in libraries is crucial for promoting understanding, critical thinking, and open dialogue in society.
640	3617	2	3	When I walk into a library to look for a book, I would love to do so without seeing inappropriate books, movies, or magazines. When I see that, I think, 'if a child saw this?' I would like a library for my child to visit without me worrying about the things they could see. To fix this problem, the libraries could do a number of things.  First off, the libraries could censor what they put out on the shelves. By putting the adult books section by the check-out place, an employee at the library could easily find any small children wandering into that section. If that solution does not work, then try and rate the sections like we rate movies. Put adult books and movies together, young adult books and movies together, teen books and movies together, and so on.  One time, when I took my baby brother to the library, he decided to bring me an adult book with a nude woman on the cover and asked if he could check it out. I was shocked and embarrassed. I did not think that kind of thing would happen at a public library, but it did.  I believe that everyone should have the option of finding the book or movie of their choice. So I do not wish to have any inappropriate books or movies removed, but placed in better order so that children are not going to see that kind of stuff.
641	3618	2	3	The library should indeed consider censoring the books on its shelves to ensure that children are not exposed to offensive or inappropriate content. While completely removing books may be excessive, implementing age restrictions and permission slips can help control access to certain materials. It is crucial to protect young minds from negative influences that could shape their behavior and beliefs as they grow older. By filtering out harmful content and providing more positive alternatives, we can contribute to creating a better society and guiding our children towards becoming responsible adults. It is essential to take proactive measures to safeguard the future of our children and ultimately, the world as a whole.
642	3619	2	3	"Offensive literary pieces should be removed from libraries if they are particularly offensive. Controversy is often the reason books are banned, and my personal experience and observations support this. I have found that books that offend me make me not want to read anymore. Similarly, my observations show that many people, especially classmates, are put off from reading by controversial books. One example that stands out to me is the novel ""Fahrenheit 451,"" where society bans all books. This story demonstrates how people can live happily without controversial books. Overall, I believe that offensive books should be removed from public spaces to maintain peace and harmony."
643	3620	2	3	People today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive. The problem with the @ORGANIZATION1 is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people. The truth is that when you have as many as there is in a country, there are going to be many different ideas, thoughts, likes, and dislikes.  Libraries are places of knowledge. They keep many different books, magazines, and movies there, so that people with all different tastes can enjoy the library. Most people, with books, figure out early what genre of books, which authors, and how long of books they like. So books are usually very hard to offend people because most people can usually tell right away if they like the book or not.  Magazines are like books in a way. People know what they want. With magazines though, people usually just flip through the pages, and skim through articles. They will keep skimming through the magazine until they find that perfect article they want to read. Usually after that, they are done with the magazine.  Music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around. There is something about music that soothes the human body. Music is one of those things that is constantly changing with time. Before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced. Now it would be nice if there was just one type of music that everybody liked, but there isn't. There are so many types of genres of music that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music.  There are people who hate change. Likewise, they don't like to change their favorite music types. But if people changed with time, then there would really only be a few types of music. But since there are many types of music, there is always going to be someone out there in the world that doesn't think that song shouldn't be played.  Just in the last century movies have come a long way in advancement. Movies used to be simple, they would have a simple plot, and everyone loved it. But there are so many people who love to see technology advance, that they want movies to change. Movies today are all about special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, fighting, and the list could go on and on. Directors try to make the best movie possible, so it's almost like they try to put just enough of one thing to keep the audience into the movie. But if they go overboard on a subject, that is when at least one person has a red flag go up in their head and think that is offensive.  Movies are supposed to be entertaining, not something people should get offended by. Movies are good about it though. They have created a rating system to try to give the audience a fair warning heads up, so that the audience knows what to expect in the movie.  It doesn't matter what it is, book, magazine, music, or movie, there is always going to be someone who doesn't like it or is just offended by it. There is nothing to do about that, and it's not a bad thing. It simply means everyone in this world is not the same. So I think we can all come up with the conclusion that: just because one person doesn't like something, doesn't mean the next person will.
644	3621	2	3	Should books and such be removed off of the shelves if they are found offensive? Personally, I don't think they should be. If there is something in the book that is remotely offensive towards children, then it should be put under a section for adults only. Most libraries I have been to have different areas for each age group. If there is a book that is racially unacceptable, then it should be placed in the adult section, not anywhere for children.  When a book is being questioned if it is offensive or not, they should review all the possibilities of how someone may comprehend the story to see their reaction to it. There are many genres of books, music, magazines, etc., so there is always a place that the book can go to. Most of the questioning about a book is the language in it. For example, in October we just finished reading the book 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' There is a lot of debate if the book should be read in schools or not because of the use of the 'n-word'. It is a very harsh word, but it aligns with the setting and the background of the story. When someone is unsure if a book is acceptable or not, they should take into consideration what the story is about and whether or not the word is necessary.  If one book is being questioned about something wrong with it, then shouldn't all books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be questioned? If something is not allowed for one item, then it shouldn't be allowed for something else. It all comes down to the audience who reads that certain book and if it is appropriate or not for the person reading it. Katherine Paterson makes a very good point about how if we start taking books off the shelves, then eventually there wouldn't be any books left for people to enjoy. Just because something has a bad word or phrase in it doesn't mean it needs to be taken away from people's enjoyment!
645	3622	2	3	If you have been a child with parents who cared, then you have heard them say, 'No you can't play that game, you can't listen to that music, or you can not watch that movie.' @CAPS1 you asked why you were not allowed the same answer was always givin, 'You're not old enough.' If you ever had the courage to ask why again they would most likely have said, '@CAPS2 if I wanted you to know then I would allow you to find out for yourself!', and that didn't get you anywhere now did it? Now I would like for you to think back on those things you were not allowed to do, and how now that you are old enough you can do those things. How would it change things if those movies, @CAPS3's, or games had been removed from the shelves before you had the chance to get to them? What would you and your friends have done if you didn't get to watch '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8' that night because some parent or other individual had had it removed from the market because they found it offensive? I would also like for you to think about the child you @MONTH1 have or @MONTH1 plan to have, would you want your child to be subjected to such things as '@DATE1 The @NUM1' or '@CAPS9 and @CAPS10' as a @NUM2 year old? Most likely that answer is 'no', but what if, because they were found offensive, they were simply removed from existence? Then they would never see them and to some that @MONTH1 be what's right, and for those of you who think that I have some news for you, those kind of movies are still made today. '@DATE1 The @NUM1' has been remade and is more graphic than before, and there are countless other titles that i could throw @CAPS6 you now that have some form of sexual themes, drug use, or foul language. They still exist and are becoming more and more popular among movies. There are @CAPS11 movies that will have some sort of sexual reference, a cigarette, or a bad word in them. You might be able to get rid of a few, but would probably never rid the shelves of all of them. But let's say that you did, that you were, in fact, able to throw away any title that contained these themes. What would there be left to watch? If those movies do not exist any more, then what would your kids have to be able to watch, @CAPS12 the @CAPS13 and @CAPS14-@CAPS15? Not only that, but what movies would you watch, if all movies with something offensive in them were removed then you wouldn't have anything left for yourself. Every thing that you might like and/or think is funny in a film, but don't want your child to see is gone. My answer to you is to not just throw everything out that @MONTH1 be offensive, or that you might not want your child to see. Instead of going to such drastic measures to shield your child from them, but to simply not allow them to watch those movies or listen to that music. It's what I'm sure your parents did you, and I know it's what mine do to me, and guess what? It has worked so far, so why should we change it?
646	3623	2	3	I don't think that anything that gets checked out from the library should be censored. Some of the people that go to the library aren't looking for material with offensive language and/or themes. On the other hand, there are some people who go to the library who find that having offensive language spoken when it was meant to be is better than censoring it.   Take for example a book about @PERSON1. It could have some things in it that people could find offensive. But if someone has to write a report on @PERSON1, it would be best to have as much information on him as possible. I will make one compromise: if there is music being checked out with offensive language, they should provide it with both a clean and explicit version of the album.   There are ways that censorship can be good, and some ways that it could be bad. Some people find bad language and themes offensive, while others find that it gives freedom to the artist or author. I think that uncensoring things in the good and bad form is better than not uncensoring things at all. In the end, it is important to consider the diversity of opinions and preferences when it comes to accessing materials at the library, allowing individuals to make their own choices without imposing restrictions based on subjective criteria.
647	3624	2	3	A kid walks into the library up town. He looks around and finds a movie one of his friends recommended to watch. He checks it out and goes home to watch the movie. Later on, his parents come home to see their son acting out of the ordinary. He starts to say rude comments, being violent, and using profanity. Who is to blame? The friend who recommended the movie, or the library for having this movie on the shelves and letting the young kid check it out?   Today, many libraries have a variety of books, movies, music, and magazines to choose from. Some libraries even have computers for kids, teenagers, and adults to use for certain things such as business, personal mail on websites, or games for kids to play.   But are all the libraries meeting their requirements? Some people find many books, movies, music, magazines, and even websites threatening. Libraries have movies that are rated G, PG, PG-13, or R. They also have music that has explicit lyrics on the shelves. Some libraries may not meet their requirements and that is why libraries do not have as much business as others.   In my opinion, I think that if a library has offensive material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and websites, they should be removed from the shelves. If the librarians are letting young kids check out explicit music, and R-rated movies, they should possibly be fired. From my own experience, I have not had trouble with libraries and materials they have to choose from. I have not visited a library that has had explicit music to choose, all of the bad websites are blocked on the computers, and all of the magazines are appropriate for all ages.   In conclusion, libraries should have respect not only for people, but for the materials they have. They need to show respect for the books, movies, music, and magazines they provide for kids, teenagers, and parents. Censorship is required for every library and I think that all the libraries around do meet their requirements.
648	3625	2	3	Censorship at the library is not always necessary, as it is ultimately the responsibility of parents to monitor what their children read. While there may be instances where censorship is warranted, such as for adult content, the library should not dictate what individuals can or cannot access. Classic literature should not be altered to cater to the sensitivities of a minority group, as it reflects the realities of the world. Limiting books based on a few offensive words undermines the purpose of literature and fails to prepare individuals for the complexities of life. The library should not act as a censor, but rather provide access to a diverse range of materials for individuals to make their own informed choices. Ultimately, censorship should be approached with caution, considering the balance between protecting individuals and promoting intellectual freedom.
649	3626	2	3	The seven books which constitute the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series by @PERSON1 are books which are frequently censored in school libraries accross the country. The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light, they must be harming our innocent children. Many books, from @PERSON2's 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series have been banned from school libraries due to their content being deemed inappropriate by a group of people who fail to take the larger meaning of these works into account. Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive. Under the @ORGANIZATION1 to the @CAPS7, every citizen has the freedom of speech, press and religion. By censoring the speech of authors, their rights have been denied. It is an author's right to say what he or she feels needs to be said, and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right. By prohibiting books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to be read; the greater meaning of these works is being disregarded. Many conservative @CAPS12 groups have advocated that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' be banned from schools because of its portrayl of witchcraft (and therefore satanism) and the nominal fact that @PERSON3 has stated that @PERSON4 (the @CAPS15 in the series) is homosexual. However the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil. Apparently that is not a message worth teaching the youth of @LOCATION1. However, even if every school in the country took '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' off the shelves; that would not, and should not, stop children from reading these books. Since 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' began to be part of many schools' curriculum in the @DATE1, it has been at the top of the most censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter involving a prostitute. That has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel, which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults. Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect'. If a parent, however, does not want his or her child to read such a novel; it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads. But just because one parent does not want their child to read '@CAPS1 @CAPS2', does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it. Censorship should be a matter of the private, not public sphere. Books and other works should not be censored in libraries. In doing so; an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded. And while certain groups @MONTH1 advocate to protect the children of @LOCATION1 from these offensive works; the children will still find a way to access them. Ultimately, censorship in school libraries limits access to diverse viewpoints and hinders intellectual growth.
650	3627	2	3	I believe that the view on censorship in libraries is justified for several reasons. The primary purpose of libraries is to provide access to information for people to learn, regardless of whether they agree with or are offended by the content. Removing offensive material would limit the diversity of information available to the public.   Katherine Paterson's quote highlights the impossibility of pleasing everyone when it comes to censorship. What offends one person may be valuable information to another. Libraries serve as a resource for individuals to explore a wide range of topics, even those that may be uncomfortable or controversial.   In conclusion, while some may find certain materials in libraries offensive, it is essential to maintain access to a variety of information for the benefit of all individuals. Limiting censorship ensures that libraries remain valuable sources of knowledge and learning for everyone.
651	3628	2	3	Censorship in Libraries  I believe that there should be censorship in libraries. In society, there are many kids who are exposed to harmful content that can influence their behavior in negative ways. Censorship in libraries can help steer kids in the right direction, alleviate parental concerns, and prevent exposure to offensive material.  Censorship in libraries can play a crucial role in guiding children towards making positive choices. When children see their role models engaging in harmful behaviors in movies or books, they may be tempted to imitate them. By censoring such content, libraries can protect children from being influenced in harmful ways and help them avoid making poor decisions.  Parents often worry about the content their children are exposed to, especially when it comes to illegal or inappropriate behavior depicted in movies or books. Censorship in libraries can ease some of this parental stress by ensuring that children are not exposed to content that may encourage them to engage in illegal activities or harmful behaviors.  Additionally, offensive movies can have a detrimental impact on children, their parents, and society as a whole. By censoring offensive material in libraries, unnecessary hate and negativity can be avoided. Children should not have to endure bullying or discrimination because of the content they are exposed to, and censorship can help prevent such situations.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is essential to protect children, support parents, and promote a positive and safe environment for all. By implementing censorship measures, libraries can help guide children towards making better choices, alleviate parental worries, and prevent exposure to harmful and offensive content.
652	3629	2	3	People from all over the world have many different opinions. If someone doesn't like something, they do have the choice of not looking at it. Therefore, I believe that when you find something offensive in a library, it should not be removed.  One main reason why I feel that offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries is because not everyone may find the book, movie, magazine, or music offensive. People have their own opinions on everything, and if someone removes a certain item because they find it objectionable, others may miss out on something they enjoy.  Additionally, some individuals may become upset if offensive materials are continually removed from the library. Many people appreciate having access to a variety of materials, even if they may be considered offensive by some. Removing these items could lead to frustration and limitations on what individuals can access.  In my opinion, a certain amount of offensiveness can add humor and interest to books and other media. Just because something may seem inappropriate or rude does not mean it lacks value. Sometimes, controversial or offensive content can add depth and complexity to a work.  While some offensive materials may seem inappropriate to some, if they are available in the library, it indicates that they have some merit and should not be removed just because one person finds them objectionable. Everyone has their own unique perspectives, and it is essential to respect the diversity of opinions present in society.  In conclusion, I believe that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries as they provide valuable insights, perspectives, and entertainment for a wide range of individuals. It is important to recognize and respect the differing opinions and preferences of others when it comes to accessing and engaging with various forms of media available in library collections.
653	3630	2	3	There are numerous books and movies which are deemed not appropriate for younger audiences. By marking movies with a rating, and marking books with a specific age group, it helps categorize them. In our public libraries, all books and movies are settled into one place for everyone to have the ability to check out. There is the ongoing discussion on whether these should be available to everyone. If a child were to check out a book, and it happened to be rated @CAPS1, the parents would most likely become upset with the library for giving the right to the child to check out a rated @CAPS1 movie. There is also the instance where a parent would have the child check out a specific movie with a @CAPS1 rating. In which the library would be harassed for not letting the child check it out. Furthermore, should public libraries let certain age groups check out movies/books which are not appropriate? The logical answer concludes to no, they shouldn't. If a child can not see a rated @CAPS1 movie at the theatre, why should they be able to check them out freely at the library? Public libraries should invest in a way to keep underage kids from checking out inappropriate materials. By simply having their age on their library card, there would be a lot of misunderstandings taken care of. Our public libraries should take it into their own hands, by changing their censorship. It would give them a better name, and give our children a secure place to gain access to these materials.
654	3631	2	3	Wouldn't it be nice to walk into a library and be able to find any sort of book possible? I believe that it would be very useful and helpful for many libraries to allow a varied censorship of books. In my opinion it would be beneficial to students, parents, or teachers to get information on different topics. As well as many students who need to write a paper about a certain topic that they may not be familiar with, and allowing all types of books would help anybody with any topic.  A library is a place where anyone can go to find information on something, find an interesting read, or just relax. If you're going to get information on a topic that you know nothing about, it would be nice to find a book telling all about the topic. This would help students with reports, along with any other person who is trying to find some extra information they might not know about a topic.  If a person does not want certain types of books in the library, then I think that person should just try to ignore the books. I think this because I don't believe books should be taken out that are beneficial to others just because they are offensive to someone who could simply ignore them.  Maybe the books are about drugs, sex, or violence, but they still are able to teach many people who are not already knowledgeable about inappropriate or offensive topics.  In conclusion, throwing books out and keeping a library censored would be a mistake. It is a mistake because it takes away from many people who want to become knowledgeable about different topics. It takes away from people who need to learn about topics for things such as school or work.
655	3632	2	3	No, books should not be banned from libraries just because some people find them offensive. Banning books only limits access to information and restricts the freedom to read and explore different perspectives. Instead of banning books, individuals can choose not to read them if they find them objectionable. Additionally, banning books can often lead to unnecessary drama and conflicts. It is important to remember that what may be offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. Therefore, it is crucial to respect diverse opinions and allow individuals to make their own choices when it comes to reading materials. In conclusion, banning books is not the solution to addressing offensive content, and it is essential to uphold the principles of freedom of expression and intellectual freedom in libraries.
656	3633	2	3	In libraries, there are certain materials on the shelves that may be offensive to some people. While some may find these materials offensive, others may not. It all depends on the individual's perspective. Libraries cannot cater to everyone's preferences, but that should not mean removing these materials from the shelves.  Taking offensive materials off the shelves deprives others who may enjoy or benefit from them. Instead, a possible solution could be to place these materials on taller shelves or in a separate room so that individuals who find them offensive can avoid them, while those who do not mind can access them freely. This way, both sides have a say in the matter, leading to a fair compromise.  If segregating the materials does not suffice, libraries could consider replacing the highly offensive materials with more suitable alternatives that cater to a wider audience. By finding a balance between accommodating different preferences, libraries can ensure that all patrons feel respected and considered.  In conclusion, libraries should not remove offensive materials from their shelves. By implementing solutions that consider the concerns of both those who find the materials offensive and those who do not, libraries can maintain a diverse collection that serves the needs and interests of a broad spectrum of individuals.
657	3634	2	3	Yes, I do think that if material in a library is offensive, it should be removed from the shelves. A library is a place for people to learn and grow, and it should be a safe and welcoming environment for all individuals, especially children. If something is deemed inappropriate or offensive, it has the potential to hinder the educational experience and overall satisfaction of library visitors. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the library maintains a positive and enriching atmosphere by removing offensive material. In conclusion, the primary goal of a library should be to promote learning and development, and this can best be achieved by ensuring that its collection is suitable and respectful to all patrons.
658	3635	2	3	Should materials in libraries be censored? No, I don't think that materials in libraries should be censored or taken off the shelf. People should have the right to access whatever they want from the library, and if something is offensive to someone, they can simply choose not to look at it. While it is important to consider the appropriateness of materials for children, libraries typically have policies in place to prevent minors from accessing inappropriate content. In general, libraries aim to provide a wide range of materials to cater to diverse interests and preferences. Removing items from the shelves based on individual complaints of offensiveness could limit access to valuable resources for others. Therefore, unless something is widely deemed as highly offensive, it should not be censored in libraries.
659	3636	2	3	I believe that if there is a book in a library that a child is not allowed to read, the book should be stored in a section where children cannot access it. Similarly, in stores, magazines with inappropriate content should be placed in an area inaccessible to children. Music and movies with explicit material should also be kept separate from items suitable for younger audiences. It is important to restrict children's access to such content to prevent them from being exposed to inappropriate material and potentially imitating it. By implementing these measures, we can help ensure that children are only exposed to age-appropriate content.
660	3637	2	3	We should not have the right to remove materials from shelves if we find them offensive. Doing so would limit access to important information and perspectives for future generations. Even if a book, movie, or magazine contains content that some may find offensive, it is crucial to preserve these materials as a reference for historical events and societal attitudes. Allowing individuals to remove materials based on personal preferences or sensitivities could lead to the censorship of valuable content. It is important to respect diverse viewpoints and preserve a wide range of materials for the benefit of society as a whole. Therefore, the right to remove materials from shelves based on individual offense should not be granted.
661	3638	2	3	Removing certain materials from the shelves of libraries is not the way to go. No matter how offensive they might be, there are many other ways to solve this problem. I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive.  First off, many people have different opinions about what is offensive and what is not. For example, many people have different interests than others. Some people like certain kinds of books and movies while others do not. Everyone is going to have their own preference on what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Why would you take things away that people actually enjoy? There are other ways to solve this problem.  I believe that we can solve this problem by just separating certain materials from others in the library. For example, if something is thought to be offensive, then it can be placed with others like it. These materials do not have to be removed completely. Mothers are often worried about their children picking up things in the library that they think are offensive. If these materials are separated from others, there will not be a problem. Certain materials do not have to be removed completely from a library.  All in all, there is no need to remove materials from a library because many people have different interests. In conclusion, I believe that materials should not be removed from libraries for being too offensive.
662	3639	2	3	I'm really sick and my head really hurts at this moment while having to write this paper, so please take it easy on me. Any source of literature is someone's own creation of imagination, taken in whatever direction they so choose for it to be taken. The creation of that art form as writing would be nothing less than lonesome trash floating the winding streets if it were censored.  It is almost like when watching television; your kids are up and want to stay up late to watch the new horror movie but no way, that movie is way too scary for them, plus it shows some nudity. If the movie is not appropriate for your children then do not let them watch it. In a library though, your mother might not always be there to pre-read your books for you. So maybe you just have to assume responsibility and read the book if you choose to, or not read the book depending on how your mother would feel about it of course.  The thought of there being censorship in libraries is quite ridiculous. Of course I would not like to see explicit content in my children's section but that is all up to just having books in their right sections. Have the explicit books on one side of the library and the non on the other side. The main point is that most people that make use of the library are old enough to choose a book of their liking and if they are not they have their mother accompanying them.   In conclusion, censorship in libraries restricts the freedom of choice and access to diverse literary works. It is essential for individuals to have the autonomy to decide what they want to read, while also ensuring appropriate categorization of materials for different age groups. Censorship should not hinder the exploration of ideas and creativity within the realm of literature.
663	3640	2	3	There are many different types of books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that fill the shelves of libraries and stores across the country. Consumers are constantly taking these items off the shelves without realizing what they are really buying. Some parents may not even realize what their teenagers or little children are actually buying. Some of the material may be offensive and have a bad influence on those who buy into them. But if parents were more careful about what their children buy, then there would not be a problem. That is why these materials should remain on the shelves.  One vital reason these items should not be taken away is because it is the consumer's choice on whether or not they want to buy or check out these items. People should be able to decide for themselves on what they will or will not buy. If they do not want to buy or check these materials out, then they should just go to another shelf or shop at another store. I have seen some parents who do not really care what their children buy, and I have also seen parents go the other way. If stores take away these items, then it is almost like taking away their right to make a choice.  It is the adult's responsibility if they do not want their children to watch movies that are for mature viewers. The parent should be able to prohibit certain things until their child is old enough to make its own decisions. If they trust their children with these materials, then that is their choice. These offensive items cannot just be taken off the shelves just because some people are bothered by them. With the way the media works, it would be difficult to remove all these items from libraries and stores. No matter what, there will probably always be a way for younger children to be exposed to these materials. On television, there are always commercials that will attract kids or teens and influence them to buy their stuff. I have also seen music videos and magazines with their favorite celebrities on the covers. It is almost impossible to control every aspect of society to make it appropriate for younger viewers.  If all the people were able to take all the items that they did not approve of off the shelves, then there would be many of these shelves left empty and bare. If everyone were to take a book they did not like off the shelf, then there would be a little selection at the libraries. By taking off one of these books, someone could be taking off another person's favorite book. People cannot just take books off the shelves because they have some bad language. There is a reason for separating the children's section from the adult's section, and it is because some books might not be appropriate for all readers. From my personal experience, I have not seen any problems with kids checking out offensive books. Most little kids are attracted to the children's section because of the colorful pages and simpler words.  There is a variety of materials available to the public that may be offensive to some, especially to their little children. As a parent, it is their responsibility to keep track of what their children are being shown. People cannot take materials off the shelves because it is only offensive to some. This would not be fair to those who enjoy these kinds of materials. If they do not want to buy it, then they should simply move on to another shelf or to a completely different store. It is their choice as the consumer on whether or not they want to buy into the many different types of books, music, movies, magazines, etc.
664	3641	2	3	I believe that if you are at a library or movie store, or wherever there are books, movies, magazines, or CDs that you find offensive, they should most likely be taken off the shelf. Have you ever walked into a store and seen something inappropriate for little kids, feeling embarrassed yourself? I know I have at least once in my life. That's why I think it should be removed from the store or at least the shelves.  I always consider how my grandparents would feel if they knew what kind of music most teens are listening to today. There is so much terrible language and talk about violence and bad things that really isn't suitable for anyone to hear or discuss. Some people may have different opinions on this matter, and some may take it too seriously, but it's essential to remember that everyone has their own perspective.
665	3642	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 paper, I do believe that there are valid points on both sides of the debate regarding whether certain books should be removed from library shelves. On one hand, it is important to consider the presence of underage children in libraries and the potential for certain books to be offensive to some individuals. However, libraries are meant to provide a diverse range of reading materials for the public, and censoring certain books could limit access to important perspectives and ideas. It is essential to strike a balance between protecting individuals from harmful content and upholding the principles of intellectual freedom and diversity. Ultimately, it is crucial for individuals to consider different viewpoints and respect the rights of others when it comes to the selection of books in libraries.
666	3643	2	3	When it comes to censorship in libraries, there is a growing concern about the content that is available on shelves. Many believe that there are books, movies, music, and magazines with inappropriate language and imagery that should not be easily accessible to all library visitors, especially children. Some argue that these materials should be removed or restricted in some way to protect young audiences from potentially harmful content. On the other hand, there are those who believe in the freedom of expression and access to information, even if it means having controversial or explicit material in libraries.  It is important to find a balance between freedom of expression and protecting individuals, particularly children, from content that may not be suitable for them. Perhaps having a separate section or store for such materials could be a potential solution. This way, those who are interested in accessing these materials can do so, while others who prefer to avoid them can easily do that as well. Ultimately, the discussion on censorship in libraries is complex and nuanced, with differing opinions on what should be allowed on shelves. Finding a middle ground that respects both freedom of expression and individual preferences is key to addressing this ongoing issue.
667	3644	2	3	Censorship in libraries, especially in schools, remains a contentious issue. The restriction of certain books due to their content, such as violence or language, deprives students of valuable educational resources. By limiting access to these materials, students are denied the opportunity to explore diverse perspectives and engage with challenging subject matter.  It is crucial to recognize that what may be deemed inappropriate for some individuals does not necessarily apply to everyone. Banning books based on subjective interpretations of what is deemed offensive only serves to hinder intellectual growth and critical thinking. Students should have the freedom to choose their reading materials, even if they may contain controversial themes.  Books have the power to inspire, provoke thought, and spark meaningful discussions. By censoring literature, we risk stifling creativity and limiting the potential for personal growth and empathy. Everyone deserves the right to access a wide range of reading materials that reflect the complexities of the world around them.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries, especially in educational settings, is a hindrance to intellectual freedom and personal development. It is essential to uphold the principles of free expression and allow individuals to make their own choices regarding what they read. By promoting open access to diverse literary works, we foster a culture of curiosity, critical thinking, and empathy. Let us embrace the power of literature to enlighten and enrich our lives without unnecessary restrictions.
668	3645	2	3	I think certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because the word is just saying 'OFFENSIVE', or those things should be placed where not everybody can get it, like the little kids or when your religion doesn't accept that kind of things. For example in my opinion there are some books, music, movies or magazines that show images or words that are offensive, and not just for me or other people too. Offensive for me is when its not an appropriate thing like certain images, videos or bad words that should not be use for everybody to hear or see. You have to be careful when you think something is offensive because not everyone thinks like you, and everybody has a different opinion and conclusion and we have to remember, we have the power to talk, read and write what we think is best. I'm not saying that they should prohibit certain books or music, I'm just saying that there is time for everything and we are young and we are looking for a good future, not just for us also for the younger kids and the older people have to provide us the best they can, because they have experience and they know what is best for their kids. This is a free country and people should express their opinion and make it worth, if you think something is being bad say it, and its important to remember do not let people offend you with words or images and don't let them force you to do something offensive for someone else. We should all strive to create a respectful and inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable and valued.
669	3646	2	3	In @DATE1's world, there are numerous materials surrounding children that may not be suitable for their consumption. While many adults express concerns about the changes in the world compared to their own childhoods, it is essential to take action rather than simply complain. Adults can play a significant role in controlling the amount of inappropriate materials children are exposed to. It is common to find questionable content in stores, such as movies and music with negative themes like drugs and parties. These materials can have a detrimental impact on young minds and should be restricted from children's access as much as possible.   Although it may not be possible to completely remove all unsuitable materials from the shelves, efforts can be made to limit children's exposure to such content. Towns and cities can also contribute by implementing measures to prevent children from accessing @CAPS1 rated movies, explicit songs, and adult-themed books. By safeguarding children from harmful materials, we are nurturing a healthier and more positive future generation. It is crucial to prioritize the well-being and development of our children by guiding them towards more appropriate and educational content. By taking proactive steps to shield children from negative influences, we can create a brighter and more promising world for them to thrive in.
670	3647	2	3	There are many books, music, movies, and magazines that people find offensive. Some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves. I do not believe that the books, music, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelves completely. Not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them.  First, people have different views on what they find offensive. Not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same books or song to be removed. With people always having different views it is difficult to take books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves for everyone. Just because one person does not agree with what is being said in the movie or book does not mean that every single person wants that movie or book to be removed. If one person found my favorite book offensive I would not want it taken off the shelves completely.  Equally important, if every book, song, movie, and magazine that someone finds offensive is taken off the shelve there would not be many books, movies, songs, or magazines left. Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove a book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves there would be no books for anyone to read. People find different things offensive and if everyone took these things off the shelves there would be none left for anyone.  Finally, if someone finds a book offensive they do not have to read it. When someone finds a book, movie, song, or magazine offensive they don't need to watch it or read it. Instead of taking it off the shelves the person could just not read it. Not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people. When someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people. If someone was offened by one of my favorite books, I would prefere if they just avoid reading it instead if taking it off the shelves so that I can not read it.  Some people find many books, songs, movies, and magazines offensive. They would like these things to be removed from the shelves permenatly. I, however, do not believe that these things should be removed. Taking these off the shelves could make some people happy, it could also upset even more. Not everyone finds the same things offensive and should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them.
671	3648	2	3	Imagine walking out of your home and you see right down the street a giant bonfire, right in the open. You see men walking into a library empty-handed and walk out carrying armfuls of books, magazines, movies, and other media. The men then toss them into the raging inferno, and you see them become incinerated, lost forever. This is what will happen if we let censorship of our libraries take place. We should not let censorship of our libraries take place since it violates a constitutional right, will gradually make our society more and more ignorant, and will let this nation slide from a democratic nation to one where the beliefs and ideals of the people are controlled by a small group of people.  Letting censorship of our libraries take place will violate a basic constitutional right, plain and simple. In the United States Constitution, it clearly says that there will be freedom of the press. By tossing out certain literary works, this right will be thrown to the side, and by violating one constitutional right, what will come next? Will our freedom of speech be negated, or our freedom to assemble? As citizens of the United States, we cannot let this happen to our great nation.  By allowing certain books and essays to be thrown out of our libraries, the people's knowledge base will eventually shrink down drastically. For example, take Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, a very sensitive subject among people of the Christian faith. If all of his works regarding that were to be thrown out, much information that was very valuable to biologists would be lost, and those biologists would not be able to improve upon the existing pool of information. If this were to take place, our civilization would experience a lessening intellect and an expanding ignorance regarding many fields of knowledge.  Picture Germany in the 1940s. Hitler's Nazi Party has taken power and is systematically destroying all materials they find to be subversive to the Nazi cause, only allowing materials that contained beliefs and ideals that they thought were correct to exist in libraries. This is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place. The censoring of the libraries would be controlled by a relatively small group of people, which means that the censoring would be controlled by those same people's beliefs and ideals, and those same beliefs and ideals would thus be forced upon the people, shaping the beliefs and ideals of the masses to those select few.  In conclusion, letting censorship take place in our public libraries will dismantle the basic structure of our society by violating a constitutional right, making our society gradually become more and more ignorant, and letting the beliefs and ideals of our people rest in the hands of a select few. This is not what our founding fathers envisioned America to become, and they were right. Letting censorship exist in our public libraries is simply wrong.
672	3649	2	3	Everyone has things that would offend them, whether they admit it or not. Books are known to do this to people. However, there are all different kinds of books, music, and all the other materials that could offend all different kinds of people. There are even books read in school classrooms that offend people. Reading is an important thing and whether or not the reader likes it, they will come across one that offends them. I believe we have the right to have those offending things because there are so many books who offend people, music and movies have censorship, and if they don't like it they should ignore it.  First of all, we have the right to have these kinds of books. Just like in life, there are certain things people don't like, but deal with it anyway. That's what this is. Even though there are the handful out there that don't like those certain books, those books are the ones that are well liked and become famous. I have read a book that people have wanted to ban and it was one of the best books I have read. To sum that all up, if we took away every book that one person didn't like, there would be only few left.  Secondly, music and movies have censorship. You can choose whether you want that censorship or not. Movies tell what ages are okay to watch those movies. Music blocks out the words that need to be. If they don't want it they don't have to listen to it or watch it. We all have the certain things we love and hate, we can't eliminate all of the hated things.  Last of all, in my opinion if they don't want it they don't have to have it. The music and movies are an option to people, they don't have to listen or watch something they think is a bad idea. It's all opinionated, there isn't a right or wrong to it. I know of people out there who don't have @CAPS1's or they don't listen to the radio, that's perfectly fine. They don't have to complain about because they don't pay any attention to it.  To wrap this all up, there are so many books out in the world that offend people, the music and movies have censorship, and if they can't stand it they don't have to deal with it. As I said, these books, magazines, music, etc. are very well liked by many of people, so why get rid of them for those few who get offended? We all have things we do and don't like that we cannot do anything about. As Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'
673	3650	2	3	There I was, shuffling my way through the library, finding the perfect books to check out. It was then that I had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting. The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on. The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it. Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them. Whether literature includes stories of love and breakbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves.  Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone else's. Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides? Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading. If we remove books that @MONTH1 be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world.  Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives. We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music. If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not. The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help.  In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders. The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective. If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public.
674	3651	2	3	The censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already. A few reasons explain why the censorship is alright as it is. Those reasons are that parents should be in charge of the books their children read, that not all people agree on censorship, and that libraries have books of different subjects that people like to read. The first reason is that parents should be in charge of what their children read. If the parents would just tell their children no to a certain book, then the child will not read it. If the parent does not want their child to go into a section then, the parents can just say keep away from that area. Although, sometimes the child may stray away from its parents, it is not very likely that the parent will not notice. That is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read. The second reason is that not all people agree on censorship. Certain people think that religion is important no matter what the book shows, but others would think parts of religious book (nudity, swears, etc...) is extremely inappropriate. Some people would say that books like mythology books are inappropriate and need to be censored, although others think these books are past culture and that they should remain in the libraries forever. Most children will look at these books and think that the books are too big to read, so they would not even look at them. Few people would agree on censorship, and a lot of people would disagree. The third reason is that libraries have different subjects than the inappropriate books. The people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others. It is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say ‘I want to read that one.’ the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort. The point being that a person can read other books than just inappropriate books. Library books should be kept the same because the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have different subjects that people want to read. The censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree. The children probably would not look at the inappropriate book anyways, because they would not interest the child.
675	3652	2	3	So you see a nice, old lady looking at one of many books through a library, she chucks it. You look at her, she looks at you, she walks away. You go and pick up the book, it's about medical marijuana. She took offense to that? I don't really care what people gotta say, if it's on the shelf, it stays on the shelf.  I'm convincing librarians, readers, and everyone else that if you have offense to a book, magazine, movie, or anything you can find at a library, shut your fat mouths. A library serves many purposes, one, it's open to anyone and everyone. Two, if you have a library card, you can check out books, movies, music, etc. Three, if you're walking down the road and 'gotta go,' you can stop right in and leave.  What I'm trying to say is that nothing should be removed from any shelf at any library. Yeah, I mean there's a certain point at which you got to take charge, but even then you can have an adolescent room or what not. I think that if you take something off the shelf at a library, you are just taking away part of the heart. Let's say you have 3 libraries in your town, one library has one thing the other doesn't have. Someone riots and they get to take it off the shelf. You're never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy it online. And sometimes, that can get a little pricey, especially since you can get it free at a library.  But then again, I see where people are coming from to take certain materials off the shelves. Say you have a 2-year old kid, and he walks up to you carrying a sex love book. What can you say about that? Most parents just want to keep their kids in a safe, harmless environment. That's where they come in and say, 'I thought this was a library?!' Then that's where it goes bad.  After all that happens, people just accuse the librarians that they got these books, movies, and music that's just bad for a young kid. But it's not the librarians' fault, different people like different books, that's why a library has many choices when it comes to books.  That's when the question comes up, 'why don't we just have separate rooms, for separate books?' Yes, that sounds good and all, but who's gonna pay for it? Libraries get donated a lot of their stuff, they are profitable, but then again a non-profitable resource. Libraries have been around for ages, most of them started out small and now are big. That's when the library gets donations, looks through them, and sells the books they don't want or need. They make money off that, that's when they start making separate rooms.  It sounds crazy, but it wouldn't cause a riot to go on about people. Therefore, people are happy, librarians happy, and most of all you are happy. You can find the book you want or need easy as one, two, three. All you gotta do is go to that certain room, look for it, check it out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime. It sounds easier than looking it up, get the dewey decimal number, find the number.  All in all, we shouldn't remove anything from a library shelf because it may be the only one in your town, maybe the only one in your state, maybe through the whole country. You never know. All I gotta say is, it's better to keep a book, than to forget a book.
676	3653	2	3	Maybe, to a certain extent, I do not believe that books should be removed from shelves. While some books and magazines may contain offensive content, there is also a great deal of informative material that can be valuable for learning and understanding different perspectives. It is important to consider that what may be offensive to one person may not be offensive to another, and removing all potentially offensive material could limit the opportunity for learning and growth. Additionally, music and other forms of media should not be censored or removed, as they provide enjoyment and relaxation for many people. It is essential to recognize the changing generations and evolving societal norms, while also preserving the freedom of expression and access to diverse viewpoints. In conclusion, while it is important to address offensive content and its impact on individuals, complete removal of books and media may not be the most effective solution, as it could hinder learning, creativity, and the expression of different voices.
677	3654	2	3	In my opinion, all types of material should be allowed in libraries. If someone takes offense to a particular topic or section, they don't have to read it. Libraries should cater to a person's desires and interests to keep them engaged. Variety is key in attracting a diverse range of visitors. While there should be a line of respect in place, allowing for different viewpoints and genres ensures that there is something for everyone. People should have the freedom to choose what they want to read and explore. The library is a place for learning and discovery, and having a wide range of materials available only enhances the experience for all visitors.
678	3655	2	3	I do not believe things should be removed from shelves in libraries if they offend someone. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't mean it's offensive to all. If you are offended by something they display, there are ways that you can avoid seeing them. One thing you can do to avoid it is never go by or around the shelves displaying it, ask for help so you get whatever it is that you need, or try to search what you're looking for on the internet.  When I visit the library, I already know what I'm going to get, so I have never found anything offensive to me. If I did find something offensive to me, I would complain, and if they didn't do anything about it, I would just never go back. I would just research online or go to another library where I know they will meet my needs.  The libraries I go to always have sections separating the different age groups. The sections are split into children, teens, and adults. I've been to the library numerous times, and I have never heard anyone with a complaint about something being offensive. If the library had something that would offend me, I wouldn't know. Every time I go, I stay in one particular section for teens and look at magazines and books.  I feel that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves, they should just avoid or ignore it because everyone has their own opinion on what offends them and what doesn't. In the end, it's important to respect the diversity of perspectives and opinions that make up our society.
679	3656	2	3	I think we should not take it off the shelf because what may be offensive to you may not be offensive to me. Something that is fun or beneficial to me may not be the same for you. If something is offensive to someone, they should simply walk away or choose not to pay attention to it. Everyone has their own perspectives and sensitivities, so it is important to consider that what may be acceptable to one person may not be to another. It's essential to respect each other's differences and make choices based on personal preferences without imposing them on others.
680	3657	2	3	I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone may dislike a particular novel or book, libraries cannot remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.  The possibility children will see the offensive material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the children's books. At my local library, there is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parent's permission or be a certain age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.  Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. Books like To Kill a Mockingbird have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone cannot be frustrated with a novel written years ago because it has something offensive in it by today's standards.  While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.  Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains on most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed. Therefore, the current approach to censorship and removal of materials in libraries is effective and should be maintained.
681	3658	2	3	When considering which books should be banned or restricted in a library, it is important to take into account the content of the material. Books that contain explicit sexual content, graphic violence, racism, or sexism may be considered for removal or placement in a separate section for adult readers. However, it is crucial to ensure that the process of banning books is not arbitrary and involves input from a diverse group of stakeholders, including educators, parents, and librarians. By having a comprehensive discussion and evaluation of the reasons for banning a book, the community can ensure that censorship is done thoughtfully and with consideration for the diversity of readers' preferences and sensitivities.
682	3659	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic that sparks various debates. Some argue that movies, magazines, and books should be available for all to access, including children, as it is essential for them to learn about the world around them. They believe that exposure to different content at a young age can better prepare individuals for the complexities of adulthood. While some may argue that certain materials are inappropriate for young audiences, others maintain that early exposure can lead to a more informed and educated society. Ultimately, the decision to allow access to a wide range of materials in libraries can have a significant impact on the knowledge and development of individuals, particularly the youth.
683	3660	2	3	I believe that it is important not to remove materials such as books, movies, or music just because a few individuals do not like the content. Everyone has different preferences and what may be offensive to one person may be enjoyable to another. Instead of trying to censor everything, individuals should take responsibility for what they and their children are exposed to. Setting boundaries and having open discussions about media consumption is more effective than trying to ban certain materials. People should have the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to, without the fear of censorship. It is essential to respect diverse opinions and allow for a variety of content to be available to cater to different tastes and interests.
684	3661	2	3	Censorship; the aspect of removing offensive materials from the public eye. Is this the right thing to do? Should society as a whole take away variety? Do you believe our generation or future generations should not get to experience and understand what the past generations have? I believe censorship is wrong in every aspect, but I also believe that materials that are offensive, or inappropriate for certain ages can be controlled.  Movie theaters, video stores, @ORGANIZATION1, and television all do it. They use ratings and age control for their viewers. Now control can be difficult, and @MONTH1 not always work if not handled correctly. To handle this situation before it arises, the library can use a system like restaurants or bars use; such as, checking identification before letting a book that is '@CAPS1' rated or above be checked out. Different sections in the library can be available to certain age groups. Now you @MONTH1 be thinking; doesn't this idea take away from the liberties that libraries give us? Well, you would rather have our children see violence and other inappropriate materials that they shouldn't? It would be just like the movie theater. You would not need to buy a ticket, but the control of content would be phenomenal compared to what it is. Would you want your six-year-old girl picking up an adult violence movie, sexual content movies, or even a @CAPS2 with cursing in it? Why should the library offer things for children that parents would frown upon?  I believe the library should be a place of learning and freedom, but the learning should be something age-appropriate. Our society is maturing too fast for young children, why should the library take part in that? Libraries located in schools do not even offer this material because they know that the majority of the readers for their library are students. This being said why should public libraries be okay with stocking this material?  Yes, media is everywhere. Movies, books, magazines, newspapers, music, and much more flash and sell more than they should. Media shows children things they shouldn't know about until they are young adults, but does this make it okay? Does it make is right for children to see and want all they want to? No, it does not. Fighting fire with fire only makes a larger fire. Why start our children out at a young age with violence, sex, and inappropriate material? Would you like to set your children up to fail? I know I wouldn't so why let our libraries hand out books, magazines, movies, and more to let our children thrive upon the culture they are stuck with? I do not think we should remove these books from our libraries because everyone has a different opinion, but I do believe that control needs to be put into place for our children's and other children's sakes. With that being said, censorship is overrated, but some of the material at the library is underrated, and that needs to be handled and controlled.  In conclusion, while censorship may be seen as limiting freedom of expression, there is a need for age-appropriate control in libraries to protect children from exposure to harmful or inappropriate content. It is important to strike a balance between freedom of access and responsible content management to ensure a positive and safe learning environment for all library users.
685	3662	2	3	Everyone has a favorite book. And some of us can't put it down once we read the first sentence. Then days later, the library takes it down and states that it's offensive to many people that have read it. Why should multiple people lose a good read just because someone doesn't like what they see? We're all trying to accommodate to everyone and their needs just to please them. Whatever they ask is done because we don't want a big scene. A majority of people think, 'That book is offensive! Take it down! Disgusting!'. But why?   Everyone has a right to read what they want to read. No library should uphold to the needs of a minority about an 'offensive' book just because they say it's inappropriate. Who are we to judge what's good for everyone and what's not? Books are written for a reason, and that's to share the ideas of the author, not to corrupt society with their 'evil' and 'offensive' ideas that could potentially cause a child to rebel. That excuse is ridiculous. A parent should've taught their child to differentiate between right and wrong, and if they use the 'child will become a rebel if they read this!' excuse, then they're not confident in their child's capability, or the fact that they taught their child well.   Also, it's not just the readers getting angry, it's the author. How bad would someone feel if they spent a year or two on a fantastic book, just to have it banned from library after library? Probably angry or upset. Authors have the right to write whatever they want. If they wish to talk about dragons and princesses, so be it. If they want to discuss why we see a full moon when we do? Go right ahead. No one can stop great books from being made and they certainly shouldn't be able to stop people from reading it. If someone is offended by a book, then don't read it, simple as that.   Parents like to protect their children from harm's way and bring them up as fine citizens of society. By having this desire, the parents do every little thing to make sure their son or daughter doesn't see, hear, or read anything inappropriate or 'bad'. This is just ridiculous. Controlling a child's life will just cause them to rebel more and more as they get older. Let children have a choice in what book they read, or the movie they watch. Parents need to teach their children right from wrong, and in doing so, letting them see, hear, or read whatever they want should be no problem.   Without books, movies, and music, what would the world be like today? No one knows. Books are a great source of information, letting the author express themself as well. Movies are almost just as harmless, limits are needed, but overall? There should be no problem. Also, music allows the artist to bring out their side of creativity and emotion. Allowing that music, or movie, or book to be made, and then take it away is ridiculous. If it offends someone, then that person should just forget it, instead of taking it away from the people who love it and the person who made it.   In conclusion, the freedom to choose what to read, watch, or listen to is a fundamental right that should not be compromised. It is essential to respect the creative expression of authors, filmmakers, and musicians, and not let personal opinions dictate what others can access. Let individuals make their own choices and exercise their own judgment when it comes to consuming media, rather than imposing restrictions based on subjective views of offensiveness.
686	3663	2	3	I don't believe in censorship when it comes to books and music. Just because one person finds something offensive doesn't mean it should be removed for everyone else. People have different opinions and what one person may find offensive, another may not. Music is often the target of censorship, but I think this is detrimental to the art form. It's an artist's way of expressing themselves, and if someone doesn't like it, they can simply choose not to listen. The same goes for books; they are a writer's expression and should be allowed to exist without censorship. It's important to respect different perspectives and allow for freedom of expression in all forms of art.
687	3664	2	3	To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3: I am writing to express my concerns about censorship in libraries. I believe that offensive books and materials should be removed from shelves to create a safe and harmonious environment for all visitors. Everyone has different values and beliefs, and the presence of offensive content can lead to conflicts and disagreements. By eliminating these materials, we can promote respect and responsible behavior, especially for children who are influenced by their parents' actions. Ultimately, creating a world without offensive books will contribute to a more peaceful and positive society.
688	3665	2	3	Removal of Books  If there is a book that someone finds offensive, should every book similar to that book be taken off shelves? No, even though people may find things in books offensive, they should not be removed from shelves.  When I was in the sixth grade, my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I searched the whole library for the book, then finally decided to ask for help, only to find that the book was no longer allowed in elementary schools due to parents finding it offensive. After many reports, the book was taken out of the library. I had to go to a public library to get the book to complete my assignment.  If you find a book offensive, keep it to yourself and don't read the book. They should not be able to remove books just because of what people think of them. Many people love different types of books, whether they are offensive or not.  Everyone has the right to read anything they want, as books are made to be read and explored. If books are taken away, fewer books will be read. The more books are read and understood, the more books will be written and published.  This also applies to music, movies, magazines, etc. They are all created for a reason and should be explored. It is great to learn about different things by reading, listening, reviewing, etc., even if some may find them offensive, as they can teach valuable lessons.
689	3666	2	3	Going to the library you would think of it as a family environment, wouldn't you? I know that when I think of the library I do not think of offensive material that would make anyone upset. Surprisingly, many libraries do have such material, and I do not think that they should be allowed to, since they are not just aimed at adults. Children love to go to the library to check out books and many other things that they enjoy, but a five-year-old does not need to see a movie, a book, or anything else that discriminates against another gender or race. These materials should not be allowed to sit on the shelves no matter what the writers say if they are putting someone down. The writers or library owners wouldn't let their own children read it, so why should it be okay for someone else's child to read or watch it? I'm not the only one who thinks this; I am sure that there are millions of people like me who would not appreciate their loved ones finding and reading these things.  The information that young ones see or hear while they are still young will carry on with them throughout their life; who knows what they will do or think when they are old enough. These places are supposed to be family-friendly where you can go to get information, not for someone to pick up on violence, drugs, racism, and other derogatory subjects. Young kids are not the only ones who should not be exposed to these corrupted materials; teenagers and adults are more likely to understand them better and take the subjects into account.  I am urging these library owners to please remove these offensive materials from their branches; not only because small children could see them, but also because adults do not need to be exposed to these things either. If you would not want your child to, why would anyone else want their child to? Let's keep our libraries safe and welcoming for all ages.
690	3667	2	3	Why should they take them off the shelves? If you ask me, I think they should leave controversial materials up there. Not only is censorship happening in libraries, but it is also occurring on television. Everything in the library might not offend everyone. Some people may find certain materials offensive due to their religion, culture, or nationality. However, just because something offends one person does not mean it will offend everyone. It is important to consider the diverse perspectives of library users. Instead of trying to remove materials that offend us, we should remember that others may appreciate and value those same materials. Everyone has the right to access a variety of materials, and we should respect that right. In the end, it is essential to prioritize inclusivity and diversity in library collections.
691	3668	2	3	Libraries are great for multiple reasons. A library is the place to go if you need to do research, meet with a tudor, find an interesting book to read, find that one song you've been looking for, or pick out a new movie to rent for tonight. However within a library there are limits toward what they offer and what you can get. Censorship in libraries is a topic that comes up every now and then, and people will debate over whether they think censorship is a good or bad thing to have. Personally, I think that censorship can just be more unconvienient for some. For example, when I was in the ninth grade I was assigned to do a research paper over @ORGANIZATION1's. However this topic turned out to be a challenge to research because the libraries I went to did not offer many books or resources over @ORGANIZATION1's because it is seen as an 'inapropriate' or 'offensive' topic. Also, the librarians wouldn'@CAPS1 let me check out some of the books because of my age. Since they thought that I was too young to be reading that information, they weren'@CAPS1 going to let me proceed with my research. I think that if it's something going on in the world we live in, then it might as well be available for the public to access. If there are people who wish to not see or hear about certain topics, then they can take it upon themsleves to avoid it. Rather than just getting rid of it all together. The same goes for any form of media. If there is a @CAPS1.V. show that you don'@CAPS1 like, don'@CAPS1 watch it. If there is a song that you dislike, then don'@CAPS1 listen to it. It is that easy. I know I do it all the time. People need to take it upon themselves and understand what they can and cannot handle, and then apply that to their daily lives. When it comes to children, and censoring certain topics from them, I think that it is up to the guardians of the child to determine what is @CAPS2.K. and not @CAPS2.K. for them to see or hear. Then it is the responsibility of the guardians to make sure that their rules, or guidlines, are set and the child understands what they are. In conclusion, I think the purpose of a library is to offer information. Any information. Then people go to that library to find the information that they are looking for, with the wide selection the library has to offer. I think that libraries should'nt have to feel responsible for censoring items that @MONTH1 be offensive. It is their job to just offer information.
692	3669	2	3	I do not think books should be censored from library shelves. Removing books that some people find offensive can actually help others see the errors in their ways and learn important life lessons. Music, as a form of freedom of speech, can also be misunderstood, but cutting down on artistic expression can hinder growth and understanding. It is important to embrace diverse perspectives and allow for the exploration of different ideas, even if they may be controversial. By keeping books uncensored, we can continue to learn, grow, and shape a better future for ourselves and others.
693	3670	2	3	Libraries are places where individuals should have the freedom to choose any book they desire without facing any restrictions. Every person has the right to access the books they want to read, and there should not be any barriers preventing people from exploring a wide range of literature. It is essential to uphold the principle of unrestricted access to books in order to encourage a culture of reading. Therefore, it is important that libraries do not limit individuals by taking books off the shelves arbitrarily.
694	3671	2	3	Should books, movies, magazines etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. No, because all you have to do is ignore it or not pay any attention to it and it shouldn't bother you that much. Most people might look at something and think it is interesting like something that happened on the news lately and was published on newspapers or put on the internet. For example, the @LOCATION1 story, that has been on the news for the past week, people think that it is awesome that he is was finally found and killed. If people found that offensive that might be because they don't know what he did or wasn't around when it happened.     If they took down stuff that was offensive then we would have nothing interesting to read. If someone found a movie that was racist the don't get it, just put it back and find something else like a romance or a comedy. Everybody could use a laugh every once and a while. For music if your friend recommends something to you, check it out on the internet first to see if it is any good, if not then tell them no and that you find it offensive. If they were a true friend then they would understand and perhaps make it up to you with something else.      Magazines, from what I know don't really have anything offensive in them. The only thing the have a some pictures, gossip, facts, and some stories that might peak your interest. Books might have something things that you find offensive but, if you like the book so much you might as well finish it. If you found a book that you really like then read through it a bit or check it out on the internet to see what is about. Out of all the books I have read, I have found none of them offensive they were all good books, books that i would probably read again if I wanted to, but I won't, because I'm lazy.      Newspapers are interesting to read and might have little to none offensive remarks in them. Some might pertain to blacks or mexicans, something like that. Well I haven't read any like that yet but, I have heard somethings about it. In the newspapers there might be little comics or gags that would probably be more offensive than anything in the newspapers. I think that if you find something offensive then just ignore it and move on to something else instead of throwing a fit about it because that wouldn't do well at all.
695	3672	2	3	There are so many things these days that people find offensive, in various forms of media such as magazines, books, movies, and the internet. Some individuals believe that they should have the right to remove these offensive materials from public access. One major concern for parents is the potential impact on their children if they were to come across such content. However, it is important for parents to monitor their children's exposure to these materials and have open discussions with them if they do encounter something inappropriate.  If everyone had the ability to remove content they found offensive, there would be little left for people to read, listen to, or watch. What one person finds enjoyable, another may find deeply offensive, leading to conflicts within communities. Furthermore, sheltering children from all controversial content could give them a false sense of the world being easy and problem-free. It is essential for children to learn about the complexities of the world through positive role models who can help them navigate media influences.  Allowing individuals to censor content based on personal offense could result in increased crime due to heightened anger, a lack of diverse media options, and confused children unsure of how to interpret the world around them. Instead of censoring, it is more effective to educate and guide individuals, especially children, on how to critically engage with media. By promoting understanding and critical thinking, we can create a more informed and responsible society.
696	3673	2	3	At my point of view, I believe that if someone finds a particular material offensive, they should simply choose not to engage with it. It is unfair to restrict access to books, music, movies, magazines, or any other form of media just because one person finds it offensive. There are likely many others who would like to enjoy that material.   If something is offensive to multiple people, it should not be immediately banned. Instead, there should be a discussion or a vote to address the issue. It is important to consider the feelings and perspectives of everyone involved before making a decision that affects a larger group of people.   For example, if my family couldn't decide on a place to eat and one person didn't want pizza, we wouldn't go out to eat that night. It wouldn't be fair to make a decision based on the preferences of just one person when there are others to consider.   In conclusion, it is crucial to consider the broader impact before removing or restricting access to something just because one person finds it offensive. We must think about the rights and interests of everyone involved, and respect the efforts of creators who put their hard work into their craft.
697	3674	2	3	The content of a library should be full of various material even if one may find certain materials offensive. Just because someone may think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgetting it altogether? Some subjects may be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ignore them.  One subject that may be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases. You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, too uncomfortable to be seen in the area. It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't affect you.  Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history. Some history may be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forget about them. The Holocaust, for example, was a very dark period in history. Over six million people died because just one person didn't like what they believed in. It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is. We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening.  People's likes in music vary. There are so many different types and styles of music. Some music may be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library? The library should always have a large variety of different music. Often people would like to widen their music intellect, and the library is the perfect place to do that.  Everyone is different. We never all like the same thing. Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information. If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library, they would most likely find another way to get that information. Having a variety in books, music, movies, and magazines makes the library a place to learn new things, no matter the subject. In conclusion, it is important to have a diverse range of materials in the library to ensure that individuals have the opportunity to learn and grow, even if they may find certain topics uncomfortable or offensive.
698	3675	2	3	Your watching a movie on tv that you and your friend have seen in theatres. You both love the movie and just as it gets close to the best part, the tv skips over that part because people think that that scene is inappropriate. Censorship is good, but sometimes it is too strict when it comes to movies, music, and books.  Some of the movies that are popular will end up on tv for the viewers' entertainment, and some movies have scenes that are a little inappropriate. Even though it's not that offensive, the tv companies will cut that scene out of it. Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say. Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love. The tv companies even censor historical movies. If it's a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story.  Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often. With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it. I don't think music should be censored just for little kids. If the parents don't want their children to hear those words, they shouldn't let their children listen to that kind of music.  Books tend to be censored and even banned at schools. Not too many children read books anymore so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want because reading helps the mind. Some schools banned books because of inappropriate language. That is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of language. Also, some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime. Some books are just too good to be banned.  A lot of things seem to be censored in this world. We should have censorship, but it shouldn't be so strict when it comes to movies, music, and books. At the end of the day, censorship should aim to protect without overly restricting artistic expression and the freedom of choice for consumers.
699	3676	2	3	The library is a valuable resource for individuals seeking a wide range of materials, from research papers to movies and books. While some may argue that certain materials are inappropriate for certain audiences, it is important to consider the educational value and personal choice involved. Censoring materials can limit access to important information and diverse perspectives. Instead of removing books or movies from library shelves, age-appropriate labels can be used to guide readers. Ultimately, individuals should have the freedom to choose what they read, allowing for personal growth and exploration.
700	3677	2	3	There are thousands of books in libraries, some of which may be deemed inappropriate by certain individuals. However, all books serve a purpose in libraries, whether they are offensive or not. Books provide us with valuable knowledge about the past, help us expand our imagination through fiction, and ultimately make us more intelligent individuals.  Books that may be considered offensive, such as those discussing controversial topics, still have a purpose in educating us about historical events and preventing us from repeating past mistakes. Fiction books, on the other hand, play a crucial role in stimulating our creativity and empathy by allowing us to relate to the struggles of fictional characters.  Furthermore, all books contribute to our intellectual growth by offering a wealth of information on various subjects. Even books that some may find offensive can be essential in shaping the knowledge and skills of future professionals, such as doctors who need access to diverse perspectives to better understand their patients.  In conclusion, while opinions on what constitutes offensive material may vary, removing books from shelves simply because they are not suited for everyone is not the solution. Instead, we should embrace the diversity of literature and respect the freedom of individuals to choose what they want to read. By allowing all books to remain accessible in libraries, we ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow intellectually.
701	3678	2	3	No, I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. If you are reading, listening, or watching any of these things, then simply avoid the parts that offend you. It is your choice to engage with the content, so if something offends you, you can easily set it aside and move on. Removing such materials takes away the enjoyment and entertainment for those who do not find them offensive. It is important to consider the impact of censoring these forms of media on the freedom of expression and access to diverse perspectives. Let us preserve the variety of content available for all individuals to enjoy.
702	3679	2	3	Libraries should not remove books simply because they are deemed offensive. While some may find certain books to be offensive, it is important to remember that everyone has different tastes and perspectives. What one person finds offensive, another may find enlightening or thought-provoking. It is not fair to censor literature based on individual opinions. Just as we have the freedom to choose what movies we watch or music we listen to, we should also have the freedom to choose what books we read. If a book is offensive to someone, they can simply choose not to read it rather than trying to have it removed for everyone else. It is important to respect the diversity of opinions and perspectives that exist in the world, and banning books is not the solution to addressing offensive content. Let books remain on library shelves for those who may find value in them, while allowing others to make their own choices about what they read.
703	3680	2	3	I will be talking about, do think books, music, or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. In my opinion I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to some people. Because not all people have the same interests.  First of all I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves because people don't like the items because they get offended. But the people who like the item say like an explicit movie they would probably buy it. But also the people who don't the explicit movie would get offended and would want it off the shelves.  Another example can be a book. What if a person didn't like what he/she read and gets offended. They would return the book and would not want to sell anymore and wouldn't mention it to a friend. But another person comes along and picks the same book and did like what he/she did read and that person would probably recommend it to a friend.  The same way goes for a magazine also. What if a person gets offended at an advertisement. A person likes it and returns it, then comes along another person who gets offended at it and doesn't like it it shouldn't stop selling for that particular person.  In conclusion I think things in the library shouldn't stop selling because one person gets offended at it. They shouldn't have looked at the item in the first place.
704	3681	2	3	Books and magazines are valuable sources of information that provide insights into the past, present, and future. They offer a diverse range of content, including both positive and negative aspects of life. While some may argue against exposing children to certain topics, it is important to acknowledge that they will eventually encounter such information as they grow older. Schools play a crucial role in educating children about historical events, wars, and other important subjects that shape our world. Removing books from shelves would hinder access to valuable knowledge that authors have worked hard to share. It is essential to respect the effort and time put into creating these resources and to consider the implications of restricting access to information. Ultimately, books and magazines are essential tools for learning and understanding the world around us.
705	3682	2	3	For as long as people can remember books have been banned for various reasons. Whether it be a time of war or a religious restriction, it is always viewed as a negative thing and therefore should be no different today. Though it may be a bit less extreme, books or content such as movies, music, or magazines should not be removed from library shelves based on someone else's opinion. It is a right to be able to obtain the information these materials offer. No material should ever be removed from a public library based on censorship.  Some may argue that certain material can be offensive to other groups of people, but who is it to judge how another feels. Material is written or made to show the feelings of the author and how they want their feelings or knowledge portrayed. The author is merely taking advantage of their freedom of speech. It is at the responsibility of the public to how they use the information they receive. It is still a piece of history and was recorded for a reason.  Religion is always a hot point when it comes to censorship, but is that not in our constitution. Freedom of religion includes how we interpret and study our religions. Most have holy books and writings. Many express their religion by means of music and culture. It is a right for the public to be able to access this material.  There are some rare situations when restrictions may need to be upheld but merely based on age. This however doesn't restrict the public, but offers parents the right to censor what information their children are able to get ahold of. An age limit on specific types of material could be added in the cases of sexual content, vulgar images, or disturbing content unsuitable for children. This way information is never censored completely.  It is never right to tell people what they can or cannot know. It is a part of the very structure of our country to allow all information to be shared freely. Censorship of these materials is not and never will be the answer. Although, age restrictions may be an answer for younger citizens these materials aren't taken away from the public. Whatever it may be called, book banning or censorship, it is a negative thing and should not be a part of our public library systems.
706	3683	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries? People think that there should be and some think it shouldn't matter. I think there shouldn't be because maybe some people like those books. I have three reasons why there shouldn't be censorship. My reasons are first people like certain books and should be able to get whatever they want. Second, the libraries should be able to put whatever they want on the shelves. Third, if you don't like what the books say then don't get the book.   Libraries have many books for you to choose from and you can pick which book you want to check out. Libraries don't need to censor their books because some people might want books like that. Everybody has their own preference on the kinds of books and music that they like. Censorship wouldn't allow them to get what they want which would make them mad. There are all kinds of genres of books and music around, some have more strong language in them than other genres. Some people like their music uncensored and should be able to get it. Libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who buy the books and music not you.   Libraries have the freedom to get whatever books they want and put them on shelves. If you don't like what certain books or music say then go get something you do like. There is no rule that says you have to get a certain kind of music. Some people like the music genre called rap which does have some strong language in it but it's your choice to listen to it. The stores just put the products on the shelf to make money not to get you angry about what the products say. There are sections on the shelves that say what genre they are.   People that want to say something about what the language is like in the book should not have checked it out. You have the right to ask what certain music, books, or movies are like, and movies have ratings on the case. Music and movies have ratings which tell you how strong the language is on the cases. People can not say to monitor that when it tells you everything that's in the movie or CD. The libraries and stores usually mark the sections on what genre they are. That can tell you where the uncensored parts are. You can stay away from those sections if you find them offensive.   The libraries should not have to censor their books and entertainment store should not need to censor all the music and movies. It's your choice what to get not theirs. People can stay away from those areas that they find offensive. Everybody should be able to get what they want even if it might offend others.
707	3684	2	3	Have you ever watched a movie that had some scenes you didn't want your kids to watch with you? What are you supposed to do when this problem happens time and time again? Do you just tell your kids to close their eyes and cover their ears? Well, I honestly think that shouldn't ever have to happen to you.   I think that you as a parent or adult should be warned about certain behaviors during a movie that you do not approve your child of watching, even if it is with you. It's just flat out wrong, I would say. So, I say that we should get some kind of extra warning that these inappropriate behaviors are showing up in movies. Parents should be able to know what their kids are about to watch is okay for their age and whatnot.   So to wrap this all up nice and sweet, just make some kind of label that says that there might be things in the movies or whatever item such as books and magazines also, that there might be things that a parent will find inappropriate for a child to watch or read. If the people that make these products do this, it will be much easier for parents to do the right thing for their children.
708	3685	2	3	I believe that libraries should stick to their traditional purpose of housing books rather than expanding to include movies and music. Introducing movies and music could potentially overshadow the importance of books and lead to a decline in reading habits. Books are a timeless and valuable form of expression that should be preserved in libraries. Movies and music have their place in theaters and stores, and introducing them into libraries may dilute the significance of literature. It is important to maintain the integrity of libraries as a place for books and literary works, without allowing other forms of media to overshadow their importance. Let's keep libraries focused on books, the cornerstone of knowledge and imagination.
709	3686	2	3	Censorship is a topic that sparks debate on whether it is beneficial or harmful. One argument against censorship is that it can easily offend people, as individuals have varying levels of tolerance. While some may find humor in controversial content like political cartoons, others may feel hurt or upset by it. However, it is suggested that if something offends someone, they can simply choose not to engage with it.   On the other hand, there are instances where censorship may be necessary to prevent content from crossing a line. Some books and movies contain extremely offensive material that can be harmful or inappropriate for certain audiences. Establishing clear boundaries and regulations on what can be published or shared is essential to protect vulnerable individuals from being exposed to harmful content.  In conclusion, finding a balance between freedom of expression and protecting individuals from offensive or harmful material is crucial. Collaborative efforts to establish guidelines and standards for censorship can help ensure that content remains respectful and suitable for all audiences.
710	3687	2	3	Books, movies, music, and other forms of entertainment play a significant role in our lives. While there may be concerns about certain content being inappropriate for certain age groups, banning them altogether is not the solution. It is important for individuals to be mindful of what they consume and for parents to monitor their children's exposure to various materials. Rather than imposing bans, we should focus on responsible consumption and supervision. Everyone has different preferences and sensitivities, so it is crucial to approach these forms of media with discretion. By being vigilant and making informed choices, we can enjoy a diverse range of content without the need for blanket bans. Let us embrace the variety of entertainment options available to us while exercising caution and respect for differing preferences.
711	3688	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic that sparks debate, especially when it comes to children's exposure to explicit content in books. While some argue that censorship is necessary to protect young minds, others believe that it restricts access to valuable information and stifles learning opportunities.   It is important to consider the impact of censorship on children's education. By limiting the availability of certain books, students may struggle to find resources for school projects and research. This could hinder their academic growth and curiosity about different subjects.   On the other hand, parents have valid concerns about the influence of inappropriate content on their children. However, it is essential for parents to have open conversations with their kids about the books they choose to read and guide them towards age-appropriate material.   Furthermore, if authors start removing their books from libraries due to censorship, it sets a dangerous precedent that could lead to a lack of diverse reading options for all individuals. Books are a vital tool for learning and should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their content.  In conclusion, while censorship in libraries may have its place in certain circumstances, it is crucial to strike a balance between protecting young readers and preserving access to educational resources. Parents, educators, and librarians should work together to ensure that children have the opportunity to explore a wide range of literature while also being mindful of age-appropriate content.
712	3689	2	3	NO, I do not think that books, music, magazines, and other forms of media should be removed from shelves if found offensive. These resources play a crucial role in our lives, offering a wide range of benefits.  Books, for example, help expand our knowledge and understanding of the world. They enhance vocabulary, improve focus, and stimulate critical thinking. When we encounter unfamiliar words or concepts, we are encouraged to explore and learn more, leading to personal growth and development.  Music serves as a powerful tool for relaxation and creativity. It can help us unwind after a long day and inspire us to express ourselves through various art forms like dance, singing, or painting. The soothing effects of music can provide much-needed stress relief and emotional support.  Magazines are valuable sources of information on a variety of topics, from recipes to fashion to current events. They offer practical guidance and inspiration, allowing us to explore new interests and make informed decisions. Whether seeking a new recipe or comparing prices on products, magazines provide a wealth of resources at our fingertips.  In conclusion, books, music, magazines, and other forms of media are essential in enriching our lives and expanding our horizons. Instead of censoring or removing offensive content, we should embrace the diversity of perspectives and ideas that these resources offer. Let us continue to explore, learn, and grow through the valuable resources available to us.
713	3690	2	3	There are always going to be people who don't like certain books, music, movies, or other forms of media. However, this diversity in opinions is what makes our world interesting. It's important to remember that just because someone doesn't like a particular book, it doesn't mean that others won't enjoy it. People have different tastes and preferences, and that's perfectly okay.  While freedom of speech is important, there should still be a line that writers and creators should be mindful not to cross. It's essential to exercise judgment and sensitivity when discussing certain topics or sharing personal stories. Respect for others' feelings and experiences is crucial in creating a harmonious society.  Ultimately, it's essential to have open discussions and listen to different perspectives. Instead of getting upset over differing opinions, it's crucial to engage in constructive dialogue and learn from each other. Embracing diversity and respecting individual viewpoints can lead to a more inclusive and understanding community.
714	3691	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic that raises concerns about freedom of expression and the impact on authors. While censorship may seem like a way to protect children and sensitive audiences, it can lead to the removal of valuable literary works from shelves worldwide. Different individuals have varying thresholds for what they find offensive, making it difficult to establish universal guidelines for censorship. Instead of outright banning books, libraries could consider segregating potentially objectionable materials into separate sections. This would allow patrons to access a wide range of content while also addressing concerns about offensive material. Authors who have their works censored may experience financial losses and feelings of injustice, as they invest significant time and effort into their creations. Ultimately, censorship in libraries is a flawed approach that undermines the principles of intellectual freedom and diversity of thought. Libraries should strive to promote open access to information and ideas, rather than restricting access based on subjective criteria. In conclusion, censorship should not be enforced in libraries, as it stifles creativity, limits access to diverse perspectives, and infringes upon the rights of authors and readers alike.
715	3692	2	3	Have you ever encountered someone with eccentric beliefs, sharing unique or unconventional theories? Each individual has their own perspective, and while it's acceptable to hold differing opinions, it's essential to seek understanding. I believe that while censorship in libraries serves a purpose, it's crucial for people to be open-minded, consider different viewpoints, and strive for mutual comprehension to foster better relationships.   Libraries contain a diverse range of materials, some of which are subject to censorship due to the expression of strong ideas and theories. Freedom of speech allows individuals to share their beliefs, but it's important to ensure that this expression does not harm others. Explicit content, such as movies and music, while regulated by rating systems, can sometimes lack consideration for others' perspectives.  Misinterpretation of others' ideas is a common issue, as people struggle to see things from different angles, leading to conflicts. By embracing a mindset of seeking understanding, conflicts arising from diverse beliefs could be minimized. Different perspectives can offer valuable insights and broaden one's awareness of various opinions.  Stubbornness can hinder the process of seeking understanding, as individuals rigidly adhere to their own beliefs without considering alternative viewpoints. Overcoming stubbornness can lead to increased empathy and awareness of others' feelings. When people are more open-minded, it becomes easier to navigate disagreements and build stronger relationships.  In conclusion, while censorship plays a role in society, the underlying reasons for censorship must be considered thoughtfully. A culture of seeking understanding would enable better discernment in censorship, addressing materials that may cause distress while allowing for the free exchange of ideas. By embracing different perspectives, being open to new viewpoints, and reducing stubbornness, individuals can coexist more harmoniously.
716	3693	2	3	I understand how some people may get offended by certain content they come across in movies, books, or music. However, just because something offends one person doesn't mean it should be removed from public access for everyone else. Ratings and warnings are typically provided to inform consumers of potentially offensive content, allowing them to make informed decisions about what they choose to watch or read. It is important to respect individual preferences and opinions, but it is not fair to restrict access to certain media based on the views of a few. Ultimately, censorship should be approached with caution, and individuals should have the freedom to choose what they consume without interference from others.
717	3694	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, etc. should not be removed if they are found offensive. The library has different sections for different groups like the young or teen section, easy children or picture book section, and adult section. Each section caters to the specific needs and interests of its target audience. The library takes great care to ensure that the content in each section is appropriate for the intended age group. If someone finds something offensive, they can always seek assistance from the library staff. Overall, the library is organized in a way that allows people of all ages to find materials that they enjoy without encountering anything that they find objectionable. It is important to respect the diverse preferences and sensitivities of library patrons while providing a wide range of materials for everyone to enjoy.
718	3695	2	3	"When people think of libraries, they often imagine a quiet and dull place filled with books and strict librarians. However, libraries have evolved to offer much more than just books, now providing access to music, movies, magazines, and other forms of entertainment.   As a child, I didn't appreciate libraries because I found them boring. It wasn't until sixth grade that I discovered the library was actually a cool place with a variety of things to explore. Some traditional library-goers may not appreciate the changes, such as the introduction of music and movies, as they are used to the quiet atmosphere of the past.  In considering how to handle these differing opinions, it reminds me of the book ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" where old traditions clashed with new ideas, much like the situation in libraries today. Instead of banning or removing new additions, it may be more productive to have discussions and find a compromise. By creating designated sections for new ideas, we can accommodate all library visitors and ensure that everyone feels welcome and respected."
719	3696	2	3	Everywhere one goes, something is being kept from them. It is either to keep them safe, pure, or happy. In the everyday world people who break the law are put into jails and prisons. Not only is it a punishment for them, but it is also to keep them away from other people. This is much like how our libraries are becoming. Books that have questionable content are being thrown out.  I do not believe that this should be done. Books are here to enlighten people and let them experience something they never would have been able to on their own. People should be able to choose what they read and if it offends them they can choose by themselves to stop reading that book. Many times I have learned new things from books that may not have been appropriate for my age, but it taught me a valuable lesson. For example, I read a book about a teenage girl engaging in sexual relations, she became pregnant and it ruined her life. From this, at the age of ten years old, I learned that I do not want that to happen to me, so I am abstaining from adult relations until I am married.  Of course the libraries should be separated into different categories such as: Children's, Young Adult, Adult, and Read at Your Own Risk. Also, the same with magazines and music. That way, a person could go to a specific section and know what to expect from there. This is much like the movie ratings, a mother can pick up a movie and see that it is rated PG and know that it is acceptable for her nine-year old to watch, except possibly save for a few curse words, but a child hears that in their everyday life anyways, whether the parent knows it or not.  In conclusion, I believe that literature should not be censored from the people. However, it should be categorized so a person could have an idea of what age group it would be most appropriate for. People have the right to choose what books they read and what they learn about. Everyone can learn a valuable lesson from any book, it just depends on how they interpret it.
720	3697	2	3	I believe that children should not be sheltered from offensive materials, as they need to understand the complexities of the world they live in, both positive and negative. It is essential for them to learn about the good and the bad aspects of life at a young age, so they can make informed decisions as they grow older. While there should be age-appropriate limits in place, children should be exposed to a variety of information to develop a well-rounded understanding of the world. It is crucial for children to learn about the existence of bad people, the importance of making good choices, and the difference between reality and fiction. They should also be taught to critically analyze media messages and not succumb to peer pressure. By equipping children with the knowledge and skills to navigate challenging situations, they will be better prepared to make responsible decisions and handle the complexities of the world around them.
721	3698	2	3	In @DATE1, there are many rap/hip-hop artists who sing about gangs, narcotics, alcohol, and using women for favors. This content is not suitable for young children, as they may end up learning inappropriate things at a young age. Parents play a crucial role in monitoring what their children are exposed to, including the music they listen to and the magazines they read. While it's important for children to understand the world around them, there is a limit to how much exposure is appropriate. Alternative genres like country music can offer a more peaceful and positive listening experience for kids. Additionally, movies and online content should be carefully monitored, as children can easily come across inappropriate material. Overall, it is essential for parents to be vigilant and mindful of the media their children consume to ensure they are not exposed to harmful content at a young age. Thank you for considering these viewpoints.
722	3699	2	3	My views on censorship are clear - I do not believe in any form of censorship. Books, music, and movies should not be censored. It should be the responsibility of parents to decide what their children can and cannot read, watch, or listen to. Removing these materials from shelves is unfair to those who wish to access them, as well as to the creators of these works.  People should have the freedom to express themselves in any way they see fit, even if others may not agree with or enjoy what is being said. Ultimately, it is the right of the individual to share their thoughts and ideas without fear of censorship.
723	3700	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Although I understand her message, I don't completely agree with it. I believe most things such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be censored in some cases.  One reason why I think there should be censorship is because of minors that might want to see things that may not be suitable for them. Children often mimic what they see, and not all adult content is appropriate for young eyes. That's why I believe that the media should be censored to protect children from negative influences.  Another reason for censorship is the prevalence of explicit content in today's media. Violence, disrespect, and profanity are often glorified, leading to a negative impact on society. By censoring these materials, we can promote a more positive and respectful environment for everyone.  In addition, censorship is necessary to maintain societal values and standards. Allowing inappropriate content to be easily accessible in public spaces like libraries can have a detrimental effect on our culture. By censoring materials, we can uphold decency and respect in our communities.  In conclusion, I believe that censorship is important in ensuring that our media promotes positive values and influences. By monitoring and restricting certain content, we can create a more wholesome and respectful society for all.
724	3701	2	3	Censorship is a controversial topic, especially when it comes to materials found in libraries. Some people may find certain books, magazines, movies, or music offensive and believe they should be removed. However, removing these materials can also upset those who find them valuable for research or entertainment.   Historical readings, for example, may contain content that is considered inappropriate by today's standards, but they also provide valuable insights into the past. Similarly, modern music and media may have explicit content that some find offensive, but others enjoy and find relatable.   Ultimately, censorship in libraries can lead to a loss of valuable resources for those who appreciate and benefit from them. It is important to consider the diverse interests and perspectives of library patrons before making decisions about what materials should be available. Finding a balance between protecting individuals from offensive content and preserving access to diverse perspectives is crucial in maintaining the value and relevance of library collections.
725	3702	2	3	"From what I have observed in my life regarding censorship, I believe that materials should not be removed from shelves simply because they are deemed offensive. Libraries should keep such materials on the shelves but perhaps in a separate section to prevent easy access for those who may find them objectionable. It is unfortunate that people are easily offended by even the smallest things, making it difficult for others to enjoy certain content. In my opinion, censorship is ineffective as it often only serves to pique curiosity and make people more eager to seek out the censored material.   I adhere to the belief that censorship should not be enforced based on individual sensitivities. The saying ""sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me"" rings true to me, suggesting that individuals should learn to overlook things that offend them. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and one person's offense should not dictate what others can access. Additionally, censorship may inadvertently shelter individuals, making them ill-prepared for the realities of the world outside where not everything is censored.  In conclusion, I suggest that offensive materials be segregated in libraries and perhaps a rating system, similar to that used in video games, could be implemented to inform individuals of the content they may encounter. This way, those who are offended can avoid such materials while others can access them freely. This approach would ensure that everyone's preferences are considered and respected, promoting a balanced and fair environment for all."
726	3703	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be imposed on books, movies, music, magazines, etc. Authors put their time and effort into expressing their thoughts and ideas, which should not be censored. Everyone has the right to freedom of speech and to share their creations with the world. While some content may be offensive to some, it should not be removed from libraries as there will always be someone who finds value in it. Limiting access to certain materials would deprive people of the opportunity to learn and understand different perspectives. History, even if it includes controversial or offensive events, should not be censored as it serves as a reminder and a lesson for future generations. Overall, freedom of speech should be respected, and censorship should not dictate what materials are available in libraries.
727	3704	2	3	I believe that censorship should not be allowed in libraries. Everyone has the right to free speech, and censoring material takes away that right. People go to libraries to seek knowledge, and censoring information can be harmful to learning and the progress of mankind. While minor adjustments can be made for inappropriate language or graphic material, completely blocking access to media is unnecessary. Libraries should be a place where people can freely access information and expand their understanding of the world. Censorship limits the capacity for learning and growth, which is detrimental to society as a whole. It is important to preserve the freedom of information in libraries to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow.
728	3705	2	3	To me, it is not right to remove music or books because people often express their feelings through them. People should be able to read or sing what they feel without the fear of it being taken away. It is important to respect the talents and passions of others, as taking away what they create can limit their ability to share their thoughts and emotions with the world. Instead of removing music or books, individuals who do not appreciate them can simply choose not to listen or read them and find something else that aligns with their preferences. Removing someone's creative work can have a negative impact on their sense of identity and self-expression, so it is crucial to allow them to share their art with others. In conclusion, it is essential to respect the creativity and individuality of artists and creators by not removing their work, but rather allowing them to express themselves freely.
729	3706	2	3	Turn the other way  When I see a book that I don't particularly care for, I simply put it down. I really don't see the need to do away with all books that may be offensive to a single person or group of people. Any time I look through the library, I come across a few books that are slightly inappropriate. However, when I see these books, I don't make a big deal about it. I just put that book down and continue my search. I couldn't imagine how scarce our book selection would be if we were to rid the libraries of all books that people might find offensive.  Also, there are many people that find The Catcher in the Rye offensive. If we were to remove all controversial text from libraries, then we would have a hard time passing the word of literature to people who do not have access to such material.  Although I do not fully agree with the ideas of many theorists, I do not ask that their work be banned from public libraries. I may not like a particular author's book on evolution, but because of our freedom of speech, they have every right to write about their discoveries and beliefs.  As you can clearly see, I am by no means claiming to be open-minded to others' thoughts or beliefs. However, when it comes to literature and art, I think that a variety makes us unique. If everyone read the same books, listened to the same music, and watched the same movies, then we could have a very boring culture. That is certainly not the basis on which this great country was founded!
730	3707	2	3	Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 are many books, music, and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes.  However, just because a book or song contains an foul word does not mean that the book needs to be sheltered from the public's eyes.  @CAPS2 are many reasons we should not censor public media.  We cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world; plus, in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech; and, finally, if media was censored, people @MONTH1 start to think every little word has an offensive connotation.     If a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley, the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened.  If the world never reported accidents, @CAPS2 would be too much crime and terror.  Sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some wrongdoing in the world today.  Most of the time, I only hear about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a fairytale version of it.  After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people @MONTH1 not oppose slavery as strongly as they do.    Here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech.  We are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way.  We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we should know what is right and wrong.  People should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience.     Also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people @MONTH1 judge almost every little word offensive then.  Then we @MONTH1 have 'no books left on the shelf' according to Katherine Paterson.  Once people are allowed to censure books or other media, they would look for words with negative connotations.  If a word was close to being offensive in one person's perspective, it would be left out.  Then, many words would be gone.     Sure some types of media, especially songs and movies, just spill out nasty themes and foul language.  However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song.  I can always change the radio station if I do not like what I am hearing.  People however, just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth, no matter how bad it is.  We just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring.  If we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need to act.  However, we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror.                                                            Sincerely,                                                              @PERSON2
731	3708	2	3	Everyone enjoys different forms of entertainment such as movies, music, and books, and should have the freedom to access and consume what interests them. Censoring certain materials in libraries can limit people's access to literature and information that they enjoy or need for research. People have diverse interests, and what one person finds entertaining or informative may not appeal to others. Therefore, libraries should cater to a wide range of preferences to ensure that everyone can find something they enjoy. Authors write to entertain and inform their readers, and it is important to respect the diversity of interests by providing a variety of materials for people to explore. By allowing individuals to access a range of content, libraries can better serve their community and promote intellectual freedom and cultural diversity.
732	3709	2	3	When going to a library, one expects it to be a place of positive influence. However, there are instances where offensive and inappropriate material can be found, such as racist books, adult content, and music with explicit language. While some may argue that these materials serve educational or historical purposes, it is important to consider the impact they may have on individuals, especially children.  Parents may be concerned about their children accessing such material, and it raises the question of whether there should be age restrictions or censorship in place at libraries. By limiting access to certain books and music, or creating separate sections for adult content, libraries can better cater to the needs and preferences of their community members.  Ultimately, the decision to implement voting for library materials or introduce censorship measures should be carefully considered to ensure that libraries remain inclusive and welcoming spaces for all individuals. By addressing these concerns, libraries can attract more customers and continue to serve as valuable resources for the community.
733	3710	2	3	"The book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" has been a controversial topic due to its offensive language and graphic content. While some praise the story, others find it inappropriate for high school students. The repetitive offensive language used by the author adds to the discomfort for some readers. Despite its awards and popularity, the offensive nature of the book raises questions about censorship in libraries. It is important to consider the impact of such material on readers and whether it should be available without restrictions. In conclusion, while ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" may have a compelling story, its offensive content warrants a closer examination of censorship in libraries."
734	3711	2	3	I agree and disagree with the prompt. I think that it is good everyone is allowed to take any book off the shelf, listen to any music, watch all types of movies, or read any type of magazine. Then I think it isn't okay.   First, reason for agreeing is because some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. may not be suitable for most young children. They may use profanity, show naked pictures, or talk about things that a child is not yet supposed to be exposed to at that age. Most music and movies these days use bad language or show people engaging in explicit activities. Also, adults may use these materials in a way that could cause many problems within the library. So, it is reasonable to agree that certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if found offensive.  On the other hand, I believe that libraries should leave most of the books, movies, music, or magazines on the shelves for everyone to access. This allows children to be exposed to various content and learn about what is appropriate or inappropriate for their age. It provides them with an opportunity to understand the consequences of certain behaviors or actions if they are exposed to them at a young age. Having a designated section for potentially offensive materials could also be a good compromise.  In conclusion, there are valid points for both sides of the argument. While offensive materials should be handled appropriately, having a diverse range of content available in libraries can help individuals, especially children, learn and grow. Finding a balance between access and censorship is crucial for promoting a healthy and educational environment in libraries.
735	3712	2	3	Hello, I am writing to you today about my concerns regarding censorship in libraries. Firstly, some of the music played in libraries can be quite graphic and inappropriate. Music should be meaningful and uplifting, rather than promoting violence and negativity. It would be beneficial to consider the impact of the music on library patrons.  Secondly, the selection of books in libraries should be carefully curated, especially when it comes to adult content. It may be helpful to have a designated section for adult material to ensure that younger readers are not exposed to inappropriate content.  Next, the magazines featured in libraries should also be age-appropriate. Displaying magazines with explicit content can be unsettling for some library visitors. Creating sections for different age groups could help in providing a more suitable reading environment.  Lastly, the movies available for checkout in libraries should be considered with caution, particularly concerning their suitability for younger audiences. Exposing children to graphic content at a young age can have negative effects on their development. Libraries should be mindful of the impact of the movies they make available to the public.  In conclusion, while everyone should have access to a library, it is essential to consider the impact of the materials available. Libraries should strive to provide a diverse selection of materials while ensuring that they are appropriate for their audience. Making thoughtful selections can help create a more positive and enriching library experience for all patrons.
736	3713	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf..' said by Katherine Paterson. Books are used to entertain and even teach readers in certain aspects of life. Not exactly all books are offensive but some are. Those who are, should be taken off the shelves, especially if it is in a school library. Children could take that offensive or violent book into action. Other children could show the book to other peers. And also, children can get very offended. Now should offensive books be taken off the shelves?  Children nowadays are being motivated a lot. Whether it's through television shows, video games, or even music. On the news, there have been reports about children being influenced to have a gun and hang themselves, etc. Books are meant to entertain readers in a good way and not teach them to become a violent person. Some readers who read such things can turn those words into action. Then the student could be in trouble. And people really wouldn't want that.  Children have a tendency of showing off to friends. If a student sees something offensive or violent in a book, there is a big chance that they will show it to their peers. Just because children think it's cool. Having one person read this could be a problem, now imagine having more than just one, a whole clique seeing this. It could end up in a huge problem, not only for the children and their parents, but also for the school. The children learning these new things from the book can cause the children to use everyday and make it popular. The school can have a bad image from the students. Passing on the information can become a conflict, and people certainly do not want that.  School is not only a teaching building, but also a social place. There are cliques in every school. Within each person, there is a different color, religion, style, and personalities. Children can be easily hurt. If books are being offensive, it can just easily hurt anyone reading that book. Once again, books are meant to entertain readers and not to hurt them. So why even have authors write something offensive in their books? Maybe authors feel the need to add interest in the book and suspense, but not all readers would take it easily. Hurting people isn't a fun thing to do, and people certainly do not want to do that.  So why have offensive books on shelves? These books can cause children to use it in action, to show it off to other peers, and to hurt them as well. Children nowadays have it hard on themselves, why make it harder. Books are meant to entertain readers, why not just do that. So yes, take the offensive books off and there will be no problems.
737	3714	2	3	Yes, I do believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason why I think some things should be removed is because some kids don't need to look at certain things. Parents don't always go with their children to the library and tell them what they can and can't get. At school libraries, they really don't have bad things; they only have school-appropriate things. But the public library has a lot of different things than a school library. Therefore, those are my reasons why I believe certain materials should be removed.
738	3715	2	3	Censorship plays a crucial role in safeguarding the well-being of children in today's society. It is essential for parents to have the ability to regulate what their children are exposed to, whether it be in the form of TV shows, movies, books, or newspapers. Many forms of media contain violence that may not be suitable for young audiences, and it is important to shield them from such content.  Cartoons, for example, often depict violence as a means to resolve conflicts. While children may enjoy watching these shows, it is crucial for parents to explain that the actions portrayed are not acceptable in real life. Similarly, popular book series like Twilight contain violent themes that may not be appropriate for young readers. By monitoring what their children read, parents can ensure that they are not exposed to harmful content.  Furthermore, newspapers frequently report on violent events, which can be disturbing for children. It is essential for parents to limit their children's exposure to such news to prevent them from becoming desensitized to violence or feeling compelled to seek out dangerous situations.  Overall, censorship is necessary to protect the innocence and well-being of children. By monitoring and regulating what their children consume in terms of media, parents can help shape a safe and positive environment for their development.
739	3716	2	3	Libraries should not remove offensive reading material just because some people find it offensive. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to someone else. It is important to remember that offensive material exists everywhere and it is up to individuals to decide what they want to read. Removing offensive material from libraries sets a dangerous precedent of censorship and limits access to diverse perspectives and ideas. It is important to allow for freedom of expression and the opportunity for individuals to make their own choices about what they want to read. Ultimately, it is important to respect the diverse opinions and preferences of others, even if they may differ from our own.
740	3717	2	3	Should books, music, etc; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Well, people have the right to choose what they want to read or listen to. While some may find certain content offensive, it is important to remember that everyone has different opinions and sensitivities. In a diverse society, it is impossible to cater to every individual's preferences. It is essential to respect freedom of expression and allow individuals to make their own choices. If something is offensive to you, it is best to simply avoid it rather than demand its removal. Life is full of challenges and obstacles, and learning to navigate through them is an essential part of personal growth. In the grand scheme of things, focusing on more significant issues and striving for a better world should take precedence over minor disagreements or discomfort. Embracing diversity and differing viewpoints can lead to a more inclusive and tolerant society. In conclusion, while offensive content may exist in various forms, it is crucial to uphold the principle of freedom of expression and encourage open-mindedness and understanding.
741	3718	2	3	If I found a book that offended me, I would have to go and take it off the shelf because if I find a book offensive, I know that others would think the same. I agree that some books can be offensive to some and not to others, and it's really not fair for those who think that way. One reason that I would take it off the shelf would be to keep young children from reading it. Parents don't really want their children reading about violence and murder.  Most of what I would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist against another person or people, people killing others, and engaging in sexual activities. People really shouldn't read things like that because it puts things in their heads and sometimes makes them think the same way as the writer. If children read books about violence and sexual actions, they could think that it's okay to do these things to other people and get into a lot of trouble with the law and their parents. Children really need to be kept away from these kinds of books until they are older and understand what's right and what's wrong. Some books have a lot of cursing in them, and a lot of children pick up on words and start using them more and more until it becomes a habit.  Even though some books are about real people, they should still be taken off the shelves. In some of these books, there is a lot of violence, and children should not be exposed to that kind of book. Books can sometimes be more bad than good. If everybody had their way and could take a book that offended them off the shelf whenever they wanted, then there would be no books left.
742	3719	2	3	If people want to remove books, movies, music, magazines, and other forms of media because they find them offensive, they may do so to prevent negative influences on others. However, it is essential to consider the context in which these works were created and the intended audience. While some content may be deemed inappropriate by certain individuals, it is essential to recognize that censorship can limit access to valuable sources of information and entertainment. It is crucial for parents to be involved in guiding their children's media consumption and to have open discussions about the content they encounter. Ultimately, it is important to find a balance between protecting individuals from harmful material and preserving the freedom of expression that is fundamental to a diverse society.
743	3720	2	3	Books should not be removed from shelves just because they are offensive to some people. Everyone should have the right to read any book they choose in a library. If a book is offensive but can help someone with problems, it should not be taken off the shelf. People may have different reasons for reading offensive books, and it is important to respect their choices. Offensive material should be moved to a separate area in the library rather than being completely removed. It is possible that those who find certain materials offensive may feel guilty about something, and their discomfort should not dictate what others can or cannot read. Ultimately, the decision to remove a book should be based on a consensus of many people finding it offensive, rather than just one individual's opinion.
744	3721	2	3	The belief of certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are offensive, depends on the situation the material is relating to. If one wants to see these type of resources, then he/she must be mature enough to withstand it. It all depends on where the material is at in the library and what situation it's in. If it is in the children's area, I highly suggest that it should be removed from there, since it's clear that a child should not process this type of information. If it's in the teen section, then the person must be mature enough to take this sort of inappropriate matter or just leave it be. In the adult section however, there should be no argument of any sort because it is obvious that the person must be fully mature to take in this sort of material.  One example on why this sort of aspect on whether or not inappropriate material should be removed are the comic books called 'Tales' or 'The Organization'. These type of materials have some from inappropriate to disturbing events in the books, but have been distributed to the teen section. Now from ages 13 years of age usually spend their time there and would likely read this type of information. Some teens would be horrified of looking through these books and others would be fascinated by it. It varies through the people and what type of material they would like to read. It all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in.  Another example on whether or not inappropriate material should be taken out of the shelves is how movies are put in situations. There was once a time, a young lady around her early teens who wanted to check out a type of movie in which she have never saw before. So once she checked it out, she watched it with her parents and saw some uneasy sections during this movie. The person should have thought this through before jumping into the situation. If the person was mature enough to go through this matter, it would have been fine; but she was young still and so it made the matter worse.  Whether or not inappropriate material should be removed from shelves depends on how and where the material is distributed and so it shows that one person can change the difference in the situation.
745	3722	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media have a significant impact on individuals, especially children. Parents are increasingly concerned about the content their children are exposed to, as they want to ensure that it is appropriate and does not have a negative influence. Violent, gory, or sexually explicit material can have detrimental effects on young minds, shaping their behavior, emotions, and overall outlook on life. It is essential to safeguard children from such harmful influences to promote their well-being and development. By being mindful of the media consumed by children, we can help create a safer and more positive environment for them to grow and thrive in.
746	3723	2	3	Newspaper staff and/or whom it may concern, Reading material found in a library is very useful and informative to the world, there is no limit to what could be found on paper. Whether it be offensive or not, having limits to books will only create tension, affect the economy, and will lead to illegal activity, ironically enough, in which offensive books will be written and sold, completely undercover.  In today's world, it would be nearly impossible to pick up a book and factually state that it is not offensive. Almost everyone has some little issue with something in the world today, and because of that, original and unoffensive material are hard to come by. With the stripping of offensive material from libraries, authors will be devastated, not just emotionally, but will be out of a job and will have less income. Because of how virtually impossible it is to write a book that is not offensive, authors will become very frustrated, and most are very passionate about what they do. Also, because almost all reading material is offensive in some way, there will be little to no reading material on the shelves of the world or nation's libraries. This could potentially lead to violent protests that quickly tear down even the most successful of nations. However, physical devastation would not be the only toll paid for the stripping of offensive reading material from libraries.  Books cost money; to make books costs money, to buy books costs money. Paper companies would take a major nose-dive in the market, having almost no clientele. When a major division such as the paper industry falls, it will bring others down as well, and due to the nation's market complexity, almost all major companies rely on paper. This would ruin the economy. Some might say, 'it means that the people of the world will be much more green!' However, the past few centuries when economics and the environment are put on a scale, economics takes the cake by a mile. Obviously, this will do much more harm than good. The people of the world always have a priority. Also, the majority of the people don't enjoy having something taken that they have grown so fond of.  People, in general, want what they can't have. An obvious example would be illegal drugs; the drug market is extremely successful, but it's illegal. If people were to have these currently illegal drugs for their use, being completely legal, chances are that the success of drug marketing will plummet. The opposite situation for books: We have them now, but when they are taken, we will want them even more. People who read tend to be very passionate about literature and very intelligent. All it takes is one group to gain numbers, and have a very talented speaker persuade others to follow in a potentially violent revolt to be given back permission to write and publish alleged 'offensive' books. All other material found in libraries, such as music and movies, being taken away will have the same effects, give or take a few similarities or differences.  Avoiding such problems is easy, keep the books and all other material in a library on the shelves. It will only be problematic to take it all away, especially for being offensive, when there are very few books that the general population will find not offensive. If keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons, let it be organized chaos. This is how people work, and keeping the material on the shelves is how the people are pleased or motivated. Let's strive to maintain access to a diverse range of reading materials to preserve creativity, freedom of expression, and a thriving economy.
747	3724	2	3	Well to begin my Persuasive @CAPS1. THATS @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! How could they!? Dont we have a say in this?.... Well.... WE SHOULD!!!!        This is a little bit about what i think of this letter. I think that if books, movies, music, magazines,or anything else is offensive, then we shouldnt have them in libraries because its not right, and its @CAPS2 cuel, and people shouldn't putting those things there if there insalting to others or mean to them. In my experenice, I have had that happen where I cheaked out a book on something and it turned out very Offensive to me. It was at the @ORGANIZATION1 when I was @NUM1 years old. My parents and I where there for some movie or something, and we were looking at some books that were there, and came across a book called' @CAPS4 in @LOCATION1 ' And it was offensive to me because @CAPS5 was the reglion I was raised in, and they @CAPS2 talked about there feelings on faith, and how they thought of it. And it made me hurt because I go to chruch and read the @CAPS6-I-@CAPS6-@CAPS8-@CAPS9. And i was raised on a type of faith that I know alot about. And if you read that book, it made my question everything i belived.      So to rap up my thoughts and feelings. I think it shouldn't be there for people to read, like i said before. People have other books they can have there instead of one that are offensive poeple. All in all I hope you think about my persuassive letter, and tell them about your thoughts and ideas too.  In conclusion, it is essential to consider the impact of offensive material in libraries. Such content can be hurtful and disrespectful to individuals, undermining their beliefs and values. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize inclusivity and sensitivity when selecting materials for public consumption, ensuring that everyone feels respected and represented.
748	3725	2	3	Hello my name is @PERSON1 one day me and a friend were in the library on @DATE1 @TIME1 looking at some books. Later that day my @CAPS1 and I were at school reading our books she came up to me in the hallway. @CAPS1 said that her book was offensive and she was going to tell somebody about it. So school went by the bell rang it was time to go. When she got home she went and told her parents he parents said that she should go and tell the librarian.  On our walk to the library @CAPS1 and I stopped at the store to get something to drink. While we were there she got a newspaper to read about what was going on at the school when she noticed something about books about how they needed to be taken off the shelf. When we walked in the doors to the library the librarian was sitting at her desk she asked us if we needed any help. @CAPS1 said no but I need to talk to you about a book the librarian said she was way ahead of her. That she had already had complaints about the books and she was taking them off the shelves. And moving them to the back closet.  About a week or so later @CAPS1 and her mother were reading the newspaper about the library. It said that all the offensive books were being taken off the shelves and they were replacing them with newer and better ones. Some people thought it was wrong and they shouldn't do it because one person said it was offensive, but they did it anyway. The library's decision to remove the offensive books sparked debate among the community, highlighting differing opinions on censorship and appropriate reading materials in educational settings.
749	3726	2	3	Censorship in libraries can have a detrimental impact on society as a whole. While the intention behind censorship may be to protect certain individuals from disturbing content, it ultimately limits access to valuable ideas and perspectives that books offer. Authors suffer as their work is censored, and readers are deprived of the opportunity to engage with challenging or thought-provoking material. It is important for individuals to have the freedom to choose what they read, rather than having that choice made for them. By respecting the diversity of opinions and experiences that books represent, we can ensure that libraries remain places of intellectual freedom and exploration. In conclusion, censorship in libraries ultimately hinders rather than helps individuals, and it is essential to uphold the importance of access to diverse and challenging literature.
750	3727	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. People have different tastes and sensitivities, so what may be offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. It is important to respect the freedom of expression and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they read or listen to. Removing offensive materials would limit the diversity of opinions and perspectives available to the public. Therefore, it is best to leave such materials on the shelves and let people decide for themselves whether or not to engage with them.
751	3728	2	3	Society is always grappling with the concept of appropriateness, constantly debating what is acceptable and what is not. This struggle is evident in our daily lives, whether we actively seek it out or not. It often boils down to a clash of opinions, each side trying to prove the other wrong, determining what is permissible and what is not. It is crucial to make a concerted effort to keep inappropriate books away from our shelves and out of the hands of our youth. People are easily influenced, sometimes indirectly, by various forms of media such as television, music, and books. These influences can be positive or negative, shaping individuals based on what they are exposed to and conditioned to believe.  As someone who values the well-being of society, I believe that books with criminal content or explicit material do not contribute to the development of good citizens. Similarly, books with politically incorrect messages are no better than movies with the same detrimental impact. Reading is highly beneficial for mental and social health, allowing individuals to delve into their inner thoughts and emotions in a fast-paced world. However, if someone is consistently exposed to books that go against human nature, it is imperative to remove such literature for the greater good. There are countless books available that are not only engaging and thought-provoking but also have a positive influence on readers.  At @ORGANIZATION1, we are already facing numerous challenges, including financial struggles. It is crucial not to exacerbate our problems by allowing the circulation of obscene books that only serve to incite rebellion against society. Any material that fosters unrest or goes against societal norms should be censored or removed promptly. It is possible to enjoy literature that is both entertaining and enlightening, conveying a positive message at the same time. Let us strive to promote reading material that uplifts and inspires, contributing to a harmonious and enlightened society.
752	3729	2	3	Dear Newspaper,   In libraries, it is unnecessary to remove material that some may find offensive. Everyone has the right to make their own choices, and if something offends you, simply avoid it. What one person finds offensive, another may not, so why should the preferences of one individual dictate what others can access?   If a book or magazine is deemed offensive by one person, they have the option to not read it. People are capable of determining what is suitable for them without external interference. It is important to respect individual choices and not impose personal beliefs on others.   The world would benefit from individuals who can tolerate differing opinions without passing judgment. It is becoming increasingly common for people to overly concern themselves with the actions of others, but it is essential to remember that everyone has the right to pursue what brings them joy.   Ultimately, focus on what makes you happy and do not let the opinions of others dictate your choices. Embrace diversity and respect the autonomy of others when it comes to selecting their preferred music, literature, or any form of media. Live according to your values and let others do the same.   Sincerely,   [Your Name]
753	3730	2	3	Why censor things? Censorship limits access to information and restricts freedom of choice. If we continue to censor books and magazines, we will eventually have nothing left to read. Everyone has the right to choose what they want to read, and censorship takes away that right. It is important to label books for different ages so that parents can control what their children read. However, as adults, we should be able to read, watch, or listen to whatever we want without restrictions. Censorship hinders learning and research, and it is essential to respect individual freedom when it comes to accessing information. Let's embrace diversity in literature and allow people to make their own choices without censorship.
754	3731	2	3	There are many things in this world that children should not see and that poison the minds of people of all ages. The exposure to inappropriate content can have a negative impact on individuals, leading to the corruption of their thoughts and beliefs. It is crucial to protect the innocence of children and ensure that they are shielded from harmful influences.   In today's society, there is an abundance of questionable content that is easily accessible to individuals of all ages. This includes explicit material, violence, and other disturbing images that can have a detrimental effect on one's mental well-being. It is essential to limit exposure to such content and promote a safe and healthy environment for all individuals.  Ultimately, it is up to families to take responsibility for monitoring the content that their children are exposed to. By being proactive in regulating what children see and hear, parents can help protect their innocence and safeguard their mental well-being. It is important to prioritize the well-being of future generations and ensure that they grow up in a positive and nurturing environment.
755	3732	2	3	I believe that some materials should not be on the shelves, but not removed from the library. They should be placed in a separate room to prevent exposure to inappropriate content for certain age groups. For instance, adult books and media should be placed on higher shelves to prevent children from accessing them. Additionally, parents can take an active role in monitoring their children's library selections. Ultimately, maintaining a balance between providing access to diverse materials and ensuring age-appropriate content is key in a public library setting.
756	3733	2	3	There are many kinds of books, music, movies, and magazines in one library. People all over the world have different interests in different subjects. Some people take offense to certain books, songs, movies, magazines, etc., while others do not find them offensive at all. The variety of subjects in a library is huge, and there should never be a book, movie, or item removed just because one person takes offense to it. Removing items based on personal offense would limit people's choices and access to information.   Freedom is important in society, and people should have the right to like whatever they want without fear of censorship. If someone finds something offensive in the library, they can simply avoid it rather than trying to have it removed. In a free society, people have the right to freedom of speech and the freedom to have their own opinions and interests. Therefore, the removal of items from a public library should not be allowed, as it goes against the principles of freedom and diversity. It is essential to preserve the variety of materials available in libraries to ensure that people have access to different perspectives, ideas, and information. Letting individual preferences dictate what is available in a library would only limit the intellectual growth and knowledge of society.
757	3734	2	3	It does not really matter to me, we all have the right to our own likes and dislikes. Some may not think that movies with blood should be allowed, while others may believe that movies with adult content should not be allowed. If we remove one type of content from the market, why not remove them all to avoid arguments about what is suitable to watch. If you do not like something or have young children and do not want them to be exposed to certain content, simply do not buy it. If you do purchase it, ensure it is kept out of reach. In the end, everyone should have the freedom to choose what they want to watch, read, or listen to without imposing their views on others. Let's respect each other's preferences and coexist peacefully.
758	3735	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines can have a negative impact on children and teenagers, influencing them with violence, drugs, alcohol, and other harmful behaviors. Exposure to such content can lead to increased aggression, bullying, peer pressure, and substance abuse among young individuals. It is important to consider the potential consequences of these forms of media and take measures to limit their accessibility to minors. By removing these materials from shelves, we can help create a safer and healthier environment for our youth, reducing the likelihood of them engaging in destructive behaviors and promoting positive influences instead.
759	3736	2	3	How much hurt can someone take from a book, popular music, a movie, or even a magazine, etc.? Well, as shown by studies, individuals often take what these items say more offensively than intended. They may exaggerate or misinterpret the messages being spread, particularly in regards to race and cultural backgrounds. In a diverse society like ours, it is crucial to strive towards acceptance and understanding of different races and ethnicities.  Unfortunately, discrimination and stereotyping still prevail in many aspects of society, including schools where individuals may be judged based on their race. This kind of behavior only perpetuates harmful attitudes and divisions among people. It is important to promote empathy and respect for all individuals, regardless of their cultural background.  While some may argue for the removal of racially charged books, movies, magazines, and music, there is also value in learning about historical events and experiences, such as slavery and the Holocaust. These stories can serve as important educational tools and reminders of the past. However, content that is specifically created to mock or belittle certain races should not be tolerated.  When it comes to music and magazines, the impact on different races may vary. While music often explores themes of love and pain, it should not be a source of discrimination or prejudice. Magazines, on the other hand, can promote positive messages of beauty and diversity.  Ultimately, it is essential to address and challenge racism in all its forms. While it is important to preserve freedom of expression, it is equally important to ensure that such freedom does not come at the expense of others' dignity and respect. By fostering a culture of understanding and inclusivity, we can work towards a more harmonious and accepting society for all.
760	3737	2	3	Should books that are offensive be removed from library shelves? Some books in the library are offensive to some people but should the books be removed from the shelves? I personally don't think the books should be removed. Some people may think the books do need to be removed, but I believe that individuals should have the choice to read or not read certain books.   First off, it is important to consider that what is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. Everyone has different preferences and opinions when it comes to literature. Just because a book may be offensive to one person, it does not mean that it should be removed from the shelves and inaccessible to those who may be interested in reading it.   Furthermore, individuals have the option to simply not read a book if they find it offensive. It is not necessary to remove the book altogether just because it may not align with someone's personal beliefs or values. Everyone has the freedom to choose what they read and what they do not read.  In conclusion, I believe that books should not be removed from library shelves just because they are offensive to some individuals. It is important to respect the diverse opinions and preferences of readers and allow them the freedom to choose what they want to read. Ultimately, the decision to read a book should be left to the individual, and censorship should be avoided in order to preserve intellectual freedom and diversity of thought.
761	3738	2	3	Have you ever read a book you found offensive? Have you ever come across a book you wished no one else would read? Katherine Paterson believes that if one book can be removed from the shelves, then all books are at risk. Books are meant to be read, not censored because of individual preferences. Magazines and movies that are deemed offensive can be placed in separate sections to limit access. It is essential to respect diverse tastes and preferences when it comes to literature, music, and other forms of media. By creating separate sections in libraries for different genres, we can cater to varying interests without compromising artistic freedom. Ultimately, it is crucial to strike a balance between protecting children from inappropriate content and allowing adults to access a wide range of literature and media.
762	3739	2	3	Libraries in @LOCATION1 play a crucial role in providing access to a wide range of books and magazines. However, some individuals may find certain materials offensive and advocate for their removal from the shelves. In my opinion, just because a book or magazine is offensive to some, it does not mean it should be banned or taken off the shelf. Everyone has different tastes and perspectives, and what may be offensive to one person could be enlightening or thought-provoking to another.  Instead of demanding the removal of offensive materials, individuals should simply choose not to read them if they find them objectionable. It is important to consider that the author of the book or magazine may have created the content to resonate with a specific audience, and by removing it, we could be depriving others of the opportunity to connect with the material.  It is essential for people to be more considerate of others' viewpoints and not act selfishly when it comes to the availability of books and magazines in libraries. Diversity in literature allows for a broad range of perspectives and experiences to be shared and appreciated. Therefore, instead of focusing on censorship, we should embrace the variety of materials available and respect the fact that different people have different preferences.  In conclusion, rather than advocating for the removal of offensive books and magazines from library shelves, we should encourage open-mindedness and respect for diverse opinions. By allowing for a variety of perspectives to be shared, we enrich our literary landscape and create a more inclusive environment for all readers. Let's embrace the diversity of literature and promote a culture of understanding and acceptance in our libraries.
763	3740	2	3	"In Libraries there are many books, magazines, music, or movies that may be found offensive to many, but it might be what some people like to read; therefore we must keep all of the materials no matter how crude. These library materials are all part of the world's past and all have a bigger story behind it which has an even bigger story behind it and so on. If we start removing books and everyone removes one then we are going to be left with nothing to learn off of. The world will be less intelligent and we start to forget and lose our past. This is the reason that we must never take any books, movies, music, or magazines off the shelves of a library for it may be special to someone or may be crude to others but in the end they all contain some past that no other book may contain.  A world with no so-called inappropriate books, magazines, music, or movies would be a less crude place but it will be stripping people of knowledge that may be needed. If everyone took a book off the shelf then none would be left. The books would start to lose their love, compassion, and liveliness within them. Other books may contain segregation and segregation is a big part of America's past. The word ""negro"" is offensive for some and if we took all of the books with the word ""negro"" out then we would lose many years of America's past that cannot be forgotten. Documents containing stories of wars, leaders, rising and falling of many empires and kingdoms would all be gone because the violence was too offensive. Many historic moments in the world's history would be lost forever. We cannot get rid of offensive books for the sake of the world's past.  The world would lose too much history in getting rid of offensive books. If the books were put in their own section in the library then kids would not be able to see them causing this to be no problem for young eyes to see. If you find many books offensive then you just should not go to a library because no matter what happens no books are going to be just thrown away for they have history within them. If we start deshelving books then soon movies will be going and then magazines will be limited to only say so much. I believe that if our kids cannot get to the section with offensive books then we will not have to worry about them seeing the offensive materials. If we want to keep all the books and people are still trying to throw away offensive books then we should just have a section where offensive books should be and kids cannot get to. In this is how we could censor books in libraries.  Books, Movies, Magazines, and music are a part of every country in the world today. It is what changes countries and makes them different, it gives them their own culture which we can share with each other. So no matter what we should should never try and take offensive or any kind of book off the shelves of libraries. Censorship may be needed but the offensive materials do not need to be taken off the face of the earth or thrown where no one could ever read it again. All in all we cannot extinguish the flames of our past or we will never have a future."
764	3741	2	3	Censorship in libraries can be a controversial topic, with some individuals believing that it is necessary to protect children from certain materials. While this may have some validity, it is important to remember that even adults can be sensitive to certain content. If objectionable material is present in a library, it may be prudent for the owners to create a designated section for such items.  However, it is crucial to uphold individuals' rights to access a wide range of information in a library setting. By providing a diverse selection of materials, libraries can cater to the varying interests and needs of their patrons. Ultimately, the freedom to explore different perspectives and ideas should be safeguarded within the library environment.
765	3742	2	3	Libraries are a place where anyone can find books to read, on any topic they choose. This is a right that should stay in the reader's hands, and not the library's. Every person can read about whatever topics they please, and those working at libraries should not have an influence on which books people read. Censorship of books is completely unnecessary. If somebody wants to read about a specific topic, then they have the right to. Reading a book that is offensive to the reader is the reader's choice; nobody forced them to read it. Upon finding a book that is offensive, the reader then can make that decision, and not read the book. Though just because this one reader finds this book offensive, does not mean a different person would, and this different person has the right to read this book if they choose. Finding a book offensive is a simply an opinion, and has no factual evidence. So who has the right to say whether a book is offensive or not? Just because somebody running a library believes a book to be offensive or inappropriate, does not mean the book should be taken off the shelf. There is no one person who can say whether or not a book is offensive. Other items such as music, movies, or magazines also should not be censored, though some of them are already. Movies for example, are all rated, and this therefore gives the viewer the choice of what level of movie they would like to watch. The viewer should not expect to check out a rated 'R' movie, and see no material with foul language, violence, or other 'offensive' subjects. By choosing a higher rated movie, the viewer is making their own choice of what they see, and so the librarians should not take it upon themselves to take away these films. It is simply not their responsibility. Music also is rated, and if thought necessary, has a parental warning label, telling the listener that this album has explicit content. Though just as with movies or books, everybody has the right to listen to whichever music they please, and should not have to search at places other than a library, because the librarian thought the music to be inappropriate. Magazines may not be rated, but this does not mean the library should make the executive decision to rate them, and get rid of the ones found to be 'offensive'. As mentioned several times above, it is the reader's choice to view material; not the librarian's. Whether the material is books, music, movies, or magazines, the consumer has the right to read, listen to, or view whatever they please, without the influence of librarians. Each person has their own say of what material they choose to consume, and nobody else has the right to tell them otherwise. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is unnecessary and goes against the fundamental right of individuals to choose what they read, listen to, or watch. Libraries should uphold the principles of freedom of information and allow individuals to make their own choices regarding the material they consume.
766	3743	2	3	Dear Newspaper,  I believe that censorship should not be implemented in libraries. Everyone should have the freedom to read or watch whatever content they choose without fear of censorship. Just because something may offend someone does not mean it should be removed from public access. If we start censoring materials based on individual sensitivities, it sets a dangerous precedent that can limit freedom of speech.  One of the key reasons why censorship should be avoided is the importance of freedom of speech. People should be able to express their thoughts and ideas without the fear of being silenced or censored. By allowing a wide range of materials to be available in libraries, individuals have the opportunity to explore different perspectives and ideas.  Additionally, censorship can have a negative impact on literature. By removing books that may be deemed controversial or offensive, we limit the diversity of ideas and perspectives that are available to readers. This can hinder intellectual growth and creativity, as well as limit the ability of authors to freely express themselves.  Furthermore, censorship can also have financial implications for authors. If their work is censored and removed from libraries, it limits their ability to reach a wider audience and potentially earn a living from their creative endeavors. Authors should have the right to share their work without the fear of it being censored or restricted.  In conclusion, censorship is a detrimental practice that goes against the principles of freedom of speech and can have negative implications for literature and authors. It is important to uphold the right of individuals to access a wide range of materials without censorship.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
767	3744	2	3	I don't think that music, magazines, books, or movies should be removed from the shelf just because some people find them offensive. While it's important for parents to monitor what their children are exposed to, everyone has the right to access information and entertainment. Children should be educated about the world around them, both the good and the bad, so they can distinguish between right and wrong. Even if some content may be controversial, it's essential for people to have the freedom to choose what they want to read or listen to. Restricting access to certain materials will not eliminate them entirely and may even increase curiosity and demand. Ultimately, it's up to individuals to make informed decisions about what they consume, and censorship should not be used as a solution to personal discomfort.
768	3745	2	3	Yes, I believe that books, music, and magazines play a significant role in our lives. Books provide a wealth of information, music brings joy and happiness, and magazines offer insights into the world around us. I have personally experienced the benefits of engaging with these mediums, such as learning new things, improving my language skills, and making new friends. Through dedication and practice, I have been able to enhance my understanding and appreciation of books, music, and magazines. I am grateful for the support and guidance of teachers and friends who have helped me along the way. Overall, these forms of media have enriched my life and continue to shape my experiences.
769	3746	2	3	In the current life we are all living, there is a growing need for privacy. If something is said that we disagree with, there is a tendency to exclude others from it. Throughout history, certain books have been deemed morally wrong by some groups, leading to calls for their removal from society. However, just because a book goes against certain beliefs does not justify completely erasing it from existence.   Books are created with a purpose, providing insights into different perspectives and aspects of human history. While some books may contain graphic content unsuitable for younger audiences, they serve a valuable role in shedding light on important historical events and societal issues. These books offer opportunities for readers to explore different viewpoints and potentially incite positive change in society.  Although there are books with mature themes that may not be suitable for all audiences, it is ultimately the responsibility of parents to monitor and regulate what their children read. Restricting access to certain books could hinder intellectual growth and limit exposure to diverse ideas. Moreover, censoring literature based on subjective moral judgments could infringe upon freedom of speech and hinder societal progress.  While concerns about the potential impact of certain books are valid, imposing restrictions on reading material could lead to censorship and limit the exchange of ideas in a free society. It is essential to allow for open discourse and diverse perspectives, even if they challenge prevailing beliefs. By embracing a variety of viewpoints, society can foster critical thinking and promote a more inclusive and tolerant environment. Ultimately, the benefits of unrestricted access to literature outweigh the risks, as it allows for intellectual growth and the exploration of different ideologies.
770	3747	2	3	I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the library shelves unless they promote racism. People have the choice to access these materials or not, and parents can monitor what their children are exposed to. While some may find certain content offensive, individuals have the option to seek out alternative sources for their reading or viewing preferences. However, if the materials contain racist themes, then they should be removed to prevent the spread of harmful ideologies. Ultimately, the decision on censorship in libraries should consider the impact on society and promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals.
771	3748	2	3	Certain books and magazines should be removed from shelves if found offensive, especially when it comes to children's exposure. Children should be reading material that is appropriate for their age group to avoid any negative impacts on their behavior. Parents have a responsibility to ensure that their children are not exposed to explicit content that could potentially influence them in a harmful way. It is important for libraries and other establishments to also take action in removing inappropriate material for children. Overall, the well-being and development of children should be prioritized by keeping offensive content out of their reach.
772	3749	2	3	If I had the right to remove offensive materials from a library, I wouldn't exercise that right. Everyone should have the freedom to choose what they read, listen to, or view. Parents concerned about their children's exposure to offensive content should take an active role in monitoring and guiding their children's choices. Removing offensive materials would limit access to important historical and artistic works, impacting the education of many. Libraries should remain open and inclusive, allowing individuals to make their own decisions about what they engage with. Allowing access to a variety of materials ensures that everyone can find something that interests and challenges them. In conclusion, censorship in libraries would hinder intellectual freedom and limit opportunities for learning and growth.
773	3750	2	3	Should certain material found to be offensive be removed from the shelves of our library? Many people find material they see in libraries such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., to be offensive; but does that mean that they should be removed? I believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials. To censor libraries would neglect parent responsibilities, destroy our profitable media, and be unconstitutional.  Parents are responsible for their children, not only when it comes to providing food and shelter, but also when their children are viewing inappropriate or offensive material. If you do not want your child to be offended or see vulgar shows, texts, and music, do not let them see it. For instance, if a child is listening to a sexual song on their I-pod take it from them. It is not a right to have the device it is a privelage and parents are aloud to take away privelages.  In addition to neglecting the parent's responsibilities, it would be a gigantic blow to the media economically. Most media is viewed, because of the inappropriate material appearing in their shows, books, and music. If you censor all of that material out less movie tickets will be bought, less books will be sold, and less music will be listened to. In a time of recession, like the one we are currently coming out of it is more beneficial to provide as much income as possible, instead of destroying current oppurtunities for profit.  Both of these points are valid, but most importantly censoring libraries would be unconstitutional. In the preamble we are given rights to the freedom of speech and press. These offensive materials are included in this right. I understand admentments can be added to specify what type of speech and press is appropriate, but how will officers monitor that. Not to mention all the jail space that would be needed for people smuggling inappropriate material to buyers.  In brief censoring libraries is a bad idea in the areas of parent responsibilities, media economics, and our constitutional rights. When negatively effecting all of these areas the consequences are much more influential then the benefits. Obviously censoring is not the answer to offensive material.
774	3751	2	3	Let your mind wander to a place of peace and tranquility. You are in a world of endless possibilities. To each side of you lies a vast collection of diverse adventures and anecdotes. You are in a library where each book holds the key to a door of knowledge and adventure. Looking for an adventure of your own, you drift down each section searching for the one suitable to your liking. Turning the corner, your eyes suddenly glance over to some books and magazines with provocative and inappropriate pictures on them that are blatantly out in the open for anyone to gaze upon. Quickly turning your eyes from the unfortunate meeting of offensive pictures, you race down the hallway to a different section. You think to yourself how unnecessary those images were, now scarred into your mind. In most libraries, you will find anything you are looking for that can be contained within the confines of a book. I believe that because libraries are used by everyone of all different ages, races, and genders, that some censorship should be put into effect.  Some of the content found in libraries should be censored due to a diverse group of people in the world with different views, opinions, and morals. This censorship is narrowed down to just inappropriate images, but religious, political, and cultural innuendo as well. Censorship should be evident in all sections of the library. I do think that certain books should necessarily be removed from the shelf because of violation of rights to speech which includes written speech as well. I do, however, think that they should be sectioned off and clearly marked to warn unwanting eyes and ears of the material found there.  Libraries are one of the number one resources when researching, reading, or gaining information and knowledge. Most everyone has used, uses, or will use a library in their life. This includes children and families. Children do need to be experiencing, learning about, or exposed to some of the content and material found in libraries. I do think the books should be removed from the shelves, but put somewhere else where a child could find it. Children have rapidly developing minds and are sometimes defined by the images that they are exposed to. Something a child sees is more commonly and easily remembered for a longer time than if an adult would see that. This shows that it is good for a child to see such offensive things. Censorship, in regard to moving the books to a new location where a child can stumble upon it, is the best choice.  Another reason that I believe that the books should be removed completely, but rather taken somewhere else in the library, is because that everyone has the right to express their opinions and feelings toward a subject. Also, others have the right to express their opinions toward another's thoughts. Just because you find something offensive doesn't give you the right to take that away from someone. I think that if a person so desires such things and feels the need to read about them, then they have the right and the choice to do that. Although, people who do want to see that should also have the choice to have that somewhere where they will come across it. This is why the books should be out in the open for all to see, but taken to a secluded section.  In conclusion, the best solution when dealing with offensive material found in libraries is to remove it completely, but section it off from everything else and allow exclusive access to only those who so desire such material. Everyone should have a choice and a right to see or to see certain material they might find offensive. In doing so, the library, I believe, will become a better environment to all those who wish to access and use it. More people will use it and the library will then appeal to everyone.
775	3752	2	3	No, I do not believe that anything should be taken out of a library because someone finds it offensive. Libraries are meant to store a variety of materials for people to access, and everyone has the right to read what they choose. Censoring materials based on personal opinions limits access to information and restricts freedom of expression. It is important to preserve diverse perspectives and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they read. Denying access to certain materials not only hinders learning and exploration but also erases important aspects of history and culture. Therefore, it is essential to uphold the principles of free speech and intellectual freedom by keeping all materials accessible in libraries for those who wish to engage with them.
776	3753	2	3	In libraries, there are a variety of materials available for the general public to access, including books, music, movies, magazines, and more. The topic of censorship in libraries is complex, as different individuals have varying opinions on what is considered offensive. It is important to note that just because something may be offensive to one person, it does not mean that it should be removed from the shelves. Libraries are meant to cater to the diverse needs and interests of the community as a whole.  While it is within the rights of libraries to censor materials that are deemed offensive to the community, it is crucial to consider the opinions of the majority. If a particular book or movie is found to be offensive by a large portion of the community, then it may be appropriate to reconsider its presence in the library. However, it is essential to remember that freedom of speech is a fundamental right, and individuals should have access to a wide range of materials, even if they may be controversial or challenging.  Ultimately, the decision to censor materials in libraries should be made thoughtfully, taking into account the values and beliefs of the community as a whole. While it is important to respect differing opinions, it is also essential to uphold the principles of free speech and intellectual freedom. By finding a balance between these competing interests, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for all members of the community.
777	3754	2	3	No, I don't think magazines should be taken off the shelf because censorship can be subjective and restrictive. While some people may find certain content offensive, others may not, and strict censorship policies can deter customers. Parents may want to protect their children from inappropriate material, but eventually, children will be exposed to adult content. It's important to find a balance and allow individuals to make their own choices. Some people may have poor judgment when it comes to censorship, affecting everyone. Ultimately, it's essential to consider individual perspectives and allow for age-appropriate access to content.
778	3755	2	3	Imagine a nice sunny day, sitting outside under a tree and reading one of your favorite books. Feeling the wind in your hair and taking in all that is going on in the story. You not only read at home but at school as well. Just think, what if you could not read that book because it was offensive to someone else in your school? How unfair it would be to allow nobody to read that book just because of one person. This is something I could not imagine.  At my school, teachers and other faculty are always encouraging kids my age to read more often. Most teenagers are always busy participating in after-school events such as band, playing a sport, theater, choir, etc. Not many teens are able to just be alone and read a good book, which is why I was so shocked when I heard about this strange news. Should books, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are offensive? I do not think doing that would be a good decision. Kids should be able to read what they want to read.  As you probably know, not all kids are alike. Some enjoy things that others may not. For example, not all kids like to eat corn. This goes with reading as well. Not all kids like to read romantic or action books. I enjoy reading romantic and mystery novels. Some novels, more than others, have a lot more graphic content such as action books. If a mother did not want her son to be exposed to fighting, should we take all action movies, books, and magazines out of our libraries? Another example would be the fantasy series. Some parents do not want their children reading about vampires and werewolves. Should we not be able to borrow or rent these books? I do not think so.  Another reason I do not think that we should take out books and magazines in our libraries is that not everyone is offended by the same thing. For example, religion. Personally in my family, me and my brother believed in a certain religion for many years. My cousins, however, do not teach their children about that religion. If I brought over a book related to that religion and read it to their kids and they got offended, should we get rid of that book? The answer is no. Some families have traditions. Just because one family does not want their kids to know about a certain religion does not mean that everyone should not be able to get the satisfaction of reading or seeing a movie related to that religion.  So the final question is, should certain materials be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Can one person eliminate more than one book just because it is offensive to them? I guess it all depends on your view of the situation. I do not think that offensive novels should be taken off the shelves because kids should have a choice in what they want to read, not everyone is going to think that the same book is offensive, and lastly because if we got rid of all the offensive books, what books would be left to read?
779	3756	2	3	There are many books, types of music, movies, magazines, etc. that are found offensive to people. Should they be removed? It depends. If something is so inappropriate or offensive then it should be removed. Today, there are many books that teach or give a bad message. If I see one, I just try ignore it; I do not pick it up and read the back or take it home and read it. I know what I am allowed and not allowed to read. But does that mean I should take it off the shelf and throw it away because I'm not allowed to read it? No. As much as I would like to, just to prevent others from reading it, I cannot. It is sad that we have to worry about these things in the first place. I think the area where the most offensive things are, are movies. There are so many movies now that have inappropriate scenes: bad language, scary scenes, etc. Some movies are not rated appropriately either. There is a movie out now that is rated @NUM1 and is extremely scary. I cannot imgaine watching this movie as a middle schooler; I watched it as a sophomore and was scared. I never would have though it would have been that bad because of its rating. Some movies for children even have inappropriate things; they might be hidden and the child not understand, but it is still there. Why does it need to be there in the first place? Is it that important? No. Another area that is bad, are video games. There are kids who play them so much, all they think about is killing, guns, and war. There are kids who think of these things so much they begin to think it is cool to point guns and knives at other kids. Some do it in a joking way, but others do not. These things are dangerous and hurt people-mentally and even emotionally. You go to a grocery store or a gas station and see magazines with inappropriate things on them. No child should see those things, but if they are there anyone is going to look. Different genres of music @MONTH1 even send bad messages. There are some radio stations that, with certain songs, bleep out words like drugs and alcohol, but with other songs that have curse words, keep them there. I do not really understand that. Yes, drugs and alcohol are bad, but why isn't a curse word? Just saying the words drug or alcohol are not bad. These types of things are very offensive to people. But is there really anything they can do? Not really. We all have our opinions and we can speak our minds, but sometimes we do not get want we always want. We cannot really do anything about this. Others belive it is okay to watch and listen and read these kinds of things, but with the things we read, watch, adn list to on a regular basis are what we think about. If you put bad things in your mind that is all you will begin to think about and it will become a part of your life.
780	3757	2	3	I believe that people have the right to know and learn about things, even if they may find them offensive. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it will be offensive to everyone. It is important to have access to a variety of perspectives and information, even if some of it may be uncomfortable or controversial. Removing books or films with offensive content would limit our ability to learn and grow as individuals. We must be able to confront challenging ideas and have open discussions, even if they make us uncomfortable. Ultimately, censoring material because it is offensive would deprive us of the opportunity to learn and expand our understanding of the world around us.
781	3758	2	3	The question is, should we censor materials in libraries if it is offensive?  In my opinion, I don't think they should censor the material. Some things that we read, see, and hear are just going to be offensive, and we can't control everything that offends us. I do agree that people have freedom of speech, but not over everything. People need to stop overreacting to something that might have been said. Some things just need to be left in the past and kept there. For example, some individuals are still upset over slavery, and that happened over a century ago. Censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our past. We need to stop all this overprotection in our libraries of all places. Children need to know what has happened in our past to see what they can change in our future. Why? Why is my only question to why the people want to censor material in the libraries. Are they trying to keep their children from seeing it or just for their own selfish reasons? My conclusion is that they should not censor material because it offends someone. I have been offended by lots of things that I have read but I don't try to get them censored or removed from the place I read it. Sometimes you just have to deal with things that you don't like or don't agree with sometimes.
782	3759	2	3	In my opinion, if the sole purpose of a resource is for reading, it should be readily available in libraries. Magazines, comics, books, music, and movies can all be accessed in libraries, catering to various learning styles such as visual learners, listeners, and readers. Libraries offer a diverse range of materials that can accommodate individuals at different literacy levels, providing an opportunity for everyone to enhance their reading skills. By offering a peaceful and supportive environment, libraries can serve as a starting point for those looking to improve their literacy. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that everyone has the chance to learn how to read, as literacy opens doors to numerous opportunities. A visit to a local library can be a step towards achieving this goal, offering a welcoming space for individuals to embark on their reading journey.
783	3760	2	3	There are so many reasons why taking a book, movie, or anything else off the shelves is wrong. If it is violent or sexual, I can see why it shouldn't be on the shelves. However, if a reader simply doesn't like a book or movie, they should just find something else to read or watch. Everyone has different tastes and opinions, so not every book will appeal to every person. It's important to remember that just because you don't like something doesn't mean it should be removed for everyone else.   People should use common sense and stick to what they enjoy, rather than trying to censor or remove things that they personally find offensive. If you don't like something, simply don't engage with it, and move on to something that you do enjoy. By focusing on what brings us joy and fulfillment, we can create a more positive and diverse community for everyone. Let's embrace our differences and respect each other's choices, rather than trying to dictate what should or shouldn't be available to others.
784	3761	2	3	History is bound to repeat itself, and we must ensure that the future in @LOCATION2 is a bright one. Censoring certain materials on shelves is akin to a mother protecting her child from harm in the kitchen. It is a way to safeguard the minds of young individuals who absorb everything they see and hear. The impact of the content they consume can have lasting effects, and it is crucial to prevent them from being exposed to harmful influences.  As someone who has witnessed the consequences of unchecked exposure to inappropriate content, I believe that restricting access to certain materials for children and teenagers can prevent a multitude of societal issues such as teen pregnancy, substance abuse, and violence. By guiding them towards age-appropriate and educational content, we can shape a generation that is better equipped to make informed decisions and lead fulfilling lives.  The current state of our country's youth reflects the importance of instilling positive influences from a young age. By censoring what they read, watch, and listen to, we can foster a culture of responsible behavior and critical thinking. It is essential for children to have the freedom to explore their interests while being shielded from harmful messages that could derail their future aspirations.  In conclusion, the implementation of censorship in libraries and other media outlets can have a profound impact on shaping the minds of young individuals. By curating age-appropriate content and promoting positive influences, we can empower the youth of @LOCATION2 to make wise choices and realize their full potential. Let us strive to create a future where our children are nurtured in a supportive environment that encourages growth and development.
785	3762	2	3	Censorship in libraries should be allowed to cater to the diverse preferences of individuals when it comes to reading materials. Removing books simply because someone dislikes them is not a valid reason for censorship. Limiting the variety of books available in libraries would restrict access to valuable information. People rely on libraries as a resource for a wide range of materials, and it is important to ensure that all types of content are available to cater to different needs. Books should not be taken off shelves; instead, efforts should be made to expand the collection to provide a wealth of information for library patrons. Ultimately, libraries should strive to offer a comprehensive selection of books, music, movies, and magazines to meet the varied interests and informational needs of their users.
786	3763	2	3	Books and movies are a way for many people to use their imagination and creativity. Taking certain books off the shelves @MONTH1 have a negative effect on people. Certain books, music, movies, and magazines are not always as bad as what some people think. People have different views on what is good and bad, so you cannot really remove certain books because, like Katherine Paterson said, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We need to leave every book on the shelves. Using my own observations, reading, and my own experience I will prove to you that we need those books on our shelves. First, I watch younger children getting so many books off the shelves and maybe they aren't the best for them. I believe from watching them, that it helps them grow. Being a young kid you're curious and they need to be able to look at just about anything. Honestly if it's really that bad to you they won't remember it the next day. Personally I think that them seeing what we call 'bad things' will make them not want to look again, and help them learn right from wrong. Secondly, I have seen many magazines, read many books, and watched many movies that I probably shouldn't have. I feel from seeing and reading those things it has made me a better person not to do the 'bad things' that they are doing. I've read books about slavery, and war and it just wants me to make the world a better place. Knowing that younger children than I are reading and seeing all this negativity in this world doesn't always put me in the spot to say 'keep everything on the shelves,' but I also believe children will know between right and wrong. Lastly, I have experienced children and young adults abusing the library and getting movies they shouldn't be watching, which would make many people want to take certain books off the shelves. Certain books need to be kept away from young kids, but not from everyone. We older, and more wiser adults need to realize that it's not all bad, yes bad for our young ones but maybe not for someone else. A family member of mine is a photographer and he looks at nude magazines and movies to help him with his career. Not every nude movie and magazine is abused, and everyone should realize this. All in all, I understand of removing some books, magazines, and movies but we can't. I don't believe a certain book is offensive to everyone, just certain people. Different people need books and movies for different things, and they aren't all used for bad. We need to all come together as one to keep certain books out of young peoples' reach, so that the books and movies aren't abused. Hopefully, everyone keeps every book on the shelves. Again, as Katherine Paterson stated, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' if we remove them.
787	3764	2	3	In this article, I discuss the issue of how libraries handle the censorship of books. I believe that while certain materials may be inappropriate for children, it is essential for librarians to monitor what young readers are exposed to. Removing books entirely from the shelves can be extreme and may limit access for other patrons. Instead, creating a separate section for mature content could be a more effective solution. Pre-sensoring books and providing different versions for different age groups could also help address this issue. Overall, I believe that a balanced approach is needed to ensure that libraries cater to all audiences while still maintaining appropriate content standards.
788	3765	2	3	Censorship in Libraries  The library presents to the community many different forms of entertainment, ranging from romance movies to adventurous novels. However, some of these materials may contain inappropriate content that is not suitable for all audiences. It is essential that libraries carefully consider the materials they offer to ensure that they align with the community's values and standards.  One of the primary reasons for censoring inappropriate materials in libraries is to protect children's moral beliefs. Children are impressionable and look to adults and authority figures for guidance on what is acceptable behavior. If they are exposed to inappropriate content at a young age, it can shape their views and attitudes towards societal norms. By removing such materials from public view, libraries can help safeguard the moral development of children in the community.  Furthermore, the image of the library as a family-friendly and educational institution is at stake when it offers materials that contain explicit or objectionable content. Parents may be hesitant to bring their children to the library if they are concerned about the types of materials available. By censoring inappropriate content, libraries can maintain a positive reputation and ensure that they remain a trusted resource for families and individuals seeking knowledge and entertainment.  In addition to preserving the library's image and upholding community values, censoring inappropriate materials can also result in cost savings. Materials that are not censored or contain explicit content often come at a higher price. By investing in materials that are appropriate for all audiences, libraries can allocate their resources more efficiently and provide a wider range of quality content to their patrons.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries plays a crucial role in protecting children's moral beliefs, maintaining the library's family-friendly image, and optimizing resource allocation. By carefully curating the materials they offer, libraries can ensure that they continue to serve as valuable and respected institutions within the community.
789	3766	2	3	Certain books, magazines, and music may contain mature or graphic content that is not suitable for all age groups. It is important for libraries to categorize and label these materials appropriately to ensure that children do not have access to content that is intended for adults. Music, like movies, often comes with ratings to indicate the target audience. Libraries should organize their collections in a way that separates materials by age appropriateness to prevent young children from encountering mature content.   Parents would likely agree that it is important to keep mature or graphic books out of children's libraries to avoid any potential conflicts or misunderstandings. Public libraries can be a good place for sharing these materials, as they are often organized to cater to a wide range of age groups. By segregating materials based on their intended audience, libraries can provide a safe and enriching environment for everyone to explore literature, music, and other forms of art.
790	3767	2	3	Every year, more and more books of significance to literature are being taken off of the shelves in our local libraries and classrooms. And although these books may contain some writing that is offensive now, they still have shaped the culture today. Along with books, many movies and magazines are also being taken off of the shelves because of offensive material. Just because some of these materials contain offensive content, does not give people the right to make them out of reach and deprive the public of what they enjoy.  So is it right to remove offensive material from libraries? Absolutely not. Many people enjoy books, magazines, and movies of this nature. In reality, it is more than likely hurting the library's business more than anything because these types of materials is what our culture is all about. People don't want to read about what's happening at the animal shelter across the street. They want to read about what's going on in our community and about the hottest trends for seasons. All in all, removing these materials will only hurt the library's popularity and the amount of customers they attract.  Artists write about what they love and how they feel. How can someone tell an author of a book that his or her writing is too graphic or too offensive? That is what he or she chose to write about! That is how he or she expresses themselves through their writing! By 'frowning upon' books, magazines or songs with certain offensive content, officials diminish the creativity and uniqueness of authors. If a certain author or artist has a really great, original idea for a new song or book, but is worried about it not being carried by libraries because it is a little offensive, then obviously that author or artist is not going to write that book or song. By removing offensive books, songs and movies, we the public are being robbed of creative and imaginative writing.  All in all, the removal of offensive books, magazines, movies, and songs is harmful to the public and to the libraries themselves. Generations may never even hear of 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' just because it uses racial terms. So what would you do if put in this situation? Keep or remove?
791	3768	2	3	"In this persuasion essay, the debate revolves around whether offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves. While some argue for censorship, I believe that outright removal is extreme. Instead, placing such content on higher shelves for restricted access seems more practical. Offensive material, like the show ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2,"" may be offensive, but it is often viewed as comedic rather than serious. Parents should monitor what their children consume, rather than banning creators from expressing themselves. Additionally, what offends one person may not offend another, such as differing religious beliefs. It is essential to embrace differences and respect varying viewpoints. Furthermore, creators have the right to express themselves, even if their work is offensive to some. For instance, the ""@CAPS3"" series may provoke disagreements, but it should not be removed entirely. Lastly, shows like ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12"" can serve as cautionary tales, teaching valuable lessons to viewers. In conclusion, censorship of offensive material is unnecessary as individuals have the freedom to choose what they consume, with the option to stop if they find it offensive."
792	3769	2	3	My views are that if it is offensive to someone or other people, the certain material shouldn't be taken off the shelf. I think you should have to have permission from a parent or guardian if the material is explicit. For example, in a store where you buy CDs, games, etc., you have to be of age to buy the material, and that should be the same with books.  Say a book has a certain word on it like '@CAPS1,' it shouldn't be taken off the shelf just because of its name. That brings up the subject don't judge a book by its cover. Just because the name isn't to someone's standards, it shouldn't matter. Pick the book up, read the back, and see what it's actually about. Then if it's what you were expecting it to be, talk to someone who is in charge and explain to them what the problem is in your case.  Also, you could always have a section of the store or library just for adults only. It may sound silly, but it can actually help out a lot. There are tons of books out there that have things in them not appropriate for children, such as love books that talk about love and passion in ways that are very inappropriate for children.  If there was a section of a store or library, it could help keep these things out of your children's or other children's minds. You or anyone else wouldn't have to worry about children picking up certain material that you wouldn't want them to see. Just keep this in mind next time you're in a library and you see something you wouldn't like for your children to see.
793	3770	2	3	Censorship is a very sensitive topic that impacts everyone, whether directly or indirectly. It is a contentious issue, particularly when it comes to books, movies, and other forms of media. The concept of censorship raises concerns about the freedom of speech and press, which are fundamental rights granted to citizens in the @LOCATION1.  While some argue that censorship is necessary to protect the youth from inappropriate content, it is important to recognize that attempting to shield individuals from certain information is futile. Ultimately, the truth will always surface. Therefore, limiting censorship is crucial in upholding our basic freedoms.  If censorship continues to expand, it could lead to a society where everything is censored to cater to the preferences of a few individuals. This would undermine the principles of freedom of speech and press that are essential to a democratic society like the @LOCATION1.  In conclusion, it is imperative to advocate for less censorship in order to preserve our rights and liberties. By challenging censorship and striving to eliminate it from our society, we can protect the fundamental freedoms that define our nation.
794	3771	2	3	Libraries everywhere might have a book or two that could be offensive to a reader, but it's important to consider the context and history behind the content. While some people may find certain music, movies, or magazines offensive, these forms of media play a valuable role in providing diverse perspectives and information to library visitors. Music in the library offers a unique opportunity to explore different genres and eras that may not be easily accessible elsewhere. Magazines provide up-to-date information and diverse viewpoints on current events and trends. Movies in the library serve as educational tools for teachers and offer a visual representation of stories found in books. It is crucial to maintain a wide range of media in libraries to cater to the diverse interests and educational needs of the community. Overall, it is important to preserve the variety of media in libraries and not give in to individual preferences that may limit access to valuable information and perspectives.
795	3772	2	3	I believe that everyone has their own opinion on what is appropriate or not. It is important to respect individual differences and rights to choose what they want to read or listen to. Parents should communicate with their children about why they may not want them to engage with certain content, rather than imposing restrictions on everyone. It is essential to allow children to explore different perspectives and learn about both the good and bad aspects of life. By censoring books, movies, or music, we limit their exposure to diverse ideas and experiences. It is crucial to let children make their own choices and guide them on how to navigate content that may contain inappropriate language or themes. It is important to have an open mind and not be judgmental of others' viewpoints, as everyone has a unique perspective on life. Let us embrace diversity and encourage a culture of understanding and acceptance.
796	3773	2	3	If you are sitting in the library and trying to focus on your homework or studying for an upcoming test, it can be really frustrating to be disturbed. Libraries should be quiet spaces where people can concentrate without distractions. It's important to consider what materials are available in libraries to ensure a comfortable and appropriate environment for everyone.  While some books may be controversial or not suitable for younger readers, it's not necessary to remove them completely from the shelves. Instead, they can be placed in sections that are not easily accessible to children. It's important to respect everyone's right to access different types of literature while also considering age-appropriate content.  Noise levels in libraries should also be monitored to ensure a peaceful environment for studying. While some people may find music helpful for concentration, it's important to be mindful of others who prefer silence. It's important to find a balance that accommodates everyone's needs.  Offensive movies and magazines should be carefully evaluated and, if necessary, removed from library shelves to maintain a welcoming and inclusive space for all visitors. It's important to be considerate of others and avoid causing discomfort or offense.  In conclusion, libraries should be spaces where people can study and explore a variety of materials in a peaceful and respectful environment. By being mindful of the content available and the noise levels within the library, we can create a more positive and inclusive experience for everyone.
797	3774	2	3	I disagree that certain material, books, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries just because they are offensive to some. There are several reasons to support this stance. Firstly, inappropriate material should not be easily accessible to children and should be kept in a separate section for adults. Children should only have access to age-appropriate content to avoid any concerns for parents. Secondly, libraries should require identification for checking out material that may be deemed inappropriate for certain age groups, similar to how movies are rated. This way, parents can monitor what their children are exposed to. Lastly, adults should have the freedom to access a variety of material for their own personal reasons, even if some may find it offensive. In conclusion, while it is important to regulate access to inappropriate material, it should still be available in libraries for adults, with measures in place to prevent children from accessing it.
798	3775	2	3	If you were an author, would you think it would be fair for someone to have your creation taken off the shelves because it offended someone? In my opinion, I believe that there are some references, considering movies, books, music, magazines, and more, that are inapropriate. However, I don't think anyone should have the right to take them off the shelves because they are offended by it.   If everyone had the right to take something off of a shelf because it offends them, we wouldn't have anything left. In my mind, everything could possibly be offensive to someone. For example, I read a book and they stereotyped the cheerleaders, just like everyone else does. The way they make all cheerleaders out to be is horrible. Considering I've been a big time cheerleader my entire life, I got a little offended because I'm not the way the book described them at all. After reading the book, I might not have enjoyed it, but it was my choice to read it. I wasn't going to @MONTH1 back to the book store and demand them to take it off the market because I, only one person, didn't like it.   My philosophy would be to just ignore the things you don't like, or not to purchase the item if it offends you. I know that the age of the targeted audience of some books or movies aren't always the only ones that come across them. For example, a child coming across a movie that includes inapropriate languages or scenes. That is when I say that you just have to keep walking by and only pay attention to the materials that are for you. Or parents, censor what you children see, hear and read about.   Moreover, I do not think it is fair for someone's artwork, whether it is music, a book, magazine, or movie, to be taken off of display or off of the shelf. Those authors or creaters worked just as hard as anyone else. Just because it is not best suited for one person, does not mean it isn't suited for someone else.   In conclusion, I don't think it is fair for items to be taken off of the market because it doesn't please a few people. I'm sure there is someone out there that will enjoy it. It wouldn't be fair to the artist, after all of their time and harkwork. Everything on the market could probably offend at least a few people in some way, but welcome to the real world. They just need to learn to deal with it, or ignore it like I do.

While some may argue that certain books are inappropriate for certain age groups, it is important to recognize that different people have different needs and perspectives. Just like books, movies, music, and magazines play a vital role in our society by offering diverse content for various audiences. It is crucial to approach these forms of media with an open mind and understand that they serve a purpose in enriching our lives. Instead of criticizing and judging, we should appreciate the diversity of content available to us and make informed choices based on our individual preferences. Removing these sources of information and entertainment would have a detrimental impact on our society, as they contribute to our growth and development. Embracing the variety of media available to us can ultimately lead to a more enriched and fulfilling life.
800	3777	2	3	Materials that are offensive for some people should not be removed from the shelves. It is important to not take everything seriously, as many offensive things can simply be jokes or attempts to seek attention. For example, television shows often contain moments that may be offensive, but it is crucial to understand that they are for entertainment purposes. If we start removing everything that is offensive, it can hinder creativity and expression in various forms of media. It is essential to remember that everyone has different tastes and sensitivities, and what may be offensive to one person may not be to another. In the end, it is important to have a balanced perspective and not let offensive materials affect us too deeply, as they are often just a small part of a larger picture.
801	3778	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, The things we learn at such a young age really need to be changed. It would really help society. Here are some ways how.  All books are different. Some books have offensive language. If books have offensive language, you don't have to read it out loud. You can always substitute other words in there for those or just skip over them like nothing happened.  Some books say sexual things in them that may offend a race or gender. If books are sexual for your age group, then I would recommend choosing a new book. But no matter how you look at it, it could always be much worse than what it is.  Music needs some censorship. When you're listening to the radio or a CD or iPod, you can't always censor that. The radio companies need to do a better job at censoring them out of songs. Many young teens think it's cool to use vulgar language.  Movies have different ratings for different age groups. I'm sure no one would let a two-year-old watch a rated R movie. That kid would have nightmares for a week. So censorship would really help the parents out on choosing the right movie for family night instead of picking one that they have no clue about.  Magazines are nothing but gossip. Most magazines do nothing but talk about the bad in people or the good in them. There should be some censorship in there because it is a person's life who they're talking garbage about.  Some say kids are like sponges. Whatever the kid hears, he will repeat. Whatever a kid sees, he will try to repeat it. So whatever a kid reads or watches will probably be the same.  Things do need a little censorship. If we didn't have that, it's hard telling what the world would be like. The world would be full of a lot of people with no motivation whatsoever. If we take things away, then the world would have nothing to do. I know that when I was a little kid, I would hear something on the radio and think it was cool to say. My parents wouldn't know what to do to me. I know as an adult, I wouldn't want my kids learning the stuff I did at such a young age.  In conclusion, censorship in various forms of media is essential to protect young minds and ensure a positive influence on society. By monitoring and filtering content, we can create a more wholesome environment for individuals of all ages.
802	3779	2	3	No, I don't think that should happen as many adults enjoy those activities. If the concern is children accessing these areas, a simple solution would be to install a door with an age restriction and security cameras. This way, parents can be assured that children are not allowed in those areas. It is important for children to learn to be around such things as they will encounter them as adults. Most children understand right from wrong and can behave appropriately. I grew up around these activities and turned out fine, so it should not be a major concern.
803	3780	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3, I am a student from @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, and I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. This is because these materials can have a significant impact on individuals, especially students who may be influenced by what they read, hear, or see.  Books, for example, can provide valuable insights and lessons, but if they contain offensive content, they may send the wrong message to readers. By removing offensive books from shelves, we can prevent students from being exposed to harmful ideas and encourage them to seek out more positive and constructive literature.  Similarly, music can be a powerful tool for self-expression and emotional connection, but if it contains offensive language or messages, it can have a negative impact on listeners. Removing offensive music from circulation can help create a more positive and uplifting environment for students to enjoy and learn from.  Movies, like books and music, can also be a source of inspiration and entertainment, but if they contain offensive content, they may perpetuate harmful stereotypes or behaviors. By removing offensive movies from shelves, we can promote more inclusive and respectful media consumption among students.  Magazines, too, can influence how individuals perceive themselves and others, so it is important to ensure that they do not contain offensive or harmful content. By removing offensive magazines from circulation, we can create a safer and more supportive environment for students to explore and learn from.  In conclusion, I believe that removing offensive materials from shelves is essential to promoting a positive and healthy learning environment for students. By being mindful of the content we consume, we can better protect ourselves and others from harmful influences and create a more inclusive and respectful community. Thank you.   Sincerely,   @ORGANIZATION1
804	3781	2	3	Removing literature from a shelf should not be permitted just because you think something about it. Everyone has different ideas and opinions about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. If you don't like a certain book or you do not want your children reading that book then don't take them to the library in the first place. In a public library you have to be old enough to buy a library card to check out a book, so if you are old enough to have a library card then obviously you arent going to find a book that is innapropriate for your own age. You @MONTH1 find a book that is immature to you, but you do not have to read it. Men and women go to public libraries to learn. If you want to learn about something that is offensive, then you won't beable to if one person comes along and doesn't approve of the book. Is that fair? You tell me. In a school library yes there should be a limit to what children can and cannot read. In a junior high school the standards should be different compared to an elementary or a senior high school. In an elementary children are required to read as part of their academics, but they are not old enough to want to learn about something offensive, therefore they will not need those types of books in their library. In a junior high school there should be a limit on the offensiveness but the students still have a right to know what is going on arond them. In a senior high school students should have a right to read whatever type of book they please. Magazines are a different subject. Alot of times in magazines there are advertisements for smoking products or alchoholic beverages. Those types of magazines should not beable to be read in a school library. In a public library a person should have the right to read whatever he or she pleases. In the end im saying adults and teens have a right to learn about whatever they like, but children should be young and innocent while they can. You cannot keep them shielded from commercials and people advertising these things themselves, but what you can prevent you should. Nobody wants their children growing up too fast, but do not limit their growth.
805	3782	2	3	People all around the world have different perspectives on the rating systems for music, books, and movies. While some may argue that books and music should have different levels of ratings, others believe that these ratings are essential to help parents make informed decisions about what their children consume. Ratings such as '@CAPS1' for mature can serve as a warning for explicit content, giving parents the opportunity to control what their kids are exposed to. Similarly, stores have restrictions on selling rated @CAPS4 movies to children under a certain age, acknowledging the potentially inappropriate content within. Despite efforts to restrict access to mature material, it is impossible to eliminate it entirely, as new content will continue to be created. Ultimately, it is crucial for parents to guide their children and teach them to make responsible choices about the media they consume as they grow up.
806	3783	2	3	Does censorship really help or setback our libraries? Does it try to mask what really might be happening in this world or does it try to make you feel all happy about this horrendous place that you live in? To one person, a book could be very offensive, and to their neighbor, it could have a whole new, opposite meaning. It's all in perspective.   Personally, I think that taking out some of the 'offensive' books in libraries could be a disaster. Libraries are a place that sparks imagination for all ages, and if you censor things out, then how is that supposed to happen? Looking at books in the past that were defied as 'offensive' and taken off the shelves at libraries and banned from reading in school, they were mostly about women's rights and censorship. If you took out all of those books that pertained to these topics, how many books would you have left?   When people who are all for censorship in libraries say something to the effect of 'what about the children, I don't want them reading a book that I think is offensive,' I say then censor them. It's your own choice on how you raise your kids, but other parents think that you should have an imagination instead of the same old, same old.   All in all, I think people who would want to censor books are crazy, and it could potentially be taken way out of hand, leading to a dystopian society. Children should not be disillusioned about what the world is and could be. Think about that next time you think a book could arise tension between people and consider if you are taking away the rights of others.
807	3784	2	3	In the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you. Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library. With this vast array of topics it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents. These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas. Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make.   Removing books from the shelves off a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the Constitution. In the United States, everyone has certain unalienable rights. These were written out in our Constitution as the first ten admendments to the Constitution. One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion. By remving a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech. This clearly violates the Constitution and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the United States. By violating the Constitution openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the Constitution. The president is now a dictator, we are now a communist country, and many other actions are allowed, leaving the Constitution as a scrap of paper with no meaning. Without the Constitution, the United States is just like any other country and has no direction. This leads to a downward spiral of our society.  The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society. Every year thousands of new books are introduced to the public. Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future. If you take these books off the shelves, and out of the publics hands, you effectivly stop all change from new ideas in a society. Nothing would ever get better, and the society would stay at the same level that they were when the censorship began.  Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society. In the novel 'Fahrenheit 451' by Ray Bradbury, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned. Anyone who is caught reading a book that 'makes the think' locked up or killed. The main characters job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think. The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything, they just sat at home and watched the television all day. Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop? Censoring out pornography would lead to romance novels being censored, which would lead to magic books being censored, and so on until you are censoring out history books or the Bible. By censoring out the books and movies that make people think, you quickly lose all intrest in higher learning. That is why censorship can quickly lead to the collapse of a society.  Although censorship may seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make. It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is. Not only is it determental to a society but it is also is clearly unconstitutional if you look at the Constitution of the United States. So let us hope that all though we may play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to nowhere.
808	3785	2	3	I think everything should be there. The examples of things that should be there are: all magazines, books, and @CAPS1 service. For the magazines there should be all cars, trucks, atvs, mtvs, utvs, espn, golf, game informers, and wwe magazines. Now for the books. All the types of books that should be allowed are @CAPS2-@CAPS3, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7 books. And last the @CAPS1 service. The @CAPS1 service should be used for school work, to play all games on any website, and to use youtube on any computer. This all should be used there because certain things some kids don't have at home. Having access to a wide variety of magazines, books, and @CAPS1 service can greatly enhance the educational and recreational experiences for children who may not have these resources readily available to them elsewhere. It is essential to provide a diverse range of reading materials and digital services to cater to the different interests and needs of children in order to promote learning and engagement.
809	3786	2	3	'Book or no Book?' This ongoing debate revolves around the idea of what should be available in libraries. While some argue for a diverse range of materials, others believe that books should take precedence. In my opinion, individuals should have the freedom to check out any book they desire, regardless of personal preferences. Implementing solutions such as organizing books by category or implementing age restrictions can help mitigate potential conflicts. Ultimately, the decision will elicit mixed reactions, but it is crucial to respect diverse interests and viewpoints in a democratic society.
810	3787	2	3	I believe that books that are deemed offensive or sexual should not be completely removed from shelves. Instead, they should be placed in a designated section of the library where children are not allowed or have restricted access. Children should not be exposed to inappropriate content, and parents should have control over what their children can access. By implementing age restrictions or parental permission, we can ensure that children are protected from harmful influences while still allowing adults the freedom to choose their reading material. It is important to strike a balance between freedom of expression and the protection of young minds.
811	3788	2	3	Throughout my life, I have seen many books that seem offensive to me. However, they should not be censored just because they seem offensive. I believe that books that are found offensive should not be censored.  A reason why I think books that are found offensive should not be censored is because what seems offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. Classifying something as offensive is an opinion. Unless everyone in the whole world thought that a book was offensive, it should be able to remain open to the public.  Another reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is because in our society, we are given the right to express ourselves freely. If we censored books that are found to be offensive, we would be violating this right. This would not be fair to the people who wrote the books and to those who like them.  The next reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is that if we were to censor every book that we found offensive, we would not have any books to read at all. Books that some people like are found offensive by others. For example, suppose a few people loved the Harry Potter series but another person who read it later found it offensive and had it censored. The people who loved the Harry Potter series would now find the books the other person likes and censor them. If this continued, we would have no books to read.  Another reason why I believe books should not be censored is because without offensive books, we would never learn from terrible mistakes. Suppose every book relating to both world wars were censored and could not be read. Sooner or later, no one would remember what terrible things happened and history could possibly repeat itself. Unless having books that seem offensive is worse than having the events we dread happen again, then books that are found offensive should not be censored.  I believe books that are found to be offensive should not be censored because without them, we would be violating the right to freely express ourselves and we would be allowing terrible things that happened in the past to be forgotten. Without books that are considered offensive, we would not have any books to read at all.
812	3789	2	3	They will see it eventually. There is no reason to censor a library, I believe. I think they should be sectioned off, maybe put the 'offensive' books in the back of the library is enough censorship. You have to look at it in the publisher's view also. They want to sell and advertise their product and they have a right to do so. Libraries shouldn't take their product off the shelves just because someone stumbled upon something they believe is offensive.   We all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like @ORGANIZATION1. Things that show inappropriate pictures, drugs, firearms, etc. I believe they are already censored enough. Most magazines that many people find 'offensive' are always put in the back of the store or sectioned off so people don't stumble upon it or have their children flipping through the pages corrupting their minds. Some material is even put in a plastic sleeve so the person must purchase it before reading.  If you decide to write and publish a book, don't you think you should be given the right as everyone else to put it on the shelves and promote it? I do, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to. The library shouldn't censor your book just because someone else thinks and feels it's offensive. That's not fair in @LOCATION1. I think that the libraries shouldn't censor any materials. Offensive or not we have the right to publish and promote it. Libraries should respect the freedom of expression and allow all types of literature to be accessible to the public.
813	3790	2	3	I don't think they should publically exploit the books if certain people feel offended by it, but I personally do not get offended by anything so my opinion will be different than others. However, if the library recieves constant complaints about this issue then I could see why they would want to get rid of it.  So what i'm saying is that if it doesn't cause a problem for anyone other then a select few then I believe they should keep it but just let the offended know that the book is going to be out of sight, therefore making the issue non-existant.  I don't think that librarians will intentually put out books that offend the public people on display in front of everyone to see, I believe that they just have the books for their purpose and that's to be read. I've been to the public library many times and out of all the times i've been I dont think i have seen a single thing that has offended me or made me un-comfortable.  The books are there for public reading and the growth of knowledge, without them I believe it would hurt our nation as a whole, due to the fact that we need knowledge to do things and the more knowledge we have the better our lives will be. So no, I believe libraries should keep all books unless it causes a big issue and many people are constantly bringing up the problem.
814	3791	2	3	I think that everyone has different views on different things so I don't think that they should be censored because that would go against the first amendment which guarantees freedom of religion and speech. People need to respect that others have different opinions and preferences, and should not try to impose their own beliefs on others. It's important to remember that there are billions of people in the world, and everyone looks at things slightly differently. We should be tolerant of diverse perspectives and not judge or restrict others based on our own beliefs. Ultimately, people should mind their own business and let others read, watch, and listen to whatever they choose without being offended. It's crucial to promote understanding and open-mindedness rather than trying to force everyone to agree with us. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and preferences, and we should respect that diversity.
815	3792	2	3	I believe that if something is found offensive to someone, it doesn't mean it's offensive to someone else. In libraries, there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., some of these different types of things come across as offensive to some but others enjoy them. Therefore, they shouldn't be taken away from those who enjoy reading or listening to them. Some things, such as adult novels and explicit music, are considered offensive by some people. But what they don't understand is that some people actually enjoy this material, so taking it away from them is not right. Everyone should be able to have different likes in these areas. Everyone is not the same.  If you attend a library, you should be able to find something that fits your style or sparks your interest. If the things that people like are being taken away, then it's not giving them a wide variety of things they enjoy doing. It's more likely closing them out on things they like because other people don't like it or find it offensive.  Lastly, those who think that these things are offensive are entitled to their opinion. But so are those who believe that these things are good. There should remain a variety of different books, music, and other things that appeal to all types of personalities.  Everyone has a right to say whether they don't like something. But what you don't like, someone else does. So to take away things that other people enjoy is unjust. In conclusion, it's important to respect the diverse preferences of individuals when it comes to media and materials available in libraries. Everyone should have the freedom to choose what they enjoy without facing unnecessary censorship.
816	3793	2	3	A colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world. The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people. In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves.  Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discriminate against certain ethnicities need to be removed immediately from libraries. There are exceptions to this proposal. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they offend people. In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves!  Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong. By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music.  Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' That is a naive comment as well as an exaggeration. There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item. That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved.  In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as well. A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society.
817	3794	2	3	I believe that offensive materials should not be taken off bookshelves. While some content may be offensive to some individuals, it is important to have a diverse range of perspectives and voices available for people to access. By keeping these materials available, it allows for open discussion, critical thinking, and the opportunity to challenge one's own beliefs and values. It is through exposure to different viewpoints that we can grow and learn as individuals and as a society. Therefore, I support the idea of keeping offensive materials on bookshelves in order to promote understanding, empathy, and intellectual growth.
818	3795	2	3	In the quote that @PERSON1 wrote she talks about how books can be taken down from a shelf if it is too provocative. This is a very interesting quote. She talks about how things should be taken off the shelf to prevent children from seeing them. In everyday life, there are things that are said in movies, music, and magazines that kids should never watch, hear, or read.  Some movies can be way too provocative. Directors try to cover them up, but we know what they are trying to get across. Some scenes can get out of control, and there is no stopping it. People wish they could close their eyes and it would all be over. When parents get movies, they try to keep those scenes hidden from their children to prevent them from getting bad ideas.  Music is especially one to do this. There are not a lot of songs in the world that do not involve language, drugs, or sexual content. Many parents do not want their children exposed to that too soon. If people listen to this, they might want to try it and end up going down a wrong path from the words that are said.  There are too many magazines that try to expose women. They use this to try to sell more magazines, which is wrong. Parents do not want their children to look at this and get the wrong idea. When girls look at a model in a magazine, they try to be just like the model, which can lead to negative consequences.  Some parents let their kids get away with too much. They should censor what their children do. Some kids will try to get around them, so there is no helping them. Everyone's point of view is different, and it just depends on how society feels about the whole situation.  If we were to take a movie or music down because of what they say, then there would be no content on the shelf. It is important for parents to monitor and censor what their children are exposed to in order to protect them from negative influences.
819	3796	2	3	Libraries are a great resource for information all around the world. They contain many different styles and genres of books. Some might not be appropriate for young children to read. There are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves. I believe that no book should be denied of this right.  Most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times. Most libraries have children sections. Offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections, not the children section. So, to my defense, there could really be no way that a child would seek out these 'offensive' books anyway. Children today are exposed to more explicit topics, but I doubt they would want to read a book about them.  Next, if a child goes up to the check out desk the librarian should be able to tell their parent or guardian that certain book is not suitable for that age of child. Going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times while in a library. If an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not.  Finally, authors should not be punished for writing something they believe in or like. They worked hard on writing and publishing their novels, they should be able to show them off. If librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults, a lot of books will be gone from the shelves. People should be able to read whatever they want, offensive or not. Children being able to do this? Depends on the parent.  There is no way a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without their guardian knowing. Yes, all parents do not care about what their child reads, so this could happen. Just because some adults complained about books being too offensive for their children doesn't mean a revolt has to happen. Those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read. Some of the most 'offensive' books out there are the very best to read.
820	3797	2	3	Censorship in media, particularly aimed at children, has become prevalent in today's society. While the intention may be to protect young minds from harmful content, the reality is that children often learn censored information from their peers regardless. This renders censorship ineffective and a waste of government resources. Instead, censorship should be focused on media that directly impacts children and young teens, allowing more mature content for older audiences. By limiting the use of certain words and expressions, censorship can stifle artistic expression and hinder individuals from fully expressing themselves. Ultimately, censorship is seen as a form of control by the government, potentially altering the way people interact and communicate. It is essential to reevaluate the necessity of censorship in order to preserve the quality of media and promote freedom of expression in society.
821	3798	2	3	How would you feel if your son or daughter saw a naked picture of someone, kept hearing bad words from a song that was in the library! Would you really want that for your child? Thought a library was supposed to be a learning center, didn't know it was a bad place to be. People have their own opinions in everything! A lot of things these days are changing and it's not for the better! Television, books, and music are becoming dirty and unenjoyable to people. Please help try and help us stop this! We don't want it getting to our kids, like it has to others! Some people like these kinds of things with bad actions in them! One thing that catches them is the beat, it just makes them want to start dancing. Another reason why they like it is because their friends like it also! People these days are becoming more of followers than leaders like they should be. When people grow up they usually have an idol whether it's a singer, book writer, or actor. When that idol grows older it most likely isn't going to be the same person with the same thoughts it had @DATE1, they change for the worse most of the time! They get caught up in drugs or the fame that it puts them in. When that happens people lose their interest in them unless they think it's cool! It all just depends on the person! Some people thrive off of these things! Libraries are supposed to be for all ages! If a kid finds something that was bad at a library and tells their friends or parents that's just putting down the library and they aren't going to want to go there anymore. This is just hurting the library because it will lose a lot of their business. Young kids these days are being exposed to a lot more things that they shouldn't be! What little kids already know is sickening! Hearing them say that they have boyfriends and girlfriends, and how they know bad words just at the age of @DATE1! It might have to do with the parents or the friends the kids choose but in my opinion it's not right! Kids are growing up way too fast because of the things that they know! Movies, music, books, etc. are not like they used to be in the fifties, even the eighties, yeah they weren't the best, but it's gotten a little extreme these days. The words that they say in songs, the things we see in movies, and the picture we see in magazines are getting out of hand. There should be a section that is blocked off only for eighteen and older that has all the bad things in the music, movies, and magazine articles/pictures. People should have IDs that they have to have to get into this section! This is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are these days when they are at a young age. This might not even work, but it's worth a try! The world isn't a happy place anymore! It's filled with violence, sex, drugs, etc. Some parents don't care about the things that their child does, says, or sees. It all just depends on the family. Whether they believe in @CAPS1 or if they don't is another example of this! It always affects their actions and thoughts! People try and do the littlest things, and they try and make a difference in the world. That is what people need to do, not get involved in horrible things. They need to get involved and stay out of these bad things; seeing bad pictures, hearing bad words, and watching horrible things in movies. Try to make a difference! Don't be a follower because it's not going to get you anywhere in life! Everything counts!

Books provide valuable knowledge and information that can help us learn from the past and avoid repeating mistakes. They are crucial for children's education and development, especially in schools where resources may be limited. While offensive books should be removed, it is important to keep books that are informative and beneficial for personal growth. Overall, books play a significant role in society, and removing them from libraries would deprive people of valuable learning opportunities and cultural enrichment.
823	3800	2	3	In today's diverse world, there is a wide array of movies, books, and music available, catering to different tastes and beliefs. While some content may be offensive to certain individuals, it is important to recognize the value of diversity and freedom of choice. Removing books or movies from shelves based on subjective opinions would limit artistic expression and intellectual growth.   Music, with its various genres like rock, rap, country, and jazz, offers something for everyone. Censoring music because it is deemed offensive by some would stifle creativity and cultural exchange. Similarly, books encompass a range of genres and themes, providing opportunities for learning and exploration. The Bible, for instance, holds significant cultural and religious importance, and its removal would have far-reaching consequences on society.  Ultimately, individuals have the freedom to choose what they consume, and censorship should not restrict this freedom. It is essential to respect diverse perspectives and allow for a variety of voices to be heard. By embracing different forms of art and media, we can foster understanding and dialogue in our communities. Let us celebrate the richness of our cultural landscape and uphold the principles of free expression.
824	3801	2	3	There are certain materials that are deemed offensive to children, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Books may contain inappropriate content that children could easily access. Music and music videos often include profanity that is not suitable for young audiences. Movies, especially those with mature themes, can have a negative impact on children who watch them. Magazines may contain inappropriate images that can be harmful to children's development. It is important to remove these offensive materials from shelves to protect children from exposure to unsuitable content. In conclusion, it is crucial to be mindful of the media children consume to ensure their well-being and proper development.
825	3802	2	3	How would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys? If you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped. Everyone in this world is different from the next person. So I believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions. Some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others.   For my first reason goes along with personal values. For example a person of higher authority may find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs. So if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic. This would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics.  My next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests. If someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable. This can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time. Everyone likes different things and has different views. They should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person.  People should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. I know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair. If everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary. Many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same. Every person should have a right to enjoy the things that make them happy without being hurt by the opinions and judgements of others.  Books should be something that each person should have a choice in. If there are endless choices of books and movies a person could learn about many different things and develop a more open mind. If everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others. So I believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read. No one should be limited because of other people's values or interest. The right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present.
826	3803	2	3	"Should we remove books and media because they are offensive? I do not believe so. In this essay, I will describe why I think this way.  The word ""offensive"" is subjective and can vary greatly among different individuals. What one person finds offensive, another may not. With changing societal standards, what was once considered offensive may no longer be seen that way.  Today's youth may consume content that older generations find offensive. This is a reflection of evolving values and norms. Parents play a crucial role in monitoring and guiding their children's exposure to media that they deem inappropriate.  Ultimately, the decision to engage with offensive content should lie with the individual or their guardians. Just because something is available does not mean it has to be consumed. Censoring materials based on offensiveness limits freedom of choice and expression.  In conclusion, the notion of offensiveness is subjective and varies from person to person. Therefore, removing books and media solely for being offensive is not necessary. It is essential to respect differing perspectives and allow individuals to make their own informed decisions about the content they engage with."
827	3804	2	3	In my personal opinion, I do believe that certain materials whether it be in books, music, magazines, or movies be removed or edited more carefully. Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or engage in inappropriate behavior, and yet we often see such content being promoted.   In bookstores or libraries, there are books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate for younger audiences. While we want to encourage children to read, it is important to be mindful of the content they are exposed to. Some books may contain foul language, violence, or sexual themes that are not suitable for all ages.  The music industry also presents a variety of content, some of which may not be appropriate for all listeners. While everyone has their own preferences, it is important to be selective about the music we choose to listen to. If a certain song or artist's content is not suitable, we can always choose to listen to something else.  Magazines can also contain content that may not align with everyone's values or beliefs. It is important to be cautious about the magazines we read and the messages they convey. Parents may want to monitor the magazines their children are exposed to in order to ensure they are age-appropriate.  Overall, it is important to be mindful of the content we consume and the messages it sends. While there may always be some content that is considered inappropriate, we can make conscious choices to avoid or limit our exposure to such material. It is ultimately up to individuals to decide what is acceptable for them and their families.
828	3805	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a contentious issue, especially when it comes to removing materials deemed offensive. I firmly believe that such materials should not be taken off the shelves. What one person finds offensive may not be the same for another. We all have different tastes and opinions, and it is important to respect that diversity. Removing items because they are offensive to some would only limit the choices available to others. It is crucial to embrace the variety of perspectives and interests that exist in society. Let's strive to be more understanding and open-minded towards different viewpoints and preferences.
829	3806	2	3	Many people find themselves upset or disturbed by certain books, songs, movies, or magazines and feel that they should be removed from shelves. However, I believe that since everyone has their own definition of offensive and disturbing, libraries and media centers should separate such materials from others rather than banning them altogether.  Individuals have different backgrounds, religions, and beliefs, which influence what they find offensive. Therefore, one person should not have the power to remove a book or magazine just because they personally find it disturbing. The purpose of media is to express opinions, and if someone disagrees with those opinions, they should simply move on to something else.  Rather than banning materials, libraries and media centers can create special sections for adult or mature content. Additionally, labeling books, songs, or movies with explicit content warnings can help readers and listeners make informed decisions about what they consume.  By taking these measures, all individuals can have access to a variety of media while still being able to avoid content that they find offensive or disturbing. It is important to respect diverse perspectives and provide options for all audiences.
830	3807	2	3	Every person is different, and in being different, people have many varying views as to what is or is not acceptable or offensive. Something that is very offensive to one person may not be offensive to someone else, it is all a matter of values and beliefs. Libraries contain a variety of books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials on a variety of topics, some of which may not be appropriate for everyone.  I do not believe that a material should be removed from shelves just because one person or a group of people find it offensive. The offended group is not being forced to read that book or magazine, listen to that music, or watch that movie. Materials are placed in a library for the public to enjoy, not just to please certain people.  I do believe, however, that materials should be clearly sorted in a library. If they are clearly sorted, people are less likely to take something that offends them by accident, and can completely avoid books, movies, magazines, and music that they do not want to read, watch, or listen to. This can also help keep children away from unwanted material.  To conclude, materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. What is offensive to one person, another person might enjoy watching, listening to, or reading. It is impossible to please everyone, because every person has different views, but a situation can be avoided by careful organization. If everything that was found offensive to certain people was taken off of library shelves, there would be nothing left.
831	3808	2	3	I do not believe that books that are considered offensive should be removed from public libraries. I could understand if it was school libraries that were in question, because of the fact that some of the materials that these extremely explicit books contain is not for a child to be reading. I feel as if these certain materials can be helpful to seeing other people's points of view on certain subjects. Though books with this material can be called offensive, to certain people this is their culture and how they live.  What would happen if every book that was considered offensive was actually removed from bookshelves? Some of the most interesting books that I have ever picked up have been controversial. The eye-opening world of these books is amazing. The fact that I can read about other people's lives and their everyday struggles is astounding to me. If we all made a huge decision based on one person's opinion, then our world would be a mess.  Therefore, if all of these 'offensive' books were to be removed, then what is left to read? I want to read something that is going to grab my attention and make me want to keep reading. I do not think that I would have that type of experience if these books were removed. The diversity of perspectives and experiences found in controversial books is essential for a well-rounded understanding of the world around us. Removing them would limit our exposure to different viewpoints and hinder our ability to learn and grow as individuals. Therefore, I believe that these books should remain accessible in public libraries for those who wish to explore them.
832	3809	2	3	"I believe that censorship is rarely acceptable, and certainly not in libraries, at school or otherwise. Censorship prevents knowledge from being obtained, spreading ignorance and intolerance. Libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking, discovery, and learning. Censorship stops these things from occurring.  If people are prevented from reading what they want, then many will not read, period. Not all children and teens are drawn to reading. If there is a book that a reluctant reader shows interest in, then why would someone want to take it away? Because he or she finds it offensive? Because he or she does not agree with the views expressed? Neither are legitimate reasons for censorship.  Most justifications for censorship would not stand the test of time. A great number of books challenged in the past are today considered classics and/or important works, such as To Kill a Mockingbird, Fahrenheit 451, The Catcher in the Rye, and Harry Potter. To Kill a Mockingbird and The Catcher in the Rye were censored because of the racist language. That language helps to set the time period in the novels. Also, To Kill a Mockingbird is about a lawyer who defends a wrongly accused black man in the South. The main antagonist is an ignorant, racist man. The book itself is not racist, only the villain of the story.  Censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent. Preventing a child from seeing a rated R movie or reading a letter to Penthouse is a separate issue from censorship. I define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person. Keep children sheltered when they are young, if one must, but as they grow older and mature, it is essential that they are allowed to mature in their reading, as well.  If someone lives their life reading only the books others choose for him or her and seeing only the movies and shows chosen for him or her, then he or she will not be his or her own person. Living a sheltered life can catch up to people when they reach adulthood. They will not have their own views, and will be largely ignorant to the world around them. John Stuart Mill said, ""He who destroys a good book, kills reason itself."" That is what happens to people who have grown up among censorship; they have very little reason. Censorship can mold people, not for the better. People who grow up free to read and watch generally what they wish can turn out differently.  These people can have views and values of their own, formed by, among other factors, influential books they have read throughout their life. Many of these people better understand others, promoting tolerance. Censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people. Anyone is capable of possessing them.  Censorship cannot be seen as the norm. Libraries and schools should allow children and teenagers to learn and grow. That is the purpose of the institution of education. Therefore, censorship should not even be considered. Students' freedom to read what they desire should be the policy of all schools and libraries."
833	3810	2	3	I think that libraries should not remove material such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Each person has their own unique reading and viewing preferences, and it is essential for libraries to cater to a diverse range of interests. By offering a variety of materials, libraries can attract more visitors and provide valuable resources to the community. However, it is important to ensure that the content available is appropriate and respectful to all individuals. Removing offensive material can create a more welcoming environment for everyone. In conclusion, libraries should continue to offer a wide selection of media while being mindful of the impact certain content may have on their audience.
834	3811	2	3	Nearly every person has seen, heard, wrote, or said something that offended someone. Most of the people that offened others do it on perpose in there music, books, or movies. While some other people accdeltly offened people by the way the worded somedthing. If someone finds something offensive, they should ask for it to be placed somewhere else so it is still avaible, ask for a vote to remove it from the shelves, or just keep it to themselves until they know their not to only one offeneded.  When someone gets offened by something they see and hear in a library, that person should ask for relocation for the offensive meteral they seen or heared. In this case, other people can still watch, hear, or read the book or magazine, movie, or music. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is to someone else.  A book or magazine, song, or movie could be offensive to a lot of people, so it should be voted to be removed or stay in the labrary. This way the materal has a chance to be avaible in the future. Some music and movies could get removed then replaced with the censered version so it for the people that were not offened.  In some cases there is only one person that got offeneded by something that was in a library. In these cases the person could chose to wait to until someone else is offeneded by the materal to speek up about it's offensiveness.  If materal is offensive to someone they should get it relocated, voted on, or hold their peace. If relocated the materal is still avaible to other people. When voted one it could stay or be removed. Someone can speek up about the offensive materal after someone else find it offensive as well. Ultimately, it is important to address offensive material in a respectful and considerate manner to ensure that everyone's perspectives are taken into account.
835	3812	2	3	If something is offensive, it should be removed from the bookshelves to ensure that everyone feels welcome in the library. Offending material can have long-lasting negative effects on individuals, affecting their communication skills and even leading to self-harm. It is important to consider the impact of hurtful content on others and take action to prevent further harm. We all have a responsibility to speak up and make things right when we encounter offensive material, as allowing it to continue can also be seen as contributing to the harm it causes. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone in our community.
836	3813	2	3	Censorship in public libraries is a controversial topic, with some arguing for the removal of offensive materials and others advocating for freedom of expression. While censorship may seem like a way to protect certain individuals from potentially harmful content, it ultimately restricts access to information and limits intellectual freedom. Instead of censoring books, art, or other materials, it is important to trust individuals to make their own choices about what they read or view. By allowing people to decide for themselves what they find offensive or inappropriate, we uphold the principles of democracy and respect for diverse perspectives. Let us embrace the diversity of ideas and opinions that can be found in public libraries, and remember that what may be offensive to some may be enlightening or inspiring to others. Ultimately, the decision to censor or not to censor should be left in the hands of the readers themselves.
837	3814	2	3	I think that if there is a book in the libraries that is harmful, then you should have to be at least 18 years of age to check it out. The reason why I say 18 is because at that age, you should know what's right or wrong and you can handle it if it is wrong. If you know it's wrong, then don't read it; no one is making you read it. Some people like to read different kinds of books just because it's not right and hurts you doesn't mean it hurts everyone. It may be helpful to someone else, and if it's taken out, then there won't be any books in the libraries for anyone to check out and read. If you have a problem with that, you can contact me at 555-5555, ask for [Name], and we can talk about it. The reason I feel this way is that there is a part in every book that will hurt someone, so you should have to be 18 to check out certain books. If you're getting hurt by a bunch of books, then I would suggest you stop reading because a book is a book, not something to hurt you. There are so many people in the world who are into books and resources about stuff.   What I do not agree with is kids getting out of class and going to the library to play games and put puzzles together. People go in there and play games, and when others need to use the computer, there is no room because of kids playing games. But as for the book part in the library, I don't have a problem with that. Books hurting people is simple: don't read them. Other people like having them there for them.
838	3815	2	3	In many libraries, there are various types of materials available such as books, movies, magazines, and more. Some of these items may be considered inappropriate for certain age groups. However, I believe that every library patron should have the freedom to choose what they want to read or watch. Ultimately, it is up to the individual or their parents to decide what is suitable for them.  When it comes to choosing books, it is important to consider your age and maturity level. Parents can help guide younger readers in selecting appropriate books, while older readers can make their own choices. It is essential to trust your own judgment and preferences when selecting reading material.  Similarly, when it comes to movies, parental guidance is crucial for younger audiences. As individuals grow older, they can learn to assess movie ratings and content warnings to make informed decisions about what to watch. If there are concerns about the appropriateness of a movie or book, it is important to communicate these concerns with the librarian and discuss possible solutions.  In conclusion, while there may be some material that some individuals find offensive or inappropriate, there are always alternative options available. If a particular book or movie does not align with your values or preferences, it is best to return it to the library and seek out something more suitable. Ultimately, everyone should have the freedom to choose what they want to read or watch, based on their own judgment and comfort level.
839	3816	2	3	Should books, music, movies, and magazines be removed if found offensive? I believe that they should be put to a vote for everyone who frequents the library to decide. The staff may have their own opinions, but ultimately, it is the library's patrons who will be reading or consuming these materials. What one person finds offensive, another may not. It is essential to consider the diverse beliefs and values of the community. Removing materials based on individual preferences could alienate certain groups of people and lead to a decline in library usage. Therefore, it is crucial to involve the community in the decision-making process to ensure that all voices are heard and respected. Ultimately, censorship should not be imposed without proper consideration of differing perspectives.
840	3817	2	3	Dear editor,  I feel strongly that we should not remove any movies, books, or music from our shelves. Doing so can lead to conflicts and potential legal issues.   I have witnessed the backlash that occurs when a book is taken off the shelf. People become upset, claiming censorship and threatening lawsuits. The legal process can be lengthy and costly, causing unnecessary strain.  Similarly, removing music from shelves can result in outrage and even violence. A simple decision to take down a piece of music can quickly escalate into a situation where a mob forms, causing damage and chaos.  It is vital that we maintain access to all forms of media. While some content may be controversial or offensive to some, the solution is not to remove it entirely. Censorship only leads to further problems and does not address the root issues.  I urge you to consider the consequences before removing any form of media. Let us keep our shelves open to a variety of perspectives and allow individuals to make their own choices. Thank you for your consideration.  Sincerely, @PERSON1
841	3818	2	3	I firmly believe that no material should be removed from library shelves. It is up to individuals to choose what they want to read, and there are age restrictions in place to prevent children from accessing inappropriate material. Removing offensive material would not solve anything, as people are already exposed to such content in other forms, such as violent video games. Additionally, censorship could lead to complaints and dissatisfaction among library users. Therefore, it is best to allow libraries to provide a wide range of material to cater to different interests and preferences.
842	3819	2	3	The author Katherine Paterson makes a very good point when she states that there are books on the shelf that people wish their kids or even themselves did not read, or that people wish they did not read. But if you were to take away every book someone found offensive, there would be hardly any books left in this world. There will always be one person that finds a book that they do not like because of the tone the author uses or if they do not like what characters call each other. People all have their own mindset on how they want to live or how they want their kids to live.   Having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves. I feel like if there are books on the shelves about kids drinking and the bad effects it has on their lives, then maybe the kid reading it would stop drinking or not even try drinking. Books about getting raped and not telling because they are afraid of what would happen, then in the long run telling after they get pregnant or injured from it. Them saying that they wish they would have told might help the kids that this happened to, or this might happen to might help them feel relief and tell someone and save themselves. Books like these should not get taken off the shelf because one person does not like it, in the long run if they did take it off some could get hurt or not know what to do, and it could be all that one person that did not like it's fault. How would you feel if you did that to someone. Maryrin @CAPS1 is a good author that shows how something that you @MONTH1 think is good but turns out to be really bad. Her books focus a lot on how girls need to watch what they are doing to keep themselves safe.   I have a friend that has parents that do not like the music on her iPod. So she had to take it off. Well with taking it off she made @CAPS2 of the songs that they did not like. She drives so the music is always playing on the radio while she drives so she can listen to the songs that she does not have on her iPod. That is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear. Music will always be out there. There will always be songs that people do not like, either due to their religion or even if they do not like the words used. But even if they stop putting songs on the radio, there is still the internet out there and people can just get their songs from there.   There are songs out there that should not be out there, but the more someone tries to push the songs out of the world and out of people listening to them, the more some kids or even adults are going to try to listen to them. In the world today, there are always a good and a bad song that is the same. Artists now always have a bad song that they would have to make into a good song. That is just how the songs go. That is just how they use their brains. No one can stop them, not even the people that publish the songs and put them on the radio.   In the long run of things, the more people try to stop things from not being in this world, the more people are going to try to get them. It is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio. People need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone. A kid @MONTH1 grow up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understand what bad could come out of it. But when they read a book about a kid their age getting kidnapped they @MONTH1 understand more clearly on the whys in life.   So if I can say so myself, I think that it is a very bad idea for books to be taken off the shelf because one mother or two dads think that book is not good for their little girl or their teenage son. They need to read it for themselves and find out what really could happen if they did something like that. Keep the books on the shelf. Let the radio play. Let your kids or grandchildren find out the danger on their own rather than you just keep telling them. I am a teenage girl and I would rather read about it than having my parents tell me over and over again. So keep the books on the shelves. Let the radio play. Just be safe in doing it.
843	3820	2	3	Should books, magazines, music, and movies be removed from shelves, if found offensive? I think the answer is yes, as long as it offends more than a few people. If it only offends a few people, then I think the answer should be no.  Why should they be removed if they offend a lot of people? They should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things. It's almost like when people were segregated by race. The segregation led to fights between the people. How would you feel if segregation was still around? You might be upset and find it unfair, because you cannot do some things. That is probably how some people feel when they get offended by the media.  Why shouldn't they be removed for offending a few people? They shouldn't be removed because they might be able to help younger generations decide what is right and wrong. They could help by giving the people choices of what is right and what is wrong. If there was nothing out there that offended anyone, how would younger generations learn how to decide what is right and wrong?  In my opinion, it all depends on how many people are offended by it. There are ups and downs either way it goes. If you removed everything that offended anyone, it would be harder to teach younger generations to decide what is right and wrong by themselves. This would mainly be because you would only have one point of view, the point of view that is perfect for everybody. The way I see it, that point of view does not exist. Therefore, I believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone, we would not have a media. However, if we did not remove anything that was offensive, serious issues could occur. For example, fights could break out or wars could even start, depending on how many people were offended. The last thing we need in our society is fighting. So my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no.
844	3821	2	3	"Everybody should have the freedom to make their own decisions, including choosing what books their children can read. However, this should not extend to censoring books for everyone else. While some books may be offensive to certain groups, removing them from libraries limits access to important literature that could be beneficial for research and education. Books like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" have faced criticism but are now valued for their literary contributions. Authors work hard to create these works, and it is unjust to ban them based on individual preferences. Libraries should remain spaces of exploration and learning, not restriction. It is essential to preserve a diverse range of literature for the benefit of future generations."
845	3822	2	3	Libraries are often considered safe spaces for children, but they can also provide access to potentially harmful content. With a library card, children can check out a wide range of materials that may contain inappropriate or confusing information. While parents may trust that publishing companies filter out unsuitable content, ultimately, it is up to the library to decide what can be accessed. Adults may better understand the complexities of certain books, but this does not guarantee that children will not come across material that is beyond their comprehension. Some may suggest segregating libraries by age groups, but this does not prevent children from being exposed to questionable media outside of the library. The most effective solution is to implement strict censorship measures to prevent offensive or easily misunderstood material from entering libraries. While libraries are valuable for research and education, it is essential to ensure that they maintain a safe and educational environment for children by carefully monitoring the content available to them.
846	3823	2	3	I don't believe that materials should be removed just because they are found offensive. People have the option to ignore something if it offends them, or they can voice their concerns. In libraries, it should be up to the staff to decide if a material should be removed due to offensiveness. Ultimately, it is important to consider different perspectives and handle the situation appropriately.
847	3824	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a contentious issue that has been debated for years. While some may feel uncomfortable with certain books that address sensitive topics such as religion, appearance, or ethnicity, it is important to remember that everyone is different. Removing books from shelves based on personal discomfort could ultimately lead to a lack of diverse literature available to readers. It is crucial to embrace the fact that people have varying beliefs, appearances, and backgrounds, and that diversity should be celebrated rather than shunned. By allowing all types of books to remain on shelves, we can encourage open-mindedness and acceptance of different perspectives. In the end, it is essential to remember that everyone has a right to their own voice and story, even if it may challenge our own beliefs or make us uncomfortable.
848	3825	2	3	It has been brought to my attention by some members of my community that the local library is planning to remove some materials such as our books, movies, and music. I've confronted them and they've made no such effort as to amend the censorship that has already taken place. I understand that some works may be found offensive to some audiences, but I believe all people should have access to the knowledge they wish to acquire.   These works they wish to condemn and banish are works of passion and labor. What I've noticed is, the materials they view as compromising are some of the most passionate, heartfelt labors of expression; and I firmly believe this removal act hurts more than those that are banished. This denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something simple, our own expression.  The capabilities of the human mind are limitless, but yet those who display its functions are limited. Knowledge is the key to unlocking a much more vast understanding of the world around us and I believe this censorship highlights what I attempt to depict in my own exposition of our minds. I believe we have come very far in the evolution of our literature and I would hate to see the flame of inspiration for creation snuffed out in a modest dash. Just out of a few broken heartstrings? Or a spare tear lost upon the earth, dusted by some ignorance forsaken, misunderstood language doomed to be lost; out of a loss of understanding? I think not.  In conclusion, I've noted what I wish to converse and I firmly stand against this censorship. I'm only one voice, but this is a call to arms and I believe we can accomplish great things together. So let's get the word out and defeat this repression of expression. Let us fight to preserve the freedom of artistic expression and ensure that all voices can be heard, valued, and shared for the betterment of our society.
849	3826	2	3	Knowledge is power, and access to information should be unrestricted in a free society. Censorship in libraries undermines our freedom to explore diverse perspectives and make informed decisions. It is crucial to uphold the principles of free speech and intellectual freedom, even when faced with materials that may be considered controversial or offensive. By allowing individuals to choose what they read, watch, and listen to, we preserve the essence of democracy and protect our fundamental rights. Let us continue to defend the integrity of our libraries and resist any attempts to control or limit the flow of information. Our intellectual freedom is non-negotiable, and we must safeguard it for the generations to come.
850	3827	2	3	A library is a place where people can rent books, music, movies, and other materials they don't have at home. It is not necessarily a bad thing if a library contains offensive materials, as individuals can choose to avoid those sections. If offensive materials are present, age restrictions could be implemented to control access. Parents play a crucial role in guiding their children's library choices and teaching them to avoid inappropriate content. Removing offensive materials could harm the library's business and ability to purchase new materials. Therefore, it is important to establish guidelines rather than banning such materials entirely. Libraries should prioritize providing diverse content while also considering the preferences and sensitivities of their patrons.
851	3828	2	3	To begin with, a woman might read a book about wifes and find it offense. But it was her choice to pick up the book and read it. Should it be taken off the shelf? No why should it. Different people have different perpectives on what they're reading. Not all people feel the same way. Samething goes for music, movies, magazines, etc. They might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it. It was there choice to pick it up and read it. No one held a gun to there head and said 'read the book etc.'  @CAPS1, why should a book, etc., be taken off the shelf if one person doesn't like it? You still have the rest of the population who might love it, some might just like it, and the ones who don't. You can't just think about that one person you have to consider everybody esle. If that person finds that book, etc., offensive then they should have chosen wisely the first time and/or never should have chose what they did. It's there own fault.  For my conclusion, nothing should be taken off the shelf if its offensive just don't read the book and etc. Another person might read it and like it. Some people who finds things offensive are maybe looking at it in the wrong way. Keep the book etc., on the shelf if they take it off then sooner or later they will take everything off the shelf for being offensive. Then what we will be able to read or listen too.
852	3829	2	3	There is much censorship that occurs in the world, from music on the radio to television shows and the internet. However, the library remains a place where one's mind can explore and discover freely. Censorship in libraries should be non-existent to allow for unrestricted discovery and learning. Books provide valuable lessons through their various endings and experiences of characters. History is often repeated, so it is crucial to have access to all types of literature to learn from past mistakes. While some may fear inappropriate language or scenes in books, it is better to gradually understand the realities of the world through reading and personal experiences. A library should be a place of wondrous learning, where all books have the opportunity to be learned from without restrictions. Ultimately, reading allows individuals to experience life and gain valuable insights without facing the consequences firsthand.
853	3830	2	3	Have you ever felt like your reading options are diminishing? Censorship is restricting our freedom to choose what we read, watch, or listen to. Who has the authority to dictate what we can or cannot access? As a passionate reader of various genres, I strongly oppose censorship. It is essential for children to have the opportunity to explore different ideas and perspectives through reading. Banned books often offer valuable insights and should not be withheld from readers.   While age restrictions on certain books may be necessary, completely removing them from shelves limits our fundamental right as citizens to access diverse literature. Reading exposes us to new cultures and experiences beyond our own, fostering critical thinking and empathy. Although some level of censorship in music and television may be warranted to protect younger audiences, controlling what they consume is becoming increasingly challenging in the digital age.   Many children today have unrestricted access to the internet, which can be both beneficial and harmful. Parents can use parental controls to limit exposure to inappropriate content online. While kids often gravitate towards internet and TV, those who enjoy reading should have a wide range of literary choices, including fiction, classics, and educational material.   Are our reading options dwindling? Yes, and censorship plays a significant role in this decline. Classics are being labeled as offensive or explicit, depriving readers of valuable works. Everyone should have the freedom to choose their reading material without restrictions. Let individuals decide what they want to read, whenever they want to read it.
854	3831	2	3	'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?'  No, I do not believe just because someone individually finds something offensive means everyone else does.  Everyone has a different opinion, we're all different.  We need variety of all books, music, movies, magazines, etc..  Censorship is understandable, in some ways.  Without a variety for all would leave everyone less choice.       Your opinions, decisions, outlook on life yourself is one of a kind.  How are you to tell someone they can't listen to a certain song or read a specific book?  Exactly, that doesn't make sense right?  If individuals didn't have options of choices there would be no entertainment.  In my opinion; if someone has such a problem with a certain topic, subject, etc. then leave it alone.  It's a big world with more than just you with your opinion.  Be open minded!     Someone else is probably writing this essay with the total opposite response to this prompt.  It just goes to show no ones opinion is right or wrong.  Individuals should all have individuality.  Without variety, how is that possible? From music, books, magazines, movies, etc.- disagreements are one thing but in questions like this you have to agree to disagree.  Different perspectives and diverse opinions enrich our society and contribute to a more open and inclusive world. Let's embrace diversity and respect each other's choices, even if they differ from our own.
855	3832	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work i abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson said this about the topic of book censorship in the library. This is a very tricky subject because no one will ever be happy. All books, music, movies, magazines, etc. can be considered offensive to someone.  When it comes to books in the library we should have sections. One for adult, child, family, activity, romance, etc. if we have those then it would cut down on what books children can look at. Parents need to monitor what their kids look at, or even what part of the library they go into. If a child wanders into the romance section then they are going to see that kind of book, it is not the library's fault or even the fault of the writer.  Parents need to set boundaries. They could say 'Do not leave this section.' If the parent does not want to monitor what the child looks at they could set boundaries. If my mom said that to me I would stay around the child books. The parents could monitor the child to solve the problem.  Libraries need to decide what kind of books they are going to have on the shelves. If the library does not have the kind of books you do not want your child to see then your child cannot look at that book. If your public library does keep those books in the open, the parents could always go to a town hall and tell the mayor, librarian, or other townspeople about the inappropriate books.  If you do not like what the library has on the shelves, suggest sections for the books, keep watch of what your kids look at, or tell someone that can do something about the problem. What are you going to do to improve your public library? How are you going to make your kids not go and look at the books you don't want them to see? In conclusion, it is essential for parents to take an active role in monitoring what their children read and for libraries to consider the diverse preferences of their patrons when selecting books for their shelves.
856	3833	2	3	"Censorship in libraries should not be mandated. Censorship should not block the 'allegory' in some books that the author is trying to give a story within a story to the reader. Censorship would lead to a stifling of creativity and expression, much like in George Orwell's ""1984"". Without the freedom to explore deeper meanings and interpretations in literature and art, we would be limiting our own understanding and appreciation of the world around us.  The word ""allegory"" refers to a story within a story, where the author conveys deeper messages and themes. For example, in William Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"", the allegory of the fall of man is depicted through the boys' descent into savagery on a deserted island. Censoring such works would rob readers of the opportunity to delve into complex ideas and viewpoints, hindering intellectual growth.  Art, too, should be free from censorship. Artists often use abstract and controversial themes to provoke thought and discussion. For instance, during his dark period, Francisco Goya painted disturbing images of demons, reflecting the turmoil of his time. Censoring such works would erase important historical and cultural context, depriving society of valuable insights.  Censorship, as depicted in Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"", can lead to a society devoid of individuality and critical thinking. By controlling information and ideas, the government in the novel maintains power over the masses. If we allow censorship to dictate what we can read and see, we risk losing our identities and freedoms.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries would hinder our ability to explore diverse perspectives and ideas in literature and art. It is essential to protect the freedom of expression and allow for the unimpeded exchange of thoughts and creativity. Let us embrace the richness and complexity of allegorical works and artistic expressions, without the constraints of censorship."
857	3834	2	3	Bad content, whether in the form of music, TV shows, or magazines, should not be accessible to young children. Parents should be vigilant in monitoring what their children are exposed to and take action to limit harmful influences. Inappropriate lyrics, explicit images, and violent themes can have a negative impact on impressionable minds. By regulating what children are exposed to, parents can protect their innocence and promote a healthy environment for growth. It is crucial to consider the long-term effects of allowing children to consume inappropriate content, as it can shape their beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes in the future. Ultimately, prioritizing the well-being of children by filtering out harmful content is essential for their overall development and well-being.
858	3835	2	3	I believe that everyone should have the freedom to choose what they read, watch, or listen to. Publicly available materials should be accessible to all, with parents having the ultimate responsibility for monitoring their children's exposure to certain content. Books, movies, and music are forms of entertainment, and people should be able to enjoy them without unnecessary restrictions. The public library is a valuable resource for learning and exploration, and censoring materials could deprive individuals of important knowledge and perspectives. Ultimately, it is important to allow individuals the freedom to make their own choices when it comes to accessing information and entertainment.
859	3836	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 many people believe that certain books should be banned from schools, just the opposite is true as students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, get a deeper understanding of the past, and comprehend the true meaning of an author's unique style.     Over the years many well-written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library.  'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive.  These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader.  While one reader @MONTH1 love the story and wear out the pages, another @MONTH1 get halfway through and never finish it.  However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct.     'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a classic example of a censored book.  Throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some.  However, at the period of time the book was written, these words were not considered to be wrong.  Books like this should be saved for older generations to read; however, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it.  None-the-less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response.     Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'?  Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way.  They are a tool of knowledge.  Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge.  Every story has a unique style, which @MONTH1 appeal to some and not to others.  Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written.     '@ORGANIZATION2' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story.  How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books?  They often state that it is their favorite book of all time.  If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it.     Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions.  How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp?  If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons.  Therefore, it is crucial to preserve the freedom of choice in reading and allow students the opportunity to explore different perspectives and styles through literature.
860	3837	2	3	I feel that there should not be censorship in libraries. All offensive material, as much as the more conservative patrons may not like it, should stay where they belong, which is in the library for all to read. I have several reasons I feel support my opinion about not removing material found offensive by some. My biggest reason is the learning capabilities these articles offer. Most works, even the more crude pieces, have some sort of educational value. Without articles based on the less comfortable or more gruesome items of life, people start to only understand in a surreal sort of way, not understanding how the less fortunate things function or how to avoid them. Those who pursue a true wanting to gain knowledge will look at many different kinds of informational items, no matter the subject. Allowing this to occur is allowing the library to be used as in the way it was meant to be used for, a resource for knowledge. All offensive items a library may have stored should stay in that very spot, for learning purposes. No one should be denied the ability to learn just because of the shielding nature of others.
861	3838	2	3	All of us can think of or have this one book that we read and hope none of our children or any other children have taken it off a shelf. Well at least I know I have a book like that, its called '@CAPS1'. I, myself personally feel that this book should be removed from the shelves because for the simple fact it is over-rated and contains lots of violence and sex. A while back when I was in the seventh grade, I read this book called, '@CAPS1'. I was a good book but it was also very explicit. The book was mainly about this teen who had a rough childhood and was trying to make it through high school while being engaged in an abusive relationship, peer pressure, and addiction to sex and drugs. This book was exposing and very detailed, In which I strongly disagree with other children reading this book. I feel sex and violence shouldn't be displayed in books or any other type of media. In conclusion, I believe that certain materials such as books should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Books that display lots of sex and violence should be restricted and not able to leave the shelves of the library unless they are issued to someone eighteen or older.
862	3839	2	3	I am writing to the newspaper to express my concern about the removal of certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more from shelves. I firmly believe that such censorship should not be allowed for various reasons.  Firstly, consider the scenario where a parent wants to share a beloved childhood movie or book with their own child, only to find that it has been removed from circulation. This situation can be disheartening and robs individuals of the opportunity to pass down cherished memories and experiences to the next generation.  Secondly, imagine the disappointment of a couple who have a favorite song that holds sentimental value to them, only to discover that it has been taken off the shelves. This kind of removal can be emotionally devastating and diminish the joy associated with special moments shared through music.  Lastly, it is important to recognize that everyone has their own unique opinions and preferences. If someone does not wish to engage with certain materials, they have the option to simply avoid them. Allowing for the removal of content based on individual preferences sets a dangerous precedent and can lead to a slippery slope where more and more items are censored.  In conclusion, as Katherine Paterson aptly put it, if we allow for the unrestricted removal of materials, we risk losing access to a wide range of content that may hold value for different individuals. It is essential to uphold the freedom of expression and ensure that diverse perspectives and experiences are preserved for the benefit of all. Therefore, I firmly oppose the idea of allowing people to remove anything from shelves based on personal preferences.
863	3840	2	3	Should we censor books in libraries? Katherine Paterson, an author, once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson provides a very valid point. If we start taking off books that we find offensive, there will be none left. Books are meant to provide information and insight into someone's life. If we take away that book, it would be like saying that person's idea did not matter. The main reasons why we should not show censorship in libraries are a loss of insight, books, and personal creativity.  Books provide insight into the author's life. Also the things that are happening in history affect the author's tone or style, like Shakespeare. During his lifetime, England was ruled by kings, so if he wanted to be successful, he had to appease the monarchy. It also helped appeasing the monarchy since he was sponsoring Shakespeare's plays. Another example of an author influenced by his time and upbringing would be Chaucer. He was alive during the middle ages, and he constantly saw oppressive things like serfs. When he wrote his tales, he made the high class people sort of mean while he made the lower caste people on the humbler side. Chaucer was not afraid to displease the monarchy.  If we start taking off books from shelves in a library that we think are offensive then soon there would not be any as Katherine Paterson said. Where one might find information, another might find it highly offensive and vice versa. Every book would have someone say it was offensive. It might be the context or the tone or even the person who wrote it; it does not matter. Sometimes the books that are the most informative are the ones that are offensive. However sometimes it is good to have offensive things in books. It builds the tone and mood of the story or character. It might create a certain image. It also teaches us not to what these people are doing. The books sometimes show us a depressing ending of a person who lived a vulgar or criminal life. These stories teaches us life lessons. Yes sometimes I read a book that I find offensive, but I have learned that if I do not like does not mean someone else does not. It would not be fair then to take off a book that someone might have learned something from just because you do not like it. I am sorry, the world does not revolve solely around you and me. It revolves us as a whole, and if someones starts taking off books, who is to stop someone else from doing the same. It would not be fair.  Finally, if we started taking off books, it would start influencing kids in thinking it was okay to throw away someone's creativity. It also make them think that there ideas would not matter and no one would be able to appreciate them. I for one do not like doing things, if they might offend someone. I could not imagine what it would be like in that type of society.  Books are important to have. They teach us about events or people who were before our time or problems some people experience. It is important to be aware of what is going on around you. I grew up ignorant of big problems that were occurring in society. My parents tried to shield me from the bad news and creeps in society. Reading books is what opened my eyes to what life is really like. So taking off books from shelves would have hindered the process of me growing up. I would still be that ignorant little child thinking that life ends in a happily ever after. Unfortunately most do not, but there are some that have a happy life. That is what books are for, to teach people about other people's experiences, the good and the bad. So Katherine Paterson was wise in her observation. Who is to stop someone from taking off books once this process has started?
864	3841	2	3	Books, movies, and music should not be removed from shelves in libraries. While some of these materials may be vulgar or offensive, a solution could be implementing an age checkout law. This way, certain age groups can access appropriate content based on their maturity level. There are individuals who enjoy consuming controversial content, but it should be restricted to the appropriate audience. Parents should take responsibility for monitoring what their children read, and they could sign out books that may be deemed inappropriate for their age. By implementing these measures, libraries can maintain a controlled environment while still providing a variety of materials for the public. This approach ensures that everyone can access content suitable for their age and preferences, creating a balanced and regulated library experience for all.
865	3842	2	3	Let's consider the impact of the accessibility of various media on children and teenagers today. While teenagers may argue that the content should not be removed from shelves, adults may feel differently. The music and movies available to young people may not always be the best in terms of content. This easy access to potentially inappropriate material could contribute to academic struggles among students. Therefore, it may be beneficial to remove offensive content from shelves and replace it with more educational material. It is important to guide children and teens towards making responsible choices in what they listen to and watch. By teaching them right from wrong and engaging in conversations with them, adults can positively influence their development and academic performance. By instilling discipline and setting boundaries, parents can help children make better choices when it comes to media consumption. Ultimately, by promoting a more positive and educational environment, we can support the academic success and overall well-being of young individuals.
866	3843	2	3	When you are taking your little kid to the library because they want a book you think 'hmmm, there isn't anything bad at the library its all education books.' @CAPS1 would you feel if your child wanted to check out a movie there? You would be ok with it because no one thinks there are bad images or movies at the library. A little girl could be with her mom at the library in the adult section and they could see some things you would not want them to see. The romance books usually have girls on there half-clothed and the guys in basically nothing. A child could easily see that and not know what it meant but they would have that image in their head for a very long time. Some of the kids could go up to the movies section and pull out a scary movie that shows blood and guns. It's not just the kids seeing the stuff, it's everyone. A teen could easily get a book and not be paying attention and see stuff about the other gender. A couple could go in the library trying to find a good healthy funny movie, but could find a movie that would make them uncomfortable. An older person could try to find some music from back in their time but when they get it, all of it is about drugs, sex, or even alcohol. The magazines always have girls half-clothed, even in seventeen magazine. The car magazines of girls modeling in front of the cars to make them look better or irresistible. You can get a baby magazine and it shows a mom breastfeeding. You could have just wanted to look at it because of the babies you or your child do not want to see a mom breastfeeding. The library is a very resourceful place and you can get very good information about things there. They have some bad parts about them too. I think the music that talks about personal things and bad things should be in its own little place. Same with the magazines, movies, and books they should all be in a room together away from all the rest of the items in the library. They should have an age limit you have to be to be able to go in that room. They should tell you what type of stuff is in there before you go in. I'm not saying the library is a bad place for kids or teens or anyone. I just think that certain books, music, and magazines should be kept in a different place instead of out in the open where everyone can see them.
867	3844	2	3	Libraries are stocked with a variety of reading materials, from books to magazines to catalogs. While not all of these materials may be appropriate for all audiences, it is important to keep them available in libraries for a variety of reasons.   One personal experience I had in seventh grade involved reading a book that covered a difficult topic like sexual abuse. While it was a frightening read, it taught me important lessons about safety and awareness. This highlights the value of exposing children to real-life issues in a controlled and educational manner.   From classic literature to religious texts, libraries offer a wide range of stories for different audiences. While categorization helps guide readers towards age-appropriate content, measures like age restrictions for certain materials could further protect children from accessing inappropriate books.   Another suggestion is to label books with mature content, similar to the system used for movies and video games. This could serve as a warning for readers and encourage them to make informed choices.   In conclusion, as author Katherine Paterson notes, the right to remove books from shelves could lead to a lack of diverse reading materials for everyone. Instead, it is important to provide access to a variety of books while implementing measures to guide children towards appropriate content. This approach balances the need for diverse literature with the protection of young readers.
868	3845	2	3	I think that if it is a problem for others and not all why can't we just separate the things in sections. That way there would be no problems. I mean, why change something if only a few people don't like something? That's only going to lead to a big conflict. Think about if we were to try and give everyone what they want, would that work out not good at all. So you should just limit things down and put them in sections. This way, different preferences can be accommodated without causing unnecessary conflicts. It's important to consider the needs and opinions of others while finding a compromise that works for everyone involved. By organizing things into sections, we can create a more harmonious environment where everyone can coexist peacefully.
869	3846	2	3	Censorship, a very sensitive topic. There are so many things people dislike, so they censor them, hiding the ideas from those who are unaware. I personally detest censorship. I would prefer a world where people are educated about potential dangers rather than keeping everything hidden and safe.  Some may argue that certain topics need to be censored to protect children's minds. However, children will inevitably come across these topics in the real world at some point. Drugs, alcohol, sex, violence, and other sensitive subjects are common and children often learn about them in school or through peers. It may be better for them to learn about these topics in a controlled environment rather than being exposed to them without any prior knowledge.  While some may fear that exposing children to certain information at a young age could traumatize them, it is important to consider that not having any knowledge about these topics can also be harmful. It is better for children to be informed so they can make informed decisions and know how to react when faced with difficult situations.  Protecting children is important, but shielding them from important knowledge may actually put them at more risk. By educating children about potential dangers, they will be better equipped to navigate the complexities of the world. Life is full of risks, so it is essential to prepare children by providing them with the necessary information. In the end, knowledge is power, and it is better to be safe than sorry.
870	3847	2	3	As I walked through the library and bookstore as a young girl, I saw a magazine book that caught my eye. To my surprise, it contained content that I was not ready to see. This experience made me realize the importance of censorship in libraries and bookstores. While children need to learn about relationships and intimacy, it is ultimately the responsibility of parents to educate them on these topics. By censoring magazines and books, children are given the opportunity to discover who they are without being influenced by inappropriate content at a young age.   The media often portrays unrealistic standards of beauty and relationships, which can negatively impact children's self-perception and behavior. Magazines display images of super skinny models and sexualized content, leading children to believe that they must conform to these ideals. This pressure to grow up quickly can have detrimental effects on children's mental and emotional development.   Furthermore, books and movies that contain explicit content can make both children and their parents uncomfortable. By segregating such material into separate sections, parents are empowered to guide their children's exposure to these subjects. This approach allows children to mature at their own pace and gain a better understanding of complex topics like intimacy and relationships.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries and bookstores plays a crucial role in protecting children from harmful influences and promoting healthy development. It allows parents to take an active role in their children's education and ensures that young minds are not exposed to inappropriate content before they are ready. By implementing appropriate censorship measures, we can create a safer and more nurturing environment for children to grow up in.
871	3848	2	3	Katherine Paterson wrote, ''If I had the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor~~ then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.'' quote.Having the right to do something is a part of freedom of speech almost. Its believing in your decesion or choice you have made. If I were to reflect my views on censorship in libraries, we all would have that same oppurtunity to state our opinion about what we feel should not be included. There could be unappropriate books in the library that we absolutly would not want our younger group of siblings reading. The best thing is to ask ourselves, Should we have the right to take our kids freedom an right to read, listen to, updated media and publications from them when we had it? Should we put a censorship on the libraries really?     I feel that censoring a library would not be nessarry considering a library is a manual guide of history. Our libraries or organized from A to @CAPS1  in authors names, seperated from non fiction an fiction, cd's seperated in one section, movies one section, magazines, and adult books from children book seperated in diffrent sections. Libraries all across the world has had a kid that might have choose a book that was not appropriate for them to read but what kid hasn't. What would a book hurt them if theres plenty of  bad influces, peer presure, violence, and sexually publicity everywhere and @PERCENT1 in the media. It would not be fair at all for us to rob our kids of the chance to read and learn from books.     I feel no we should not take our learning form our babies. Growing up as a kid I loved being able to go to the library it helped to enhance my vocabulary, spelling and which I learned plenty new words. Books I read growing up wasn't perfectly @NUM1 but I could relate to alot of books I choose as a kid so no I feel we should not censor libraies we need them to be a fun place to our children and us to go to for learning, fun, confort and etc. We can't take that from our generation it just would not be right.

If you were in a library and you saw a book or anything that you took offensive, more than likely someone else will find it offensive too. So, by eliminating the problem before anyone else sees it, will reduce problems before they even happen. Now, more than ever, you will find offensive things in libraries. More people get offended by lesser things now.   One reason to have censorship in libraries is that, if you had a child, would you want them going to the library and seeing derogatory writings and movies? It's teaching them different values and it's teaching them that since it's in a library it must be okay to do out in the community. For example, if the library has a book or movie about doing drugs or anything sexual, they're going to look up to that and more than likely do those things, which they could end up harming themselves or others.   If the government provides the taxes for the libraries, doesn't it show that our government doesn't care about the offensive items on the shelves? It gives them a bad name. If we look to our government for support and answers. How would we feel if they had no judgment about the offensive things in libraries? It would seem like they didn't care and that might cause panic throughout the country. Which would cause many more problems then needed. It would be an easier thing just to censor our libraries.   If our libraries weren't consumed with negative and offensive literature, we would have a lot more room for things of greater value. We could have books and movies that are educational and will actually teach a person something. Rather than, lead them into making bad decisions. There are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it. Not just the library has books. You could find one quite easily if you tried. If a library does have offensive things, I think they wouldn't have a large variety, so it would be a better decision just to look for it elsewhere, where you could find a larger quantity of the subject you are looking for.   When I go to the library, I go there for educational books, not books that teach kids how to 'fill a bong' or 'different sex positions.' I highly disagree and I think it's a negative outlook on our society by putting those things in our future generation's hands to read. So by putting censorship in our libraries, not only will calm down some of the problems that are re-occurring in our communities, it just might eliminate the problem completely.
873	3850	2	3	There is a lot of different offensive content that can be found in various forms of media, but censorship is not the answer to address this issue. Instead of removing content, we should focus on better monitoring what children are exposed to and providing appropriate guidance and supervision. Implementing age restrictions on movies and educating parents on the content of media can also help in ensuring that children are not exposed to inappropriate material. Additionally, cleaning up explicit music lyrics and making sure that teachers are involved in educating children about what is suitable for them to watch can also be beneficial. It is important to find a balance between freedom of expression and protecting young audiences from harmful content in order to create a more responsible and informed society.
874	3851	2	3	A lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf. Well I believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library. All books are worth something toward anything like careers, and being able to learn new things. Magazines may not be as helpful as books, but they provide entertainment. Music can help keep you relaxed while reading, and movies can have a significant impact on individuals. Removing any form of media from shelves would limit people's access to diverse perspectives and knowledge. It is essential to have a wide range of books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries to cater to various interests and learning styles. People should take the time to truly understand what they are reading or watching, as these forms of media can offer valuable insights and lessons about life. It is crucial to appreciate the presence of authors and creators who contribute to the world of literature and entertainment. Ultimately, the availability of diverse media in libraries enriches our understanding of the world and enhances our overall learning experience.
875	3852	2	3	A library is a public place for all ages. They have many different kinds of books for specific reasons. For the children they have a nice comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it. For adults they have coffe tables, sofa seats, and many different things while they read their books. never should a library have to disclousre certain materials because of the ages that come in and out.              Censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive. I feel that when a child is in a library they should go to their specific areas for which they came for, they should also be monitored while in the library. Most kids woldn't go to a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures or colors in it any way. The library is a public place and is made for all ages, even though there are book stores that sell just adult books, movies, and magazines, they still shouldn't throw them out of a library. There should be equal rights all over, yes even in libraries.     The world is full of offensive things period. Now while a child a is not within a library they could be at home or in a public place and see things that they could also see in a book at the library. The removal of certain books, movies, and magazines wouldn't really stop anything. I think that if the parents teach thier children right from wrong there is nothing wrong with them being in a library that has adult books, movies, and magazines. If I owned a library I personally would not mind all kinds of books that are appropriate to a certain exstint in my selction of books. I have been to plenty of libraries and have seen stuff that I thought shouldn't be in thier but at the same I was not in my right section or doing what I was supposed to be doing. This subject really doesn't bother me, so no I don't think they should remover certain books just because children are in the library.   The library should remain a place where all individuals have access to a wide variety of materials, regardless of age. Censoring certain books or materials based on age would not effectively protect children from offensive content. It is important for parents to teach their children right from wrong and monitor their activities in the library. Ultimately, the presence of adult books, movies, and magazines should not be a reason to exclude them from library collections. Libraries should uphold equal rights and provide a diverse range of materials for all patrons to access and enjoy.
876	3853	2	3	Censorship restricts individuals from accessing certain forms of media or content based on age or other criteria, limiting their freedom of choice and expression. This can create a homogenous society where everyone is expected to conform to the same standards and beliefs. Just like how the Nazis controlled people's actions and thoughts, censorship can stifle individuality and diversity. By allowing people to explore different ideas and perspectives, we can celebrate the uniqueness that makes our world colorful and vibrant. Let's embrace diversity and reject censorship to ensure a society where everyone can freely express themselves and pursue their own interests.
877	3854	2	3	Everyone has different views on works of literature, whether it be books, magazines, movies, or music. If libraries were to remove this stuff from the shelves, they would be losing business, children, and the educational purpose of having them available.   Removing literature from libraries would result in a loss of business as people who enjoy those particular works may no longer visit. Additionally, the decision to remove older pieces of work that may offend younger generations could hinder the opportunity for them to learn about historical contexts, such as the struggles of the past like slavery.  Children who use libraries would also be negatively impacted by the absence of diverse literature. Without access to a variety of materials, they may grow up with a limited understanding of different perspectives and historical events. This lack of exposure could lead to a narrow worldview and a disinterest in learning about important historical events.  Ultimately, literature is meant to educate and enlighten readers about different aspects of life. By keeping a diverse range of works on their shelves, libraries can continue to serve their purpose of providing knowledge and understanding to people of all ages. It is essential to preserve these pieces of literature to ensure that future generations have the opportunity to learn from the past and broaden their horizons.
878	3855	2	3	I feel that there should be censorship in libraries. Children should not be able to access certain books that are not appropriate for their age group. This can prevent them from getting into trouble or misunderstanding the content. Just like stores have restrictions on certain items based on age, libraries should also have censorship to ensure that children are only exposed to suitable material. Public libraries should be a safe space for everyone, and censorship can help maintain that by regulating what is available for different age groups. Overall, implementing censorship in libraries can help create a more inclusive and appropriate environment for all patrons.
879	3856	2	3	The library is a place for people to explore various topics through reading, whether for enjoyment or information. While some materials may be deemed inappropriate by certain individuals, they can still offer valuable insights and perspectives to others. It is essential to recognize that freedom of expression allows for a diverse range of content to be available in libraries, including discussions on sensitive subjects like sexuality and substance abuse. These materials can serve as educational tools by shedding light on the consequences of such behaviors.  However, there are limits to what should be acceptable, particularly when it comes to promoting discrimination or bullying based on race or disabilities. It is crucial to consider the impact such content can have on vulnerable populations and work towards fostering a more inclusive and compassionate society. While individuals may have the right to express their opinions, it is important to be mindful of the potential harm that can result from spreading hateful or hurtful messages.  In conclusion, while the library offers a space for diverse perspectives and ideas, it is essential to approach controversial topics with sensitivity and empathy. By promoting understanding and respect for all individuals, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone.
880	3857	2	3	I think that some material should be removed from the shelves if they are racist or contain unsightly images. But that brings up the question about racism almost all of the classic books have some form of racism in them such as To Kill a Mockingbird; that book uses the derogatory word to describe African Americans, but when that book was published that was common talk. Nowadays, people look down upon the use of such language.  For the most part, though, books are not all that offensive, at least none of the books I have read. I know that there are books and magazines such as Playboy and Maxim that are offensive to women, but there are laws regulating who can purchase such material. During World War II in Germany, many books were banned for various reasons, including anything related to Catholicism or beliefs contrary to the regime.  As for me being Catholic, there is a list of forbidden books that I am not supposed to read. I can see how some books could be banned, especially those that are rude and vulgar. Regarding music, I believe that songs promoting violence or racism, such as those by the Arian Brotherhood, should not be allowed in libraries. However, I do not think movies should be banned for violence, but pornography should not be allowed in libraries.  I agree with Katherine Paterson that everyone has the right to their own opinions, but if we start banning books based on offense, soon there may be no books left on library shelves. My personal view on what is offensive is relaxed, and I do not get offended easily. It is important to find a balance between protecting individuals from harmful material and preserving freedom of expression.
881	3858	2	3	"The @CAPS1 Materials      Have you ever came across a book that you thought was really good, but knew it might show certain offense to someone you know? My censorship on materials that show offense in libraries is they should not be taking off the shelves. People should have their own choice of books, and who has the right to tell someone what they should read. My opinion is that materials that may be offensive to certain individuals should not be taken off the shelf, but put in a certain section that says adult material such as books, music, movies, etc.   I myself have experienced not being able to get a certain movie because of my age. The book was called @CAPS2 @PERSON1, but it was just full of action/adventure. This was very unfair in my eyes, just because I was young I couldn't check out a certain movie. This was an experience that I have been through, which led me to my opinion that materials that might show offense to someone should not be removed.   Another reason that the materials should stay on the shelf is because many people like different things. No one is going to have the same interest all the time. So by taking materials away is just helping one person, but hurting many by taking something they may be interested in. I can understand that people have been through things, and might not be happy that offensive materials are around. Then again, I think all materials are not the same; they can get the materials they enjoy, and leave the other materials up to other people to choose from.   In conclusion, I believe that materials that show offense to certain people should stay. The reason being is because the material that might show offense to an individual might just be very interesting to another person. This is a saying I heard before from the Ebony magazine, ""another person's junk may be someone else's treasure,"" which I believe is a good saying for this topic."
882	3859	2	3	I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves. What I think is that things should come with a rating because this is a free country and for someone to do something like that would be taking away someone's freedom of speech. Too many people have fought in the past for just simply freedom of speech. I think that if people rate the things that come out, then they will not go into the wrong hands. That's like saying they should have taken violent video games when it first came out off the market because it has violence in it, profane language, and guns that company would have lost a lot of money because it is inappropriate for kids. I think that parents shouldn't go buy a 1 or 2 years old something like that, but some parents do. It's not the creator's fault of the actions of how people react to whatever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responsible and make sure that whatever it is is supervised and carefully monitored. There's an old saying 'everything isn't made for everybody'. I strongly believe that. That saying is so true. Everybody doesn't like the same thing that someone else likes but it's okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for everybody and you can't force nothing on someone. Well, everything isn't appropriate for everyone; we all have our limits to everything and if you watch what kids watch and do then things won't be so inappropriate for this world. Certain books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age. When children read books like that, they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that's why it's their parents' responsibility to monitor what their children read because that's their job as parents to do, not the person who wrote the book because they may think they're writing to a much older group that can relate to what they're talking about but then again they're just speaking their mind and enforcing their freedom of speech right, one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for. I also feel that music helps us to express ourselves so if someone feels that the music is inappropriate for their child then they need to watch what their child is listening to. Music brings out the different moods in everybody. All magazines are not for everyone because as we all know there are adult magazines that produce certain imagery that children should not see, but you cannot blame the creator, only the buyer is at fault for leaving it in the wrong place after they're done with it. They're just people trying to make money off things that they know that people like.
883	3860	2	3	Don't you hate when you come across a book that you wish was never written? I'm sure we all come to that point in our lives, constant readers, or not. Like a quote I once read, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' - Katherine Paterson, Author If you ask me, I think there should be a certain authority to these books. Maybe if we could make a petition and have at least 100 people sign it then the book could be removed. All of this goes for music, movies, magazines, even bibles in libraries. I'm not saying we should make a law that says if one person doesn't like something then nobody should have the right to have it. But as a public if enough people all agree we shouldn't have something then maybe it's best that we don't. We all worry about our children, having to keep a constant eye on them making sure they're not getting into something they're not supposed to be in. The same goes for books and movies, even music and magazines nowadays, and for certain people, even bibles. Now don't get me wrong, I'm sure we all know that when a child goes to a library and tries to check out an 'inappropriate' book then the checkout counter will deny the child and take the book. But just think for a minute here, that doesn't mean the child can't go into the library, find a book, and just read it there. There's also the scenario where, mind me it might not be your child but with today's crime records then this is very probable, the child could grab a book, magazine, even a film and just steal it. In the long run, there are many things we can do to prevent things like this from happening. There could be an adult section of the library, not just for 'R' rated books or films but just a place where we can keep all the books we don't think children should be reading. Still, we should definitely have the option to petition off books we don't think our children should be reading. Think what you will, but this is my opinion of library censorship, hopefully it's yours now too.
884	3861	2	3	Why Should you be offended? The @CAPS1 is a place where you come and get what you like.The Libraries are organized for a reason,what I like is my preference.You don't have to look at it if you don't want to. Everyone has their own taste. Books, movies, music, and magazines are made for people to look at, read, watch, etc. People have a preference and they like to have it available when they want it. Libraries are a great use for that. People go to get what they like to watch, read, and listen. And other people should not get offended by what others like. Most Libraries are organized into sections for children, young adults, and adults. If there is material that you don't think is 'ok' for that section then you can ask for it to be moved to another section. But don't think something is offensive and make it be removed because you don't like it. How is that fair to others who might like it. If you are offended by a material that is in a section of the @CAPS1 that you think is not 'ok' then it's ok for it to be moved to another section. You don't have to look at something if you don't like it. Someone else might like it. Libraries are made for all people, and everyone has their own taste. Don't be offended by what others like.
885	3862	2	3	Libraries are a place for everyone, catering to a diverse range of readers with different preferences and interests. They provide access to a wide variety of books on various subjects, ensuring that there is something for everyone. While some may argue for the removal of certain books due to controversial or mature content, it is important to remember that individuals have different beliefs, values, and perspectives. Restricting access to certain books limits the freedom of readers to explore different ideas and viewpoints. Libraries should strive to maintain a balance, ensuring that books are appropriately categorized and displayed to suit the needs of all patrons. Ultimately, a library should be a place where individuals can freely choose what they want to read, without censorship or restrictions imposed by others.
886	3863	2	3	I believe everyone has the right to voice their own opinion on life. If we censor books, music, or movies because they are inappropriate, we silence a perspective that may stand out among the rest. This silencing prevents us from seeing life through another person's eyes. In the United States, we have the freedom of speech and press, allowing individuals to express their opinions without fear of retribution. While there are restrictions on what can be published, I believe that any idea, if allowed by the author, should be allowed to be read and understood in our own way.  Even if an idea is considered racist, sexist, biased, or controversial, it is essential to hear all voices to understand different perspectives. Censoring materials does not eliminate them from society; it simply drives people to find them elsewhere. With the rise of the internet, access to uncensored content is readily available. Therefore, it is crucial to allow all ideas to be heard, as they provide insights into the reasons behind hate and conflict. By exploring various viewpoints through literature, music, and movies, we can learn and grow as a society.  In conclusion, no material should be blocked from the public. Everyone has the right to express their opinions in their own way, and it is essential to embrace diverse perspectives to foster understanding and empathy.
887	3864	2	3	KEEP ALL BOOKS ON THE SHELF! It is essential to maintain a diverse collection in the library to cater to the varied interests and preferences of readers. While some content may be considered offensive or inappropriate by certain individuals, it is crucial to remember that what one person finds objectionable, another may find valuable or insightful. By segregating books based on content and ensuring appropriate categorization, libraries can accommodate a wide range of tastes without compromising on the availability of literature. It is important to strike a balance between protecting sensitive audiences, such as children, and preserving the freedom of choice for all readers. Ultimately, maintaining a comprehensive selection of books is vital for promoting literacy, education, and intellectual exploration. Let's keep all books on the shelf to uphold the principles of diversity, inclusivity, and intellectual freedom in our libraries.
888	3865	2	3	Katherine Paterson, an author, believed that books she wouldn't want her children to read should be removed from library shelves. However, I disagree with this viewpoint. In my experience, I learned the importance of access to all types of books when I helped a classmate find a book she had never encountered before. This book opened her eyes to new ideas and perspectives. Furthermore, some books are banned in certain places due to differing beliefs, but access to these books can be crucial for personal growth and understanding. Removing offensive books from libraries could deprive individuals of valuable learning opportunities and limit their exposure to diverse viewpoints. Ultimately, books have the power to change lives, and it is important to preserve access to a wide range of literature, even if some may find certain books offensive.
889	3866	2	3	I feel that a library can have any kind of book stating any kind of material. Its a library, a place where people go to get information. If you dont want your kid, or kids reading, watching, or listening to those kinds of material then you shouldn't have to let them read, listen to or watch any offensive material, untill they are at a certain age and are mature enough about it. It is a library, and they are gonna have a wide variety of books. I dont think any book should be removed just because someone gets offended or its to ghory or has to many curse words for your kid. Not everyone gets offended by the same things, or the same material. If you do then dont read that book or watch that movie, but that shouldn't mean it has to be taken off the shelf just because one person got offended by it. Libraries are made for the community and the people in it, not just one person. Other people might want to read or watch the material that some people get offended by. This is what I think on the censorship on the book, movies, music, magazine, etc. Its a library, they are going to have a bunch of material. If you find something offensive, be mature, put it back and find something else to read, watch or listen to.
890	3867	2	3	In a library, certain materials should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Individuals should be mature enough to avoid what upsets them, and children usually stick to appropriate sections. It is essential to respect freedom of expression and access to diverse content in libraries. Therefore, people should exercise discretion and self-regulation when encountering potentially offensive materials, rather than calling for their removal. This approach ensures a balanced and inclusive environment for all library users.
891	3868	2	3	Whose to say what is appropriate for whom? whose to judge right and wrong for anyone? It depends on a point of view like most things. The sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as, not to stick forks in outlets, then they won't be as curious when they are older. Being sheltered is not always a good thing and censorship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridiculous, and disrespectful to authors.  In matters of censorship, I find it to be pointless. Censorship doesn't prevent your kids from learning about anything, except mother won't let me watch that. it just keeps your kids more curious and more obligated to hide things from you and like they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you. Causes children to go behind your back more and when they're in trouble they'll ask if you're the last place where they can ask for help, where you should be their first resort.  No, I do not believe that libraries should censor anything. It's altering an author's work. How would it feel if you had written something and it had been published and was in the library and didn't like something about it so they decided to just bleep it out or not allow certain people to read it? I believe censorship should be illegal not required.  Sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing and discovering the real world. The idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children will in most cases cause them to rebel and in other cases leave them unprepared for the future and the real world. Wouldn't you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of telling them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language? Or make them feel like a bad person for doing something your grandparents did when they were young?  I conclude that censorship is unjust, unfair, and is the real wrong. Not the profanity or the violence that will one day be a part of their life in some way. You don't go through everyday in the 'real world' with a mindset of there's nothing wrong in this world. Or everything is censored and everything is controlled. I believe censorship is just another way of controlling the mind through nurture.
892	3869	2	3	I believe that it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for offensive reasons. I feel this way for several reasons, but three in particular. First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make.  First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading, and removing an item will let down the customer. People come to libraries to look at what they're interested in to entertain themselves. @CAPS1 should be all types of literation in the library for all types of people, because everyone doesn't think alike. Every time an item is removed off of a shelf, @CAPS1 will be an unsatisfied customer.  Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Libraries always have some type of organization. In order to not offend anyone, items should be divided into their own categories inside their own sections. This solution will prevent anyone from seeing something that offends them. If that doesn't help, librarians should post a sign stating what type of objects are inside on the front door, so everyone knows before they enter.  Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. A customers' needs and wants should be met at all times, unless a customer is trying to run the business as if it was their own. If a particular library chooses to have certain types of items, because they know what readers' like, then no one else should involve themselves. If I owned a library, I would be upset if a customer removed a book off a shelf, because they would be interfering with my business.  In conclusion, I believe it is unnecessary to remove items off shelves for three reasons. First, it @MONTH1 be a book, movie, or magazine that someone plans on reading. Second, @CAPS1 are many solutions to try out before taking an item away. Last, customers have to accept some decisions a business decides to make. I believe I expressed my opinion to the fullest. Although some people @MONTH1 disagree with the way I feel, I'm sticking with it. @CAPS1 definitely wouldn't be any books left for any of us if items were removed for offensive reasons.
893	3870	2	3	Newspaper company,  I am writing to express my views on why certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. I believe that censorship in libraries is necessary to protect individuals from harmful and offensive content.  I firmly believe that no book should be removed from any library shelf based on people's opinions on religion, race, or any other sensitive topics. However, if a book contains language or content that is meant to harm or offend others, then it should be considered for removal. For example, if a book contains derogatory language towards certain groups of people, it should not be available for public consumption.  When it comes to children's access to books, parents should take responsibility for monitoring what their children read. Children should be guided on appropriate reading materials and taught to respect others' beliefs and opinions. If a book is deemed inappropriate for a child's age group, it should be the parents' responsibility to ensure that their child does not have access to it.  In conclusion, I believe that while freedom of speech is important, it should not come at the expense of causing harm or offense to others. Censorship in libraries is necessary to protect individuals from harmful content, and books that contain offensive language or messages should be considered for removal. Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this matter.  Sincerely,   [Your Name]
894	3871	2	3	There are no universally evil books that should be banned from readers. Censorship is a harmful practice that restricts the freedom of speech and limits the knowledge that can be gained from different perspectives. Everyone has their own opinions and tastes, so it is important to allow individuals to choose what they want to read without interference. Libraries offer a wide range of books to cater to diverse preferences, and banning certain materials would only limit the opportunity for people to learn and grow. The freedom of expression, as protected by the Constitution, should be upheld to ensure that individuals have the right to access a variety of literary works. In conclusion, censorship should be prohibited as it goes against the principles of freedom and diversity in reading materials.
895	3872	2	3	Dear @CAPS1,  @CAPS2, is it safe to draw the line on what kids should or should not see in the world? What influences children to behave better: being sheltered from life or being knowledgeable about what is happening in the world? I believe it is crucial for children to be well-rounded, both academically and street smart. In today's technology-driven age, children are often overly sheltered and disconnected from the real world. While it is important to protect children from harmful content, completely shielding them from reality may hinder their ability to navigate the complexities of life.  Children are growing up in a digital era where computers, laptops, and gaming systems dominate their daily lives. It is essential for children to understand the importance of being street smart in addition to excelling academically. Limiting their exposure to real-world experiences may result in a lack of essential life skills, such as fixing cars or operating a lawnmower. It is concerning that children may be ill-prepared to face the challenges that await them in the future if they are not exposed to a diverse range of experiences.  While it is natural for parents to want to protect their children, it is equally important to educate them about the realities of the world. By providing them with the knowledge and skills to navigate life's challenges, we can help them become resilient and capable individuals. Books should not be neglected, as they offer valuable insights and perspectives that may not be readily available online. It is crucial to strike a balance between protecting children from harm and equipping them with the tools they need to thrive in an ever-changing world.  In conclusion, it is essential to find a balance between sheltering children from harm and exposing them to the realities of the world. By providing children with a well-rounded education that includes both academic knowledge and practical life skills, we can help them become informed and capable individuals ready to face the challenges of the future.  Thank you for considering these perspectives.  Deven
896	3873	2	3	Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1 has been prevalent throughout history, with various forms of art and media being subjected to restrictions. While some censorship aims to protect individuals from harmful content, it can also stifle creativity and limit access to valuable information. Countries like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2 have implemented strict censorship policies, with some resorting to book burnings and internet restrictions to control the flow of information. In @LOCATION5, a conflict between @ORGANIZATION3 and the government highlighted the ongoing battle over online censorship. Despite the arguments for censorship to protect individuals, it ultimately raises questions about freedom of expression and access to diverse viewpoints. As citizens of @LOCATION1, it is crucial to uphold our rights to freedom of speech and press, resisting efforts to censor libraries and limit intellectual freedom. While the censor may raise concerns about inappropriate content, it is ultimately the responsibility of parents and guardians to monitor children's access to materials. As author Katherine Paterson aptly stated, allowing censorship to dictate what is suitable for all individuals can lead to a loss of diverse perspectives and valuable literature. While censorship may always exist to some extent, it is essential to advocate for our rights and resist unwarranted restrictions on information and creativity. By standing up for our freedoms, we can ensure a society that values intellectual freedom and diverse expression.
897	3874	2	3	Almost everyone in this world reads. Many people have to read almost every day, people may not realize it but they do. Reading is just a part of life. If you don't know how to read, you are most likely to not be successful. Even if you know how to read a little bit, if you just knew the basic words, people would probably be fine, but people definitely need to know how to read. No, I do not think they should take anything off the shelf.   Why would they take anything off the shelf? If anyone finds it offensive, they should simply not read it. Just because it offends them, other people may find it interesting. If people just started taking books off the shelf because they were offended by them, who knows how many books we would have left. People can be offended in the easiest ways. We could have no books on the shelves because almost every book out there can offend someone in some way. The same thing goes for movies, movies can offend people just the same as books. I think movies would offend more than a book would.   In conclusion, books, movies, or anything of that matter should not be taken off the shelf because it offended someone. Many people get offended in this world way too easily. One person may love a book and another person may hate it. Just because you hate it does not mean it should be taken off the shelves.
898	3875	2	3	Censorship is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While some argue that offensive materials should be censored to protect society, others believe in the importance of freedom of speech and expression. It is crucial to distinguish between what is suitable for adults and what is appropriate for children. While adults should have the right to access and form opinions on controversial materials, children should be shielded from harmful content until they are mature enough to understand it. Libraries should offer a designated children's section while providing unrestricted access to information for adults. Ultimately, censorship should be used judiciously to safeguard individuals, especially children, without infringing on the rights of adults to explore diverse perspectives and ideas. People should have the freedom to educate themselves, develop their own views, and express their thoughts, without undue restrictions on their access to information.
899	3876	2	3	Books have the power to leave a lasting impact on readers, especially children and teenagers. Inappropriate material in books, movies, or other forms of media should be carefully considered before being made available to young audiences. Children may not be mature enough to process and understand certain themes or content, which could negatively influence their thoughts and behaviors. Exposing children to inappropriate material can lead to them mimicking dangerous or harmful actions portrayed in media. It is crucial for parents, educators, and society as a whole to be mindful of what children are exposed to, as it can shape their development and perceptions. Ultimately, it is important to protect the innocence and well-being of children by restricting their access to inappropriate media.
900	3877	2	3	"Censorship has become a major concern in today's society, especially when it comes to books, music, and movies. While the intention behind censorship is often to protect young audiences from potentially harmful content, it is also important to consider the rights of adults who may wish to access and engage with uncensored materials.  Books have been a primary target for censorship, with some being rewritten to remove offensive language. However, altering the original content of a book can significantly impact its message and meaning. For example, the classic novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" addresses important themes of racism, and censoring the language in this book would diminish its impact. Libraries should consider creating a separate section for censored books, allowing adults to access the original versions if they choose to do so.  Music is another form of media that has faced censorship, particularly in terms of removing explicit language from songs. While it is important to provide appropriate content for young audiences, adults should also have access to the original versions of songs. Libraries can cater to both audiences by offering both explicit and clean versions of CDs.  Movies have also been subject to censorship, with ratings determining their suitability for different age groups. While these ratings can serve as guidelines, ultimately, parents should have the final say in what their children are allowed to watch. Libraries should have a diverse selection of movies available, allowing individuals of all ages to access a wide range of content with parental consent when necessary.  In conclusion, while censorship can serve a valid purpose in protecting young audiences, it is essential to consider the rights of adults who may wish to access uncensored materials. Libraries should strive to provide a range of options to cater to different preferences and age groups, ensuring that individuals have the freedom to make informed choices about the media they engage with."
901	3878	2	3	There should not be restrictions on certain types of books in the library. Just because some people find a book offensive, it should not be removed from the shelves. Everyone has different tastes and preferences when it comes to reading, so it is important to have a diverse selection available for all readers. If a particular book is not to someone's liking, they can simply choose not to read it and explore other options. The library is a place for entertainment and learning, and there are always plenty of other books to choose from. It is important to respect the variety of perspectives and interests that different readers may have, and not impose personal opinions on what should or should not be available in the library. Ultimately, the goal of the library is to provide a wide range of books for readers to enjoy, and individuals have the freedom to select what they find appealing.
902	3879	2	3	I believe that censorship is unnecessary when it comes to adult shows. While I understand the need for censorship in children's programming, it seems excessive to restrict the content of movies and songs intended for mature audiences. Whatever happened to freedom of speech? It is important to trust adults to make their own choices about what they watch and listen to without unnecessary censorship. Let's allow artists and creators the freedom to express themselves without unnecessary restrictions.
903	3880	2	3	Dear Newspaper,  There should be censorship in libraries, but people should be a certain age to check out the book. Some individuals visit libraries solely for censored material. Censorship serves as a tool to attract children or students to pick up a book. Parents who allow their children to read censored books believe it does no harm, and creating an age-restricted section in libraries can address this issue. By implementing an age requirement, libraries can prevent unrestricted access and potential negative influences on younger readers. Although some may argue for the removal of censorship in libraries, doing so could lead to financial struggles for these institutions. Therefore, maintaining censorship in libraries is crucial for their sustainability. Do you truly want to remove censorship from libraries and risk their closure?  Sincerely, [Your Name]
904	3881	2	3	Now take a moment and go back to high school. Do you remember roaming under the opera house with the phantom? What about fighting for @PERSON2's freedom with @PERSON1? Perhaps getting people into trouble in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1? No matter what your favorite classic piece of literature was, you recall the wonderful feeling you felt when reading it. It enveloped you into its world, and you felt every sensation it offered. What is this though? The author is a @CAPS2. The author uses occasional bad words. The author is a woman. This is not an acceptable excuse to miss out on everything literature offers. Censorship in public libraries is wrong. The @CAPS3 was a dark time. Thousands upon thousands of @CAPS4 people were killed for their religious belief, as well as homosexual people, and other minorities. Amidst all of this chaos, the @ORGANIZATION1 decided it would be a good idea to burn all books written by @CAPS4 authors. So they did. Millions of books were eradicated along with their owners all because of a religious difference. Does it even need to be asked? This was wrong. Many say that ignorance is bliss, but is it really when people impose their ideas on others? Let us now look now at what a book, movie, magazine, or song offends with to be censored. A curse word, a bit of skin, a controversial idea. Sometimes these are needed for emphasis of the compilation. Imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then. Pathetic. So is it worth it to you? Will you give up a beautiful composition because it is controversial? Will you hide your children from materials that will make them form their own opinions? One thing is certain, I will not. I will stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works. One day my plea will be heard. Censorship in public libraries is wrong no matter how you put it.
905	3882	2	3	There are a variety of books available at public libraries that cater to different interests and needs. Whether you are looking for information, facts, or guidance on a particular topic, there is likely a book that can assist you. While some books may present opinions, it is important to remember that everyone has their own perspective.   Reading can be a valuable tool for learning and expanding knowledge. However, not everyone enjoys reading and may prefer hands-on learning experiences. It can be challenging to focus and retain information while reading or multitasking. Ultimately, finding the right learning method that suits your preferences and strengths is key to acquiring knowledge effectively.
906	3883	2	3	My say would be no. Because all that was history, say you had like a KKK thing or anything like that. Say you had a writing report but need the information for that. You would need information for that and that information would have notes, dates, and other things.
907	3884	2	3	I believe in censorship, but I also believe that it is not a major issue. Parents should take responsibility for monitoring the materials that their children are exposed to and should block anything they deem inappropriate. Extreme cases may require censorship, but in general, people should be more understanding and simply avoid content they do not like. Censorship should only be used for valid reasons such as protecting certain groups or preventing exposure to graphic content. Ultimately, individuals should have the freedom to decide what they and their children are exposed to, and censorship should be used judiciously and for good reason.
908	3885	2	3	If I was given the chance to choose whether people should take books off of shelves that offend others at local libraries, I would suggest holding a vote to determine the best course of action. Different people have varying beliefs and sensitivities, so it would be fair to involve a diverse group in the decision-making process. By allowing individuals from various backgrounds and perspectives to participate in the voting, we can ensure that a range of opinions are considered. Additionally, assessing the popularity of the book based on its checkout history can provide valuable insight. If the book is ultimately voted to remain in the library, it should be clearly labeled to alert potential readers of its potentially controversial content. Voting is a proven method of decision-making that can effectively address conflicts and diverse opinions in society. By embracing the power of voting, we can find solutions to many challenges we face today.
909	3886	2	3	In my opinion, no one's work should be removed from shelves simply because it is deemed offensive. Artists and creators put a lot of effort into their work, and it should not be taken away from them. However, there are instances where certain materials may need to be kept out of public view, such as articles containing explicit language or content. In these cases, it is reasonable to have them available upon request rather than openly displayed. Overall, while censorship in libraries is a complex issue, it is important to consider the balance between freedom of expression and public sensibilities.
910	3887	2	3	Materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines are important sources of enjoyment and information for people of all ages. In libraries, reading materials play a crucial role in expanding knowledge and providing learning opportunities outside of formal education settings. It is essential to uphold the availability of these materials in classrooms and libraries, as they offer valuable insights and perspectives on various subjects.  Individuals must exercise responsibility when selecting reading materials, as not all content may be suitable for every reader. While some may find certain materials offensive, it is important to recognize that diverse opinions and viewpoints are integral to a well-rounded reading experience. Every book has the right to be read, and individuals should have the freedom to choose their reading material based on their interests and preferences.  The Bible, for example, is a book that holds significant understanding and knowledge for many individuals. While some may question its relevance or appropriateness, it is ultimately up to the reader to decide whether to engage with its content. Books, music, movies, and magazines offer unique opportunities for learning and personal growth, and individuals should have the autonomy to explore a wide range of materials to enrich their understanding of the world.  In conclusion, reading materials serve as valuable sources of information, entertainment, and personal growth. It is important to respect individuals' choices in selecting their reading materials and to uphold the availability of diverse content in libraries and classrooms. By embracing a wide range of perspectives and opinions, readers can expand their knowledge and gain new insights into the world around them.
911	3888	2	3	"Should offensive material be censored? No, censoring books, music, movies, magazines, etc. takes away from our freedom as American citizens. If books are censored, it limits education and restricts access to different perspectives. For example, the controversy surrounding the book ""Huckleberry Finn"" shows how censoring offensive language can detract from the story's historical and cultural significance. While censorship is a personal decision, it should ultimately be up to individuals, especially parents, to choose what content is appropriate for themselves or their children. In a society that values freedom of expression, censorship should be approached with caution to preserve the integrity of art and literature."
912	3889	2	3	Imagine you are in the library looking for a book to read when your child runs up to you holding a magazine of questionable nature. A library should not have inappropriate items on the shelves. Censoring libraries is necessary to protect families. Libraries should be a safe space for everyone to enjoy without encountering offensive material.  Children are naturally curious and attracted to colorful and different things. They may be enticed by inappropriate material if it is easily accessible in a library. By censoring the content available, children can explore the library without coming across anything unsuitable for their age.  Sometimes, items in the library may not be placed correctly, leading to misunderstandings or embarrassing situations. Imagine borrowing a movie for a party only to find out it is not the film you expected. This could have been prevented if libraries were censored and organized properly to avoid such incidents.  Offensive material in a library can be upsetting and uncomfortable for many people. It is important to consider the feelings of others and ensure that everyone can feel respected and safe in a public space like a library. Censorship can help prevent offensive material from causing harm or discomfort to library visitors.  In conclusion, libraries should be censored to protect children, prevent misunderstandings, and avoid offending library users. By implementing stricter guidelines on the content available in libraries, we can create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone to enjoy. Let's work together to ensure that libraries remain a place where families can feel comfortable and secure.
913	3890	2	3	Why should books that some people enjoy reading be removed from library shelves? It is ludicrous. There are many alternatives to just taking those books off the shelves completely. We have all seen or heard of books that are inappropriate for certain audiences, especially young children. It is understandable that children should not be exposed to explicit materials, but there are ways to prevent it.  One way libraries can prevent children from accessing inappropriate materials is by creating separate sections for adult and children's materials, with strict rules in place to ensure children stay in the appropriate section. Another idea is to require parental permission on a child's library card, so that librarians know where the child is allowed to access books within the library.  It is important for parents to be vigilant and ensure that their children are not exposed to explicit materials at a young age. Let's keep inappropriate books and magazines away from younger kids, without resorting to banning or removing them from libraries. It is ultimately the responsibility of parents to protect their children from such materials, not the libraries.
914	3891	2	3	Materials that are considered offensive, such as movies, music, magazines, and books, should not be automatically taken off shelves or banned. While some content may be controversial or distasteful to certain individuals, it is important to remember that entertainment plays a crucial role in our society. These forms of media provide a means of expression, creativity, and even reflection of the world around us. Without them, our lives would lack diversity and stimulation.  It is true that some content may be critical or mocking towards certain individuals, including celebrities, but this is a part of the reality of living in a media-driven world. Removing offensive materials would not only limit our freedom of expression but also deprive us of the opportunity to engage with different perspectives and ideas. Furthermore, censorship can lead to a slippery slope where the line between what is deemed acceptable or offensive becomes blurred.  Ultimately, it is essential to approach offensive content with an open mind and critical thinking. Rather than outright banning them, it may be more beneficial to engage in constructive dialogue, educate ourselves, and promote a culture of respect and understanding. By doing so, we can navigate the complexities of media content while preserving the importance of free speech and creativity in our society.
915	3892	2	3	In @LOCATION1, freedom of speech is enshrined in the constitution, allowing individuals to express their thoughts and opinions through various forms of media. This includes books, music, movies, and more. While some may find certain materials offensive, it is important to respect the diverse viewpoints and artistic expressions of others. Censorship in libraries should not be tolerated, as it limits access to information and hinders the freedom of speech for artists and authors. Banning books and restricting content only serves to shelter individuals from the realities of the world. It is essential to embrace different perspectives and allow for open dialogue and expression in order to foster a truly inclusive society.
916	3893	2	3	Censorship for books? Never thought I'd see the day. But, that doesn't necessarily mean I approve or agree. Just because I don't approve or agree doesn't mean I do not oppose it. I find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair. Shall we?   Among others, I find that if you censor one thing, you censor them all. Public items such as televisions, radios, magazines, and even books have wriggled their way into our not so perfect world. Yes, there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this. But, is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood? Maybe. Then again, maybe not.  It is true that children, at their youngest, are easily molded and cut out into who they will permanently be, or at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions on certain topics. For instance, when I was younger, my cousin, who happens to be just a few years older than me, started to like a certain thing. After spending time with her for an elongated amount of time, I started to 'like' it too. I found myself obsessed with it. Now, before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad, I can assure you, it was nothing other than stacks of cards. Anyway, it wasn't until later that my mother informed me that it wasn't really my interest. It was hers. I modeled after her likes and dislikes. Every other child in the world has done something similar. What makes anybody think they wouldn't do the exact same after listening to uncensored music, watching uncensored television, or reading an uncensored book or magazine?  On the other hand, it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent. If that were the case, nearly every book would be out of sight, but not out of mind. Today, you can't turn on the radio without hearing something about sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking. Now, those things are a lot more accessible to anybody. You can't turn on the computer without advertisements for porn or other sexually crude websites popping up on your screen. Books have gotten out of hand, as well.  The world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place. But in the end, I'm sticking to my original opinion: If you censor one thing, censor them all. It's only fair. Radios, television, movies, and even games have been censored. Books are not as innocent as they seem, anymore. So yes, my final opinion is that libraries should, in fact, censor their books, or at least make an effort to. Libraries are places to learn and have fun doing so, not have a mental scar leading back to what they read in a 'harmless' little book.
917	3894	2	3	You are not eligible to check out this book', says the librarian. You are just too young for this book.   To me, censorship laws in libraries are not needed. The common people should have the liberty to check out whatever they please. The people who make the censorship laws should be pleased that young people actually want to read.   Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are all under censorship. Everyone takes things in differently; some are more mature than others. If they want to play that game or read that book, they should be allowed. The person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material. Therefore, they are held accountable for their actions. Isn't that how legal laws are carried out?  If any sort of content is found offensive, it still shouldn't be removed from the shelves. Something may seem offensive to one person, but someone else may find it interesting. For example, when the newspaper talks about a specific athlete, they may say things that offend his/her fans. The people who are not fans of him/her may find it amusing; so they should not remove the post because some people don't like it. Someone may like that book, music, movie, or magazine; don't inconvenience them because of a few people.  Interests vary, but a teen may like the same type of books as an adult. Censorship laws won't let the teen read the book they like because of his/her age, and to me, that is unfair. It is a new day and age; things have changed from what they once were. Censorship laws should be wiped out completely. If you find a book offensive in any way, shape, or form, just don't read it. Nobody is forcing you to read that specific book; libraries are filled with a numerous amount of books. There is a book out there that you will enjoy.  In conclusion, certain material shouldn't be removed from shelves if found offensive. Some other people may like that same material. There shouldn't be censorship laws in libraries at all. That is just unfair and unjust to some people. It's a new time and age, and things are different. People of any age should be able to check out any book they please.
918	3895	2	3	The things found in libraries should not be considered offensive, as it is a matter of personal choice whether to engage with such material or not. It is important to remember that nobody is forcing anyone to read or view offensive content. Keeping such material on the shelves allows individuals who are interested in exploring these topics to have access to them. While some may find offensive content entertaining, it is crucial to respect the freedom of expression of those who create such material. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they want to engage with offensive content, and it should not be a cause for concern as it is prevalent in various forms of media.
919	3896	2	3	Censorship can be a double-edged sword in society. While it can help protect children from inappropriate content and maintain certain standards in media, it can also limit freedom of expression and access to information. Personal experiences with movies and television shows show how censorship can cater to different preferences and audiences. Observations reveal the need to be mindful of what is appropriate for different age groups and settings. Reading materials such as banned books and censored music lyrics highlight the controversial nature of censorship and its impact on artistic expression. Ultimately, the debate on censorship is complex, and individuals must consider both sides of the argument to determine its effectiveness in society.
920	3897	2	3	I believe that if you find a book offensive then you should not read that book. What some people find as offensive some other people might find it not offensive. I do not think that people should not be able to take books off of the shelves.  For example, if there is a person of the Jewish religion, they might find a book about Hitler offensive. In that sense, if they take the book off of the shelf, then the other kids that are soon to come into the age of studying this era will not have a book to look at. Without these books, our history of the world will be soon forgotten.  Another example would be slavery. I believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with. In reality, it was a hard time for the Africans. I do not think that they will take the books off of the shelf because of it being offensive. How could you take away the future of learning from the children that are our next generation?  If we are to take the books off of the shelves at the libraries, what do we do about the Bible? Some people do not believe that there is a god or a heaven, but a lot of other people do believe in it. So how would that work out in the long run? It would create a lot of problems for the public library and for its citizens as well.  In reading books as a kid, I have found that some things are bad and I do not like them, but I don't believe that we should take the book away from people that like the books. How do you take away from the people that like to read different novels than you is beyond me, but it will only be a problematic subject in the future. In conclusion, it is essential to respect differing opinions and allow access to a variety of books for all individuals, even if some may find them offensive.
921	3898	2	3	Older authors often write gruesome stories about their past, whether fiction or nonfiction. Sometimes, these books may end up in the wrong hands, leading to them being discarded or destroyed. Parents tend to blame external factors like television or peers when their children engage with inappropriate content, failing to consider the broader context.  Children can easily access unsuitable material at libraries, exposing them to content not meant for their age group. While it may be challenging to gauge a book's appropriateness by its cover, removing it entirely from a library is not the solution. Every book serves a purpose, catering to diverse interests and curiosities, even if they touch on controversial topics like drugs or murder.  Authors should not be held accountable for their creative expression, as their work reflects their unique perspectives and narratives. It is essential to respect their artistic freedom and allow them to present their stories as intended. By categorizing materials based on age appropriateness, libraries can better guide readers towards suitable content.  Adults who criticize such content should reflect on their own past experiences and consider how their choices shaped their viewpoints. Understanding the value of diverse storytelling can help foster a more inclusive approach to consuming literature, movies, music, and other forms of art. It is crucial to appreciate the diversity of narratives and the importance of artistic freedom in shaping our cultural landscape.
922	3899	2	3	Walking into the library and looking for a good book or magazine to read, you run into some of those disgusting books that are offensive to some people. Some people think they should be removed from the shelves, and I am one of them. There are some books, magazines, movies, and etc., that we all run into that have very bad language, racism, bad religious talking, and even some about sex. Nobody needs to be reading those kinds of books, as they are bad for our minds and offensive to some people.   A lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them, so seeing those words in a book can lead to negative thoughts. Books about racism can be particularly hurtful and offensive. Additionally, books with content that goes against someone's religious beliefs can be very offensive as well.   There are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people. They could consider putting up warning signs and separating these books into their own section. Alternatively, they could include a warning note inside the front cover of the book to alert readers about potentially offensive content. These measures would help people avoid reading material that may offend them.   In conclusion, it would be beneficial for libraries to remove or at least provide warnings about books, magazines, and other materials that contain offensive content. This would ensure that all readers can enjoy their reading experience without being subjected to content that offends them. Let's work towards creating a more inclusive and respectful library environment for all readers.
923	3900	2	3	I believe that there are certain movies, music, and other things that are bothering parents. I would not want my kid listening to music that teaches them wrong things, so I always check the kind of music my child listens to. I believe that some movies are too violent for anyone to see, but in a free country, people will watch them anyway. There are movies made for adults, but some parents allow their kids to watch them. Some people don't like what they see or hear in music or on television, and they may choose to avoid it. Personally, I have encountered situations where my mom has asked me to turn off the TV or music due to inappropriate content. My friends enjoy music that I find concerning, as it often glorifies violence, gangs, and other negative behaviors. It is evident that certain media influences can impact children, leading them to imitate what they see. Despite personal preferences, there will always be a market for drama and action movies, while content tailored for babies is less prominent. I believe that excessive violence, drug references, and other inappropriate content should not be readily accessible on national television for the sake of educating young minds. Ultimately, the media landscape is diverse, and individuals will continue to have varying opinions on what is suitable for consumption.
924	3901	2	3	Human beings, like snowflakes, are unique in their own way, with no two individuals being exactly the same. Just as each snowflake has its own distinct pattern, each person has their own set of characteristics and interests. Some individuals possess a greater sense of curiosity and a desire to explore topics outside the norm. However, these curious minds may face restrictions when it comes to accessing certain materials at libraries.  It is important to acknowledge that maturity and readiness play a significant role in determining what individuals should be allowed to read or study. If a person demonstrates the necessary level of maturity and has the permission of a guardian, they should not be limited in their quest for knowledge. Age should not be the sole factor in determining what individuals can and cannot access at a library.  By allowing individuals to explore a wide range of topics and materials, we are fostering a culture of curiosity and learning. It is this curiosity that drives innovation and progress in society. The youth of today will be the leaders of tomorrow, and it is essential to nurture their inquisitive minds and encourage them to seek knowledge in all its forms.  In conclusion, individuals should have the freedom to explore and learn about any topic they are interested in, as long as they demonstrate maturity and responsibility. By promoting a culture of curiosity and open-mindedness, we can empower individuals to reach their full potential and contribute positively to society.
925	3902	2	3	In most libraries in the @LOCATION1, there are certain books, movies, music, etc., that could be inappropriate to younger children. These books and movies can contain graphic content or offensive language that any young child should not be hearing or seeing. However, this does not mean that the libraries of @LOCATION2 should get rid of these books, videos, etc. The libraries should keep these books and videos because the adults of @LOCATION2 like to use them, the kids probably already know about the language and graphic content, and some of the books and movies that are offensive are very educational.  When you think about your childhood, there would always be things you couldn't watch or listen to because you were too young. Your parents and older siblings would watch movies that you couldn't watch because they would say you aren't old enough. They enjoy watching more mature movies because it is more interesting to them than cartoon shows or movies. The mature content in movies, books, and more should be kept in libraries because mature audiences enjoy watching and listening to them. If they are taken out of libraries, this mature audience has nothing to watch or read in the library. They do not want to be reading children's books all the time.  Also, most children have already observed or heard this offensive content in these books and movies. Most of the parents in the @LOCATION1 have used offensive language in front of their child without even realizing it. The kid then starts using these words because they think they are cool if adults use them. Another thing is that most kids have seen a movie with graphic content in it, or they have played a video game with it in the game. They have seen blood, gore, and other things in these games and movies. It's already too late to try and hide your child from seeing or hearing these 'bad words' or 'graphic content'.  Many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational videos. For example, 'Saving Private Ryan' was a great movie describing the search for one man in the middle of World War II. These wars actually occurred and movies like this give a great amount of detail on what actually went on during these wars. If you want kids to know about the history of our country, they need to know what actually happened. There is no point in trying to hide the truth.  Overall, most kids in the @LOCATION1 have heard offensive language or graphic content. Whether it was from a parent or even their best friend, they have heard it. So why would we try to hide this from them? Keep these books, movies, music, and more in the libraries for the benefits of the adults, the kids, and for the history of the country.

The question arises as to who determines what is offensive and how something becomes offensive. Offensiveness is subjective and can vary greatly among individuals. What one person finds offensive, another may not. Additionally, the reasons something is considered offensive can be complex and multifaceted. Therefore, simply removing potentially offensive material will not eradicate all instances of offense. Ultimately, addressing the root causes of offensiveness and promoting understanding and dialogue may be more effective in reducing instances of offense in society.
927	3904	2	3	Many people in the community enjoy reading a variety of materials like books, magazines, newspapers, and music. Reading serves as a great way to pass the time and explore different worlds and ideas. Personally, I find interest in books about individuals with special powers, such as necromancers. However, if we were to remove all the books that potentially offend someone from our libraries, what would be left? It seems like the only safe option would be to read material from a specific organization, which may not cater to everyone's tastes.  Consider what you enjoy in terms of music, art, and literature. Now, imagine if all of those were suddenly removed from the library shelves. The book you love, the song stuck in your head, all gone because they could potentially offend someone. Every individual has their own sensitivities and triggers, and if we cater to all of them, there would be very little left to enjoy.  If libraries were stripped of anything deemed offensive, it would greatly limit the variety of materials available, leading to a decline in visitors and potential closure. Libraries serve as a sanctuary for many, a place to escape the noise and chaos of everyday life. Removing offensive content would only serve to stifle creativity and diversity in the literary world.  For book lovers, discovering a captivating and thought-provoking read is akin to finding hidden treasure. It's an experience that can alter one's perspective, ignite passion, and keep readers on the edge of their seats. Literature has the power to transport us to different realms, challenge our beliefs, and expand our knowledge. By eliminating everything that could potentially offend, we risk losing the very essence of what makes reading so enriching and transformative. Let's embrace the diversity of ideas and perspectives that literature offers, rather than seeking to censor and restrict it.
928	3905	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. This is because everyone has the right to express themselves and have their own opinions. If something offends you, you can simply choose not to engage with it. Additionally, offensive materials can sometimes provide valuable learning opportunities, helping people to challenge their preconceived notions and biases. Therefore, censorship of offensive materials goes against the principles of free speech and personal growth. It is important to respect diverse perspectives and allow for open dialogue, even if it means encountering content that may be uncomfortable or offensive.
929	3906	2	3	No Censorship  Do you enjoy reading interesting books, watching superb movies, or listening to appealing music that some people don't approve of? Most people would answer yes to the question because anything that a person reads, watches, or listens to may be found offensive or crude to someone else. Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because different people find different materials offensive, people sometimes specifically come to libraries to search out materials they can't find elsewhere, and if a person finds a material offensive, they don't have to keep reading, watching, or listening to it.  The first reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because different people find different materials offensive. Each person is different, and people have all sorts of opinions on books, movies, magazines, music, etc. Also, several different ethnicities exist in the world and many nonfiction books educate people on different cultures around the world. The ethnicity of the people living in the culture may find what the authors of nonfiction books are writing about them offensive because the book is talking about something in their culture they wouldn't want the public hearing about. However, the public needs to be educated on the cultures of different people. Students do research in libraries for research projects and essays. Also, books pertaining to racism such as To Kill A Mockingbird and books about slaves may be offensive to the race that is being victimized in the book. In contrast, some people may love the book because of the good theme, symbolism, word usage, etc. So, who would be the judge of whether a material is offensive or not? If the person who is doing this for a certain library finds many materials in the library offensive, the whole library could close down because many materials that could have been popular were taken out of the library.  Another reason why certain materials shouldn't be removed off shelves if they are found offensive is because sometimes people specifically come to libraries to search out materials they cannot find elsewhere. Libraries are the one place that people go if they are looking for that certain book or maybe even a movie they can't find at a video store. In my experience, there have been an infinite number of times where I have wanted to read a book I have heard about, and I've gone straight to the library and found it there. Also, because no video store exists in the town I live in, I go to the library for movies because I know they have a large selection. Some of the books and movies I or other people like may be found offensive to others, so if they were taken off of library shelves, I'm not sure if I would go to the library as often.  A third reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because people don't have to read what they may find offensive. Everyone has the choice of what materials they acquire from a library, unless it's something they have to read for school. If a person hears about a book that may be found offensive to them, why would they read the book. Also, if a person accidentally checks out a book or watches a movie from the library that they find offensive, they can always just stop reading the book or watching the movie.  Censorship shouldn't occur in libraries because everyone has different opinions. Libraries assume that if someone finds a material offensive, they'll just stop reading it. Also, if libraries take out all the materials anyone finds offensive, what will be left to read, watch, or listen to?
930	3907	2	3	I do not think that any books should be taken out of libraries because they are found 'offensive'. Something that is offensive to me may not be offensive to another. Although I have all the right in the world to object to a book that I find inappropriate, somebody else might believe that that book is completely appropriate. The main issues that most people have with books are foul language, sex, and difference in opinion. These three categories are very sensitive issues; some may not be comfortable discussing these issues.  Many books in the library systems today contain foul language. Surprisingly, a majority of the indecent language can be found in the young adult section. I don't believe that parents would be very happy to know what their children are reading.  In our modern-day world, we are bombarded with images of sex and indecency. Books containing obscure acts are no different from television or magazines. Most romance novels are very descriptive and leave little room for imagination, and in the wrong hands can lead to some very prompting questions.  Difference in opinion can be a big problem for some libraries if patrons do not like the message a book sends. Religion, politics, and morals can lead to some nasty debates, but sometimes we have to just agree to disagree.  Can teenagers handle that kind of language and sexuality in a responsible way? Should the books be taken off the shelf just on the basis that we don't agree with what it says? Should there be a sensor on what can and can't be put in libraries? I don't think that any books should be taken off of library shelves. If you don't agree with the book then don't read it. Instead of blaming libraries for what your children read, perhaps you should look at your own parenting and make sure they aren't reading something they shouldn't.
931	3908	2	3	Katherine Paterson's quote about offensive books is completely true, and I agree with her. She's saying that if everyone had the right to remove a book they found offensive off of every shelf, there would be no more books for people in the world. There are most likely books that one person could find offensive, but others do not. What would the world have left if almost all books are taken off the shelf? I do not think that offensive materials such as books should be removed from shelves because not everybody could find them offensive and could be depriving people of their favorite subjects, I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book, and because there would not be books left in the world.  There are books about every single subject in the world. Some are about subjects we love and could read about for days. Others are about subjects that we hate or that just plain bore us. Though whatever the subject is, whether it be about the media, science fiction, romance, or anything else, there are different people in the world who love reading about different subjects. If a person had the right to remove a certain type of book from libraries and stores, say a romance book, because she found it offensive in some way and it was taken off the shelves, then a person who loved reading that book would be deprived from it because one person found it offensive. Just because one person finds a book offensive, doesn't mean everyone else in the world would too.  I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book. In my class, we were assigned to read 'The in the'. As we were reading the book I honestly thought it was a very interesting story. Though later with some research I found out that the book was banned in a lot of schools all over the world. Teachers from those schools reported that there were some very subjective words and events in the book. I do agree that there was some bad language, but I don't think that's a reason to ban the book from schools. It's an awesome story that won a couple awards, and my class also enjoyed it. My experience with this proved another point that certain books should not be banned.  Just as Katherine Paterson stated, if every person was given a right to ban certain books from libraries, there wouldn't be books left in the world for people to read. There are millions of people in the world. If every single person was able to ban one book in the world, what would we have left? There would probably be nothing left. If every book was gone from the world, what would kids in school be able to read? Kids would start reading at a slower rate, causing grades to drop. One little law change in could cause great negative changes in the future.  There's always going to be people in the world who find certain books offensive. That's never going to change, but people also have the freedom and choice to stay away from the book they abhor. Unless you're a student in school, you don't have to read or look at a book you find offensive, and you can also try to keep your kids from reading whatever it is because if you want one book banned off of shelves, you're depriving other people of books. So I say every library stays the way they are now, and keep every book they have for all kids and adults.
932	3909	2	3	Would you let someone ban your favorite movie, just because it has mildly offensive materials in it? I know I would not. If everyone had the right to ban books then we would have no books, because something would offend someone. You should not ban books because it desecrates our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it would ruin the future.  If you ban a book then you are giving up your individuality. If you let someone decide what is offensive to you, then how can you express yourself. Therefore, by letting someone else decide what is appropriate for you to read, you are giving up your freedom. By banning books, you are not being yourself you are conforming to what other people want. Therefore, you should not ban books because, it demolishes your individuality, and it makes you conform to what other people want.  There should not be any banning of books. You should not be able to ban books because we have the freedom of press. The freedom of press means that we can write whatever we want. However, you should not ban books because we have the freedom to choose what we read. This means that we as individuals should be able to decide what we want to read and what we do not. You should not ban books because we have the freedom of press, and because we have the freedom as individuals to read what we want.  If you ban books then you will ruin the future. There are hundreds of really phenomenal books out there that would be banned, and future people would not be able to enjoy them. There are books that can change your life, and teach you how to deal with things, and if we ban them then we are ruining the chance to help future people with their problems. People turn to books for knowledge, and help, and for ideas, and if we take away their books then how can we say that we are paving the way for the future if we are destroying it along the way. Books should not be banned because if they were then, we would be ruining the future for others, and we would be destroying our own future.  In conclusion, books should not be banned because, it limits our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it destroys our future. If you ban books, more likely than not, your favorite book would get banned. Also, if everyone could ban books, then there would be nothing to read because all of the books would be banned. By banning books you are destroying the future, limiting our freedoms, and abolishing our individuality.
933	3910	2	3	A library should carry every kind of book, movie, magazine, music, etc. Removing items based on personal preferences would limit the choices available to patrons and could potentially alienate certain individuals or groups. It is important for libraries to provide a wide range of materials to cater to diverse tastes and interests. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to exercise discretion and choose what they want to read or view, rather than imposing restrictions on what is available. By maintaining a comprehensive collection, libraries can better serve their communities and ensure that everyone has access to the resources they need.
934	3911	2	3	I think that none of the books should be removed from the shelves of libraries. Everyone should have the chance to read any book they want, regardless of whether others may not like it. Each person has their own preferences when it comes to reading, and it's important to respect that. Removing books based on personal preferences could discourage people from reading and have negative effects on authors and their livelihoods. Books are a form of expression and can provide an escape from the real world, as well as valuable learning experiences. It is best to leave books where they are and allow individuals to make their own choices when it comes to reading.
935	3912	2	3	No criteria such as books, magazines, or other materials should be removed from shelves simply because some individuals find them offensive. In a free country like the United States, people have the right to choose what they read or view. What one person finds offensive, another may not. For example, while some may find certain sports events offensive due to the high salaries of athletes, others enjoy watching these events without issue. Similarly, jokes that some find offensive may be humorous to others.   As Katherine Paterson wisely stated, removing materials from shelves based on individual offense is not the solution. If everyone had the power to censor based on personal sensitivities, little would remain available for public consumption. In a society that values freedom of choice, individuals can simply opt not to engage with content that they find objectionable. This allows for a diverse range of materials to remain accessible to those who may find them valuable or enjoyable. Ultimately, the ability to make individual choices regarding what to read or view is a fundamental aspect of a free society.
936	3913	2	3	@CAPS4 I believe that all forms of media, including books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. This is important because children can be exposed to inappropriate content that can have a negative impact on their development. For example, books with explicit language or images can introduce children to concepts beyond their understanding, leading to potential harm. Similarly, music with explicit lyrics or themes can influence young minds in a negative way. Movies and TV shows should also be censored to protect children from harmful content. Magazines that feature explicit images should not be easily accessible to children. Overall, there should be limitations on what children are exposed to in the media to ensure their well-being and proper development.
937	3914	2	3	I don't think offensive content should be removed from libraries because most books, music, movies, and other materials contain some form of offensive content. It is ultimately the responsibility of parents to monitor what their children are exposed to. Banning offensive content would significantly diminish the library's collection and limit the freedom of expression for individuals who enjoy such content. Instead of removing offensive material, individuals should simply avoid it if they find it inappropriate. Ultimately, it is important to maintain a diverse range of materials in libraries to cater to the varied interests of patrons. Offense is subjective, and it is up to individuals to make choices about what they consume. In conclusion, offensive content should not be removed from libraries, as it is a matter of personal responsibility and choice.
938	3915	2	3	Certain material such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from libraries. The quote by Katherine Paterson simply states that if everyone had the right to remove a book from a shelf, then we would have no books left on the shelf for any of us. The world would be empty because there is always something that a person sees as offensive.  To each person that finds the material offensive, there are always ten people who do not find it offensive at all. A person's beliefs can cloud their views on things like religion. There are so many wrong things out in the world that you can never do right by.  In places like libraries, you never know who might come in to check something out. That is why it is recommended to make sections in the library. Adult novels, children's book, science fiction novels all in different sections of the library. This would make a parent cautious of where their child goes. If a child walks into the wrong sections, there is only one person to blame; the parent. Children always wander off into random places because of curiosity. Parents have to make sure that nothing horrific happens such as seeing something that a toddler or a teenager is not supposed to see.  One object, such as a book, a movie, or a magazine, can teach a person millions of lessons. If those lessons are not taught yet, they will be taught later. In a harder way. The person might have to live the lesson to learn it. That is why some material should not be taken away.  Everyone believes in different things. There is always someone that has a different opinion of things. The world contains many things that people find offensive, but it does not mean those things have to go. There is always a choice of what to do and what not to do. Someone has to find a way to fix things in a good kind of way where people can find peace with themselves and others. Removing material from libraries can cause many things; approval, disapproval, anger, and happiness. Most of all, it can cause fights, which later on can turn into war. The material in our libraries is meant to teach people about life, and if people find that wrong, then it means they do not experience life to its fullest.
939	3916	2	3	Censorship is a complex issue that requires careful consideration, especially when it comes to censorship in libraries. While some may argue for the removal of certain books to protect younger audiences, it is important to remember the value of literature and the impact it can have on individuals. Restricting access to books can limit knowledge and hinder intellectual growth.   Instead of censoring books, it is more effective to monitor children's reading choices and guide them towards age-appropriate material. Banning books can lead to a slippery slope where more and more titles are deemed unsuitable, ultimately depriving readers of a wide range of perspectives and ideas.   Books have the power to transport readers to different worlds, teach important lessons, and spark critical thinking. By maintaining a diverse collection in libraries, individuals have the opportunity to explore a variety of topics and expand their understanding of the world.   Ultimately, censorship in libraries can have negative consequences, causing division and limiting access to valuable resources. It is important to prioritize intellectual freedom and encourage a culture of open-mindedness and exploration.Books are meant to be enjoyed by all, and efforts to censor them can have detrimental effects on society as a whole.
940	3917	2	3	You go to a library to read books, music, and magazines, but soon you find out that there are very offensive books. I strongly say yes, I agree that we should remove the books, magazines, and music from shelves if they are offensive to people. We are supposed to feel safe reading books, listening to music, and reading magazines. When I was younger I went to the library all the time. I would get books to read and look at, and for a while I was excited to go to the library, but all the excitement went away after a few bad experiences. Remembering the names of the books are not going to come to me, but I know I was so upset by how the book was. It had words that I never heard before, and I got confused. This could happen to many little kids that come across a bad book, but really libraries should only have good books not bad.  After that bad experience happened to me I ignored it like it will go away or something. Bad books, offensive books, should be taken off shelves for good and never to return. I feel very strongly about this subject, because I am a bookworm, I love to read books and being able to go to a library and find a good book that's not offensive is all that I ask for in a library. Offensive books, music, and magazines should not be allowed to be in libraries at all. When kids read books or listen to music they want to be able to disappear in them, but if there are offensive stuff out there, how will they be able to do that. There are things that should be left out of libraries and that is offensive books, music, and magazines.  In closing to my essay I still have full courage in my answer, I still say yes, they should remove the offensive books, music, and magazines. If it was your sister, your daughter, or your niece that went into a library and found an offensive book, what would you say? I ask you this, how would you feel? Offensive content has no place in a library, where people should feel safe and comfortable exploring literature and music. It is important to protect the innocence and well-being of library patrons by removing any offensive material from the shelves.
941	3918	2	3	When I was in fifth grade, chaos broke out in my community over the issue of censorship. It all started when a high school student's parents demanded that the book The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 be banned from schools due to its disturbing content. This sparked a debate on whether censorship was justified, especially in educational settings.  As the discussion unfolded, I realized that everyone has the right to decide what they read, watch, or listen to, except for parents when it comes to their children. Parents have a responsibility to monitor their children's exposure to certain materials based on their maturity level. However, this does not give them the right to impose their beliefs on others by banning books from libraries or schools.  Censorship based on personal opinions can be subjective and limit people's access to valuable learning experiences. We learn from the mistakes and triumphs of fictional characters, musicians, and artists, and denying individuals the opportunity to explore diverse perspectives could hinder their personal growth and understanding of the world.  In conclusion, while parents have a role in guiding their children's media consumption, widespread censorship of materials in libraries or schools is detrimental to society as a whole. We must protect the freedom to explore different ideas and viewpoints, even if they may be controversial or uncomfortable. Ultimately, censorship should be approached with caution to ensure that individuals have the opportunity to learn and grow from a variety of sources.
942	3919	2	3	Libraries are a valuable source of information that should not be censored. People have the freedom to choose what books they want to read, and should not be restricted by someone else's idea of what is offensive. Each individual has different sensitivities and preferences, so it is important to allow for a wide range of materials to be available. Censoring books would only lead to dissatisfaction among library users and would be a difficult task to carry out effectively. Therefore, libraries should continue to provide a diverse selection of books without censorship.
943	3920	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should never be removed just because a certain person, or group of people, find it offensive. The authors of these works have the right, as stated in the Constitution of the United States, to express themselves freely through their writing. Additionally, what one person finds offensive, many others may not, and these materials may hold value and knowledge for those who enjoy them. It is essential to respect the freedom of expression enshrined in the Constitution, as it was deemed vital by the founding fathers of the nation.   Furthermore, what is considered offensive varies from person to person. Just because something may offend one individual or group does not mean it should be censored for everyone. Diversity in beliefs, values, and opinions is a fundamental aspect of society, and censorship hinders the exchange of ideas and perspectives. Everyone should have the opportunity to access a wide range of literature and art, even if some may find it controversial or objectionable.  It is crucial to preserve all forms of literature and art, even if they contain challenging themes or language. These works can offer valuable lessons and insights that may benefit individuals of all ages and backgrounds. By allowing for a diverse range of materials in libraries, we enable people to learn, grow, and expand their understanding of the world.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not acceptable. All works of literature should be available for people to read and interpret as they see fit. By upholding the freedom of expression and resisting censorship, we ensure that knowledge and creativity continue to flourish for present and future generations.
944	3921	2	3	There are many different styles of literature and media in this world, each with the potential to please at least one person. However, there comes a point when some media and literature become too much and should not be allowed on shelves. In today's society, media has a significant influence, with people constantly engaging with various forms of it, from television shows to social media platforms. However, excessive exposure to certain types of media can have negative effects on individuals, especially teens who may become addicted and influenced by the immoral content they consume.   Video games, for example, can be entertaining and even beneficial in moderation, but when players become engrossed in violent games that glorify killing and immorality, it can have damaging effects on their minds and behavior. Similarly, certain genres of music, such as rap and heavy metal, can promote unhealthy attitudes and beliefs, leading listeners to question the value of life and engage in destructive behaviors.  Ultimately, the overwhelming presence of negative media and literature in society can contribute to mental health issues, destructive behaviors, and even tragic outcomes like suicide. It is crucial for individuals to be mindful of the content they consume and set limits to protect their mental and emotional well-being. By recognizing when media becomes too much and taking steps to filter out harmful influences, we can strive to safeguard our minds and preserve our values in a world inundated with questionable content.
945	3922	2	3	"Books, music, movies, and magazines can be considered offensive in different ways, leading some individuals to question whether they should be removed from shelves to protect children from exposure. However, libraries typically do not have a designated ""offensive"" section. Instead, individuals can take proactive steps to ensure that children do not access materials they deem inappropriate. By monitoring children's selections, checking content ratings, and previewing materials before allowing access, individuals can effectively manage exposure to potentially offensive content without the need for widespread removal of materials. Ultimately, it is important to balance individual preferences with the broader availability of diverse materials in library collections."
946	3923	2	3	Books, movies, magazines, or music that is offensive in any way should not be allowed to be shown to the public. These forms of media often contain inappropriate content that can negatively impact individuals, especially young children and teenagers. It is important to protect the minds of our youth and promote a positive and respectful environment in society.  When it comes to magazines and tabloids that expose the personal lives of celebrities, it is important to remember that everyone deserves privacy and respect. Constantly showcasing the embarrassing aspects of their lives only perpetuates a culture of invasion of privacy and sensationalism. Celebrities work hard to entertain us, and they should be able to live their lives without constant scrutiny and judgment.  In school libraries, books with explicit content such as sexual assaults and foul language should not be available to students. Schools should provide materials that offer good examples and positive messages to young readers. It is essential to create a safe and educational environment for students to learn and grow.  Similarly, movies that contain nudity, violence, and foul language should not be easily accessible to children and young adults. Libraries should take measures to separate restricted movies from other films and ensure that individuals of a certain age or with parental permission can access them. By restricting access to violent and inappropriate content, we can protect the well-being of our youth and promote a culture of respect and positivity.  In conclusion, it is crucial to limit the exposure of offensive and inappropriate content in books, movies, magazines, and music. By taking action to prevent the distribution of such material, we can create a more wholesome and respectful society for all individuals, especially our children and young adults. Let us prioritize the well-being and moral development of the younger generation by promoting positive and uplifting content in all forms of media.
947	3924	2	3	Some materials, such as books, movies, magazines, should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. While there are offensive content in these materials, they can also serve as a learning tool for individuals. Books provide valuable information and insights on various topics, even if they contain offensive content. Movies can have a strong influence on people, especially young children, but they can also provide important lessons and perspectives. Music can define a person's mood and personality, but it also allows individuals to express themselves and connect with others. Magazines showcase different styles and stories, influencing people's choices and preferences. Overall, these materials should not be removed as they can help individuals learn and grow, despite the presence of offensive content.
948	3925	2	3	@LOCATION1's main idea in the area of art, language, and music is centered around the concept of freedom. They believe that individuals should have the right to express themselves freely through writing, drawing, and speech without fear of censorship or restriction. @LOCATION1 argues that banning or removing books, music, or movies infringes on people's rights and limits the diversity of viewpoints in society. They emphasize the importance of allowing people to express their ideas, even if they may be considered controversial or offensive to some. @LOCATION1 draws parallels to historical figures like @PERSON1 and Galileo Galilei, who faced backlash for their innovative ideas but ultimately contributed to advancements in knowledge and understanding. Overall, @LOCATION1 advocates for the protection of freedom of speech as a fundamental aspect of a progressive and open-minded society.
949	3926	2	3	There are a lot of things that can be found in libraries that some people may find inappropriate. If a person is offended by something, they can request for it to be removed from the shelf. Libraries are great places to work on projects and meet friends. If someone needs help finding a book for their project, they can ask the librarian for assistance.   Having books available in different formats such as discs, DVDs, movies, and tape players could encourage more people to read. It would also be beneficial if all libraries had a similar collection of books to cater to a wider audience. Creating a separate section for children's books would make it easier for kids to find what they're looking for.  It's important for libraries to remove any inappropriate materials to ensure a comfortable environment for all visitors. Magazines should also have ratings to prevent young children from accessing content that may not be suitable for them. Dividing magazines into sections for different age groups would help in maintaining a respectful atmosphere in the library.  Overall, libraries and magazines should be mindful of the content they provide to cater to the needs of their diverse audience and create a welcoming environment for all visitors.
950	3927	2	3	Dear newspaper editor,  I am writing to tell you about the censorship in the libraries of our community. This issue may not seem significant to some, but it is a major problem for many. Censorship has led to the removal of various forms of media from shelves, including books, music, magazines, and movies, deemed offensive by store or library owners.  The concern here is not about what the owners personally like or dislike, but rather about catering to the diverse interests of the general public. Some individuals have even succeeded in having certain books banned from our local library systems.  Should the decision of what to sell or display be solely left to the owner? In most cases, the answer is no. Banning materials that contain even a slight reference to sensitive topics such as sex, drugs, or alcohol could eventually lead to a complete lack of variety on our shelves. Without access to a wide range of reading materials, we risk becoming a society devoid of critical thinking and literacy.  There have been reports of individuals losing their jobs for simply reading a magazine during their break at work. If we continue to yield to the demands of those seeking to censor materials, we may soon find ourselves devoid of books and other forms of media in our libraries and stores.  While some may argue in favor of censorship, believing it necessary for certain items, others advocate for a more open and free society. It is crucial to consider the implications of censorship on our access to information and ideas.  Therefore, I urge you, as a newspaper editor, to reflect on whether you would like to see all your favorite magazines, books, and movies disappear forever. The answer to this question will shed light on the importance of preserving a diverse range of materials for the benefit of our community.  Sincerely,   [Your Name]
951	3928	2	3	Some books on the shelf at libraries have content that may be deemed inappropriate for certain age groups, whether it be explicit language, mature themes, or controversial topics. The question of whether libraries should censor such materials is a contentious issue.   In my opinion, censorship of books, magazines, music, or movies in libraries should be avoided. Readers should have the freedom to choose what they want to read or watch, and it is ultimately up to the individual or their parents to decide what is suitable for them. While some parents may prefer to restrict certain materials from their children, others may have different views on what is acceptable.  When it comes to school libraries, there may be stricter guidelines in place to ensure that the materials available are appropriate for students. However, in public libraries, there is a wider range of materials catering to various interests and age groups. It is important to trust in the discretion of readers and their ability to make informed decisions about the content they engage with.  Censoring books or other media in libraries could limit access to important and valuable works that may spark important conversations or provide valuable insights. It is essential to promote a culture of intellectual freedom and allow individuals to explore a diverse range of perspectives and ideas. Ultimately, the decision to read or watch certain materials should be left to the discretion of the individual, with guidance from parents or caregivers where necessary.
952	3929	2	3	I believe that the appropriateness of books in libraries is a subjective matter, with different viewpoints from various individuals. While some may argue that certain books should not be available in libraries, I think that if a book is deemed inappropriate for a particular age group, it should be placed in a different section or library for older readers. Parents may have concerns about their children reading certain books, but ultimately, kids will be exposed to challenging content at some point in their lives. Schools and libraries should have protocols in place to address parental concerns regarding book selections. By communicating with educators and librarians, parents can ensure that their children have access to reading materials that align with their values and beliefs. It is essential to have open discussions and establish guidelines to address any potential issues regarding book selection in libraries.
953	3930	2	3	To censor, or not to censor? That is the question. I am positive that there are a great amount of different views portaining to this topic. Everyone will have very good points on either using, or not using censorship in the library. Although this is true, I believe that there are many more valid reasons not to use censorship in libraries. First of all, how offensive can library material truly be? I do not believe that is very offensive at all. There will be movies and material specifically designed for a mature an older age group. This is fine; if the person choosing the material is of age then he or she should have no reason not to choose advanced material. A mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life. Sooner or later, they will have to be intruduced into the real life. It would not be beneficial to them or society if they are sheltered their entire lives. Also, if the person is still a child, there should be no reason for a child to choose the older level of material. There @MONTH1 be times when he does; however, this is not a problem because all the parent has to do is explain to him that he is not of age yet. This is an easy fix. As I said earlier, ther is no reason we all need to read the same thing. Variety is what makes libraries apealing to the customers. Who would want to go to a library with all the same books? I myself would not. Within the library, there are sections specifically just for children. If all the slightly offensive material was to be taken out of libraries, that would eliminate a large portion of the customers. Also, this would discourage writers from even producing thier material; thus hindering their income and motivation. We have freedom and choice in @LOCATION1, and I feel this would go against @CAPS1 values if they were to induce censorhip in a harmless library. No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. However, we can also improve and learn from them. If a person does choose an inapropriate book, they will most likely learn and improve from their mistake. We have a choice about what to choose when we go into the library. I believe if not all, the majority of the time we make the right choice. Libraries are a supercenter of learning and information. This would not be true if certain portions of information began to be removed. I have had many worthwhile times in the library and was never once harmed or offended. Libraries are here to help and not to hinder our learning. I am most likely not the only one who feels pleased with the way libraries are now and feel no need to change what is good.
954	3931	2	3	My opinions on censorship in libraries are that it is important to consider the content of books, movies, music, and magazines before deciding whether to remove them from shelves. While offensive material should be removed to protect the sensibilities of the public, it is also crucial to respect people's right to access information and entertainment. Books are essential for education and enjoyment, while movies and magazines provide entertainment and information on various topics. Therefore, censorship should be done judiciously to strike a balance between protecting the public and preserving freedom of expression.
955	3932	2	3	Censorship in libraries is almost a primitive if not childish way to exclude what one might think to be offensive from everyone else, is it not? Think about it. A kid who doesn't let another kid play with him at recess today, only because he stuck his tongue out at him during math the previous day, seems pretty childish, and several much more reasonable solutions come to mind to anyone who sits and thinks about the situation for more than a second. This scenario runs parallel with censorship in libraries.  A book is a book to be read. That is, of course, an obvious statement. But why read a book? To get information. To learn something that you did not know, or to build on knowledge that you already had. How do you cook an exquisite meal? Go read a book to find out. How do you graph linear equations? There are books that will explain it for you. Is it fair for an avid astronomer, feeling no need to know how long a turkey needs to stay in an oven, to remove a book that teaches that very thing? Now, of course cooking a turkey will most likely not come across as offensive to someone perusing through their local library, however, think about this. The book has been written, so is that not a sure sign it is not offensive to at least one person, that being the author?  There are things people will not agree with. And just when you think you find something everyone likes, someone will come along and disturb the peace. Not everyone likes rap music, but it is still playing on the radio. It is free choice to listen to it. It is a free choice to read a book, regardless of what it says. Just because people have the misfortune to be subjected to material they find offensive, by accident or otherwise, and then project their disdainful comments toward someone in charge, does not mean that the offensive material should be thrown out.  Perhaps, radios and libraries can be even further examined. Radios have specific channels, playing specific music. There is a country music channel for those who want to listen to country music. As for libraries, there is of course the @ORGANIZATION1, but that is about as far as categorization goes. Suppose books be even further distinguished by the location within a library. A certain area designated for certain genres. That way, if you happen to find books about @CAPS1 concentration camps distasteful, then you can avoid the @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 aisle of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 section in your library. Problem solved. I find it hard to see something as offensive if I can't even literally see it.  You see, outright removal isn't really the best option for pleasing dissatisfied people. Compromise is. Now, after having thought about this situation for more than a second, I'm sure you have thought of much more reasonable solutions than something so ludicrous as censorship. Now the best part is seeing people enjoy books, and not being offended by the ones they don't like anymore.
956	3933	2	3	Having libraries is essential for promoting literacy and providing educational resources for children and families. Libraries offer a wide range of books, magazines, and other materials that cater to different age groups and interests. Librarians play a crucial role in organizing and maintaining these resources, ensuring that they are easily accessible to everyone.  Libraries should prioritize age-appropriate and educational materials, such as books, CDs, and computers for homework or research. It is important to create a safe and conducive environment for learning and exploration. Inappropriate materials should be removed to protect children from exposure to harmful content.  Librarians should advocate for the removal of any materials that are not suitable for a library setting and guide patrons on proper usage. By promoting literacy and providing a welcoming space for reading and learning, libraries can have a positive impact on children and families in the community.
957	3934	2	3	Books, movies, music, and magazines are often subjects of debate when it comes to censorship. Some believe that these forms of entertainment should be censored or even banned for various reasons. Three main topics often discussed in relation to censorship are children, race, and religion.  When it comes to children, many parents are concerned about the content their kids are exposed to in books, movies, music, and magazines. Violence, vulgar language, and drug references are some of the main worries. Parents fear that such content could influence their children negatively, leading to risky behavior or disrespect. This concern for children's well-being drives some to advocate for censorship.  Race is another sensitive issue that can be portrayed in a controversial manner in various forms of media. Racism and discrimination based on skin color or ethnicity have been prevalent in society. Some believe that certain content perpetuates stereotypes or fuels hatred, leading to racial tensions. Censorship may be seen as a way to prevent such harmful portrayals and promote equality among all races.  Religion is a significant factor in the censorship debate, as different beliefs can clash in books, movies, music, and magazines. People often feel strongly about their religious views and may find content that contradicts their beliefs offensive. This can lead to conflicts and attempts to impose censorship to protect religious sensitivities.  In conclusion, the debate over censoring books, movies, music, and magazines revolves around concerns for children, race relations, and religious beliefs. While some argue for censorship to protect vulnerable audiences or prevent harmful stereotypes, others advocate for freedom of expression. Finding a balance between these viewpoints is crucial in navigating the complex world of media censorship.
958	3935	2	3	In every library, it is important to have a wide variety of books, movies, and magazines available for the public to access. While not everyone may agree with or enjoy every single piece of content, it is essential to have diverse sources for people to choose from. Limiting what is available in libraries would restrict access to information and entertainment, which goes against the purpose of these institutions.  Libraries should not remove certain books, movies, or magazines simply because some individuals may find them offensive. What one person finds offensive, another may find valuable or enjoyable. It is up to each individual to decide what they want to read, watch, or listen to. By keeping a wide range of sources available, libraries can cater to the diverse interests and preferences of their patrons.  Librarians are knowledgeable professionals who carefully select materials to include in their collections. They do not choose items with the intention of causing offense, but rather to provide a variety of options for the community to explore. It is important to trust their judgment and allow them to curate collections that serve the needs and interests of a wide range of individuals.  Overall, all types of books, movies, and magazines should be left on the shelves of libraries. This ensures that everyone has the opportunity to access the content that interests them and helps to promote learning and exploration. Libraries play a crucial role in providing access to information and entertainment, and it is important to preserve their role as inclusive and diverse spaces for all.
959	3936	2	3	"I think that they shouldn't remove the censorship books in the libraries because so bigger kids can read the books not the little kids because they don't need to hear the kind of words in the books. Also the little kids have too small ears to hear and too small eyes to even see the words in the book like that. The bigger kids, like in grades @NUM1, should be able to look at the books because they will be words that they have heard before.  The books shouldn't be in the lower-grade libraries because the little kids will check the books out of the libraries, like the books that are called ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" because it says the n-word a lot of times, and another one is ""Of Mice and Men"" because it says a lot of curse words like the f-word, s-word, and etc. Words that they don't need to hear at that young age.  Another reason why it would not be fair to the bigger kids if they take away from the libraries is that they are trying to get them out of the libraries so the littler kids don't get the books to take home and read at home. If you are going to take away the books, take them away from the grades @NUM2 because the books called ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""Of Mice and Men"" will be bad for those kids to read.  Some more reasons why bigger kids should read the books and why the little kids shouldn't read the books are that the bigger kids in grade @NUM1 are bigger than the littler kids. The littler kids shouldn't read them because we don't want them to go home and say the words to their mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, and etc.  Now I have come to the end of my persuasive essay for the newspaper about my reflection on why or why not we should get rid of the censorship in the libraries. Also, until next time, I write again about this topic, and I hope you like this persuasive essay for the newspaper."
960	3937	2	3	Picture for yourself you, as a 10-year-old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, Socrates. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' What? One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, it's unnecessary. Here's why.  When it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways. For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person. Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend. Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend. Think about it next to you look at a copy of 'Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain; is it really that offensive to you?  When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because it's of some educational value to you. Books like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' provide a huge educational value because they show what American culture was like, but every day, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in the United States because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness.  There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, it's just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problems are that there are people who wanted to read this book can't because you thought it was offensive. If this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves. Then you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve? Nothing. Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what it's about, making the ban worthless.  I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone. It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve? Either way, you still must know that banning these things is wrong.
961	3938	2	3	I think that the bad books, and all the adult books, magazines, and all the other articles should have its own room in the libraries. If you don't want little kids and teenagers in those kinds of books and magazines then put I lock on the door and if you have proof of @CAPS1 that shows your @NUM1 then you are going to be aloud back there if you don't have proof of @CAPS1 then I guess your not going back to the adult section.     I say this because they have movies at the movie stores that are not aloud to be seen unless your @NUM1, but the thing is kids have imaginations that if you read a book you can also see pictures just like a movie. The movies in the movie store are locked up in a back room where you have to be @NUM1 or older to go back there and look. I bet its ruff when your kid is reading books and getting bad words out of them and saying them around like an even younger sibling, because then thats just going to cause a bigger problem then what you started out with.     People have to understand theses days that kids are growing up way to fast to just leave stuff like that laying around. Parents need to keep stuff like magazines, movies, pictures, books and stuff like that up away from kids. I feel like once you become a parent you automatically think your smarter than a kid but yet kids are pretty darn smart. I understand its only a word but its disrespectful to have your kids running around cussing and saying inaproperiate things to nice people.       When kids do that then othere parents that don't let their kids do that stuff think ' wow these parents obviously don't care'. I have a feeling that its never going to stop but it would be better if childrens parents did not let them cuss around other people ok at home if your parents don't care then sure but when you go out to eat or something and your son or daughter is over there cussing like a freight train its all because of those books she has been reading, the magazines and the movies.      Im going to close this little description now and im still against kids cussing under the age of being a mature teen.
962	3939	2	3	There are many inappropriate types of entertainment in the world, but that does not mean we should censor them all. Censoring materials in a library would severely limit what we can learn and explore. It would hinder research, especially for those in academic or medical fields, and restrict the diversity of content available to the public. While censoring may shield children from certain content, it does not address the underlying issues present in society. Ultimately, censoring materials in libraries may do more harm than good, leading to a lack of diversity, education, and a true reflection of our society.
963	3940	2	3	Now, one way or another that certain piece of material will be found and used. Someone out there in this world will appreciate that material and want to share it with others. So, regardless of efforts to remove offensive material, it is not fair to impose personal opinions on what others may find offensive. It is unjust to restrict access to material based on individual preferences. Everyone has different perspectives, and what one person finds offensive may not be offensive to others. Trying to control what people can view, listen to, or read is akin to trying to control individuals, which is not feasible in a diverse world. Therefore, it is not justified to remove material from shelves simply because a select few deem it offensive. People will always find a way to access such material, and attempting to conceal it goes against the principles of freedom of expression and access to diverse content.
964	3941	2	3	Most people do not think that kids should see certain things if they are found offensive. Like some books, music, movies, and magazines. I do not believe books or any other thing should be removed from libraries shelf. It should be the parent choice to what their child can look at or listen to. But now days when a child parent or any other authority don't let them do, watch, or listen to something it make kids want it more. Since they want it more they will find away to do, watch, or listen to what ever it may be. They will even go behind there parents back and probably won't care if they get in trouble. With this new generation authority can only limit so much of what children see today. Children see a lot of things that they are interested in and can find it all different types of ways. Computers, televsion, and the radio are three differnt major ways of finding things that maybe offensive but kids are interested in all the time. Young parents i do believe is one of the reasons kids know about these movies, books, music, and magazines. They say things and do things that young people should not know at a young age. That what make kids think its alright when their parents do what ever it maybe. So let it be the parent choice of what there child can see. Cause either way they going to be able to find away to get it.
965	3942	2	3	It's common for people to have items in their lives that hold significant sentimental value. These items may seem insignificant to others, but to the individual, they are priceless treasures. Whether it's a gift from a loved one, a memento from a special occasion, or a cherished possession, these objects hold a special place in the heart of the owner. It's important to respect and understand the attachment that individuals have to these items, even if it may seem trivial to others. By acknowledging and appreciating the importance of these possessions, we can show empathy and support for those who hold them dear. Ultimately, it's essential to be considerate and mindful of the sentiments and emotions tied to these meaningful objects, as they hold a unique significance for the person who treasures them.
966	3943	2	3	What I do think is that they should keep everything in the library. Some people like to stay and read the newspaper and listen to music while out in the library. If you do think it's offensive, then don't read it or just pick out another book. Everybody has their own ideas on a library and if they want their voices heard let them speak it out.  What I think about all this stuff in the library these days are good for the kids so they can learn faster and have a lot more to look forward to when they do get older. My own experiences in the library that I do see that there is a lot more people in the library and there is a lot more you can do instead of reading books most of the time. You can read magazines or newspapers to pass the time when no one is home or to hang out with, and it does get boring just reading books so try something different for a little while then go back reading the book that you did start with and wanted to take a break from.  Then other people have their own voice to say something if they don't want it in their library. Some of my observations that I have seen were not really good. I've seen some protesters in front of the libraries and I have seen them close down because of it. But people sometime can take it to far and do sometimes burn it to the ground. I have seen people cry over it and it makes me really upset that I want to do something to help them but I really can't do nothing.  The most valuable thing is the kids and young children that read the books. What if someone burn down you home, this is how these kids feel when you close down the most safe place to them? They have the biggest voice of everybody put together. That if you do something that make them feel better that would be really good to them. That they have not done anything to deserve this kind of mess that we put them through. It is very difficult to have somewhere to go to read but there is nowhere to go.  If you don't want to be quiet then let your voice be heard aroud the world and have the freedom to let it come out. You have three diffenent voices your own, other people that do or don't agree and you have your children. So which one are you going to listen to? When you have a choice and you have to make it and hope you make the right one.
967	3944	2	3	Should you conceal a child from the inappropriate half of the world? Not letting them hear, see, or read the bad in the world. Letting them grow up as innocent as possible. Should libraries take these precautions?   In a world like ours where bad things happen every day, it is challenging to shield children from the harsh realities of life. With easy access to information through various media channels, including libraries, it becomes crucial to consider what content is appropriate for different age groups.   Libraries should implement censorship measures by organizing materials based on age appropriateness and implementing security checks to prevent access to content deemed unsuitable for certain age groups. While offensive material should not be removed entirely, it can be segregated in a separate section to allow access for those who may benefit from it while protecting others from exposure.   Parents play a crucial role in monitoring and guiding their children's access to library materials, ensuring that they are exposed to content that aligns with their values and beliefs. By working together, libraries and parents can create a safe and enriching environment for children to explore and learn.
968	3945	2	3	We all find things offensive, whether it be in a book, magazine, movie, CD, TV show, or a newspaper article. Libraries hold all of those items and some people may want to remove the items that they think are offensive, but would that be right? If everyone went to the library and took everything that they thought was offensive off the shelves, we would have nothing left. Maybe writers should just cut down on things that are inappropriate, racist, or include foul language. Then not as many people would be offended and they would not have any problems with letting their children pick out books on their own. Although, it may not be the writers at fault here. It may be the readers. Some people should just stop taking everything so seriously, then they would not have to worry about things like what their children are reading.  Yes, most adult things now are inappropriate for children, but that's why it is for adults. Children have their own selection of books and movies. Parents need to realize that maybe they should take their kids to the children's section. All types of entertainment are categorized by age and people should start paying more attention to that. If parents started watching what their kids do, then they would not be worrying about them reading or watching something they should not be. That is what parents are for, taking care of their children, and some people do not do a very good job of that.  If there is a book you read and it is something you do not want your child to read, it is probably something you read when you were older, so do not worry about it until they get to that age. And maybe then it would be okay if they read it because they are old enough to realize right from wrong. Parents cannot always control what their children do. If they do by chance pick up the book their parents never wanted them to read, they may see it in a different way than their mother or father did, and they may learn a very valuable lesson from it. Ultimately, it is important for parents to guide their children in selecting appropriate reading materials while also allowing them to explore and learn from various perspectives.
969	3946	2	3	When going to a library, you expect to see various books, movies, music, magazines, and maybe other items. If a person is looking for a book that may be offensive to a race, culture, religion, or etc., they should still be able to check out that book. Libraries shouldn't be able to control those situations because it's a person's choice or an adult's choice to read those kinds of stories.  In our country, we are allowed to express our opinion by the law. The law includes free speech, which ensures that anyone can express their personal feelings or their opinion on certain matters. If a person would want to check out a book that could offend another individual, technically, by the law, they have the right to do so. I'm not condoning that someone should read books, listen to music, or even watch movies that could be hateful or cruel, but by the law, it's ok for people to want to read, listen, or watch those works.  Libraries are government-funded organizations. Therefore, meaning they don't have the right to disregard these works. The government pays for the books that are purchased into the library. This means they need books that people would want to read and be interested in even though some groups of people might not agree, it's their job.  I'm not encouraging reading these novels or listening to offensive music, but as citizens of the United States, we are allowed to listen to what we want and read anything we want because that's what our country is meant to stand for freedom. When I think of America, I think freedom, and I have to say I'm proud our country stands for that, and we should stand for that freedom even when it comes to the small things in life.
970	3947	2	3	I was asked to write an essay for a newspaper expressing my views on censorship in libraries. I firmly believe that it is not the government's place to decide what we can read or access in libraries. People should have the freedom to choose what they want to read without any interference.  Books are essential for learning about our history, understanding right from wrong, and exploring different perspectives. They provide us with knowledge, entertainment, and a gateway to different worlds. If we start censoring books, we risk losing valuable information and stifling creativity.  It is crucial for us to preserve our access to a wide range of books in libraries. By limiting what people can read, we limit their ability to think critically, imagine, and explore new ideas. It is our right to have access to diverse viewpoints and information.  Instead of censoring books, we should focus on educating people on how to make informed choices about what they read. If someone finds a book offensive, they can simply choose not to read it. Let's not let a few individuals dictate what the rest of us can or cannot access in libraries.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries goes against the principles of freedom of expression and access to information. We must protect our right to read and explore different ideas without any restrictions. Let's embrace the diversity of books and allow everyone the opportunity to learn, grow, and expand their horizons through reading.
971	3948	2	3	Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them. Others do not. For me, I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves because there are different types for different types of people. If a person took offense from a book or magazine, I believe that person should just put it back. If books that offended people couldn't be on the shelves, there would be no books on the shelves because I'm sure there's at least one person in the world that would take offense to each book. There are a lot of people in the world after all.  For music, there are different types also. There's rap, country, rock, pop, and many more. For example, if someone likes rap but not country, that person has a choice to listen to rap and not country. If that person doesn't like country though, it shouldn't be removed because others like country and want to listen to it.  For movies, there are many different types. There's horror, comedy, romance, and many more. That's why at the theater, there are different rooms for different movies. People always have a choice.  Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them, although some don't. Every person is different. People like different things. That is, in my opinion, the beauty of human nature.
972	3949	2	3	The views on censorship in libraries definitely varies from person to person. There are those who are offended by the material that is out there for anyone to access, and then there are those who want the right to read, listen, and watch whatever they choose. I believe there are pros and cons to each choice, either way you look at it, but there does need to be some sort of censorship in libraries; the line must be drawn somewhere.  The lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people. The inappropriate scenes in movies, whether it be involving two people of opposite sex or intense action moments, are not something people of a young age should be exposed to.  The easy access to the library is part of the problem. Someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want. In my own experience, I have had the opportunity to get whatever I wanted at the library. The advertising pictures on the cover of books, movies, magazines, etc., gave me a false sense of what the material really contained when I was younger. I came home from a day at the library with materials that my parents did not approve of.  If you look at it from the other point of view, you would probably be thinking, if we got rid of all material that someone would find offensive, our libraries would be left with close to nothing. In reality, I believe that once people realized that exposure to this kind of material is offensive, authors would change the way they would write; directors would change the way they produced movies; artists would change the lyrics to their songs. So yes, library's shelves would have been rid of many materials, but they would be replaced with what the people want.  Others might argue that they have the right to read, listen, and watch what they would like. This may be true, but shouldn't others have the right to let their children go to libraries without worrying about the gruesome material they might be exposed to?  Although to some people this argument can go either way, if the line is never drawn on what is available, who knows what the world may come to. From here, the material can only get more offensive, more disturbing, and leave a bigger effect on the minds of people. Children will be exposed to the 'evils' of this world at even a younger age, and if that is all they ever know, they won't realize what else this world has to offer them. Authors, directors, producers, and artists will all change their material if we show them that it is not what we want. In the end, a balance between freedom of expression and appropriate censorship in libraries is essential for creating a safe and enriching environment for all individuals.
973	3950	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and more, should be removed from libraries. These materials can contain harmful content that can negatively impact individuals, causing them emotional distress and potentially leading to harmful actions such as suicide. For example, a young girl was seen crying in a library after reading a book that made derogatory remarks about her race, causing her to fear a repeat of historical atrocities like slavery. Removing such offensive and hurtful materials from libraries can prevent similar incidents and protect the well-being of individuals. Ultimately, taking action to remove such harmful content from circulation can create a safer and more positive environment for everyone.
974	3951	2	3	Imagine walking into a library where the shelves are empty. A library where there are no books to lose oneself in the pages. A library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new views. A library where works of literature such as @ORGANIZATION1, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Harry Potter are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages. Some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind-blowing ideas. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice which is being taken over by modern technology.   A number of children in the United States are unable to read at their appropriate grade level. This number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities, lack of interest in education, and lack of resources. Reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject. It is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students. However, by censoring what books are allowed in a classroom and library, we are taking away a child's chance to broaden their minds. We are also taking away books that may interest a child. Children are 80% more likely to read a book that they are interested in. Allowing a child not to read a book, such as 'Harry Potter,' is impractical and harmful to the child. By taking away a book that students greatly enjoy, it discourages them from reading altogether. A person not only has the right to the best education one can receive, they also have the right to read whatever they want.   Books open up a child's mind to new places and adventures that they may not ever be able to experience in their lifetime. Books have the ability to broaden people's minds. Some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individual's beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people. The United States was founded on the basis of freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of thought. Why should this freedom not apply to books? Why should any person be allowed to tell another person what they can and cannot read? And why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries? This freedom should apply to books. No one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and cannot read. And these books should not be censored in public and school libraries. No one should be denied the chance to learn. By censoring books in libraries throughout the United States, millions of children are being denied the chance to learn.   We live in a world where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones can be found in most homes and in everyone's hands. Books are thought of as 'a thing of the past' and not up to speed with today's technology. However, books are an important part of one's education. Censoring libraries discourages kids from reading even more than they already are discouraged from reading. Kids do not want to be told what they can and cannot read and by taking away the books they want, we are suppressing their minds. Censoring will only make them want to read less, and play on the computer more. Censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non-effective method. Kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers. The things they find on the internet will be more controversial than the majority of books that are being censored. A favorite book of many kids is the Harry Potter series. These books have been taken out of many libraries for their use of witchcraft. However, a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial. Censoring is pointless because children have other ways of viewing things that would be censored in a library.   Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice that is being taken over by modern technology. Today's youth is exposed to wars, terrorist attacks, gangs, domestic violence and drive-bys every day. The world of books can be an escape from the world they live in. Books can help a child overcome poverty, mental challenges, and violence every day. The pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves. The inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more than they thought possible. Censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books. Censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish. In conclusion, censorship in libraries should not be applied as it hinders the personal rights, opportunities for education, and the intellectual growth of individuals. Every person deserves the freedom to explore
975	3952	2	3	First of all, I believe that if something is on the shelf, regardless of age, people should be able to access it. While there may be materials that are not suitable for certain age groups, it is important for individuals to have the freedom to choose what they want to read. Parents may have different opinions on what should be available in a library, but ultimately, the decision should not be solely up to them. Everything should be allowed in a library, and if parents have concerns about their children's choices, they should accompany them to help select appropriate reading materials. In conclusion, the ability to access any item on the library shelves should be upheld for both children and adults. If something is not meant to be accessed, then it should not be displayed in the library in the first place.
976	3953	2	3	'@CAPS1 are you reading' asked mom. I immediately hid the book behind my back, knowing she wouldn't like the idea of me reading such an in-depth book. Some parents don't like for their kids to read certain content. If it's not okay at home, it shouldn't be okay at school. There are subjects that maybe we shouldn't, but we do because our parents say no. Removing said subjects will remove the chance of disobeying our parents and copying behavior from books.  There are books, movies, magazines, and music that are considered 'cool', but not all of them are appropriate. Some movies and music use offensive language and actions that some kids pick up on and mimic actors, actresses, and artists. Soon they start to make a name for themselves by using such language or actions and eventually become known as the 'bad kid'. Students such as myself feel inferior to being popular or noticed, so they feel the need to do things to stand out. Most things students model after are the things they see, hear, or watch, such as the media.  It is wise to set censors in libraries for students. Though some students may not want censorship in libraries, it is only for their best interest to remove materials that are offensive. This will help students, including myself, become better individuals by not being exposed to inappropriate content. I believe that using censorship will encourage students to make the decision at home not to engage in such things.  Students often observe how movie stars and famous people behave. If they are a fan of a particular celebrity and that person does something questionable, they may either find someone else to admire or imitate the behavior because they think it's cool. If I were a fan of @PERSON1 and read that she stole something, I would reconsider my admiration or risk getting into trouble by following her example.  In conclusion, I support censorship in libraries because it ensures the well-being of students and protects them from harmful influences. I would respect the idea of censorship in my school because I know it is there to help me. It is important for students to avoid being exposed to violence, sex, drugs, and drama through movies, music, magazines, or books for their own good.
977	3954	2	3	I don't think censorship should be practiced in libraries. It's not fair to everybody. If censorship was practiced everywhere, there probably would not be any movies or anything entertaining out, due to a large amount of people complaining. I have a few reasons also why I think there should not be censorship in libraries.  One reason is freedom of the press. In our society, we are given the right of writing what we want, and if censorship continues, we will lose one of our rights. I don't think that's fair to control what we want to write or read.  Another reason is freedom of speech. Also written in our constitution, we are given the right to say what we want, and nobody can control that. If we keep using censorship, then this right will also be taken away from us. We're slowly losing our God-given rights, as people are offended by books and things of that nature.  A personal experience I have was one day my friend and I were going to go to the library to get a book for our history report. The report had to be over the 1800s and slavery. Unfortunately, my friend was African American, and he had a hard time not being offended by the assignment. When we got to the library, things got worse. All of the books we found were over how badly the slaves were treated back then.  My friend was getting very upset at this point. Finally, he saw another book making fun of the slaves, then he went up to the librarian asking, 'Can you take those books off the shelf and put them somewhere else?' The librarian just looked at him with a straight face and said, 'No. What makes you think you should get any special treatment?' My friend was dumbfounded. He couldn't believe what he had just heard.  Censorship isn't fair, as it limits us to our abilities and what we enjoy. It's not fair to punish other people based on what they read, write, or say. We all have our own preferences; how would you like it if yours got taken away?
978	3955	2	3	Some people often go to the library to check out books, movies, magazines, etc., without realizing that some of the content may be offensive to certain individuals. However, it is important to understand that everything in the library is there for a reason and should remain accessible to the public. While certain materials may be offensive to some, they serve educational purposes and offer different perspectives on various subjects.  It is not necessary to remove offensive content from libraries, as people need to learn to deal with diverse viewpoints and opinions. Just like on television, offensive content can be found in various forms of media, but it is part of life and should be accepted as such. Books, movies, and magazines often reflect real-life events and may contain harsh or controversial themes, but they are meant to provoke thought and discussion.  Everyone has the right to their own opinion, and it is essential to consider the intentions behind the creation of certain works. Even if something is offensive to one person, it may serve a valuable purpose in sparking dialogue and challenging societal norms. In a free country, individuals have the freedom to express their thoughts and feelings without fear of reprisal.  Overall, it is important to understand that offensive content in libraries is not meant to harm or discriminate but rather to provide a diverse range of perspectives and ideas. By considering the context and purpose behind such materials, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of different viewpoints and engage in meaningful discussions. It is through this process that personal growth and societal progress can be achieved.
979	3956	2	3	Censorship can be a positive measure to protect the community from inappropriate content, such as vulgar language, explicit images, and violence, in books, magazines, music, and movies found in public libraries. It is essential to censor material that may offend or harm individuals, especially children. However, excessive censorship, as seen in extreme cases like burning books, can have detrimental effects on freedom of expression and access to information. Finding a balance between protecting the public from offensive material and preserving artistic and intellectual freedom is crucial. In conclusion, while some censorship is necessary in public libraries to maintain a safe and respectful environment, it is essential to avoid going to extremes that may limit access to diverse ideas and perspectives.
980	3957	2	3	As an individual who has read various books, I believe that some books should be removed from shelves to protect children. It is important for kids to have an innocent childhood and not be exposed to inappropriate content at a young age. This also applies to music, movies, and magazines, as some people believe that these can influence negative behavior in children. By limiting access to obscene material, we can help prevent children from engaging in harmful actions such as stealing, swearing, or violence.  Every day, we witness instances of bad behavior like theft, foul language, murder, and assault. These behaviors are often glorified in media, making it seem acceptable to young audiences. By restricting access to such content, we can promote more positive behaviors among children. It is crucial for kids to be shielded from inappropriate material until they are old enough to understand and process it.  In conclusion, children should be allowed to enjoy their youth without being exposed to harmful content. By implementing censorship or removing inappropriate material from shelves, we can help create a safer and more positive environment for children to grow up in. Let's prioritize the well-being and innocence of our youth by controlling their exposure to negative influences.
981	3958	2	3	I believe that there are certain materials in libraries that are not suitable for young children. Books containing violence or sensitive topics like slavery can have a negative impact on impressionable minds. Similarly, music with inappropriate lyrics, movies depicting violence, and magazines with explicit content should not be easily accessible to children in school libraries. These materials can influence children in the wrong way and may lead to undesirable behavior. It is important for libraries to curate their collection carefully to ensure that only age-appropriate and educational content is available to young readers.
982	3959	2	3	If there is any offensive material in books, movies, music, or magazines, it should be removed from shelves to protect children. Kids can easily access these items and may learn inappropriate behaviors or language from them. It is important for parents to monitor what their children are exposed to and keep offensive content out of their reach. By being proactive in keeping these materials away from young kids, we can help ensure they grow up in a safe and positive environment. All offensive books, movies, music, and magazines should be kept out of the hands of children to prevent them from being negatively influenced.
983	3960	2	3	In a way, many books are put on the library shelf for a reason. Some of the books take race, sexism, bullying, etc., to extreme. Putting myself in a child's shoes when they read those books, magazines, movies, music, etc., would have to be scary. The languages in movies and music are not what we think they are. Would you want your child, who is young, to go out and imitate what other children their age do because they think it is cool?   Remember back in the days when you were young, and your parents didn't have to worry about what you were doing because your generation was different? Well, these upcoming generations may face even more challenges if we don't take action now. Removing certain books from shelves or censoring profanities in songs will not harm children or teenagers. These influences are normalizing behaviors like sex, smoking, drinking, or swearing.   My mother often checks up on me because she worries about my well-being. If we work together to eliminate profanities and inappropriate content, the world could become a safer and kinder place. Bullying, cyberbullying, drugs, and alcohol could become less prevalent. It's crucial to teach children that such behaviors are unacceptable and unnecessary. There is a fulfilling life without indulging in sex, drugs, or profanities.   Before purchasing DVDs or CDs, make sure to preview them to ensure they are suitable for your child. Have conversations with your child about right and wrong. Let's work towards eliminating profanities and harmful influences. If it's not something you want your child to be exposed to, then it's best not to engage with it yourself. Let's strive to create a more positive environment for our children and future generations.
984	3961	2	3	Browsing for a book at your local library that you've read, wanting to reread to enjoy the sounds of its words again? You look shelf after shelf, not locating anywhere. You searched everywhere, by everything that the book would possibly be listed under. You've browsed paperbacks, hardbacks; eventually letting your frustration take over. Giving up on locating the novel, you walk over to the librarian and ask about . She replies with, 'I'm sorry, we had to remove that particular novel due to a person finding offensive to them.' You're infuriated, you decide to write an article to your local newspaper about the outrage of the books, movies, music, etc. that has been taken out of your local library.  Personally, I don't think that the media taken away from the library should be considered offensive. How can you consider what is offensive and what is not? A book could be offensive to one person, but not another. Different people have different opinions, and it's not reasonable to remove a book or other type of media from a library because it contains 'offensive material.' It's ridiculous; it infuriates me that someone would do that. If you think it could get into the hands of a child, or someone that it would affect, do not rent the item. That's why at most libraries, there are separate areas for adults and children so that children don't obtain these items.  How can you determine if something is offensive? I personally don't find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me, doesn't mean I will request to have it banned so that other people can't enjoy it. If you find something offensive, just leave it alone. Don't bother, annoy, or hassle someone else that had nothing to do with its creation with it. It's not only disrespectful to the individual you file a complaint to, but the artist who created it. You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, it doesn't have to be voiced.  We live in such a closed-minded world. We have people who don't even think it's appropriate to show one's arm. I can see why some people take offense to these things, but honestly, it's mediocre to report something just because you do not agree with it. We have a vast knowledge of what's right or wrong, what is or is not appropriate for an audience to hear. If it weren't appropriate, you honestly think it would have been published? Sure there are things in book, music, etc. that are inappropriate, but to be so closed-minded to have something banned for use of foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is illogical. You can find worse, hear worse, just by walking down the street just about anywhere.  To answer the question bluntly, no, I do not think that media should be banned just because it is offensive. We as have the right to speak our voice, from two different perspectives. You can argue if something is mediocre, is offensive; I will argue back, just because I have the right to voice my opinion as you do. These reasons that enjoyable media are banned, such as language and violence, add emphasis, meaning, emotion, and make the reader dig for so much more in a book, song, etc. These are how the authors see their work, they want to show the people what they see, even if it does offend someone else.
985	3962	2	3	Imagine a scenario where someone snatches a book from you, claiming it is offensive and should not be read. This is an example of censorship, where individuals or authorities restrict access to certain forms of entertainment. While it is important to protect children from harmful content, total censorship is not the answer. People should have the freedom to choose what they read, watch, or listen to, without interference from others. Censorship limits creativity and restricts individual rights. Instead of imposing strict controls, we should focus on guiding children towards appropriate content and allowing adults to make their own choices. Let us uphold our freedom of speech and expression, and respect each person's right to decide what is acceptable for themselves. Let us promote a society where diverse opinions and ideas can coexist, without the fear of censorship.
986	3963	2	3	Many Libraries today have limits on what they can put on their shelves.  Yes, their is offensive material out there in the world but, its just artists trying to make a name for themselves.  If we start controlling each other's thoughts, feelings, and artistic ability, where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding?  Libraries should not have the right to censor material.  One way to appeal to everyone's demands would be to divide the library into two major sections: children's and adults. Then, further dividing sections could be implemented. Doing this would be cost-effective, and adding an age limit in the adult section so no noisy children could get in would be beneficial. It would help make finding a book easier for each individual.  Censorship is defined as removing a particular item that is either offensive to a certain group or is banned. If someone removed a statue or other pieces of work by an artist, we wouldn't be where we are today. Censorship holds back many artists' true potential and limits someone's knowledge, which could hinder their chance at success in the world.  I have read many books that are both offensive and full of knowledge, and there is no difference. Many things interest different people, and censoring material hurts everyone's yearning for an open mind and a better understanding of the world.  Libraries should not censor any material. Censoring material impedes everyone's ability to access diverse perspectives and ideas. As Katherine Paterson's quote eloquently states, if one person has the right to remove a book from the shelf, then everyone has that same right, and soon there will be no books left for anyone to read. Censorship should not have a place in libraries, as it stifles creativity and intellectual growth for all.
987	3964	2	3	It can be offensive when certain media content discriminates against individuals based on factors such as race, gender, sexuality, and social groups. While freedom of speech is important, there should be regulations in place to prevent harmful content from being disseminated. People should have the right to express their opinions, but there should be limits to ensure that the media does not promote discrimination or harm certain groups of people. It is crucial to consider the impact that media content can have on individuals, especially vulnerable groups like children. Ultimately, there needs to be a balance between freedom of speech and protecting individuals from offensive or harmful content in the media.
988	3965	2	3	Dear @CAPS1,  To @CAPS2 or @CAPS3,  Is it wrong to ban a book? It has come to my attention that this is exactly what our library is considering doing with any materials that someone finds offensive. I strongly disagree with this approach. A world where everyone has equal access to information is a better place to live. While some information may be sensitive, it should not be completely blocked simply because some individuals find it objectionable. Our country is founded on principles of freedom of speech and press, and denying this denies the essence of our nation. To address this issue, we need to establish a system of checks and balances to ensure information remains accessible while also protecting younger audiences.  Our society faces many challenges, but fundamental values enshrined in the Constitution are paramount. The freedom of press and speech guarantees our right to publish and access diverse content, regardless of its controversial nature. For instance, a recent incident in @LOCATION1 required a library to permit individuals to access explicit content on public computers due to legal obligations. While some may be uncomfortable with such freedoms, we cannot censor works based solely on individual discretion.  The world is constantly evolving, and societal norms shift over time. What is considered offensive today may not be tomorrow. The internet serves as a vast repository of information, both positive and negative. While it is impossible to block all objectionable content, we can implement restrictions to safeguard certain audiences.  To achieve this, our library could implement a system where adults or individuals over a certain age are granted access to restricted materials, while minors require parental consent. This would mirror the concept of permission slips in works like '@CAPS10 @CAPS11 and The @CAPS12 of @CAPS13,' where access to restricted areas is regulated. Such measures would enable the dissemination of information while protecting young audiences from inappropriate content.  As human beings, we have an innate curiosity for knowledge through various mediums. Restricting any part of this experience limits our potential growth. While certain content may be offensive, life itself can be offensive. Our founding fathers understood this when drafting the Constitution, which safeguards our right to information. It is essential to uphold these freedoms while also shielding our children from harm. A balanced program that allows individuals to access content based on their maturity level, guided by parental consent, is crucial.  In conclusion, banning books or any form of expression hinders our collective progress. By implementing thoughtful restrictions and age-appropriate access to materials, we can preserve our freedoms while safeguarding the well-being of our youth.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
989	3966	2	3	I'm ok with censorship on reading materials. I understand that the people selling the products want to appeal to the eye and make people buy what they are selling. I have a lot of experience with this because I read a lot of car magazines, and they sometimes have models in them. However, as a seventeen-year-old, I am okay with this. My school is very good about censorship; they flag inappropriate material and put it in the back, but they still allow you to read it. I appreciate this practice as it helps keep inappropriate content off the shelves. My parents also have some limits on what I can buy, but they are understanding as long as the content is mostly related to cars. All things have limits, just like how there is a limit to the horsepower stock parts can handle on a car before breaking. As I am not yet eighteen, I have limits on what I can purchase, but I still enjoy reading car magazines. In conclusion, censorship in reading materials can be beneficial in maintaining appropriate content for different age groups.
990	3967	2	3	What is offensive? How do we know what offends people, I mean everyone is different, everyone has their own thoughts a beliefs. So how are we suppose to know what offends who? The things that I would find offensive would be racial discrimination, gender discrimination, or religious discrimination. Those types of things would offend most people I think, but you can never be to sure. Books will always be books though and you can not tell people what they can and can not write or publish, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech. People will always say what they want but not everyone can get what they want. People need to come to sence and understand that consept. If a book, magazine, song, movie, or any other type of writen or vocal recording offends some one then do not read, listen to, or watch that item. No one can make some one watch or listen to something that offends them. People will always have a choice to do what they want in most cases. Books, songs, movies, magazines, and many other things will always offend atleast one person in the world we live in, but to be honest do we really care if it offends people if that is how we feel or believe? So I believe that if it offends a person then they will not take it off the shelf and if they do then that is their own personal problem people can not tell others what they can or can not write or record, it is their life let them live it.
991	3968	2	3	Isn't there a saying in the world called its a free country? I thought it was. There are a lot of things that people should not see in the world. But we find ways to see them anyway, no matter what it is. The world has many sources to get the truth, or maybe even lies, to the world we live in. From the media to the press to paparazzi, maybe even from the people around you, they all contribute to showing things that should not be seen by the public.  There are things out there that we, the people, don't know anything about, that the government and the world shield from our eyes. Then there are things that we are shown by the world that many find offensive. Racism, violent news stories like murder, kidnappings, and robberies, and more are displayed without censorship. People find these offensive and even scary, yet they remain accessible to the public.  I believe that offensive content should not be removed from shelves or any other platform where it is found. It is essential to have open discussions and debates about what should or should not be displayed. If we cannot come together and work with one another on these issues, what is the point of calling out offensive content when we may end up contributing to it ourselves without realizing it?  Everyone has an opinion, and it is crucial to respect that others may see things differently. If something offends you, simply avoid it. Focus on the positive aspects of life and do not dwell on the negative. By choosing not to engage with offensive content, we can promote a more positive and respectful society for all. Live life without worrying about negativity and concentrate on the good things you see around you.
992	3969	2	3	'Can I read this?'  @CAPS1 a round the world have asked this or been asked this question. @CAPS1 have their own right to read what they want, but are the children allowed to? There are books that children or young adults should read and should not read. This may vary for it depends on age, and the way the reader will understand the content of the books. There are cursing, smut and violence in books that children should not read.  In high school there are some books like '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' that have cursing in it. For high schoolers of 11 or older, it will be alright to read. High schoolers understand and have heard these words more than once before. If a teacher gives this book to a 3rd grader they would not understand the full potential it holds for the learning of it. Children in that age range will not understand that the man is handicapped, then the children would not understand the killing the handicapped man had done or why his friend killed him after it.  Will a parent let a 3-year-old read a smut novel? This depends on the way the parent was raised and how they feel it will affect the child's development. An adult book would not be appropriate for a child of that age for the child does not, and will not understand the book itself. The book is more than just that one part of smut. There is a gothic and romantic way of writing to adult books. A child of 3 years old would not have developed the mature way of thinking of the book.  Violence! 'Violence is not the answer.' Everyone has heard this saying. This saying is said but it's not followed. Young adults play video games, read books in school related to violence. '@ORGANIZATION1's don't @CAPS5' is a book of colored teenagers going to a white school. This is a book giving the kids to see how things were. A child in elementary would think it's funny if a cartoon is played for them and someone gets hit. The children will think it's a game and do not have enough background or maturity to understand what is really happening and that it is wrong to do that. For just watching a tv show with hitting or punching, the child will think it is okay to do it.  Overall, there will be violence, cursing, and smut novels out there. The thing it depends on the parents and maturity level of the person/child. There is a wrong and right way to do it but for some, it's not right to let some underage read a curse, violence, or smut.
993	3970	2	3	Almost everyone has a movie they would like to see, or a book they would like to read. What happens if they take a trip to the library, and check the catalog, only to find out it had been removed from the system because of bad language or mild themes? I believe that people should be able to choose what content they decide to read and let their children read. Some parents don't allow much offencive material at all while others don't mind it. Also the books and movies for adults are different than children books and movies. It would not be fair to remove offencive books, music, or magazines, from the shelf because different people like different content. Today, we live in a world of violence and it is going to be hard to avoice violence and offencive material. For some people, they want to avoid it at all costs, while others don't care or they like it. First of all, different people consider the same content differently, and the titles being removed @MONTH1 not be judged fairly. The people who want to see the latest movies that just came out, are usually going to see some type of violence. With more advanced computers and technology, there can be more special effects and move violence added to movies easier. In books, they @MONTH1 have old language that isn't up to the standards of today. For example, in the @NUM1 and @NUM2, when the word 'gay' used to mean happy. It is a whole different word now and it is a lot of old books and songs. Some people @MONTH1 find that offensive and some @MONTH1 not. Adult content is very differnt than children content. Adults have movies and music based on real life situations and stories while most children content is based on the alphabet and sing alongs. There are also the more grown up kid movies like @ORGANIZATION1's '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 one is based in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1 training to be a hero. During his fights, he kills the creatures that he fights. So if the libraries started censoring mateirals, then a classic @ORGANIZATION1 movie would be considered violent. The adult movies are worse in every way. They involve cursing, killing, gun battles, and sexual content. I'm not going into any further detail about adult movies. Being an adult, one should have the choice of what they are going to watch and the judge of what they are going to let their children watch. Different people like differnt content and it is only fair for them to be the one to decide what they watch and consider violent. An example one person might grow up around a farm and be used to seeing animals killed, while one who grew up in a neighborhood has never seen an animal killed. When they both see the movie or read a book with an animal killed, it will have hardly an effect on the one from the farm compared to the likely painful effect on the one from a neighborhood. Think about a gun battle scene of a movie or a death in a book. A soldier who is in the army will take killings and seeing deaths much easier than a @CAPS4 of a company. As stated before, different people prefer differnt types of content. All in all, I don't think there should be any censorship on library content. It should be up to the parents to make the choice of what they are going to let their childern watch or read. Adults can also be the judge of what they let themsleves watch. Lastly, again, different people like different content and it's not fair for one to choose what another can or can't watch.

These materials are a part of our history and the culture we are creating. If someone wants to read or view something, they will find a way to do so, especially with the technology available today. Censoring content in libraries can lead to backlash and potentially harm the institution. People should have the freedom to explore and engage with a variety of perspectives, even if some may find them controversial or offensive. It is essential to preserve the diversity of thought and expression in libraries to promote intellectual freedom and open dialogue. Therefore, libraries should not censor materials based on their content, as this goes against the principles of intellectual freedom and access to information.
995	3972	2	3	Libraries are full of all different sorts of books, movies and magazines. These books, movies, and magazines may come across as offensive to some people. Parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies. Does this mean we should take those offensive books off the shelf?   If everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library. Books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need. Young Children need books to help their imagination grow. If there were no more books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow. Movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather than a book. If the book or movie is found offensive to you, pick another, but it should not be removed from the shelf. One book or movie may seem offensive to you, but may not to another person.  A world without books. No imagination. No adventures. It would be a boring world. I would rather have a few offensive books than none at all. That way I can learn and see character's adventures through my own eyes. In conclusion, it is important to have a variety of books and movies available in libraries, even if some may be considered offensive, as they provide valuable learning experiences and opportunities for growth.
996	3973	2	3	Just because someone is offended by a book or writing does not justify its removal from a shelf that is accessible to the public. People have the freedom to choose what they read or ignore, and removing offensive material would infringe upon this fundamental right. In a society that values freedom of expression, it is essential to uphold the principle that individuals have the autonomy to engage with diverse perspectives, even if they find them disagreeable. Therefore, censoring or eliminating materials based on personal offense sets a dangerous precedent that undermines the liberty of individuals to explore a wide range of ideas and beliefs. Letting go of the urge to censor offensive material is crucial for maintaining a democratic society that values intellectual freedom and the exchange of diverse viewpoints.
997	3974	2	3	I do not think that censorship has a place in our libraries. Libraries were created to be information hubs for the public. If censorship were put in place, then many books would be gone as they could be seen as offensive to a minority of people. Censorship goes against the fundamental principles of freedom of expression and access to information. It is important for libraries to remain as open and inclusive spaces where individuals can explore a wide range of ideas and perspectives. By censoring certain materials, we limit the diversity of thought and knowledge available to the public. Therefore, censorship should not be implemented in libraries to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow from the wealth of information available.
998	3975	2	3	I do believe that libraries should censor certain materials. Some things like music and magazines have bad language and racy pictures in them, which may not be suitable for children. Parents may not want their kids to be exposed to such content, and it is the responsibility of the library to ensure a safe environment for all patrons. Removing inappropriate materials from the shelves is the most efficient way to prevent children from accessing them without constant supervision. While setting age limits on certain materials could be an option, it may not be foolproof as children can find ways to circumvent the system. Ultimately, removing inappropriate books and music from the shelves is the best way to protect children and maintain a safe and family-friendly environment in libraries.
999	3976	2	3	Censorship is a contentious issue that often arises in libraries, where books and magazines may be hidden or restricted from public access. Many people are concerned about offensive content in these materials, fearing the impact it may have on readers. However, this fear of causing offense can stifle creativity and prevent important messages from reaching the public.  It is important to remember that everyone has the right to their own opinions and preferences. What one person finds offensive, another may find enlightening or thought-provoking. By sheltering certain materials from the public, we limit the diversity of ideas and perspectives that can be shared.  Allowing a variety of voices to be heard, even those that may be controversial or challenging, is essential for a healthy and vibrant society. By engaging with different viewpoints, we can expand our understanding of the world and form our own opinions based on a wide range of perspectives.  Ultimately, censorship in libraries can hinder intellectual freedom and limit the exchange of ideas. It is crucial to uphold the principles of free speech and open access to information, even if it means confronting difficult or uncomfortable topics. By embracing diversity and encouraging dialogue, we can create a more inclusive and dynamic community for all.
1000	3977	2	3	I do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries. By censoring our libraries, they're censoring us. This is supposed to be a democracy, not a dictatorship.  A good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the @PERSON1 books just because they use the 'n word' and some people find this offensive. The thing is, this is how they talked back then, this is just the way things were. People can't just rewrite books because they don't like the history behind them. They can change all they want, but in the end it still happened. We recite history so we don't make the same mistakes again, and this is a good example of it.  Music shouldn't be censored. Music is a form of expression, and by censoring the music, you're censoring the artist. They say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do. We're supposed to have freedom of speech, so now why are we getting these freedoms taken away from us just because a select few deem it inappropriate. We don't make anyone listen to anything they don't want to. Each generation has its own style and music, has its own problems and ways to deal with them; our generation is music, so let us express ourselves.  Movies are censored due to language and content, which I get, but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen. If the audience is mature enough to handle it, they should be able to watch it. We don't need to take out curse words or remove inappropriate scenes just so children can watch them. If they are really that bad, they don't need to watch them period until they are mature enough to handle it.  Magazines should be censored in the same way as movies, by maturity level and age. I agree there are some movies that are inappropriate, but taking out articles just because someone in charge doesn't like what's being said is wrong. We can't just block out all the bad things that are happening in the world and just pretend nothing's wrong because the stories aren't being told. People deserve to know what's going on. People deserve to read, watch, or listen to anything that they want. By censoring things, they're only going to make us search to find them, therefore making it kind of like a reward to get to see the things others find so inappropriate that they're willing to go out of their way to get rid of them.  You can't please everyone, so just let us make our own decisions. Censoring our libraries is like censoring us. We have our constitution, we know our rights, now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them? They can't keep us dumb by hiding things. We're still going to find them, they're just going to make it like a game of tag; so let the game begin. Let us have the freedom to access information and make our own choices.
1001	3978	2	3	In the words of the author, Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' There are countless books in the world which will offend someone in one way or another. If everyone were to expect their feelings to be accounted by everyone, they are mistaken. Everyone has a right to discover the thoughts of others as long as they keep in mind they may not always be pleased with the outcome. Certain books carrying harsh opinions or uncensored material can be found on every shelf. In my many years as a student, I have come to find books containing vulgar images and language. Shakespeare's play 'Othello' describes him in very crude ways. Our class was very surprised at the language and sexual innuendos involved. Othello was described as a 'black ram' by his nemesis. Comments such as these in books can mold a young mind into thinking name-calling is appropriate. Unfortunately, this is how children are to learn the nature of select authors and the world outside the classroom. Shakespeare also discusses a 'strumpet' in 'Othello'. Once a mind is aware of such adult matters, they will look at the world completely differently. Life must be hard for children as their books and magazines show racy pictures of girls and advertisements for products. Magazines are a threshold of adult matters. Once a teenager or child views all the vibrant advertisements and beautiful models selling products, they begin to lose a sense of reality and childhood. The photoshopped images of tall, tan, and thin models make a girl's head ponder that way of life. They begin wearing shorter skirts, dieting, and tanning all because of an ad they saw in their magazine. Who wouldn't want to be like a model? When every actress, singer, and model begin looking like goddesses, the men picture the perfect girl as the ones they see on billboards. After the men picture the ultimate female as the images they see, the women will never be able to add up to their qualifications. A whole cycle of being underappreciated and the obsession to be perfect makes the media more powerful. In conclusion, the world has become absorbed in the unrealistic fantasies racy books and magazines provide. Crude comments are found in classics and are a powerful influence on the mind. Advertisements in magazines cause a sense of worthlessness in women and the feeling of unfulfillment for men. Are you going to control your life or let the media?
1002	3979	2	3	Kids today have a wide range of book options in school libraries, but some books are censored for valid reasons such as racial slurs, profanity, and inappropriate situations. Racism is present in about one out of every fifty books, with some, like '@PERSON1' fin by @PERSON2, being banned in schools across @LOCATION1. It's essential for parents and schools to guide children on what to read and what to avoid, as books can contain language that children should not be exposed to. Additionally, schools limit access to magazines like Sports Illustrated to prevent children from viewing nudity or violence. Ultimately, it is crucial for children to make responsible choices in their reading material. Censorship, when done for the protection of youth, is a necessary measure that schools and parents should continue to implement.
1003	3980	2	3	People have the right to decide whether or not their child's books contain censorship. While some parents may not mind their children reading books with explicit content, others prefer to shield their children from such material until they are older. In elementary and middle schools, it is important to consider the parents who do not want their children exposed to profanity or inappropriate content. Therefore, it is advisable to remove books with censorship from these educational institutions.   On the other hand, high school students are more mature and capable of making their own decisions regarding the books they read. While some parents may still have concerns, teenagers at this age are generally able to discern what is appropriate for them. It is reasonable to allow high school students the freedom to choose their own reading material, as they are old enough to understand and handle the content.   In conclusion, books with censorship should be eliminated from grade schools and middle schools to accommodate parents who prefer their children not to be exposed to such content. High school students, on the other hand, should be trusted to make their own choices when it comes to reading material. Ultimately, it is essential to consider the preferences and values of both parents and students when selecting books for educational purposes.
1004	3981	2	3	Remain on the Shelf?     Certain materials such as books, music, magazines and more can often contain offensive information that many would want censored. The people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive, the way people take in information is the main factor. People choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves, and with those come their personal opinions. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive, this could create more problems with the public and those who disagree on what has been taken out, that don't consider them to be offensive.     What is offensive to one person may not be offensive to the next. Items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered. Whether it be a book, magazine, or music the author had a purpose for it and it was not intended on hurting someone's feelings. For example, a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man, but a black man would consider it to be about his history. People can find many things offensive by just reading titles, or listening to one lyric from a song, but that does not mean they have to read the book or keep listening to the song. Someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to every day.     These magazines and books could also be seen as informing. The material in a certain magazine may not be acceptable by some, but a lot of new information can come from them. If everything found offensive was removed from the shelves there would most likely be nothing left. Removing them could cause chaos to someone who is trying to learn more about a disease when another person who is suffering from it does not want their story told. Certain materials being offensive can only offend so many, and chances are what doesn't offend them offends the next person. Informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge.     Censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested. A lot of people like to read and rent movies just for fun, but chances are if the book or movie does not sound interesting, it is not going to make any profit. What is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another. From my experience, teenagers are interested in a lot of action and romantic films and books. They often contain a lot of physical and sexual content along with a decent amount of foul language. An older person would not be interested in the foul language and content, they would consider them to be offensive to either the girl or boy in the story and would wonder why it is even being read. Most would even say that the books and movies can be degrading to some, but it is what interests teens and makes them want to read more because they can't wait to see what is going to happen next. Removing items such as these would push teens away from reading and viewing a lot of movies because nothing then would spark their interest.     Scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be. People are not being made to read and watch what offends them. Everybody is different and what offends my neighbor may not offend me. Chances are that there will always be something that is going to offend at least one person. The more we all get used to it, the less many people will actually run into items that offend them. They may still be offended on the inside but it won't matter because they will have realized that not everybody is offended by the same thing.
1005	3982	2	3	Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if found offensive? Censorship can be a huge deal depending on who you ask or where you go some find it necessary so kids do not get into these things found in libraries or some may not think it's so important.  Books are important parts of people's lives, learning, etc, they are also read for many different reasons but some of the topics books are written about may not be right or could be inappropriate or possibly against all of someone's beliefs or religion. I personally do not think that censorship is necessary to keep some things out of libraries just some things shouldn't be available for anyone to just walk in and pick up off of a shelf in a library maybe materials that are inappropriate for children or people may find offensive should be kept away in a different secluded section of a library and be clearly labeled of what the purpose of this room is so people will clearly know and won't really risk the chance of just stumbling upon those materials.  Another reason why censorship may not be necessary is that things that anyone could find in the library that may be offensive or inappropriate can be found just as easy if not easier on TV or on the internet by anyone anytime of the day. TV has some censorship but not enough to remove the effect that TV show or movie or internet site could have on the minds of today's young people and children such as violence, drugs, language, and racism that is found in almost everything today. Today's children and young people should be taught of what's wrong even if they do think it's dumb or unnecessary at the time when they mature they hopefully will see why they were taught those things and why they should always try to stay away from things that are seen in movies, magazines, books, and mostly on TV and not get involved with these activities.  Censorship I still believe is not necessary even though I know of all the inappropriate and harmful things in today's culture. Even though I know how harmful it can be if they see the effect it could have on their future and what it has done to other people that saw things in movies, books or even heard it in music if they could see and hear from people who have been affected by these things they would know to stay away from bad things and go along with what's right.  In conclusion, censorship is not necessary, it could be in the future but if everyone is led to what is right they will hopefully make the right decision and stay away from harmful books, movies, music, magazines, and other things alike.
1006	3983	2	3	Censorship is a touchy subject in our society today. People ask, 'How much should be censored?' or even 'Should it be censored at all?' My opinion is that censorship should be left up to the parents of the children that are consuming materials. Television networks and reading companies, including publishers and libraries, can't possibly take the place of a parent. I believe that if a parent is not responsible enough to care about what the child is reading, the distributors of the materials can't be punished.  In my experience, my mother has taken part in censoring me from offensive materials from a very young age. She is always interested in what I am reading. Occasionally, she will glance over a book or reading material herself in order to deem it appropriate for me to read. My mother has also censored my music by glancing through my music player and every so often, playing a song or two. This discourages me from listening to anything that my mother wouldn't approve of. I have also experienced censorship in my local library, where materials are divided into sections based on age appropriateness.  Through reading the book 'A Clockwork Orange' by Anthony Burgess, I have observed that parents need to have some involvement in what their children are consuming. In the book, the protagonist's parents simply left him alone to listen to his own music and watch whatever he wanted, leading him to commit a heinous act. This is a worst-case scenario in which censorship was not practiced at all. Violence can have a large impact on young minds, and they shouldn't be exposed to it until they are mature.  Through my reading, I have taken the position that the government does not have the right to impose censorship on the whole population. The novel 'Fahrenheit 451' is an example of censorship being taken to the extreme, where reading is banned except for certain materials. This shows that without the right to read, society is reduced to uneducated creatures. Censoring an entire population's reading is impractical, and once a person is an adult, they should have the freedom to choose what they read.  Censorship is a complex issue with both positives and negatives to consider. My stance is that parents should be the ones censoring their children's reading, not the government or reading companies. Once a person is an adult, they should have the freedom to choose their reading material. Finding a balance between censorship and freedom is essential for a healthy society.
1007	3984	2	3	Many people think that libraries should be censored in one form or another to keep certain types of books away from people. How does that really help? Even if you remove certain books or music from a library, it doesn't mean people won't still get that same information from somewhere else. Besides, many of the things that people think should be censored are probably not that bad. It is better for someone to read about something than to have it happen to them and then experience it. As Katherine Paterson said, if we let people get rid of books or music that they think are bad for people to read or listen to, what will we have left? Nothing. Though people think censoring libraries is for the greater good, it just has too many downsides to have much of a positive effect.  When people try to censor things, they usually just take items off shelves and get rid of them. However, in today's world of technology, that doesn't stop people from obtaining their goal. With the internet allowing people to upload books and music to share, individuals may not be able to get a specific book at the library, but they can almost always find it online. Thus, attempting to censor libraries by removing books and music really does not achieve much.  Determining what should be censored is also a challenging task. Everyone has a different idea of what is suitable for the public and what is not. Some books that get removed could insult a certain group of people because it relates in some way to them, resulting in loss of business and making people upset. Perhaps it is better for people to learn about negative things like crime and death through fictional scenarios that don't cause harm. Books often show the consequences or how situations are handled, potentially helping individuals facing similar circumstances later in life. This complexity makes it difficult to decide what should be censored and what should not.  Katherine Paterson also expressed that if we allow people to censor what they consider immoral, nothing will be left. Everything would be gone because every person in the world could find something objectionable in every book. Even if there is a book that people generally agree should be censored, there will always be others who think differently. Censoring libraries could lead to a situation where people demand more items to be censored, leaving nothing behind.  In conclusion, censoring libraries ultimately causes more harm than good. It does not prevent people from accessing information through other means, presents challenges in determining what should be censored, and can lead to a never-ending cycle of demands for censorship. Overall, censorship does not effectively address the underlying issues and can result in significant negative consequences.
1008	3985	2	3	Dear Newspaper staff,   @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is @PERSON1, and I am in the @NUM1 grade. I am writing to express my belief that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are offensive.   I believe this is necessary because in today's world, children are exposed to a wide range of inappropriate content, from explicit material to violent games and music. These influences can have a negative impact on their behavior and attitudes.   Books, magazines, and movies often contain content that is not suitable for young audiences. When children come across these materials, they may be influenced in ways that are harmful. Additionally, easy access to inappropriate content online can lead to further problems, such as exposure to viruses and dangerous websites.   Removing offensive materials from shelves would help create a safer and more positive environment for children. By limiting their exposure to harmful content, we can help protect their innocence and well-being.   In conclusion, taking action to remove offensive materials from shelves is essential in safeguarding the development and well-being of children. It is a step towards creating a healthier and more positive environment for our youth.   Thank you for considering my perspective.   Sincerely,  @PERSON1
1009	3986	2	3	The extent of reading that should be read by the public world is vast and diverse, encompassing books, magazines, music, and movies. These forms of entertainment and information provide people with enjoyment, emotional connection, and a sense of escape from reality. Books offer a wide range of genres and stories that captivate readers, while magazines provide the latest gossip and trends for those seeking light entertainment. Music serves as a therapeutic tool, helping individuals cope with life's challenges and altering their moods with its melodies and lyrics. Movies, on the other hand, ignite the imagination and evoke powerful emotions through their storytelling. These various forms of reading and entertainment are essential aspects of people's lives, offering comfort, inspiration, and joy. Removing them from shelves due to offensive content would deprive individuals of the diverse experiences and perspectives that contribute to the richness of life. Embracing the diversity of books, magazines, music, and movies is crucial in maintaining a vibrant and fulfilling society.
1010	3987	2	3	In this essay, I discussed the importance of having a variety of books in libraries, even if some may find certain materials offensive. I believe that libraries should not remove books from their shelves as different people have different preferences and interests when it comes to reading. What may be offensive to one person may be enjoyable or thought-provoking to another. Ultimately, libraries should strive to provide a diverse selection of books to cater to the varied tastes and preferences of their patrons. Removing books based on subjective opinions of offensiveness would limit the freedom of choice and access to information for library users. Therefore, I firmly believe that books should not be removed from libraries based on their content, as they serve as valuable resources for individuals seeking knowledge, entertainment, and different perspectives.
1011	3988	2	3	Books are an extremely important part of literature as they cater to a wide range of preferences and interests. Reading is a personal activity, and what one person enjoys, another may find offensive. It is important to respect individual preferences when it comes to choosing reading material. If a certain book or genre is not to your liking, you have the choice to avoid it and find something that aligns with your tastes.  The same principle applies to other forms of media such as music, movies, and magazines. Everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to consume and should not impose their preferences on others. It is essential to recognize that everyone is unique and will have different likes and dislikes.  By acknowledging and respecting individual differences, we can create a more inclusive and diverse environment where everyone can enjoy the things that bring them happiness. So, let's embrace the diversity of preferences and allow others to enjoy what they love, while also finding our own sources of joy.
1012	3989	2	3	People of the world always find something they think is offensive that others don't. In this case, I believe that public libraries should be cautious about the materials they provide. It is essential to consider the potential consequences of inappropriate content, especially when it comes to children accessing such material. Libraries are meant to be safe spaces for learning and exploration, and the presence of explicit or offensive material can be harmful.  Movies and books with explicit content should not be readily available in public libraries, as they can have a negative impact on young minds. Exposure to inappropriate material at a young age can shape a person's beliefs and behaviors in the future. It is important to create a positive and nurturing environment for children to learn and grow.  Advertisements in magazines and other media should also be monitored for inappropriate content. Messages that promote harmful behaviors or attitudes should not be allowed to influence impressionable individuals. It is crucial to be vigilant about the type of content that is being exposed to the public, especially when it comes to young people.  In conclusion, it is essential for libraries and other public institutions to be mindful of the content they provide. By being proactive in monitoring and regulating materials, we can create a safer and more positive environment for everyone. It is our responsibility to ensure that our future generations are not exposed to harmful influences that could shape their beliefs and actions.
1013	3990	2	3	Censorship is a complex issue, especially when it comes to determining what is appropriate for different age groups in libraries. While some restrictions may be necessary for certain materials, such as movies, music, and magazines, it is important to balance the need to protect younger audiences with the principles of free speech and access to information.   In the case of movies, a standard age restriction of seventeen for @CAPS1-rated films should be implemented in libraries, similar to other venues. Explicit music should also be restricted to individuals over the age of eighteen, as it may contain content that is not suitable for younger listeners.   Printed materials, such as books, present a more challenging dilemma. While some magazines may contain graphic content that should be restricted to adults, books should generally be available to all, as they are a form of expression and should not be censored.   Overall, it is important to maintain a balance between protecting younger audiences from potentially harmful content and upholding the principles of free speech and access to information in libraries. By carefully considering age restrictions for certain materials, libraries can ensure that they are providing a diverse range of resources while also respecting the needs of different age groups.
1014	3991	2	3	Magazines and Books  I am writing an essay on whether we should remove books, magazines, or movies from shelves if they contain bad language or violent content.  Firstly, it is essential to consider the popularity of such content. Personally, I enjoy books with violence and graphic language as they make the story more intriguing. However, parents must be vigilant about the media their children consume, including music and television shows that may contain inappropriate content.  Secondly, the appropriateness of children reading such material should be addressed. It may not be suitable for children under fourteen to be exposed to violence or explicit language. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of parents to monitor and regulate what their children are exposed to.  Furthermore, libraries can play a role in ensuring that children are not accessing inappropriate material. By segregating books based on content and age appropriateness, libraries can help guide children to suitable reading material. Restrictions on checking out certain books based on age can also be implemented to prevent children from accessing unsuitable content.  In conclusion, it is crucial to ensure that books and other media with explicit language or violent themes do not fall into the hands of children. Such content can have a negative impact on young minds and should be carefully monitored and regulated by parents and libraries.
1015	3992	2	3	Censoring books and music is a topic that raises debates regarding its necessity. Some argue that censoring is essential to protect children and adults from harmful influences, such as violence, gang activity, and explicit content. These individuals believe that uncensored materials can lead to negative behaviors and attitudes, ultimately impacting society in a detrimental way. Additionally, censoring can prevent disrespectful and offensive messages that target certain groups based on race, religion, or appearance. By censoring books and music, people can avoid being exposed to harmful stereotypes and misinformation. Ultimately, promoting love, positivity, and good influences in literature and music can help create a more respectful and responsible society. Thus, the argument for censoring books and music to protect individuals and uphold positive values remains strong.
1016	3993	2	3	I do not think they should be removed at all. They show a person's opinion on something. We can't just disregard it because we don't like what it's saying. That's like us saying black people aren't allowed here because we don't like how you look. Or just anyone that we don't like how they look. I think anyone who wants to speak their mind should be able to without having to worry about censorship. I may not agree with all the statements they bring up but they should have a fair chance like anyone else would. You should restrict to age accordingly to content so you don't have little kids reading about stuff they really shouldn't be. I could get a book removed because it offends me. Well then I could get a franchise closed because it offends me. People are offended by little things and should just accept the fact that other people have different opinions. It's just like judging a person for their race. They have different morals and values and you can't just change that in a person. Like if you don't like this article just don't read it. Don't say other people can't read it because of your views. I don't think there should be censorship.
1017	3994	2	3	There are many opinions on censorship in libraries. Some people believe that if books are offensive in any way that they should be removed, while others believe that these books should stay since there are different opinions on what is classified as 'offensive'. I believe that books should remain on shelves due to the fact that all people view things differently and it is free will that allows people to pick up these books. No one is forcing them to read them.  I believe when books, music, movies, and magazines publish offensive material, it is just a matter of opinion. People have different perspectives on what they find appropriate. For example, a magazine article containing information about the wrongdoings of political offices or a cartoon of a certain candidate may be seen as offensive by some, while others view it as simply expressing an opinion.  I also feel that this somewhat goes along with the idea of free will. No one can force a person to not read a certain book or listen to a certain song. It is free will that allows us to read, listen, and watch whatever pleases us. If someone demands that a book be taken off a shelf, it takes away from an individual's free will to choose what they want to read.  Furthermore, I believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should remain on shelves for learning and educational purposes. Just because something may contain a few offensive lines or phrases does not mean the entire work should be deemed offensive. The library is a place for research and information, and individuals should be able to decide for themselves what is offensive and what is acceptable.  In conclusion, the library is a place where our free will is essential. Offensiveness in media is subjective, and books should not be removed based on individual opinions of what is offensive. People should be able to access a variety of viewpoints and information to make their own decisions.
1018	3995	2	3	Can you think of a book that you hope none of your children or any other children have taken off the shelf? But if you had the right to remove the book would you? I believe if I found a book, magazine, any type of music, or a movie offensive I would not remove it, because everyone has a right to their own opinion, even if it is offensive. Also, instead of removing the materials completely, why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive. First, noone should have the right to remove materials they find offensive. Because if people were allowed to do that the world would have no music, books, movies, magazines or anything to intertain ourselves. Also it would start a big fight because alot of people do not find certain things offensive like other people do, and when the people that find materials offensive start removing things that other people dont find offensive, a big riot will start. Secondly, why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner? maybe instead of removing everything, why not find the publisher and see if the could make it @NUM1 or less vaulger. Same with music, movies, and magazines. So to conclusion everyone has a right to their own opinion, no matter if it is offensive or not. I think if i came across something that offended me I wouldnt do anything about it. Because maybe that person who wrote the book, or movie was expressing how they feel, and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves. So instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do.
1019	3996	2	3	Empty censorship is a complex issue that involves different perspectives on what is deemed acceptable or unacceptable in society. With a global population of around 7 billion people, it is inevitable that there will be varying moral codes, beliefs, and values that shape individuals' views on censorship.  Censorship is often implemented to protect individuals from content that is considered inappropriate or harmful. Whether it is in music, movies, literature, or other forms of media, certain topics such as sex, drugs, or politics may be censored based on cultural or societal norms. However, the reasons for censorship can differ from one place to another, highlighting the subjective nature of what is considered offensive or dangerous.  On the other hand, the freedom of expression allows individuals to share their thoughts and ideas with the world. While some may find certain expressions controversial or offensive, others see them as valuable contributions to society. Censoring individuals with unique perspectives can stifle creativity and innovation, preventing the emergence of potentially groundbreaking ideas.  Moreover, societal norms play a significant role in shaping censorship policies. What may be acceptable in one society may be deemed unacceptable in another, leading to a diverse range of censorship practices worldwide. This diversity underscores the importance of respecting different viewpoints and allowing for open dialogue on controversial topics.  In conclusion, censorship should be approached with caution, as it can limit the free exchange of ideas and hinder intellectual progress. While certain restrictions may be necessary to protect individuals from harm, it is essential to strike a balance between censorship and freedom of expression. Ultimately, open communication and respect for diverse viewpoints are crucial in navigating the complexities of censorship in a global society.
1020	3997	2	3	If content in a library is considered offensive, it should still remain on the shelf regardless. Perhaps the media would prove inappropriate for many, but select few will still value the media for what it is. Taking one kid's cake because it has too much frosting would anger most kids (and adults). If a book, album, movie, or a magazine is known to contain offensive or inappropriate material, it should remain organized with the rest of its kind, not exiled in the furthest corner. When one checks out such media, they should be required to state they are comfortable with the fact that their media might contain inappropriate and/or offensive content. I personally find Edgar Allan Poe's work or in the context of a song, Eminem's lyrics fascinating. Every time I look up these poems, I have to accept an agreement that I am comfortable with their violent or hateful content. Although, I do agree they should not be readily available to anyone looking for something new to read (or listen) without their consent. I believe that simply asking the customer if they are comfortable with a form of media's content would prove sufficient. No one wants to settle for less or no frosting, and they should not have to. Therefore, offensive media should be accessible but with a warning and consent from the consumer.
1021	3998	2	3	Some materials could be seen as offensive to some people. It could have language, racial slurs, or anything else one might find offensive. In my personal opinion, I believe anyone should have the right to read or watch whatever they choose. These books or movies are put out there for entertainment or learning purposes. Some things did happen, such as the @LOCATION1, that many people would like to forget but no matter which way you take it, it happened and we can't change it. This can teach the next generation that it was a bad idea and should not have happened in the first place, so they will not do it. Language is a big part of today's world and many do not appreciate a bad word. They put these in movies to emphasize something big because everyone will remember that word. I know that it is not necessary all of the time and could be taken out, but for some movies a certain word could make or break the scene. Some movies have a lot of cursing in them but that does not make it a bad movie. A few of the best movies I have ever seen have too many bad words to count but the story line is phenomenal. What you gain from watching those movies is not the cursing, it's the success of the protagonist that makes it enjoyable and worth your time. As for books in libraries, we should make a separate section for these offensive materials so that a young, innocent child does not wander across them. Put up signs warning people of the material contained in that section and put a special sticker on the book to warn parents as well. In conclusion, offensive materials are not always bad and should not be removed from shelves, just maybe to a different location. Let the people read what they want to read.
1022	3999	2	3	As far as opinions go, everyone has one. Only in certain situations are people's opinions actually taken seriously. When it comes to a debate on serious situations such as 'censorship', there will be an argument for those who agree and for those who disagree. Agreeing to a cause such as 'inappropriate book removal' in one's opinion should not be omitted.  At the ages of children, teens, and young adults, their minds are very curious. If interested in something they will go out and seek information for it if the adult does not provide proper information to what is asked. Books, magazines, newspapers, novels, etc are public reading materials that are meant for everyone to see. Hiding it would be like robbing them of their right to be informed.  Not all reading materials are dangerous to the mind and eyes of the youth. The issue is how the parents raised them to embrace knowledge that they see. A maturity level must be high enough for that child to be able to understand what it is they're looking at. It would be useless for the adult to hide things from them until the age of 18, when they are legally obligated to consume any sort of knowledge. The easiest way would be for the adult and child to have a sit-and-chat session for better understanding.  Removing novels and books from libraries publicly or even at school would do nothing more than just raise the child's curiosity level to the highest extent. This, some would believe, would persuade the child to go out and experience it first hand so that they know what it is, and later in life know what to expect. Doing so would, could, and may be harmful and dangerous depending on the act made by the child. When the simplest solution would just be approving that child to read and be educated.  Therefore if one person out of millions dislike a book because they feel it can greatly influence one child to do the wrong thing, then another child who try and keep their self away from it can't be taught because someone had a deep abhor for it and decided that it was outlandishly inappropriate for someone, much as a child, to read.  To agree to removing information form the library is absolutely purposeless, and may be an inconvenience for someone whom may have been determined to research something. With all honesty, books and novels were made for a reason. That reason is to entertain, inform, and educate. By removing every source all those who agree to the cause should also agree to the fact that they have no remorse for the outcome of how their child grows up and become someone they never wanted them to be.
1023	4000	2	3	Libraries are treasure troves of knowledge with a wide variety of books covering different topics. The idea of removing books from shelves seems counterintuitive, as every book has its value and can cater to different preferences. It is essential to respect individual choices when it comes to reading materials.  While some books may contain controversial or objectionable content, it is important to remember that different people have varying tastes and interests. What may be considered inappropriate by some may be perfectly acceptable to others. Instead of banning books, it is better to educate readers about the content and let them make informed decisions.  When it comes to movies and music, the impact of visual and auditory media is more direct and immediate compared to books. Movies and music can influence behavior and perceptions more strongly, especially in younger audiences. Therefore, there may be a greater need for regulation and guidance in these mediums to ensure responsible consumption.  Ultimately, it is crucial to strike a balance between freedom of expression and responsible consumption. While individuals should have the freedom to choose their reading materials, there should also be measures in place to protect vulnerable audiences from potentially harmful content. By promoting awareness and understanding, we can create a healthy environment where diverse perspectives can coexist harmoniously.
1024	4001	2	3	Libraries are a place where individuals have the freedom to choose what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Censorship should not be imposed on books, music, movies, or magazines, as people should be able to make their own decisions about what they consume. It is important for individuals to be aware of the content of the materials they select and to make informed choices based on their own preferences and beliefs. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with the individual to choose what aligns with their values and interests, rather than having someone else dictate what is appropriate for them.
1025	4002	2	3	Libraries should have a variety of books, music, and magazines available for people to access, even if some individuals may find certain materials offensive. It is important to respect the diversity of interests and perspectives within a community. While it is essential to consider age-appropriate content for children, adults should have the freedom to choose what they want to read or listen to without censorship. Libraries can establish age restrictions or separate sections to ensure that inappropriate materials are not easily accessible to young audiences. Ultimately, public libraries should strive to provide a wide range of resources to cater to the diverse needs and preferences of their patrons.
1026	4003	2	3	First, libraries are a good source of information. At the same time a library can have pros and cons to its information. Some information should be only seen by adults. Have you ever wondered what if a child got their hands on an adult book? What's one way we can stop this? Next, you can find information about everyday life. Through magazine, movies, music and books are ways you can find them out. You have explicit music where the artist curses, and says inappropriate things. There has been books from my past experiences where an author just talked about her sex life. I have a past experience with magazines too, such as '@CAPS1'. All these have to stay out of libraries or put in a section where children can't reach them. Third, parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyways. The library should be divided into different parts. Music isn't really necessary at a library. They could throw the music out. Also, at the same time children shouldn't get their hands on the books but they would have to learn about that stuff in life eventually. The committee should have a contest in which people of any age of the community could write an essay telling their opinion also. Finally, I've come up with a plan to fix this situation. I personally don't think they should throw these books out because this is how people make a living and some people actually like these things. So they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be 18 or older to enter and a identification card to prove it. Also, you must have a membership to that department. That way we don't have to worry about censoring these books, etc. Children will not be able to proceed in this section. In conclusion, libraries are a good source of information. So they shouldn't throw these books, music, magazines and movies out. The library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age. In that way they won't need censorship.
1027	4004	2	3	I feel that individuals should have the right to choose to remove certain books, movies, music, magazines if they are deemed inappropriate for certain people, especially children. Some may enjoy such content, while others may not, depending on personal preferences. If a library restricts access to certain materials, there could be a small fee ranging from $1 to $2 for access, similar to a rental fee at a place like Redbox. This approach allows for freedom of choice while still maintaining some level of control over potentially objectionable material in public spaces.
1028	4005	2	3	People that walk the surface of our planet sometimes feel the need to have something banned or at least get some dirt on it to make people think less of it. It is just the way our world works when it comes to something you just can't stand, but why even bother, just what exactly are they going to get out of it? If someone took the time to make it then we all deserve the right to view it. I do not agree on censorship in our world.  Local libraries are a very nice place to go for books, movies, and information. How is this to be such a good resource for people once everything is gone, especially considering some of the world's greatest books ever written are the ones that are targeted by censorship. I believe Katherine Paterson has a very valuable point in saying, 'Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' because it is true. People don't stop at just one, once something is gone they will continue hunting for things that they just hate, which will lead to people suffering from not being able to enjoy the things they want.  When I was younger, I remember going to the library all the time for movies and books. I personally got to actually see a book be removed because of censorship, although I did not fully understand, I felt that if I read it, I would get grounded. Which is also not good for kids because they shouldn't be scared to read something. We live in a place with the freedom of speech, but yet that right seems to be fading away. There's still more ways to see censorship and how it affects the libraries though, such as actually reading about some of the cases that have tried to ban books.  Although most fail to be banned right now, the world is very unpredictable. In school there have been many times where kids got the chance to read case after case about people trying to get some of the best books banned. Which is funny how those books are the only books that were fun to read during the school year. So that doesn't make sense on why to take them off the shelves. Reading is what keeps us informed, on the past and even the future.  'Then we have no books left.' if this is what people wish for then keep at it, but if there is some sort of decency in you, I would imagine when it comes to making an easy choice like this, you too would choose the right one. Saying no to censorship. Reading is what keeps us strong, entertained, and those who know the past are not likely to repeat it, unless books are gone.
1029	4006	2	3	Many individuals visit libraries all over the world every day for various reasons, such as books, magazines, and movies. Libraries offer a wide range of materials to cater to the diverse interests of their patrons. Limiting the options available at libraries could deter people from reading and exploring new materials, ultimately hindering their intellectual growth and freedom of choice. While it may be necessary to restrict access to certain materials based on age appropriateness, overall, libraries should strive to provide a wide selection to meet the needs and preferences of their community members. By preserving the variety of materials available, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for individuals seeking knowledge, entertainment, and personal enrichment.
1030	4007	2	3	"Books nowadays are filled with action, romance, and other exciting elements, which is why some books struggle to move off the shelves. Those that remain stagnant often lack the engaging qualities that readers are seeking. On the other hand, books that are popular tend to be those with action, love, and other captivating themes like happiness, the supernatural, or vampires.  There are books that fall somewhere in between, being neither bestsellers nor complete flops. These may be well-written but lack the modern appeal that readers are drawn to. Additionally, books that tie in with popular movies, like ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" can often outsell their film adaptations because they provide more depth and insight into the story.  In today's digital age, books are more accessible than ever, with e-books available on various devices such as iPhones, iPads, and e-readers like the Nook. This convenience has made it easier for readers to enjoy their favorite books on the go, without the need to visit a physical bookstore.  While digital formats offer convenience, some readers still prefer the tactile experience of reading a physical book. For those individuals, the option to choose between traditional books and digital copies provides the best of both worlds.  In conclusion, the changing landscape of the book industry reflects the evolving preferences of readers. Whether in traditional or digital format, books continue to be a beloved form of entertainment and escape for people around the world."
1031	4008	2	3	In addition, taking away these items could limit the resources available to library patrons and hinder their ability to access information and knowledge in various forms. It is important for libraries to cater to a diverse range of needs and preferences to ensure that everyone can benefit from their services. Removing items such as music, magazines, and DVDs could alienate certain groups of people and make the library less welcoming and inclusive. Therefore, it is essential for libraries to maintain a balance and offer a variety of materials to serve the needs of all members of the community.
1032	4009	2	3	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I @CAPS3 The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 short is about my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 watching the movie anthology horror of @CAPS7 with @PERSON1. I admit I was scared out of my mind, then I got over it. After a few times, you get used to it, and I did. That's it for @CAPS6 assignment.
1033	4010	2	3	The library is a sanctuary for knowledge seekers, housing a vast collection of books from past and present writers, as well as information on historical and current events. The ongoing debate surrounding censorship in libraries raises concerns about potentially offensive material being restricted. However, censorship in libraries should not be permitted to erase offensive history, alter books, or eliminate controversial newspaper articles.  Banning censorship in historical events is crucial to prevent the loss of valuable information. For instance, events like the Holocaust and the slave trade are essential parts of history that must not be forgotten. By censoring such events, we risk erasing crucial lessons and perspectives that can educate future generations. History should be preserved in its entirety to ensure a comprehensive understanding of past events and their impact on society.  Similarly, censorship should not be allowed to alter books written by authors who intended their works to be read as originally written. Authors like Mark Twain used language reflective of the time period in which they wrote, aiming to provide an authentic portrayal of the era. By altering or censoring such works, we not only distort the author's intended message but also hinder readers from engaging with literature in its true form.  Moreover, censoring newspaper articles in libraries deprives individuals of access to important information and perspectives on current and past events. Newspapers serve as a vital source of news and play a crucial role in informing the public. By censoring newspapers, we limit the dissemination of information and hinder public discourse on critical issues.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries should be prohibited to avoid erasing offensive history, altering books, or removing controversial newspaper articles. It is essential to preserve all forms of information, even if they may be considered offensive, to maintain a comprehensive understanding of history and encourage open dialogue and critical thinking.
1034	4011	2	3	Dear @CAPS1,   In many parts of the world, censorship restricts what people can read and write, often imposed by communist and socialist governments. Fortunately, here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom to express ourselves without such limitations. However, censorship does exist in our society, mainly in the form of political correctness.  I have come across articles discussing how textbooks may distort the truth to align with certain political agendas. Additionally, I have heard of libraries removing books that express strong conservative views. It is concerning to see books being published solely to criticize potential presidential candidates. As a conservative, I believe that all books should be accessible to the public, as restricting them goes against our right to freedom of the press and the exchange of ideas.  I support the idea of having a separate section in libraries for controversial or mature content to ensure that young children are not exposed to inappropriate material. However, it is crucial to maintain the free flow of ideas and information in our society.  As a republic that values the diversity of opinions and encourages open discourse, we should continue to uphold these principles. Let us embrace different perspectives and engage in meaningful discussions to promote a more informed and inclusive society.  Thank you, @PERSON2.
1035	4012	2	3	My views on censorship in libraries are similar in many ways. I believe that certain materials should be removed if they are found offensive to more than just one person. Offensive books, music, movies, and magazines can have a negative impact on individuals, especially children. These materials can influence behavior and thoughts in a harmful way.   It is important for libraries to be mindful of the content they provide to the public. Offensive materials can turn people away from using the library and can also be accessed by the wrong audience, such as children. I believe that books, magazines, and videos containing drugs, nudity, violence, and bullying should be removed from libraries to create a safe and welcoming environment for all visitors.   I have personally experienced the negative effects of offensive materials in libraries. I once got in trouble for reading a book that I found in the library, which contained inappropriate content. This incident made me realize the importance of screening materials in libraries to ensure they are appropriate for all audiences, especially children.  In conclusion, I support the removal of offensive materials from libraries to protect the well-being of library users, particularly children. It is crucial for libraries to review their collection and eliminate any materials that could be considered offensive or harmful. By doing so, libraries can maintain a positive and inclusive environment for everyone.
1036	4013	2	3	I believe that there should be censorship in public libraries to protect children and families from being exposed to inappropriate material. Libraries should be a safe space for all ages, and certain content should not be readily available for public consumption. While adults have the freedom to access such material elsewhere, it is important to consider the impact on young minds and the discomfort it may cause parents. By implementing censorship in public libraries, we can maintain a family-friendly environment and uphold community standards. It is essential to prioritize the well-being and innocence of children, ensuring that they are not exposed to content that is not age-appropriate. Let's keep public libraries a place where everyone feels comfortable and respected.
1037	4014	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 the author, Katherine Paterson. Her quote means that there might be a book, magazine, etc., on a shelf that someone shouldn't see. I beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are ways people can avoid seeing them. I think that if something is found offensive then they should be in a special aisle.   First off, if there are items that people find offensive then they should be placed in a specific aisle. There are things that only adults should see so therefore there should be an aisle dedicated to the offensive or inapropriate things. And for someone to get into that aisle they should have permission to get into the aisle and show and I.D. so that kids and children don't accidently slip in and see things they shouldn't. Because if a child sees something bad, then that might influence them to do bad things because they won't know any better.   Secondly, if an indivual finds a book or magazine offensive, then they can avoid it by simply walking away. That person doesn't have to read it or look for it in a library if it's in a certain aisle. But if someone is really offended by something then all they have to do is go complain to the person head of the library and it can simply be removed if there are enough compaints. Then again, it's not that hard to avoid something you don't like. It might bother you that it's there, but it should be out of the way for younger kids to see.   Thirdly, the library will contain things that are found either offensive or inapropriate so children entering the library should have adult supervision so that they don't see the bad things. If a child sees something bad, they might find it interesting so they might want to pick it up and read it, which is bad because it might give them ideas.   Finally, there are many ways to avoid seeing something you find offensive. You can walk away if you notice something you find offensive or you stay away from that area of the library. There are going to be many things out there that people find offensive and inapropriate, but there's not much you can do about it. The best thing to do is ignore it and walk away. And if you're that concerned about it then you can always make a complaint about what has offended you or what you think is inapropriate for children. Putting bad things in an aisle is a smart idea because little kids won't be able to access it.
1038	4015	2	3	Books, magazines, music, and movies are all essential resources found in libraries that offer a wealth of knowledge and entertainment for individuals of all ages. While there may be certain materials that are deemed unsuitable for children due to their content, it is important to recognize that everyone has the right to access a diverse range of information. By implementing age-appropriate labeling and warnings on materials, individuals can make informed decisions about what they choose to engage with. Additionally, the presence of controversial or challenging content in libraries serves a purpose in promoting understanding and empathy, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discrimination. Ultimately, the freedom to explore various forms of media and literature is essential for personal growth and development, and should not be restricted based on individual preferences or sensitivities.
1039	4016	2	3	As a fellow member of the community and a regular visitor to the library, I believe that books, magazines, movies, and other materials should not be removed from the shelves. While something may be offensive to one person, it may hold value or interest for another. Removing items from libraries limits access to knowledge and can contribute to illiteracy.  Libraries offer a wide range of materials that cater to different interests and age groups. While some content may not be suitable for everyone, it is important to view these materials as sources of information and learning rather than focusing solely on whether they are potentially offensive. Removing items from libraries can have negative consequences for future generations.  Personally, as someone who frequents the library, I have come across books that address sensitive topics, including racism related to my own ethnicity. While the language used in these books may be uncomfortable, I see it as an opportunity to learn about the struggles faced by my ancestors. Magazines, like movies, are also meant for entertainment and can provide a source of relaxation for library visitors.  In summary, I believe that materials should not be removed from library shelves. Libraries serve as valuable resources for learning and entertainment, and it is important to preserve access to a diverse range of materials. It is up to individuals to choose what they read or watch, and censorship should not dictate what is available in a public library.
1040	4017	2	3	There will always be something offensive to someone, no matter what is on the shelves of a library. Removing books based on individual preferences will lead to a never-ending cycle of censorship. In today's world, with various forms of media bombarding us, it is impossible to shield children from everything deemed offensive. Ultimately, trying to control what children see or read will not work, as there will always be something else around the corner that someone finds objectionable. It is essential to understand that personal preferences should not dictate what others can access, as censorship can limit intellectual freedom and diverse perspectives in society.
1041	4018	2	3	Conflicting works of art such as books, music, and movies have always been present in libraries, sparking debates and differing opinions. Whether it's a controversial novel, a provocative song, or a divisive film, someone is bound to be offended. However, the question of whether these offending works should be banned is a contentious issue among creators and consumers. In my view, all works of art should be allowed to be seen, heard, or read, as the creators have the right to express their opinions and ideas freely.  It is inevitable that some individuals may find certain works offensive due to conflicting beliefs or values. However, banning a book or censoring a film would be a direct violation of the creator's freedom of expression. Every artist has the right to share their perspective, even if it challenges societal norms or upsets certain audiences. The censorship of any form of art is not only unconstitutional but also limits our access to diverse viewpoints and historical context.  Offensive works should not be dismissed or suppressed; instead, they should serve as catalysts for meaningful discussions and critical thinking. By engaging with controversial art, we are encouraged to reflect on our own beliefs and opinions, contributing to a more informed and open-minded society. As author Ursula K. Le Guin aptly stated, allowing individuals to censor works based on personal offense would ultimately lead to the eradication of all forms of artistic expression.  In conclusion, the censorship of art stifles creativity and inhibits intellectual growth. By preserving the freedom of expression for all creators, we can continue to learn from the past, challenge our perspectives, and foster a culture of tolerance and understanding. Embracing diverse and provocative works is essential for the progression of society and the development of future generations of critical thinkers.
1042	4019	2	3	The shelf is an object that holds many types of different materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music. Its all media and entertainment. But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials may be offensive towards the foreign and children. Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such. Yes we all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries. A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes. There are not for entertainment and things of that nature. Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school. By all rated R movies, dirty music, adult books and magazines should be taken off the shelves.   One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on Africa and its people. As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the African people. I thought to myself that this book should be taken off the shelves forever and never seen again. It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it. After some people read about the African people; They had second thoughts and started get angry and disliking them for these things and offensive comments made!  Magazines and movies should be taken off the shelves in the categories in my opinion of the people in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could have really gone through everything in that movie or what ever that magazines says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldn't you think that's a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violent movie.  We have to think for our children and the people that come in from different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carefully then we could make the foreigners very angry or make our children become very violent and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come into our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might have thought that was interesting but turns out to be very offensive in their opinion. Censorship is very important in libraries and on the shelves.
1043	4020	2	3	I can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the bookshelf. I hope our children or any other children do not take this book off the shelf because it would be offensive or demeaning to our race or the children. This book may raise questions that we do not want to discuss with our children. It is a book that I would not recommend for my children to read or even look at the pages or cover. If it contains profanity and racial slurs, I would consider it off-limits until they are older. Magazines with inappropriate content, such as swimsuit models, should also be kept away from children. Similarly, music with profanity or drug references should not be allowed for young listeners. When it comes to movies, I would permit those rated G or PG, but anything beyond that would be restricted. It is crucial to monitor and regulate the media content that children are exposed to, as it can have a significant impact on their development. Therefore, it is essential to be vigilant and cautious about what children are reading, watching, and listening to in order to foster a healthy and positive environment for their growth.
1044	4021	2	3	If someone is offended by a book or a movie from a library, they should not be able to get it removed. While individuals have the right to their own opinions and preferences, it is not fair for one person to dictate what others can or cannot read. People should be able to make their own choices about the material they consume, and if someone finds a book offensive, they can simply choose not to read it. Ultimately, censorship in libraries should be avoided, as it limits access to a diverse range of perspectives and ideas. Each person should have the freedom to decide for themselves what they want to read, without interference from others.
1045	4022	2	3	Everywhere I go, there always seems to be something, small or big, that can be considered offensive. Because of these offensive things, there is often censorship in public places. It is acceptable to view non-noncensored materials at your own disgression and privacy, but not very acceptable to do so in public. I believe that censorship is necessary in libraries because of the wide range of audiences, the public materials, and the opinions of certain people. Libraries are considered public places and have a wide range of audiences. Whether it be children, teens, adults, or elders, some things are inappropriate and should not be accessible to certain people. This is directed mainly to children, however. Like the quote mentioned, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Who put these offensive books in libraries then? Censorship will block out inappropriate parts of books, movies, music, and magazines in order to make these materials more suitable for all age groups. Because libraries are considered public places, their materials are considered public property. Everyone has the right to these materials. However, not every library will have the book, magazine, or movie you could be searching for due to the fact that it may contain profanity, or inappropriate content. Some people may be against censorship in libraries, but there often is not censorship in bookstores, movie stores, music libraries, etc. If you desire a certain non-censored material, then go purchase it. That way the material will no longer be public, but rather your own and you can do with it whatever you choose. We now live in a world where everyone voices their opinion freely and you can not be punished for doing so. Libraries are targeted toward every age group and censorship just allows everything to be appropriate for everyone. Certain parents do not allow their children to read certain books, view certain movies, or listen to certain music and this is just because it is their opinion and their parenting. Some parents, on the other hand, do allow their children to partake in inappropriate materials, and that is perfectly fine, because it is their parenting and their children. However, libraries should not have the right to introduce inappropriate things into the lives of children; that should be the decision of the parents or guardians. In conclusion, censorship should be allowed in libraries because of the wide-range audience, public materials, and the strong opinions of the people. Everyone deserves to read, watch, and listen to whatever they choose, but not everyone deserves to be around inappropriate things in public places. Not everyone can be happy, but everyone can be appropriate.
1046	4023	2	3	In my experience, some music, magazines, and movies can be too offensive for certain audiences, especially children. I once witnessed a young girl listening to explicit music at the library, which shocked and worried me. The lyrics were filled with sexual references and curse words, which are inappropriate for her age. It's crucial for content creators to be mindful of what they release to the public, as it can have a lasting impact on individuals, particularly children. Additionally, magazines with mature content should be carefully curated in libraries to ensure they do not fall into the hands of young readers. The media that children are exposed to can shape their perceptions and behaviors, so it is essential to monitor and filter what they consume to promote a healthy and positive upbringing. By being vigilant about the content available in libraries and the media children engage with, we can help shape a more wholesome environment for the next generation.
1047	4024	2	3	no i dont think anything should be removed caz not everyone wants too look at the same thing i think if you dont like it dont look at so there is no need to remover it no matter what. It is important to respect individual preferences and allow for diverse content to cater to different interests. What may not appeal to one person could be meaningful or enjoyable for another. Removing content based on personal preferences would limit the variety and freedom of expression available to everyone. In a world where individuals have varying tastes and interests, it is essential to embrace this diversity rather than impose restrictions on what can be shared or viewed. Ultimately, the key is to respect differences and allow for a wide range of content to exist harmoniously.
1048	4025	2	3	"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote from Katherine Paterson voices a strong point on citizenship. Censorship happens everywhere you are. Whether its a book, a magazine article, or even a TV show, things are censored. Censoring things doesn't make anything more enjoyable, but in fact makes less things enjoyable.  I think that things that are offensive should not be removed from the shelf. Censorship disables the viewer and or reader to be able to enjoy the full potential of things. When things are censored, it hinders the experience and limits the freedom of expression. Some books, like ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" have been banned from schools because of offensive language, but one should consider the historical context and not impose personal feelings on others.  Books like ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""The Giver"" explore the dangers of censorship in society. They highlight the importance of challenging censorship and valuing freedom of expression. In today's media, censorship also limits what can be shown on TV, even for mature audiences. People should have the right to choose what they watch or read without unnecessary restrictions.  Katherine Paterson's quote emphasizes the importance of allowing individuals to make their own choices about what they consume. If something offends you, you can simply choose not to engage with it. People should have the freedom to access uncensored content and make their own informed decisions. Censorship only limits creativity and freedom of expression, ultimately diminishing the richness of our cultural landscape."
1049	4026	2	3	Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights. There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence. Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble. That can disappear in a instant. Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age. Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it. The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point. A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.   Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children. It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon. The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people. Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship. Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy. Therefore, why censor?
1050	4027	2	3	I think certain books such as offensive books shouldn't be removed. That's how some kids learn better and read better. Kids don't like reading boring books. Things like music, movies, and magazines are interesting to us. If this world didn't have movies, kids wouldn't read books. Most kids these days read books because they watch the movie version of the story. Some kids like listening to music while reading, which can make the experience more enjoyable. I'm glad people invented these things because I feel like without them, the world would be boring. Magazines are also great because they help people start reading books and so on. Magazines are entertaining with pictures, gossip, and more, making them appealing to readers. However, it can be problematic when kids imitate what they read in magazines. It's essential to distinguish between good and bad books, as some books contain excessive cursing or inappropriate content. Overall, books, magazines, music, and movies play a crucial role in enhancing reading habits and entertaining individuals.
1051	4028	2	3	When @LOCATION2 was founded and the constitution of @LOCATION1 was signed, freedom became a fundamental principle of the nation. The right to freedom of speech and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty set @LOCATION2 apart from other countries that suppress their citizens. Despite the occasional offensive or controversial expression, freedom of speech remains a crucial aspect of our society. Without freedom, individuals risk imprisonment or even genocide for speaking out against those in power. While some may find certain forms of expression offensive, it is important to remember that freedom allows for diversity of beliefs and opinions. The production of books, movies, and other media, though sometimes controversial, reflects the value of free expression in our society. It is essential to appreciate the freedoms we enjoy in @LOCATION2, even if it means tolerating offensive content at times. Freedom is ingrained in the fabric of our nation and must be preserved as we move forward into the future.
1052	4029	2	3	Do you think that books, movies, music, etc., should be moved if they are found offensive? I can't choose, as they are both understandable. Therefore, I will discuss how I feel about it in this essay and what I have experienced on this topic.  I could go both ways with this. Material that is interesting to many people might not be interesting to me, and everyone should be able to enjoy what they love. No one can dictate what someone should like or dislike. On the other hand, if something is offensive to someone and they don't want their children exposed to it, it may be best to set it aside and allow people to ask for it if they want it. This way, people can get what they want without causing a big commotion.  It's important to understand both sides of the argument and respect individual preferences. Ultimately, whether to remove offensive content or not should be a decision made with consideration for everyone's views and preferences. In the end, it's up to each individual to decide what they want to read or listen to, and no one should be forced to change their preferences.
1053	4030	2	3	I believe that certain materials that may be offensive to some people should remain on the shelves. It is ultimately up to the individual whether they choose to engage with the material or not. I have personally experienced feeling upset by an article and have also been in a situation where someone found the music I was listening to offensive.  When I read an article that mocked my hometown, labeling its residents as unintelligent and uneducated, I initially felt ashamed. However, I realized that the article was just one person's opinion and did not reflect the truth about my town.  Similarly, I once had a disagreement with a friend who found the rock music I enjoyed offensive. We argued about it, but ultimately reached a compromise where I agreed not to listen to that music when she was around. I respected her feelings, but also felt that I should not have to give up something I enjoyed because someone else found it offensive.  In today's society, it seems that more people are quick to take offense to different viewpoints expressed in literature, music, or other forms of media. It is important to remember that authors and artists often share their opinions and perspectives, and it is up to the individual to decide whether or not to engage with their work. If something is on the shelf and you dislike it, simply choose not to consume it. Ultimately, everyone is entitled to their own opinions and preferences, and it is important to respect that diversity of thought.
1054	4031	2	3	I don't think that materials should be removed from public libraries simply because they may be offensive to some individuals. Libraries are open to the public, and people have the right to access a variety of information and materials. If someone finds a particular book or magazine offensive, they can choose not to read it or simply ignore it. Freedom of speech is important, but it should not infringe on the rights of others.  If music is played in the library that is offensive to some people, they have the right to speak up and voice their concerns. However, books and magazines should not be banned from public libraries just because they may be offensive to some individuals. People have different tastes and preferences, and a diverse collection of materials should be available to cater to the needs of everyone.  In the United States, everyone has the right to express their opinions, even if they may be unpopular or offensive to others. It is important to respect the rights of others while also standing up for what you believe in. Public libraries should remain open to a variety of materials, allowing individuals to explore different perspectives and ideas. Freedom of speech should be upheld, but it is also essential to consider the rights and feelings of others in a public setting.
1055	4032	2	3	I think people read more books that are banned from schools and libraries, they listen to 'rebel' music, or they just watch controversial movies, so is censoring really effective? I do not think censoring is really necessary. If you think a subject might be offensive for you, you should not read it. Instead of censoring the products in a library we should censor the readers, I believe people are mature enough to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen. Media is just another way to gain knowledge that's why they are used at school.  I would like to go to my school library and find books like, 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', I know this book is considered as one of @LOCATION1's most famous literature work, but it was once banned from some schools around the nation. The reason of the banning was that they believed that the book contained pornography, and it wasn't school appropriate. My English teacher used this method, by telling us this, to encourage us to read it. My classmates who hadn't read the book wanted to find the pornography in it, if you were to ask me... I did not find it. Another literary work which was banned once is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', this book was banned because @PERSON1, a black character in the book, was called a @CAPS4, and thought to be stupid sometimes during the book. Even though @PERSON1 is the most noble and innocent character in the book, some people found this offensive and not appropriate. Movies with strong language are rated for its public so I don't think this should be a problem. Music on the other hand, depends on the singer's music style and that should be monitored by parents.  I truly believe that we should not censor any material in libraries, but if it's necessary, they could establish an age limit to check out any controversial material. As I said before, media is just another way to gain knowledge.
1056	4033	2	3	As @CAPS1, we are entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press. However, these rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries. I can understand why libraries feel the need to ban certain works, especially with children present. While explicit content may not be suitable for all audiences, there are ways to manage this without imposing complete bans. By creating separate sections for adult material and implementing age restrictions for borrowing, libraries can still provide access to a wide range of media while protecting younger audiences. Trusting in individuals' common sense and ability to make informed choices can also play a role in managing the availability of certain works. Ultimately, imposing restrictions on media based on personal morals limits the freedoms of others and can lead to unnecessary conflicts. It is important to respect diverse viewpoints and allow individuals to make their own choices regarding the media they consume. In the spirit of free expression, we should strive to uphold the rights and freedoms of all individuals, even if we may not always agree with their choices. To paraphrase @ORGANIZATION1, I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right to say it.
1057	4034	2	3	Certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines can be offensive and inappropriate. This is because they may contain content that can hurt people in various ways. For example, I once came across a book at a public library that contained offensive language and disturbing images, which deeply upset me. Additionally, I noticed inappropriate books that children were browsing through, which could potentially have negative effects on their development. To address this issue, public libraries should consider segregating such materials into sections for adults only, requiring identification for access. This measure can help protect younger individuals from harmful content and its potential consequences in their lives.
1058	4035	2	3	Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Censorship in libraries should never be an issue. It is essential that libraries remain family-friendly places where children can learn and enjoy themselves without being exposed to inappropriate materials. While it is crucial to respect everyone's right to access different types of reading materials, it is equally important to ensure that children are not exposed to content that is not suitable for their age.  Library employees play a significant role in maintaining a safe environment for all patrons. Offensive materials should be placed in the adult section of the library, clearly marked as restricted access. Parents should educate their children about these restrictions and ensure that they do not venture into the adult section. By segregating offensive materials, libraries can cater to the diverse needs of their community while also safeguarding children from harmful content.  Respecting individual rights is paramount, but it should not come at the expense of the well-being of children. It is possible to strike a balance where adults can access the content they desire while protecting children from inappropriate materials. By working together and being mindful of each other's needs, we can create a library environment that is inclusive, safe, and enjoyable for everyone. Let us strive to uphold these principles and ensure that censorship in libraries is never a cause for concern.   Sincerely, @LOCATION1
1059	4036	2	3	We all have that favorite book, mine is ' OF MICE AND MEN.' It is a book I would recommend to anybody, but there are libraries that have some books that are so bad I would be scared if my mom even picked it up and looked at the cover. My name is @PERSON1, and during this essay I am going to show you what I am talking about.  I love to read during the day. I like to go out and just pick a book right off the shelf and start then and there reading, but when I see a book or a magazine that holds sexual acts in them I become very angry. I have seen many of my friends get lost in these books and magazines right in front of adults like their mothers. They can go to a public library where their children (as young as the age of five) and read and look at these terrible things. I don't know why these books are even needed in a library. Now people can get on the internet and buy or rent them.  I have a best friend who lost his father to these sexual acts and pictures. My friend's mother had enough and had to kick him out. Now my friend is becoming the same person. He can go out and buy these magazines from friends that steal or rent them from our local library. He doesn't even recognize that his father did the same thing. He still never wants to see his father, but what he is doing is the same thing that his father also did. I have had various talks with my friend, but he said it isn't hurting anybody, but what he doesn't see is that he is hurting me.  Back in the late 90s, early 2000s parents saw some of the books that their children were reading. They tried to put a stop to it, but the plan never worked. Since then the problem has grown to a point that we will never be able to control. The libraries do this all for money they make. More people go to a library now not to study or to read in peace, but to get a sex high. This is where about half of the library's money is being made. The government tries to stay out of this, because the money they get through taxes is coming from these people. When will it stop? No one really knows, but we will try to stop it all we can.  The reason for this essay was to show why the process needs to be stopped. If you go to your local library and really look at what they sell or rent out, you will then know what I am saying. I will try to stop it, but probably will not succeed. That will not stop me from helping my friends in the future. Just be glad that you know about it now.
1060	4037	2	3	"Offensive much? That's what multiple people feel towards certain books. For instance, if someone views the Bible as offensive due to their atheistic beliefs, then the Bible can be hurtful to them. As a student, I believe that removing books based on individual feelings would leave us with nothing to read. Everyone has different perspectives, so books, magazines, and music cater to diverse tastes and preferences. These resources are valuable for learning and exploring various subjects.  Apart from books, magazines also play a role in providing information and entertainment. While some magazines focus on gossip and sensationalism, others offer valuable insights and knowledge. However, the negative impact of gossip magazines outweighs their benefits, leading to a call for their removal from shelves.  Music serves as a source of inspiration and solace for many individuals. It has the power to uplift spirits, heal the sick, and bring hope to people. Songs like ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" by Billy Joel convey powerful messages and inspire listeners. Music is an essential part of our lives and should be preserved for its ability to unite, heal, and motivate.  Furthermore, movies serve as a visual medium for storytelling and education. Historical movies like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" provide insights into past events and offer valuable lessons for viewers. Movies entertain and educate audiences, making them an important aspect of our cultural landscape.  In conclusion, books, music, and movies are essential elements of our society that inspire, educate, and entertain. While some forms of media may be deemed offensive or harmful, the overall value they bring to individuals and communities cannot be overlooked. It is crucial to preserve these resources for their positive impact on our lives and the world around us."
1061	4038	2	3	There are too many people in the world to just have one opinion about one topic and nothing else. If a person knows something is unjust, they obviously have to tell the world about it, or they feel like their opinion does not matter. Take, for example, women's clothing. If you show a man a piece of women's clothing on a computer screen, he will probably only have one or two opinions about that piece of clothing. If you show a woman that same piece of clothing, she will have more than two opinions about the piece of clothing. This is how society works today and it is not just because we were brought up that way; this is how we think and how we act. Many magazines and books, such as fashion magazines and books about modeling, portray beauty as stick thin and almost falling off clothes. Many songs and movies also tell you that being beautiful is on the outside. If you can find these materials at your local bookstore, they could possibly be at your local library as well.  Libraries aren't just for adults and teenagers; they are for people of all ages. Many libraries have sections specifically for teenagers, but some young adult materials may not be suitable for them due to the mature content. If young children access these materials, they may develop unrealistic standards of beauty at a young age. The media often portrays beauty as unattainable for the average person, leading to unhealthy behaviors like extreme dieting or excessive exercise to meet these standards. Removing such materials from libraries could help reduce the societal pressure to conform to unrealistic beauty ideals.  Books, magazines, television shows, and music often perpetuate the idea that beauty is solely based on external appearances. This can lead to individuals feeling inadequate or unworthy if they do not fit these narrow standards. True beauty comes from within, and it is important for individuals to love and accept themselves for who they are. By promoting self-acceptance and diversity, we can challenge the harmful stereotypes perpetuated by the media and encourage a more inclusive definition of beauty for all. Let us strive to embrace the beauty that lies within each of us, rather than conforming to unrealistic and damaging standards imposed by society.
1062	4039	2	3	Ever went to the library and seen a book that was too graphic for a certain section? When little kids came into the library, it seems like they should stay away from that section. Censorship should be in libraries nowadays. Many children are seeing inappropriate material at too young of an age. This exposure can lead them to develop bad ideas and potentially steer them in the wrong direction in life.  In libraries, there are numerous books that are too mature for young children. There should be a restricted section in libraries that only people of a certain age or with parental guidance can access. For instance, video stores have adult sections that only adults can enter, not children. Libraries should have a similar system to ensure that children do not have access to inappropriate material.  Personally, I have witnessed children learning negative behaviors from video games, movies, and some books. At a young age, they may not fully comprehend what is harmful to them. If children see movie characters they idolize engaging in violent acts or play video games that promote harm towards others, they may imitate these actions.  Libraries need to remove books, movies, games, music, and magazines that are not suitable for certain age groups. If they choose not to remove these materials, they should create a separate area where children cannot easily access them. It is crucial for parents to accompany their children in libraries to prevent them from coming across inappropriate material for their age.  Without censorship in libraries, children may observe and replicate harmful behaviors depicted in books, games, movies, magazines, and music. Implementing censorship can protect the next generation from being influenced by violence and other negative behaviors present in these materials. It is essential to ensure that young children are guided and supervised when visiting libraries to prevent exposure to content that is unsuitable for their age.
1063	4040	2	3	Books have been around for centuries and hold significant cultural value. While children enjoy stories about ponies and puppies, it's important to consider how books can impact people of different races, religions, and ages. Negative books, movies, and magazines can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and hurtful ideas, so it's crucial to remove them from circulation.  It's essential to promote respect and acceptance for all individuals, regardless of their appearance or background. Books that perpetuate discrimination or exclusion based on race should not be tolerated. In schools, teachers should be vigilant in ensuring that all students feel represented and respected in the literature they read.  Similarly, materials that disparage certain religions or undermine faith should not have a place in libraries or bookstores. Everyone deserves to practice their beliefs without fear of judgment or ridicule. Negative portrayals of different faiths can be damaging and divisive, so it's important to remove such materials from circulation.  When it comes to children's books and movies, parents should be mindful of the messages their kids are consuming. Violent or inappropriate content can have a negative impact on young minds, shaping their views on conflict, beauty standards, and gender roles. It's crucial to provide children with positive and empowering stories that promote kindness, diversity, and self-acceptance.  In conclusion, we need to be proactive in identifying and removing negative books, movies, and magazines from circulation. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and uplifting literary environment that fosters respect, understanding, and positivity for people of all backgrounds. Let's prioritize materials that inspire and empower individuals, rather than perpetuate harmful stereotypes and divisive ideologies.
1064	4041	2	3	Books play a crucial role in shaping the minds of children, and it is important to consider the content of these books carefully. While some parents may be lenient about the types of books their children read, it is essential to be cautious about the potential influence of inappropriate content. Children are impressionable and may mimic behaviors or ideas they encounter in books, so it is vital to ensure that the material they are exposed to is suitable for their age and maturity level.  Authors have a responsibility to consider the impact of their words on young readers and to be mindful of the themes and messages they are conveying. It is concerning when books contain explicit or harmful content that could lead children astray. Parents and caregivers should be vigilant in monitoring the reading material of their children and advocating for more stringent guidelines regarding the availability of certain books.  It is crucial to have measures in place to restrict access to books that are not suitable for children and to provide clear ratings or guidelines for parents and educators to make informed decisions. By taking proactive steps to regulate the content of books, we can help protect the innocence and well-being of young readers and promote a safer and healthier reading environment for all.
1065	4042	2	3	The material found in books can sometimes be offensive, which is why it is important for parents to supervise what their children read. Censorship can be beneficial in controlling access to inappropriate content. However, books are not the only source of potentially harmful material for youth. Magazines, music, movies, and the internet also expose children to suggestive content. Music, in particular, often contains explicit lyrics without any rating system like movies have. The internet provides easy access to a wide range of content, both educational and harmful. Video games, online interactions, and global connectivity further complicate the issue of controlling what children are exposed to. Despite efforts to regulate access, it is challenging to completely shield youth from inappropriate content in today's digital age.
1066	4043	2	3	One book or movie doesn't make a difference in the huge library full of books and movies. That's why the books, magazines, or movies shouldn't be removed from the bookshelf of the library. They shouldn't be removed because some parents of the children don't care what their kids listen to or read. Only if they are doing what the parent says. Also, the parents might think too much of their kid and think that their kid knows what books you want them to get or don't get.  Although, if you're one of those parents who not only care about what your children read or listen to, and you realize that not every kid knows what their parent wants, then you should talk to the school's principal and see if there is a way that you could come up with an area of the library that is just for the books that have the wrong type of language or sex appeal that you don't want your children to have, or ever read. Or you could ask them about a permission slip for the students to ask their parent if they care about these types of books.  Then there are some kids who like to read those types of books and would be very disappointed if their favorite books got taken off the shelf, and they didn't have anything else to read, but everybody else in the school got to have their favorite books in school.  If someone were to tell me that the book is changing their lives into something that is unbearable, I would say to them that it's not the book. The kids chose to read the book in the first place, so it would be their own doing if their life changed.  Finally, that's the reason why books shouldn't be taken off the bookshelf because some people like them, and if you are one of the kids or parents who don't like them or don't want their kids reading them, then have the librarian make a note to say they aren't allowed to check them out.
1067	4044	2	3	Author Katherine Paterson once commented, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exctly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. Many people in society share Katherine's view, while some belive in strict library censorship. It is important not to infringe on the rights of other people, surpress freedom of speech, or limit their knowledge. Therefore, I support her sentiment. If materials are thought to be innnapropriate for children ,or others for that matter, then censorship needs to be set up in the home by the parents, not by a public institution. America was founded upon the need for freedom: freedom of speech, of religion, and press. If we start to change that or limit what press a library can or cannot have, we are destroying a nation's core values. Can we turn our back on what our forefathers knew we had the right to? Furthermore, if we start to take a few 'offensive' books off the shelf, where do we draw the line? Anybody can claim almost any book is 'offensive' in some way, shape, or form, that does not mean we should immeadiatly take it off the shelf of an important public institution. If you do not want to take my word for it, look back at histroy. What kind of civilization was @LOCATION1? Not one you would want to live in I suppose. Hardly anyone would, and one of the things they controlled most was personal freedom. They started it off with the seemingly small act of censoring books. First, it was just viewed as unsavory to have a book they deemed offensive, in this case it was the works of @CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS3, or @CAPS4 authors. Later on they started to burn theese books, and punish people for having them in thier possesion. If we are to live in a country, where a man has the rights he should have, then we cannot censor library books. This seemingly harmless act could have much greater consequnces than foreseen. Many families have different values they want to pass on to their children, morals they hope to teach them. The problem is, is that each families' limits and values are unique; We cannot just assume anything about families in general. I personally know a family that is very protective over what their children read, watch or listen to. On the other hand, I am aquainted with a family who allows their children more freedom to choose what they read. What one set of parents want to limit their child from reading @MONTH1 vary from another set of parents. If they find material they do not want their children to read, then they should censor in the home. They could start with a disscusion about why the material is inapropriate, and give the child the responsibility to obey their parents. It helps the parents become more involved in their childrens' lives and it aids the children in personal growth with responsiblity and respect. In the end, it all boils down to freedom. Do we want to live in a counrty with freedom of press and the right to publicly access it. My answer is yes, and I belive it is the answer of my fellow @CAPS5 too. We cannot clearly draw the line between 'offensive' and 'okay' because we are all different. Therefore we cannot bring our opinions down on the public instituion, but the home. It is not right to limit a whole society on what they have public access to because of one opinion.
1068	4045	2	3	Most people consider libraries to be a safe and enriching environment, but it is important to address the issue of offensive material that can be found on their shelves. While libraries are meant to be a place of exploration and learning, the presence of books, magazines, and other media containing nudity, explicit language, and other inappropriate content can be harmful, especially to children. It is crucial for libraries to establish boundaries and enforce censorship to ensure that visitors, particularly young readers, are not exposed to offensive material. By implementing regulations on the types of materials available, libraries can maintain their role as a place of education and inspiration without compromising on ethical standards. Let us work towards creating a library environment that is welcoming and safe for all individuals to explore and learn without being subjected to offensive content.
1069	4046	2	3	Do you want your children to have bad images in their head? Does everybody deserve to read or watch anything they want? I believe strongly that these materials should be removed from libraries in most cases. Offensive materials have no business being in libraries. These materials are not good for children, offend people, and do not look good on the libraries that carry them.     First, I believe there is absolutely no reason for any child to see explicit material. This material can create a very ambitious young child. If a child sees a magazine containing pornography, the child will think that this material is acceptable. The truth is, that child should not know about anything of this subject until he or she receives approval from his/her parents. I know from experience that most parents would not want one of their children to see any of this material for a very extensive time. I have had a few disturbing experiences myself. One time when I was a young lad, I checked out a horror movie from the local library not knowing what the movie was about. I made sure my parents were not home when I watched it. After about three minutes, I was terrified. The images from the film stayed in my head for a good month. Children do not deserve the feeling of fear for that long of a time.     Next, some material in the library contain certain things that offend random people. Large public libraries contain music with explicit lyrics. We, as a society, do not want our youth to hear the nasty words in some of the rap songs that are released. In addition to that, this music offends many adults as well. Adults agree that there is no reason for any rap to be released in a public place like a library. Music is a very great art, but when certain people abuse it, it no longer has a good image. I have observed that children listening to rap at a very young age are more likely to end up turning out to be an unsuccessful individual.     Also, some specific magazines contain images that are offensive to the people of our society. This idea relates to my first idea, but I will speak some of it again. Images like blood can sometimes offend the people of our generation. We do not need any of this. If offensive material was banned from libraries, our society would have eliminated one more problem that is taking away from our good world. I have been offended of some different magazine pictures before. Someday when I have kids, I will never let them go to certain sections of the library with this material.     Last, I want to address the fact that specific libraries can carry a bad reputation if they carry this material. In addition, employees will definitely go to a different library without the bad music and the violent movies. Most of the adults that want their children to be successful and have a good, creative mind will think twice about going to the library without censorship of certain items. I have read that libraries with bad material are much less likely to attract customers than libraries with censorship. I know that if I was the manager of a public library, I would make sure that any items that have the potential to offend people would be immediately removed. A library should definitely not want that bad gossip to go around town about how bad that specific library is. Censorship is as necessary to libraries as flavor is to food. Shelves that contain inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only make their number of customers drop. If you think that this is only going to help libraries, I dare you to go ahead and try it out.      Everyone has their own opinions, but I am a firm believer in censorship at public and private libraries. Inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only destroy the good reputation that a library @MONTH1 have. A library is a great place to be, but the libraries without censorship are an utter disappointment. After all, it is your life, and you get to choose the way you want your children to act. Disturbing materials are only going to bring a negative effect on these minors. I hope to see the amount of censorship rise in libraries. If it does, people will see a dramatic change in all of my ideas discussed.
1070	4047	2	3	As the Katherine Paterson's quote states everyone has the right to decide what is offensive or inappropriate for themselves. In today's world, many things that were once deemed acceptable are now seen as inappropriate by parents. However, if parents start censoring what their children read, watch, or listen to, it may only pique their curiosity and lead them to seek out these materials anyway. This rebellion could result in children receiving unintended education and going against their parents' wishes. Therefore, it may be more beneficial for parents to have open discussions with their children about what they are consuming rather than outright censoring it. Ultimately, children will be exposed to various forms of media, and it is essential for parents to guide them through these experiences rather than trying to shield them from everything.
1071	4048	2	3	The topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years. It has been discussed by many people, but a decision has never been reached. I say that there should be no library censoring. I would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are.   I think that there should be no censoring of libraries. It would impair our basic rights, such as our right to freedom of expression and our right freedom to the press. We would no longer live in a free country but a totalitarian state.  Though if they would put an age restriction on certain things that please the debaters. I think that many would agree to this if it was proposed. Thus, if we did this, children would only be able to read or listen to materials appropriate for their age.  Though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to, not the libraries. It's the parents who introduce the children to music, magazines, and books. If the parents started to censor these materials early on, this debate would not be going on as it is.  The topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over the past years. Some want to censor our libraries, though that is not the best choice. @PERSON1 said that if we have the right to censor libraries, then there will be no more books for any of us. Ultimately, censoring libraries would limit our access to information and hinder our freedom to explore different ideas and perspectives. It is essential to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and resist any attempts to restrict access to knowledge in libraries.
1072	4049	2	3	"I do not believe that such things as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from libraries. First, books serve as valuable learning sources for people of all ages, providing historical context and important messages that can help educate individuals about various topics. While some content may be deemed inappropriate for certain age groups, it is essential for understanding the past and promoting awareness and sensitivity towards different issues.  Movies also play a crucial role in educating and raising awareness about societal issues, cultural differences, and historical events. Films like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" can provide valuable insights into the struggles of the past and how far society has come in terms of addressing discrimination and inequality. Visual representations can enhance understanding and make complex topics more relatable and engaging for viewers.  Music, despite some controversial content, can be a powerful tool for communication and expression. It has the ability to convey messages, evoke emotions, and spark important conversations. Artists often use music to share their personal experiences and perspectives, creating a platform for dialogue and connection among listeners. Music reflects the evolution of society and serves as a means of cultural expression and storytelling.  Magazines, while some may contain inappropriate content, also serve as sources of information, entertainment, and insight into current events and trends. Publications like National Geographic provide valuable knowledge about the world and promote learning and curiosity among readers. Magazines cater to various interests and preferences, offering a diverse range of content for individuals to explore and enjoy.  In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from library shelves as they play essential roles in education, entertainment, and cultural enrichment. These forms of media contribute to learning, understanding, and personal growth, and should be preserved and accessible to all individuals seeking knowledge and inspiration."
1073	4050	2	3	"Somethings on the shelves in bookstores and other places can be very offensive. I think having cuss words in music and sexually explicit content can be offensive to women. I do listen to some music, but nothing with that kind of content because I believe it should not be included in music and books.   One day, I believe the USA will be led by a woman, and there is nothing wrong with that. Women have the same rights as men do. There are some people who believe women are just slaves, but that is completely false. Women and men are equal, no matter what others may say.   Katherine Paterson has the right idea. It would be great if the law allowed individuals to remove offensive content from shelves and discard it. However, some people may disagree because they only care about themselves and act in ways that benefit them. There are also kids who look at magazines and see negative influences, thinking those individuals are cool and mimicking their actions. This is why I believe we should have the ability to remove such content from shelves.   I once saw a magazine in a store featuring a movie star holding her three kids on the cover. The title was ""Superstar."" It saddened me to think that these kids might not grow up to be like their parents, with all the wealth in the world.  It may seem silly that people care so much about these things nowadays, but it's important to remember that life is more than just material possessions. We need to move past our own selfish desires and realize that not everyone will share the same perspectives on life.  Throughout my life, I have pondered these thoughts because it appears that today's society is focused on money, material possessions, and status symbols. When I see someone driving a new car worth a significant amount of money, I can't help but wonder how they acquired such wealth. It makes me reflect on our societal values and priorities. We need to remember that true fulfillment comes from within, not from external possessions."
1074	4051	2	3	Libraries contain more than just books. They offer a variety of materials such as music, movies, magazines, and more for people of all ages. While some may not agree with all the materials available, libraries strive to cater to the diverse interests of their patrons. To address concerns about inappropriate content, libraries can consider creating separate areas for different age groups to ensure that children are not exposed to unsuitable material. While this may require additional resources, it is a worthwhile investment in providing a safe and welcoming environment for all library users. Ultimately, it is important to strike a balance between freedom of access and responsible content management to create a positive library experience for everyone.
1075	4052	2	3	As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'  I think we all can agree with @CAPS2. We have all read something that we did not necessarily want to finish or that we wish we had not read.  I, however, believe that these materials should not be taken off of the shelves and be put out of reach of our youth, or adults.  When you take away materials that some people use to learn, you take away their ability to learn.  Yes, they @MONTH1 choose another book and learn from it too but it should not be our choice to dictate what they can and can not read.  Take for example the popular internet video clip, '@CAPS1 guys one hammer.'  @CAPS2 is a video of two guys beating a homeless man to death with a hammer and screwdriver.  I have never seen @CAPS2 movie and listening to my friends talk about it, I do not want to.  @CAPS2 seems like a gruesome and horrific video clip that would scar me for life, but it is a perfect example for @CAPS2 because what some do not want to learn from, others can.  I would never watch @CAPS2 or anything like @CAPS2 but my friends who have watched @CAPS2 have learned something. That is that you should be successful in life because if you are homeless then you could be beaten to death by some teenagers who are looking to have some 'fun.'  I kid you not, after hearing about @CAPS2 sad video it has inspired me to be a successful person and not become homeless. @CAPS2 brings us back to the main point - had someone said, 'No, @CAPS2 video can not be on the internet.' none of my friends would have seen @CAPS2 or told me about it.  Therefore I would not be driven to be a good student and a good person.  Then, when I was older I would have become homeless and would have had the chance to be the star in one of these videos. You can be sure that that is not something that I would want to be.  In conclusion, I believe we should not interfere with some people's right to learn.  We should not take away materials that can be used to learn no matter how bad we think they are, because you never know, one man's pain is another man's learning tool. If we all took away the materials that we felt were innappropriate or needed censorship then we would have very few learning materials left.  As Katherine Paterson said, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'
1076	4053	2	3	Coming from a teenager, offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from local libraries. A library is meant to be a place for relaxation and learning, but unfortunately, many of the materials available are filled with explicit content such as sex, gang violence, and drugs. In today's society, these themes are prevalent, and it is crucial to protect younger children from being exposed to such harmful influences.   When children are constantly surrounded by books and movies that glamorize sex, drugs, and violence, it can shape their behavior and beliefs in a negative way. Instead of being able to open a book and learn something new, they are bombarded with inappropriate content that can lead to the development of bad habits.   As a teenager, I believe that libraries should be a safe space where individuals can access educational and enriching materials. By removing offensive books, movies, and magazines, we can ensure that younger children are not exposed to harmful content that can influence them in a negative manner. It is important for parents to guide their children and ensure that they are consuming age-appropriate and educational materials.   In conclusion, offensive books, movies, and magazines have no place in local libraries. It is essential to provide a positive and enriching environment for individuals of all ages to learn and grow without being exposed to explicit and harmful content. Removing offensive materials from libraries can help create a safer and more educational space for everyone.
1077	4054	2	3	The @CAPS1,     I read an intresting @CAPS2 the other day by Katherine Paterson an author. The @CAPS2 said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- the work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'      I believe that people should not have the right to take matieral such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. of the shelf of a library, or anywhere else those items are displayed. So I agree %@NUM1 with Paterson because people have their own opions. Some stuff @MONTH1 be more offensive than others to different people. I have observed people, and were all different so why should our thoughts be to? The answer is yes they should be different. But it is pretty simple if you find a book, song, movie, or magazine that you find offensive or distasteful then put it back another person might find it intresting.      I want to know the thoughts of my fellow citizens about what Paterson has said. I am asking for your help to do so. I would like you to put the @CAPS2 in The @CAPS1 and hear what people have to say about it. Thank You for accepting my @CAPS4.
1078	4055	2	3	Most of us have had times when we are really into a book or magazine that we are reading, and all of a sudden we come across vulgar language, pictures, or activities that are not suitable for us. Why did the author have to throw this in the book? Why didn't the back of the book tell me that there was offensive behavior in this book? Why is this magazine in the library with risky pictures? It may even make some people not interested in that specific author anymore, or quite possibly persuade someone to stop visiting that library. Certain materials in libraries should be removed.  The first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers. Let's say your child is at the library and they pick up a random book to check it out. Turns out, the summary of the story on the back is actually about college kids partying and participating in illegal activities. Your child on the other hand, does not read the summary and just wants the book based on the moral of the story, interesting cover, and critic reviews. If your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities, you are most likely going to be upset.  The second reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the books and other materials with offensive material can be placed in book stores, instead of the public library. In that case, parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library. Adults and older teenagers can still have their material choice, they will just have to take a trip to the bookstore to find what they need. They may not get to check out items for free like at the library, but it will be safer for the children and young teenagers. Not to mention, the people who respect their morals too much to read offensive material.  The third reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the library should be ordered to state on the back of the book, magazine, movies, etc., in any way they choose, if the book contains anything that may be taken as offensive to a reader. That way, if someone is questioning the summary of the book, a risky title, or cover illustration, they can flip to the back to see if it will be tolerable for them.  Libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves. It will create a more civil trip to the library. No more worries about accidentally coming upon a sentence or chapter in a book that is against someone's morals. Or flipping through pages in a magazine and seeing a picture that offends you. Libraries will contain safe books for all ages, while bookstores can have the pleasure of having offensive material on their shelves. It's a win-win situation.
1079	4056	2	3	Should books that seem offensive to you be put off of the shelves? I know that most people who agree that it would 'better' our kids if they didn't read or listen to certain things. But, what would happen if everything that we thought was wrong was taken off of the shelves?   I do not think that we have any right to take a book off of shelves because of its contents. If I look at a certain book and think, 'this book is offending me and my beliefs,' then I should just not read the book. Just because it is offensive to me doesn't mean it will offend someone else. Every book that has ever been written has affected someone, either in a good way or a bad way. Does that mean they have the right to say, 'take them off the shelves?'   I remember when I was in second grade, there was this girl in my class whose mother came in to complain about my teacher playing gospel music while we worked. The parent was extremely angry at the teacher and, at that time, I didn't know why. Now I realize that it was because they didn't believe in what the lyrics in the song were saying. The teacher never played the music in class again and was too afraid to play any other type of music.  Since everyone's views are different, by the time every person took off the books that offended them, there would be no books left. As Katherine Paterson put it, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly that same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  In conclusion, I strongly think that books, whether they offended someone or not, should be kept on the shelves. Taking the book off wouldn't accomplish anything to begin with.
1080	4057	2	3	I think that we should have offensive materials on the shelves in libraries. People have their own ideas and opinions about offensive material like it shouldn't be around in libraries for children to read or we should have offensive material because it might help someone one day. Sometimes when people think of offensive material they think of bad and not good for people to read or watch because it's not treating people right. However, offensive material can also be educational and provide valuable insights into historical contexts. It can help students in high school research for a project, show how offensive materials were perceived in the past, and teach us more about the subject. Removing offensive material from libraries would limit access to important information and hinder the learning process. In conclusion, having offensive material available in libraries is essential for education and understanding different perspectives.
1081	4058	2	3	To whom it may concern: Do you take away books because someone might find them offensive? Is racism a part of literature? Libraries are considering removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from their inventory for censorship, fearing that individuals may take offense to certain beliefs portrayed in various forms of entertainment. However, these forms of entertainment should not be removed from public or private libraries.  In many libraries, inventory is being stripped for censorship, with materials being removed due to potential offensiveness. Literature, as an art form, reflects the beliefs and values of the time in which it was created. It is a part of history, encompassing wars, politics, art, and even slavery. Removing offensive material erases a significant era of history, disregarding the perspectives and opinions of people from that time.  While many may find racism abhorrent, it is essential to acknowledge that it was once a prevalent belief. Literature provides insight into past attitudes and societal norms, allowing us to understand how far we have come and the progress we still need to make. Personal opinions are embedded in books, and respecting diverse viewpoints is crucial for fostering a tolerant and inclusive society.  Literature plays a vital role in shaping society and our understanding of the world. Without it, we would lack valuable insights into different cultures, perspectives, and historical contexts. Therefore, literature should remain on library shelves, serving as a testament to our past and a reflection of the diverse human experience. Let us preserve this important part of history for present and future generations to learn from and appreciate.
1082	4059	2	3	Many people have different views and opinions on things. No opinion or view is right or wrong. Books, music, and movies of controversy shouldn't be removed from shelves because not everybody finds them offensive, people have the right to view them, and others can't make the decision for everyone. Everybody is entitled to their own views and opinions, but they can't make others see things their way. If someone was at a library, and thought the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series were offensive, they might be the only ones to think that. They can't tell the library to remove them because they're uncomfortable with the books. Things go by majority rule, and that person is not the majority. They're the only one with the problem. Everyone has the right to view or listen to what they want, as long as it's legal. If someone finds a type of music that they find offensive, they can't tell the store to remove it. One person can't change everything to fit their needs. They would be making plenty of people unhappy if that type of music was removed. To make everyone happy, the person could just not listen to it. There's a huge selection of music a person could listen to, without being uncomfortable. One person cannot make the decisions for everyone. The president doesn't even make the decisions by himself; he has the government helping him. If one person felt as if a magazine was inappropriate, they don't have the right to change it. They're not the one in charge so they can't be the one to change the magazine. It might be inappropriate, but other people enjoy reading it. I believe that everyone's entitled to their own opinions and views, but they shouldn't make everyone see it their way. Books, music, movies, and magazines are few of the things that people try to control because they're uncomfortable with the subject inside the material. Some of the stuff is inappropriate or offensive, but one person can't change it. Not everybody will find it offensive, people have the right to view, watch, or listen to what they want, and one person can't make decisions for everyone.
1083	4060	2	3	Should someones work categorized as 'inappropriate' or 'offensive' be taken off of a shelf and not able to be sold or seen in stores? If you believe so, then do you think it is okay for the campaigners that run for @CAPS1 be able to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics? This is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries.  When someone writes a book on something, they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing. Just as when @CAPS2 campaigners present themselves to the public and announce what party they will be running for and what their beliefs and disbeliefs are. If it is okay for someone to take a book off of a shelf, or even a magazine because people think the book is 'inappropriate' then maybe we should reconsider what the campaigners say on live @CAPS3.  Even if you were to walk into a store and there be nude magazines on the shelf, or CDs with lyrics that contain cuss words do you feel those should be taken off of shelves as well? There is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed. For example, when you go to a little kids store and things like this are being sat out for the kids to see, they will not forget what they saw or heard if referring to music. Kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered. Like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank, or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug. When kids see or even hear things like this, they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try.  When someone spends months or even years on writing a story, they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long, hard work. By doing this they try and get it to be published, and put in stores so people can buy it. Whether or not if you're talking about music, movies, or books, it's all the same. Things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available.  If things were going to be taken off of shelves or not put out onto display, people will stop recording music, acting out movies, or even writing ads and books. When and if this were to happen, people will not become educated with new available data. If there is nobody to write science books, or biographies then nobody will learn about new things. Same with music and movies, if people spend a few months or even a year writing a new album, or coming up with an idea for a movie and they work hard to get it done, they expect to get it out to the public. If it's finally out and people have the chance to buy it, they hope it will stay available. If it doesn't and people think the movie is 'inappropriate' then the songwriters and actors will more than likely not have the urge to do it all over again.  In conclusion, I think that if someone writes something or records something that has taken them a good amount of work and time that they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold. If someone believes that an item is 'inappropriate' then they should keep their comments to themselves, and not have the item taken off display. There are some people out there that enjoy things that are not 'appropriate' and they think it's funny. Surely if the writer or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good, and they believe that people will buy their product. So, if the writer thinks this, surely there is someone out there that feels the same. How are we to know if there is someone out there that agrees, and enjoys the book or movie if it has been taken off of the shelf because someone thought the material was 'inappropriate.'
1084	4061	2	3	What if someone told you that you couldn't wear a yellow shirt because it was offensive? What if they said you couldn't look a certain way because you might offend somebody? Not just one person or group of people have the right to decide what is suitable and what is not. There are so many different religions and traditions throughout the world it would be completely ridiculous to set one standard for all people. If individuals aren't restricted when it comes to apparel, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limits in the libraries? Libraries should not be censored because not only would censorship limit the resourcefulness of the libraries and smother the knowledge intake across the world, but it would also pose a threat to our future.   When one takes a trip to the library, one would expect to find a book, magazine, and/or movie on just about anything. It would be extremely frustrating to find that a library, which is supposed to contain content on nearly every subject, does not have what you're looking for. Say a book on the assassination of JFK is what you fancy, so you ask the librarian where you could find it. You would be disappointed if she says they don't carry assassination books because they are too vulgar for young children. This could become very troubling and would limit the library's resources.  Not only would censorship in libraries limit the content but it would also limit learning in the world. How are people supposed to stay informed if they are being shielded from knowledge? Many people that do not have computers depend on the library. If they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go? The libraries would lose business and funding if they did not supply library-goers with the content which they desire. People would take their business elsewhere. Protests might break out and rebellious citizens might protest the censorship, causing an uproar in society.  The people would not be the only thing out of hand. The censorship would surely get out of hand, as well. We are already being censored through news stations, radio, and TV shows. Libraries are a place where infinite knowledge is realistic and that is comforting for many. In libraries, people choose what they learn: they aren't forced by teachers or parents. The censorship might start out as a small intervention, but it could turn our nation upside down. Next thing we know, our decisions could be influenced by the books that only 'they' decide are suitable. What kind of society would we have then? Individuality would be lost, and opinions would be forgotten.  Clearly, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable. If libraries were censored, not only would knowledge in the world disintegrate, but libraries would lose their respect and threaten the future of society. No one tells me what to wear or say, so why should anyone tell me what to read? We are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs. Our rights and freedoms earned us our freedoms, we cannot let censorship take them away.
1085	4062	2	3	@PERSON1 @NUM1 @DATE2, @DATE1                                   @CAPS1 @CAPS2           You should be able to read any book, listen to any music and watch any movie you want right? Well in some libraries that isn't always the case. Some people find books, music and movies offensive and not suitable for public libraries.     In a public library I think that all books should be there to check out! The books might contain material that is more adult, but thats okay. For the books that are more inappropraite the library needs to offer an adult section. Just for the books that contain more adult material and are not suitable for younger readers. The person checking the book out should make the final decision if they think the book they have selected is right for them.      Music in libraries should not be censorshiped. The lyrics might be inappropraite, but most teenagers listen to that type of music. For younger children they should not be able to check out a @CAPS3 that is more adult. In @CAPS1 opinion, for the music that is more adult you should be at least thirteen years old. Children under thirteen years of age should not have the option to check out that music. Some parents don't know what their child has checked out from the library. The child should have parent concent to check out any music if under the age requirement.      I think that some movies should defenitely be removed if they are found offensive. Some movies have scenes that are horrible and that should be in the adult section. In a library you aren't expecting to find a movie that contains very adult material. At a movie rental store you would expect to find movies that are adult, but not in a public library. Movies for kids to check out should be educational, fun and most importantly, appropriate!      Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that is exactly right. I would not want @CAPS1 little cousin reading books with racial comments and just plain out inappropraite content for a child that age. Even if the child doesn't understand what all of the content means, they will ask questions that the parent is most likely not ready to answer. As children,they might get the wrong idea in their head and say things that are not right.      In public libraries books should not be censored movies should be censored and music should not. It all comes down to what do you allow your children to read, watch and listen? Its a debate that has gone through several libraries over the content of the material. Now that you know @CAPS1 opinion on censorshiped, maybe others will consider this an important topic, too  In conclusion, the debate on censorship in public libraries continues to be a significant issue. While books should be available for all to access, with parental discretion for younger readers, movies with explicit content should be limited to adult sections. Music, on the other hand, should remain uncensored, with age-appropriate guidelines in place. Ultimately, it is crucial for individuals to consider what is suitable for themselves and their children, sparking ongoing discussions and considerations within library settings.
1086	4063	2	3	Freedom of speech is a fundamental aspect of society in @LOCATION1, allowing for the flourishing of diverse ideas and perspectives. The constitution guarantees freedom of the press, enabling the dissemination of information and opinions, even if they may be offensive to some individuals. While certain materials may be deemed controversial, it is essential to uphold the right to express and access various viewpoints.  Throughout history, there have been instances of censorship, book burnings, and suppression of free speech. However, @LOCATION1 has progressively adopted a more inclusive and open-minded approach towards media and literature. Despite occasional objections, it is crucial to respect the freedom of expression and resist the urge to restrict access to certain books or publications based on personal preferences.  While there may be limitations on the distribution of explicit content in certain settings, such as public schools, it is essential to recognize the value of exposure to diverse ideas and narratives. Reading and engaging with challenging material can broaden one's understanding and foster critical thinking skills. It is not the content itself that influences behavior, but rather how individuals interpret and engage with it.  Ultimately, the freedom to read and write about a range of topics is a vital component of a democratic society. Embracing diverse perspectives and engaging with challenging material can lead to personal growth and intellectual development. By upholding freedom of speech, we can ensure a more inclusive and enlightened society for all.
1087	4064	2	3	Nowadays, children can access a wide range of reading materials in libraries, including some that may be inappropriate for their age. While it may be tempting to remove these items, it is important to consider other options. Implementing a rating system for books and magazines, similar to that of movies, can help guide children and their parents towards age-appropriate content. Additionally, creating a separate section in the library for more mature materials can prevent young children from accessing them. Ultimately, it is essential for parents to be vigilant and monitor their children's reading choices. By taking these measures, libraries can maintain a diverse collection while ensuring that children are exposed to suitable content.
1088	4065	2	3	There should be separate libraries for children and adults to ensure that inappropriate content is not easily accessible to young readers. By creating distinct spaces for each age group, libraries can better cater to their specific needs and interests. Additionally, it is crucial for libraries to remove any books, magazines, music, or movies that contain inappropriate material from their shelves. This will help maintain a safe and welcoming environment for all visitors, especially children. It is the responsibility of library staff to ensure that the content available is suitable for all audiences. By taking these measures, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for learning and enjoyment for people of all ages.
1089	4066	2	3	Libraries contain a variety of materials such as books, magazines, and movies, providing a diverse range of content for people to explore. While some individuals may find certain materials offensive, it is important to remember that what is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. Therefore, it is not practical or fair to remove all potentially offensive materials from library shelves. Instead, individuals have the choice to avoid or ignore materials that they find offensive, allowing others to still access and enjoy them. If a particular item is found offensive, it can be brought to the attention of library staff for further discussion or action. Ultimately, libraries serve as valuable resources for a wide range of interests and perspectives, and it is important to respect the diverse content available while also being mindful of individual sensitivities.
1090	4067	2	3	If we remove all books we deem inappropriate from shelves, we would limit our reading options significantly. Books often provide rich detail and unexpected surprises that enhance the reading experience. Instead of censoring books, it may be more effective to rate them similarly to movies and music to inform readers about their content. Offensive books could be placed in designated sections with clear labels to alert readers of their potentially objectionable material. This approach would allow individuals to make informed choices about what they read while still preserving a diverse range of literary options. By implementing a labeling system for books, we can empower parents to guide their children's reading choices and ensure that young readers are exposed to age-appropriate content. This method of categorization could help address concerns about offensive material in books without resorting to outright removal. Ultimately, labeling books based on their content could be a practical and effective solution to managing potentially objectionable material while maintaining the availability of diverse reading options.
1091	4068	2	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I've recently finished reading a quote from the esteemed author Katherine Paterson regarding the use of certain materials in books that may offend some readers. Paterson's stance emphasizes the importance of individual choice when it comes to reading material. If a particular book contains content that makes a reader uncomfortable, the simple solution is to choose a different book to read.  Authors view books as a platform to express their thoughts and beliefs about the world around them. They should not be censored or criticized for their creative expressions. Everyone has different preferences and sensitivities when it comes to literature, and no one should be forced to read something that doesn't align with their values.  While I may not be an avid reader, I can appreciate the power of language in transporting readers into different worlds. Even if a book contains elements that may be deemed controversial by some, it has the potential to resonate deeply with others. It's all about personal interpretation and perspective.  Removing books from shelves based on individual opinions would ultimately lead to a vast emptiness in the literary world. Every book has its critics and admirers, and it's impossible to please everyone. Diversity in literature allows for a range of voices and perspectives to be heard, enriching the reading experience for all.  In a world as vast and diverse as ours, it's essential to embrace the variety of opinions and beliefs that exist. What may be considered a terrible book by one person could be a beloved treasure to another. Let's celebrate the unique qualities of each book and respect the freedom of authors to share their stories with the world.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1092	4069	2	3	Have you ever been to a library and found that some books are not the best choice for younger kids to be reading? I have visited multiple libraries and discovered that some books, magazines, and movies are too extreme for children under the age of 15. In my opinion, children who are not above 15 years old should not be exposed to rated R or NC-17 books, movies, or magazines. Children should not have to be aware of adult content at such a young age. I believe that children should be reading and watching PG-13 movies and books.  Some may argue that young children will not understand the content, but children are curious and learn by observing and asking questions. They may come across inappropriate content and ask for explanations from parents. It is not easy for parents to explain adult themes to young children. It is better to introduce older books and movies when children are 15 and older when they are more mature and able to understand and handle the content.  Twelve years old is still a young age for children to be exposed to mature content on their own. Parents should sit with their children and explain what is happening in the book or movie. Children look up to their parents and learn from them. It is important for parents to guide their children in understanding and processing adult content.  In conclusion, I believe that rated R books, magazines, and movies should be reserved for ages 15 and above. Children should be exposed to age-appropriate content to prepare them for adulthood. By introducing mature content at an appropriate age, children will be better equipped to understand and navigate the complexities of adulthood.
1093	4070	2	3	Many books, movies, and magazines are tailored for different age groups of adults and children, and it is understandable that certain content may not be suitable for all children. While parents may have concerns about the material their children have access to, it is not right for them to outright ban books from schools and libraries. Authors have the freedom to create the content they desire, and students should have the freedom to explore a variety of literature.  Books play a crucial role in a student's learning and development. They provide valuable information and insights that can help shape their understanding of the world around them. Parents need to recognize that they cannot shield their children from every aspect of society, as one day they will need to navigate the world on their own. Books can serve as a tool for teenagers to learn about sensitive topics that they may not feel comfortable discussing with their parents.  Access to books is essential for students who may not have the means to purchase them. School libraries offer a valuable resource for students to explore different genres and topics. By implementing measures to restrict access to age-appropriate materials, such as using locked cases with electronic keys, schools can ensure that students are only accessing content that aligns with their maturity level.  In conclusion, books are a vital source of knowledge and learning for students. While parents may have concerns about the content their children are exposed to, it is important to find a balance between protecting children and allowing them to explore a variety of literature. By implementing measures to regulate access to age-appropriate materials, schools can ensure that students have the opportunity to learn and grow through reading.
1094	4071	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a contentious issue, especially when it comes to materials that contain profanity, nudity, or other controversial content. While some may argue for the removal of such materials, I believe that they should remain on the shelves but perhaps be categorized in specific sections. Banning these materials would be disrespectful to the creators who put time and effort into their work.  Instead of censoring, individuals can choose to avoid such materials by seeking out alternative options that align with their preferences. There are plenty of books, magazines, and movies that are more family-friendly and suitable for all audiences. By spreading awareness of these alternatives, we can help others make informed choices about what they consume.  In the end, it is important to respect the freedom of expression and diverse perspectives in libraries. While some may choose to engage with more explicit content, others can opt for more wholesome and uplifting materials. By promoting a variety of options, we can create a more inclusive and enriching environment for all library users.
1095	4072	2	3	Censorship in today's libraries is a major issue. There are groups who both support and challenge these ideas of censoring books and other media from our children. Do you think it is right for someone else to decide what we can or can't read? Personally, I believe that we should be able to make our own choices when deciding if a book or movie is too indecent to read or not.   We as human beings have the ability to make our own decisions. Everyday we are faced with hundreds of decisions; whether it be what outfit we are going to wear for the day, or what type of food we want to eat. In that sense, nobody can tell us that we can't do these things so why should they be allowed to tell us what we can or can't read? What may look vulgar to someone, might not look so offensive to another individual. Everybody has a different taste in media. That is why it is wrong for someone to make decisions on what to watch or read for someone else. What they think is wrong may be completely normal to the individual they are making the decision for.  Censoring of media for kids should be the responsibility of the parents. If a parent does not want their child to be exposed to a certain element of media then that parent should not allow their child to see or read it. Everybody has their own opinion on things, that is what makes us human individuals. The ability to make and process decisions is one of the human race's greatest talents. These decisions should never be left up to someone sitting in an office in a distant location. When the government is making decisions that affect us that personally, do we still truly have freedom?  When censorship of television comes into question I believe that this is the reason we have ratings. These ratings warn people of the content included, whether graphic or not. With these in place, there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public. I believe that the same should be done for books. Books should be required to have an age-appropriate rating on them. If you are under the age required to purchase or check-out a book, then you will be rejected and not able to get the book. Ratings worked with television and movies, so why can they not work for books too?  In some cases, some media should be destroyed and hidden from the public. Media that show racism towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned. By doing so, I believe the only effects this will have on society are positive ones. Censoring these types of movies, books, etc. can save a lot of people hurt or embarrassment.  I believe that we should be allowed to choose which books, shows, or movies we read or watch. This includes all forms of media, excluding any media that provoke racism and hate against a group of people. The decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media. We as humans have the birth given right of making our own decisions. This right should never be taken away from us.
1096	4073	2	3	I do not believe that people should be given the right to do that. Just like Katherine Paterson had said, if people did away with everything that offended them, there would not be any books left for any of us. Everyone has the choice whether they either want to read the book, or they do not. If they do not want to, then they do not have to. Just because one person does not like something does not mean that everybody else cannot either.  Honestly, there are some people who take offense to everything, and if they do not like the book or whatever it may be, they do not have to read it. I find a lot of people to say things that offend me, but that does not mean that I have the right to make them stop talking.  However, I do agree that there should be certain standards set for some of the books out there. Some books are too graphic for young children to read, and I think that one should have to be a certain age to be able to read them. But, I do not think that just because they are graphic that they should be taken off the shelves.  Maybe the book gets a very delicate point across, like the book 'Speak', for example. In this book, a young girl is raped very harshly. But, the author did not write the book to tell everyone about her experience. She wrote the book to explain that no matter what happens, there is always something that can help. This book was a success story, and the graphic detail is there to show the agony the girl had went through. Some might find this offensive, but most think that it is uplifting to know that they are not the only ones who have had it happen to them.  Books are not the only things that might offend some people. In certain department stores, there may be a movie that has a line in it that I take offensively. Does that give me the right to take it off of the shelf and demand that it be banned? No, and why might that be? Because I have a choice if I want to watch it or not.  Another place is the internet. If you ask me, there are a lot more offensive things on the internet than there are in books. Kids can get on the internet and stumble across things that they definitely should not see, so does that mean we should ban the internet? No, because the internet helps in a lot of ways too. If I wanted to, I could find offense in everything that is in a library. Books based on religion, or maybe a website based on a musician that had references to drugs in their lyrics. I would be mad if I came to the library to listen to music and someone had removed them from the computer. Maybe I do not like what they're listening to, but that does not mean I can do anything about it.  So, my opinion is that books, or anything else for that matter, should not be banned because someone didn't like what it contained. Not everyone is going to like the same book, and that's why there is such a variety to choose from. Libraries should not be told which books they can and cannot lend out. After all, we are not forced to do anything. All of us are different and we like different things, but we should accept the tastes of others as well as our own.
1097	4074	2	3	Books, music, and movies are being taken off of shelves around the globe, because they are found offensive.  Books, movies, and music were created for a reason.  It's a form of entertainment as well as to build knowledge.  Artists, authors and publishers release their work to get information out and to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech.     Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive.  Censorship in libraries just hides certain things from society.  If all books on the @CAPS1 were banned and nobody could read them, nobody would be informed on the horrible event and it could easily be reincated.  The majority of movies and books have relevant information, portray events that could take, or have taken, place, and teach valuable lessons.     Artists and authors use their works to get points across to their audiences, whether it is a lesson or learning valubale or interesting information.  People shouldn't be allowed to just take things off of shelves like they are doing.  The material we read, music we listen to, and the movies we watch should be our decision to make.  It shouldn't be decided upon by others wanting to take it off of shelves.  If someone finds material offensive then they should take their own actions to benifit themselves such as, choosing not to expose themselves or their family to the material.  Banning things from the public takes away opprotunity for people to engage in things that interest them.     Some material could be banned for something as simple as one provocative word, sentence or even a thought.  The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4' had multiple occurances of cursing, but the book told a true story of an event that can happen to anyone.  It also indirectly included that families can be torn apart if you let them be, but the choice is yours and you can prevent it from happening.  Small things like such as language should not cause the material to be taken off of shelves where people who appreciate it cannot obtain it.     Katherine Paterson's quote is correct, if we can just take things off of shelves then there wouldn't be anything left for us.  Most materials contain something that someone isn't going to agree with, but if we just keep getting rid of things then what is the point in making new material.  There is always going to be the issue of finding offensive material, but nobody should have the right to ban it from everyone.     Materials around the globe are being taken off of shelves due to offensive material, but they were created for a reason.  Not only is it for entertainment,  but it is also for knowledge too.  Artists, authors, and publishers release their work to get information out to let others hear their voice, it is their freedom of speech.
1098	4075	2	3	"Did your child ever bring home a book? A piece of music, movie or magazine? Did you ever stop to think that the piece of information that your child was bringing home could be offensive to someone else? There are points in time where there isn't an answer to that question and you don't want to choose yes or no. The driving question is do you want to remove books, music, movies, and magazines from the shelf just because a parent thinks that it's not fit for a child to be reading. Katherine Paterson said, ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" The point in this quotation is that if you take a book off the shelf every time that someone doesn't think that it's right for children to see, then there will be no books left to see. In agreement with Katherine, parents want the best for their children, but there are reasons to why you should agree with the average parent and then there are reasons to why you shouldn't. There are books out amongst the world that only adults should see, and there are also books out there that are way too advanced to be read by children. These books are all made for a reason and have their own purpose on why they are put there. Parents have to sit back and think of their children and then think of the rest of the world; it's a big world and you can't just take things away from it. No matter how much you want to protect a child from the point of seeing the books that are meant for older age ranges, there isn't a way that you can stop it. I think that books are there for whatever reason they were written for. There is no reason that because one person doesn't agree with the way that someone has written that book, it should be taken off the shelf just for that child. Libraries can't just start taking books off the shelf for individual mothers that don't like this or don't like that. Many people come from many different areas and see things from different perspectives; they don't know the difference between right and wrong. It's a bigger world out there than you and me. When one person tries to stand against the world, they're going to get knocked down. So why fight when the world was meant to be at peace?"
1099	4076	2	3	I don't believe that censoring books and movies is necessary. Life is unpredictable, and people will come across various topics regardless. Instead of censorship, libraries can be organized with sections for adults, teenagers, and kids to make it easier for visitors to find appropriate material. Signs categorizing books, movies, and music can further guide individuals to the content they seek. Bright colors in the kids' section can attract their attention and keep them engaged. These strategies can make libraries more accessible and appealing, encouraging children to explore and develop an interest in reading. By implementing these ideas, libraries can cater to different age groups and ensure that everyone finds content suitable for them.
1100	4077	2	3	To remove or not to remove  Should people be able to remove books that are offensive? I think so; it would help our kids and young adults to read more educational books, rather than magazines and comics.  To start off, everyone has their own opinion of what is offensive, and what's not. Personally, I don't think that we should remove books because they're offensive; I think we should just not let that particular person put out any more books. But, as I said, everyone has their own opinion.  Secondly, it's entirely up to the library where to place certain books with blood and gore, and whether to have them or not. Personally, I like books with blood and gore because it shows how the world actually is. It's not like a book where you save the princess or damsel in distress.  Lastly, if parents are concerned about offensive books, don't let your kids get those kinds of books; give them a boring book instead. We know the books that kids are not supposed to read, but parents let kids read them.  In conclusion, if you feel that a book is offensive, don't pick it up, and don't have it taken off the shelf because there is always someone to disagree with you.
1101	4078	2	3	I do not believe that censorship in libraries is a good thing. For many reasons but to save sometime here are just a few of the reasons why I believe this, there would be no books left for anyone to read, if certain books where taken off the shelf we would not have the knowledge from them, and our kids would not know what other people can think of. At the end of this essay one might understand the advantages and disadvantages to censorship in libraries. Many books would be gone? If we all took off one book that we found offensive then our children and other children would not be able to read. Taking off one offensive book per person leaves no books left in a library. What one person may find offensive another person could find rather enjoyable. Some of my friends think that 'Catcher in the Rye' is an offensive novel but I found the book to be rather enjoyable. On the other hand we also have to understand that there are somethings that just shouldn't be put out in public. Would we get as much knowledge as we have? Without all the books that are in our libraries would people get the knowledge to make great discoveries in science, history, and electronics? People would be lost if we didn't have our books. The books give people great knowledge and a great place to learn how to do things. I myself have learned how to become a successful writer from the books I took out of 'A Writer's Guide for Dummies.' Would the ideas of other people be heard around the world without books in our libraries? Those books that are offensive can also be of great use when doing a research paper or just trying to find something to talk about with friends at school or work. Without the books that we have in the library people would not be able to understand what other people thought about certain ideas on politics and other issues in daily life. The books help people come up with ideas to create things and be creative in everything they do. The ideas that one person expresses in their writing is a great place to find a spark of imagination when a person needs something to keep their mind off of personal issues. Life without books? Censorship is a good and bad thing in libraries, I myself on one hand do not find it appropriate but on the other hand it can be taken to a whole different perspective. People who want to use it don't understand that other people could take the books off the shelf that they, themselves like to read in their spare time, nor do they understand all the knowledge that we gain from books even if they are fiction, and lastly without the books that we have no one would know what someone in a different part of the world was thinking. Foremost people who want censorship in libraries don't understand what would happen if we had the power to all take one book off the shelf. One could understand both sides of the coin here but we need to step back and think about what life would be like without our books.
1102	4079	2	3	There are many books, music, movies, and magazines in the world that may be deemed offensive by some individuals. However, just because one person finds something offensive does not mean it should be removed from the shelves. Everyone has different tastes and sensitivities, and it is impossible to please everyone. Instead of removing potentially offensive content, individuals can choose to not engage with it and focus on the entertainment that suits their preferences. Libraries should not cater to the demands of a few individuals at the expense of others who may enjoy the material in question. It is important to respect the diverse range of opinions and interests within society and provide a variety of options for everyone to enjoy. Ultimately, individuals should have the freedom to choose what they consume, while also respecting the choices of others.
1103	4080	2	3	Libraries have always been an outstanding source for information. Among the myriad of resourceful materials provided by libraries are book, movies, and magazines. Recently, the debate over whether libraries should censor offensive materials has caused quite a stir. Many parents argue that they don't want their children to be exposed to explicit materials, especially books, exhibited in public libraries. Others have retorted to this statement by saying that if every book that is viewed as offensive is taken off the shelves, the shelves would be nearly empty. Author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of  book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Katherine Paterson). Books that are offensive should not be removed from libraries for the simple reason that they are still one of the most reliable sources for information and historical events, and, without books, society would suffer.   The most important reason as to why people shouldn't be allowed to remove offensive books from shelves is that if every person was allowed to remove a book that he/she found offensive, there wouldn't be many books remaining on the libraries' shelves. There are many historical works that contain offensive images and content, but people have to overlook this because these books are accounts of our history. Without them, society would forget about the past events that shaped and molded our world into the world it is today.   Another important reason why library censorship is wrong is that material that one person may find to be offensive may not be offensive to another. Every person has his/her own view on certain matters and events. For this reason, the censorship of a certain book shouldn't come down to the opinion of one individual. Rather, the decision to take a certain book off of library shelves should come from the opinions of a large group of individuals. By doing so, a fair representation of diverse views can be maintained.   In conclusion, most books are meant to tell either fictional stories or historical events that aren't meant to offend anyone. Fictional books are meant to fill the mind of whoever reads them with tales and mental images of a story created by the author. Also, historical books are meant to capture the events of our past so that people can be able to look back on these events both now and in the future. In all, the idea of censoring libraries is a negative proposal. Books were meant to provide historical accounts and fictional stories to enrich the minds of readers, not poison them with bad content. Everyone has their own views, which is why people should learn to respect the views of different books no matter how offensive the material may be to them.
1104	4081	2	3	No, I do not believe that any book or form of literature should be removed from a library just because someone takes offense to it. People have different opinions and preferences, and just because something offends one person does not mean it should be censored for everyone else. It is important to respect the freedom of expression and allow diverse perspectives to be shared in libraries and bookstores. Instead of trying to ban certain materials, individuals can simply choose not to engage with them and focus on content that aligns with their values. Censorship limits access to information and restricts intellectual freedom, which is detrimental to a democratic society. It is essential to uphold the principles of free speech and protect the right to access a wide range of literary works.
1105	4082	2	3	Dear sir or mam, Have you or someone in your family ever read a book, magazine, or watched a movie that was taken to be offensive? Do you or that person think that it would make a difference if that one book, book or movie was removed from the shelves? Would removing every book, cd, movie or magazine from shelves that were to have a great or small amount of racism, violence, bad language and other inappropriate things be helping the community? Do you believe that its everyone's decision whether or not those things should be removed from the shelves?  I believe that a lot of people in our community have read a book in their lifetime that they considered to be the slightest bit offensive to them. I bet people all over the world have read offensive books. But the only types of people that those books, movies or magazines would affect would be teenagers and kids. But at the time they wouldn't see it as offensive, they would think that it was cool and interesting and they would want to read or watch it over and over again until they were to get bored of it then they would gone back the library and get another one.  I think in a way it would and would not make a difference whether or not they were removed from the shelves. Because if only that one book, movie or magazine was removed from the shelves then the person that got it removed would move on from that book, magazine or movie and find plenty more of them that would be more or equally offensive. If every people were to remove every book that they were to find offensive then other people who would enjoy them that certain thing wouldn't be able to obtain it. If everyone were to find all kinds different books, movies or magazines offensive and got them removed from the shelves then there wouldn't be very much left for the community.  In conclusion I believe that every individual has their opinion and own way of thinking when it comes to what is and is not offensive. I think it is not just up to them on what should be on the shelves in a library, but the communities choice. If someone wants a good book, magazine, or movie they should ask suggestions from a friend or family member on what they should get. If they can't get any suggestions on what they should get they should just what they think is interesting ignore the offensive parts.

In such cases, it is important to consider the audience and context in which the material is being presented. While it may be appropriate to remove offensive material from children's libraries or school libraries, the standards for what is considered offensive may differ in teenage or adult sections of a public library.  Censorship in libraries can be necessary to ensure that inappropriate or offensive material is not readily accessible to all audiences. However, it is also important to establish guidelines or rules to govern what can be considered offensive and warrant removal from library shelves. By having clear standards in place, it can help maintain a balance between protecting individuals from offensive material and preserving the diversity of literature available for readers.  In conclusion, while there may be instances where certain materials in libraries are deemed offensive and warrant removal, it is essential to establish guidelines or rules to govern such decisions. By doing so, it can help ensure that there is a level of censorship in place to protect audiences while still allowing for a variety of perspectives and viewpoints to be represented in library collections.
1107	4084	2	3	Today in our modern society, there is a growing concern about the inappropriate content that children and teens are exposed to through various forms of media. It is evident that there is a need for stricter censorship in libraries to ensure that young audiences are shielded from harmful materials.   With the rise of television shows like those on channels such as @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2, children are being exposed to violence, sexual content, alcohol, and drugs at a young age. These shows often portray behaviors and situations that are not suitable for impressionable minds. Similarly, books, magazines, and music also contain explicit content that may not be appropriate for young readers or listeners.   It is crucial for parents to be more vigilant in monitoring the media consumption of their children. Implementing warning labels on materials that require parental permission before access can help in filtering out inappropriate content. By taking an active role in guiding their children's choices, parents can protect them from exposure to harmful influences.  While it is important to acknowledge that not all media content is harmful, it is essential to regulate access to materials that may have a negative impact on young individuals. Parents must be proactive in setting boundaries and ensuring that their children are consuming age-appropriate content. By promoting responsible media consumption, we can create a safer and more nurturing environment for the younger generation.  In conclusion, the need for increased censorship in libraries and households is evident in today's society. It is imperative that we take proactive measures to safeguard the well-being of children and teens by restricting their exposure to inappropriate content. Through collective efforts, we can create a more wholesome and positive media landscape for the future generation.
1108	4085	2	3	I believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are offensive. Children shouldn't be exposed to books, movies, or other media that contain inappropriate content. These materials can have a negative impact on young minds and should be restricted in order to protect children from harmful influences. It is important for libraries to carefully curate their collections and ensure that they are safe and appropriate for all patrons, especially children. By removing offensive material, libraries can create a more positive and welcoming environment for everyone.
1109	4086	2	3	Parents are responsible for their child, whether it's taking them to school, making sure their grades are up or even watching what their child reads. Libraries should not remove 'offensive' books, magazines, movies, etc. That is the parents responsibility, not the library's. The library is a place where people can access a variety of materials for enjoyment or research. If libraries started removing materials deemed offensive by some, there would be very few books left on the shelves. It is up to parents to monitor what their children are reading and guide them towards appropriate content. Libraries should keep a wide range of materials available for all members of the community to enjoy. It is not the library's role to censor or restrict access to certain materials; that responsibility lies with the parents. By keeping a diverse collection of materials, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for everyone in the community.
1110	4087	2	3	Some people do not like the fact that there are books on the shelf that they consider offensive. People argue to get the corruptive books, magazines, movies off the shelves. The customers have the choice not to check out the material, it's not their place to try to get the object removed from the shelf.   People that go to the library have the choice to read the book or not, if they have heard bad reviews about the book then they can just ignore it. The books on the shelves in public libraries are there for a reason, and its not to be taken off just because some people dont care for it. Reasons might be that the book goes against beliefs of religion, or just the way those people view things, but that still does not give them the right to remove the book from the shelf.   Everybody has different likeings and tastes when it comes to books. Because a book is not up to one person's standards does not mean that it is not up to another person's. Beliefs and standards differ from person to person and that is why the likeing of books is different to most everybody.   Most people are worried about their children reading the books that they find offensive. If your child is looking for books to read and they pick out one of the books you dont want them reading then tell them that the book is innapropriate. The kid will most likely listen to you and put the book back, that is a much better technique than trying to get the book removed.   Removing a book from the shelf is completely unfair to the other people who visit the library. Everybody should have the right to read what they want and have the choice to ignore the books that they choose not to read. When looking for a book, magazine, movie, etc., and you run across one you find innapropriate then ignore it and continue with your day, it's as simple as that.
1111	4088	2	3	It was during English class that we visited the library to look at various books. One of which, that my teacher picked up, was 'The Angel in the House' by Coventry Patmore. The book had been written during the cult of domesticity and was filled with ideas of the submissiveness of women and their devotion to the home. I found that book to be very offensive just because I was looking at it from a modern perspective. Nowadays it would be considered sexist to assume that women should stay home and take care of the house while men work outside of the home. Just because it was a piece of literature that I didn't agree with, doesn't mean that it's not a valued work. Certain materials should not be removed from the libraries if found offensive.  There is such a wide variety of people who search through the library, so finding a certain piece of material that not one person finds offensive is nearly impossible. Materials shouldn't be allowed to be censored for that reason. Materials found in the library are a form of expression to the individual who created them or to the society as a whole. Censoring those works would be considered a violation to the freedom of expression.  People of all ages look through the library to find books or music or magazines. Each of those people has a different belief. What is considered a work of art to one person could be seen as highly offensive to another. If libraries were to start censoring their books, then the result would be a small selection of drab, emotionless materials. People visit the library to find materials that they are interested in, or look around to expand their interests. Libraries need to contain a wide variety of material to satisfy this knowledge.  A library's job is to educate the people who enter it. A good form of education is the exposure to different types of material.  Sometimes the offending nature of a novel is what makes it good. It gets the reader thinking about what the author's purpose was. 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain was seen as a very offensive work for a long period of time. It incorporated the issue of slavery when many people weren't ready to deal with it. As a result, that book was banned from libraries and schools. Now, it is seen as one of the most famous works in American literature. That example proves that material that's regarded as offensive, shouldn't automatically have its value lowered.  'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' as said by Katherine Paterson, is an accurate depiction of the outcome of a library with censorship on its materials. Part of what makes a good work great, is its ability to stir up controversy among its readers. Removing the controversy will remove an aspect of education along with it, which is essentially the main purpose of a library.
1112	4089	2	3	@CAPS4's argument that books, even if found offensive by some, should still be available in libraries is valid. People have the choice to not read books that they find offensive, rather than censoring them for everyone else. While music can be more persuasive and potentially harmful, books are a form of entertainment and should not be restricted based on individual sensitivities. It is important to respect differing opinions and allow for diverse content in libraries. Ultimately, the decision to engage with certain material should rest with the individual, not be imposed by external censorship.
1113	4090	2	3	I believe that if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offend you, people shouldn't have the right to remove that material from the shelves. If everyone had the power to censor offensive material, we would be left with nothing. It is important to teach children to stay away from adult sections in libraries if parents are concerned about inappropriate content. Additionally, while some individuals may not appreciate foul language, it can add depth and authenticity to a story. Censorship in libraries can limit people's access to information, hobbies, and education. It is crucial to find a balance between protecting children and preserving the freedom to access a variety of materials. In conclusion, censorship should not be allowed in libraries as it can have detrimental effects on individuals' rights and access to diverse content.
1114	4091	2	3	Removing certain books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media is a contentious issue. While some argue for the removal of offensive content, I believe that such censorship is not the solution. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and what offends one person may not offend another. Instead of banning materials, individuals can simply choose not to engage with content that they find objectionable.  Moreover, if we start removing items that some find offensive, where do we draw the line? We all have different perspectives and sensitivities, so censoring everything that could potentially offend someone would leave us with very little left to enjoy. Instead of banning, we should focus on providing appropriate guidance and restrictions. For example, children should be guided towards age-appropriate materials based on their knowledge and maturity levels.  Ultimately, we should respect each other's beliefs and choices. While I understand the arguments for censorship, I believe that keeping libraries and media accessible to all is crucial. Removing materials would only lead to more conflicts and debates over what should or should not be allowed. It is better to maintain a diverse range of content and let individuals make their own decisions about what they want to engage with. In conclusion, preserving freedom of expression and access to a variety of viewpoints is essential for a healthy and open society.
1115	4092	2	3	There have been instances where parents have prohibited their children from watching certain movies due to the graphics or content. However, restricting access to such movies often leads to children becoming more curious and finding ways to watch them illegally. When children are forbidden from watching a movie, they may sneak in or access it through the internet, which can result in trouble. It is important for parents to have open communication with their children about why certain movies are not suitable based on their beliefs and values. By discussing and reaching agreements with children, parents can foster trust and reduce the likelihood of children lying or going behind their backs to watch movies. Allowing children to watch uncensored movies may not necessarily be harmful, as they may come across the content elsewhere. It is essential to consider the implications of censorship and the impact it can have on children's behavior. In a world without censorship, individuals have the freedom to choose what they consume, and imposing restrictions may not always be effective. Ultimately, it is crucial for parents to engage in dialogue with their children and consider the implications of censorship on their relationship and communication.
1116	4093	2	3	"There are all kinds of different people in the world, including authors who write books with varying tones and messages. Some schools choose to censor certain books from their libraries, but I believe that all books should be available for students to read. Censoring books goes against the freedoms of press and speech that our country values.   One example is the book ""@CAPS1 @NUM1"", which is about a society that bans all books. Ironically, some schools have chosen to ban this book, missing the point of the story. High school students are mature enough to handle some offensive language or violent scenes, as they likely have already been exposed to such content in other forms of media or in their own lives.   Censoring books only serves to shelter students from reality, when in fact, reading about different experiences and viewpoints can help them grow and mature. We should have the right to access all books, just as authors have the right to write them. By allowing students to explore a variety of literature, we can better prepare them for the challenges they will face in the real world. Let's not limit our access to knowledge and diverse perspectives by censoring books."
1117	4094	2	3	Inappropriate magazines in the reach of children?!? '@CAPS1 just not right', says reporter @PERSON1, 'I think that magazines, books, and other profanities should be out of the reach of children and only discussed when chosen by an adult'. Libraries in the present day need to overseer children when they are looking in the library. If children see something that they want with no guardian then they shouldn't get it, its just that simple.   Although the books can seem inappropriate to some people they should not be taken off the shelves because older books help children learn about what happened in the earlier days, it teaches them some of the ways that we use now, and it shows real stories about people in modern day. For example some of the books about @ORGANIZATION1 connect some people as being to abrassive and mocking, but it just shows what happened long before there were laws for racism. The books about @NUM1 also come provacative to some people because they lost someone close during the bombing, the books teach the kids that not everyone is nice and cruel things happen to some good people.Books about peoples life are also in libraries talking about what happened to them as they were kids or how their parents died of cancer, the books teach the children that outcomes can turn out for the good or the bad.   Some entertainment is not intended for kids to see, for example, pornography and provacative language. Pornography is thought to be an entertainment for adults, but many times it is just something that can scare kids at young ages if they do not know what is really happening. Also, provacative language in a book or on a cd is not something that kids should be listening to. However, they need to learn that if they hear those words they need to know not to say them so they don't get into trouble by their parents.   Books of history are thought to be helpful when children are growing up. Most of the time that is correct, about @PERCENT1 of the children take in the information and use it to help them. However, there is @PERCENT2 of children out there that will just think of the information that they are being told as good things. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't just wake up one day and say im going to bomb the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. His devious plans and clever mastermining took alot of time to plan out.   People @MONTH1 object to children learning some things about history, but i think it is needed for every child to understand. Everyone needs to know about the ups and downs about their country and the others surrounding them. Children @MONTH1 not understand right now what is wrong with the economy, but they will soon learn when they are adults why people complain so much. Books about this stuff @MONTH1 come offensive to some people, but down the road books are used for many things, we still learn about people from hundreds of years ago.   Children will soon learn of the harsh conditions and the reason why things happen. Without the books and the videos the future will never know what happened. Many young people @MONTH1 change words in books, but the books will always still have what really happened. @CAPS1 why i think that the libraries should keep the books on the shelves, just out of reach of the children. Libraries play a crucial role in providing access to diverse information and knowledge, shaping the understanding and perspective of children as they grow and learn from the past.
1118	4095	2	3	Reading is essential for children in today's society, and libraries should have the freedom to offer a wide range of materials for students to explore and learn from. While certain offensive materials targeting specific races, religions, or genders should be excluded, the majority of books, movies, music, and magazines should be accessible in libraries. Personal offense should not dictate what is available in a library, as there will always be someone who finds something offensive. However, materials like pornographic movies should be restricted from library shelves. Music, with its diverse genres, should be available in libraries for those who cannot afford to purchase it. Magazines promoting unhealthy body image or inappropriate behavior should be omitted, while those that foster learning and positive messages should be welcomed. Overall, libraries should provide a variety of materials for individuals to enjoy and learn from, ensuring that all patrons have the opportunity to find what they are seeking.
1119	4096	2	3	@CAPS1, @CAPS1 is what made this country into what it is today. The ability to express oneself through writing, acting, and art has played a significant role in shaping our society. People have different views and ways of expressing themselves, which is evident in various experiences encountered in different parts of the country.   For instance, incidents in libraries have shown the diversity of opinions regarding what is acceptable in modern times. In one scenario, a couple disagreed over a magazine cover they deemed derogatory towards women. In another instance, a debate arose over an old painting depicting a woman with exposed chest. While some argued for its removal due to its content, others defended its historical significance and longevity in the library.   These situations highlight the need for a balanced approach in addressing controversial content. While advertisements often use provocative images to attract attention, there should be transparency in labeling such material. Implementing a rating system for magazines could help consumers make informed choices about the content they engage with. However, when it comes to longstanding cultural artifacts like paintings, consideration should be given to their historical context and community acceptance.   In conclusion, the debate over what is deemed acceptable in art and media is ongoing. It is essential to find a middle ground that respects artistic expression while also considering societal values and sensitivities. By promoting open dialogue and understanding, we can navigate the complexities of modern expression and uphold the principles of freedom of speech and creativity.
1120	4097	2	3	@PERSON1 emphasizes the importance of sharing and not always getting what we want immediately. They suggest that popular items should be stocked adequately to cater to everyone's needs. While acknowledging that not everyone shares willingly, they argue that sharing is better than wasting money on something someone else already has. @PERSON1 also highlights the value of individual opinions and preferences, stating a preference for music over reading at the moment. They believe that books, music, and other forms of entertainment should not be removed from shelves based on individual opinions. Ultimately, @PERSON1 urges respect for differing viewpoints and stresses the importance of enjoying life in the present moment, even if it means disagreeing with others.
1121	4098	2	3	I am writing this essay to persuade the members of our local library to use better censorship when putting unfit material on the shelves for the members of our community to use. In this essay, I will reflect my views on this subject, backed by true facts that I have learned from many past experiences.  I believe that there is a large amount of reading material in the children's section shelves of our libraries that is far too advanced for many young children to understand. Upon reviewing many books in the children's section of various libraries, I noticed that much of the material making up this section is either too advanced or too profound for children to absorb. Young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagination more and not let their heads be filled with thoughts of war and disaster. The children of today need to have more suitable material offered to them that they can understand, rather than material they cannot comprehend. Let's put more appropriate books on the shelves of our library and stop wasting money on unfit books.  In reaching the conclusion of this article, I hope that I have persuaded the readers to understand the point I am trying to make. I hope my readers take the information I have given and put it to work. Let's work together to ensure that our libraries provide suitable reading material for children in our community.
1122	4099	2	3	Libraries are community centers that provide a wide range of books for people of all ages to explore new experiences and gain information. Censoring books in libraries can limit individuals from accessing diverse perspectives and knowledge. While some may find certain content offensive, it is important to consider the impact of removing books on the overall community. By allowing a variety of books to be available, libraries support intellectual freedom and encourage individuals to think critically about different ideas and viewpoints. Additionally, censorship in libraries could have broader implications on other forms of media, such as movies and music, potentially affecting the creative freedom of artists and entertainment industry professionals. It is essential for libraries to uphold their role as providers of diverse and inclusive resources, respecting the rights of authors and the interests of their patrons.
1123	4100	2	3	Raded @CAPS1 for @CAPS2, violence, and some nudity. This kind of movie shouldn't be on any shelf. It is too inappropriate for kids to see or even read what the movie case says. There shouldn't be any movie or magazine with nude pictures. It's harmful for kids to see or hear because they might imitate what they see and get into trouble. It's not right to see others naked. The only person I want to see that way is my wife in the future. I don't want to watch a movie and see a lady nude.  Next is violence. I wish guns and bombs weren't invented because I've lost friends and family due to them. People are influenced by movies, books, and magazines to obtain guns and bombs, leading to more violence. Children get in trouble at school for using violent language they learned from movies, where actors use such words. Kids imitate their favorite actors on and off-screen.  In conclusion, everything with violence should be removed from shelves. It has a negative impact on society, especially on children who are easily influenced by what they see in movies and media. It is crucial to protect the young generation from harmful content and promote a safer environment for everyone.
1124	4101	2	3	Throughout history, there have been many books written at a time when their beliefs differed from those of our world today. Views on slavery, women's rights, religion, and other topics have evolved as our society has changed. While some may find certain books offensive, this does not justify banning them from society as a whole. People have the right to ban books for themselves, but it is up to each individual to decide whether or not something should be banned for everyone.  Freedom of speech is a fundamental right in our society, allowing individuals to express their opinions without fear of punishment. While some may speak out against the majority opinion, they have the right to do so without censorship. This means that people cannot ban something simply because it goes against their beliefs.  Public libraries may set age restrictions on items based on content, but they should not have the authority to ban books. Parents should be able to decide what is appropriate for their children to read, and as long as they approve, children should have access to a wide range of materials. Banning books because they are considered offensive would leave libraries with very few options, as almost any book can be found offensive by someone.  Books that are considered offensive can provide valuable insights into past societies and help us learn from historical mistakes. By understanding the views and attitudes of the past, we can better navigate the present and future. Authors and artists have the right to freedom of speech, and libraries should not infringe upon this right by banning their work. It is important to preserve a diverse range of materials in libraries to promote understanding and learning.
1125	4102	2	3	I believe that children today should have the opportunity to learn the same things that previous generations did, without censorship or alterations to historical truths. It is important for children to learn from the past, including the good and the bad, in order to have a complete understanding of history. Censoring books, movies, or other educational materials only serves to limit a child's knowledge and understanding of the world. As a parent, I would want my children to have access to all aspects of history, even if it means confronting difficult or uncomfortable topics. Education should be about learning the truth, not shielding children from reality. Let's preserve the integrity of education by allowing children to learn from the unaltered past.
1126	4103	2	3	Libraries are essential for advancing knowledge and providing entertainment for people of all ages. While some may argue that libraries should not contain offensive materials, it is important to remember that libraries serve a diverse population with varying interests and needs. Censoring materials based on potential offensiveness can hinder access to valuable information and limit the opportunities for learning and growth.  Instead of removing offensive materials from libraries, they can be organized into sections based on topics to allow individuals to make informed choices about what they want to read or view. By providing access to a wide range of materials, libraries can help individuals gain a better understanding of the world around them and learn how to navigate complex and challenging issues.  Furthermore, libraries play a crucial role in preserving and sharing diverse perspectives and experiences. By offering a variety of books, magazines, movies, and other materials, libraries can help individuals explore different viewpoints and gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of the world. Censoring materials based on potential offensiveness would limit the ability of individuals to engage with new ideas and perspectives.  In conclusion, libraries should not monitor what materials are put on the shelf based on potential offensiveness. Instead, they should continue to provide access to a wide range of materials to support learning, growth, and exploration. By offering a diverse collection of materials, libraries can empower individuals to expand their knowledge, challenge their assumptions, and develop a deeper understanding of the world around them.
1127	4104	2	3	There are thousands of books in libraries nowadays, some from years ago. Books are meant to interest people of all ages, and everyone should have the freedom to choose what they want to read. Authors and publishers should not be penalized for their hard work.   Censorship in books should not result in their removal from shelves. People have varied interests, and censorship in a book does not necessarily mean it will be disliked by readers. For example, those who enjoy romance novels may find censorship within the story, but that doesn't deter them from reading.   It is important not to deprive adults and young adults of the opportunity to explore different topics through literature. Censorship can add depth to a story and even inspire readers to help others based on real-life situations depicted in the book. Removing censored books from libraries would limit the reading options for many individuals.   Allowing authors to freely express themselves through their work benefits both the creators and the readers. Young adults should be able to access a wide range of literature to broaden their horizons and explore different perspectives. Censorship should not stand in the way of individuals enjoying and learning from diverse stories.
1128	4105	2	3	Censorship has been a long-standing issue, with restrictions on what we can see, read, and hear. While some level of censorship may be necessary, it can sometimes go too far, especially when it comes to limiting what high school students can access.   High school is a time when students are expected to mature and handle more mature content. It seems hypocritical to allow certain information in science books but restrict it in literature. Students should be trusted to handle a few bad words in a book without it causing a big uproar.   While extreme content like pornography should be censored, a few bad words in music or movies shouldn't prevent students from enjoying them. Censorship should only go as far as necessary to protect the lighthearted, but not to the extent where it limits access to valuable cultural and educational materials. People should have the freedom to choose what they read or watch, and simply avoid content they find objectionable.   In conclusion, censorship is important to a certain extent, but it should not hinder the access to valuable content for high school students. Let the lighthearted individuals make their own choices, and trust them to handle a few bad words or mature themes in media.
1129	4106	2	3	Books, music, and movies play a significant role in our lives, offering meaning and purpose in our spare time. These forms of media keep us occupied and entertained, providing us with a source of relaxation and enjoyment. At the library, individuals can immerse themselves in reading, listening to music, or watching movies without distractions. However, it is essential to be mindful of the content within these materials, as they come in various genres catering to different age groups.  Each genre serves a specific audience, from children to adults, and it is crucial to select appropriate material based on age and content. Children's books are tailored to their age group, filled with colorful illustrations and engaging stories. On the other hand, adult literature may contain more complex themes and language unsuitable for younger readers. By categorizing media based on genre and age appropriateness, libraries can ensure that individuals have access to content that aligns with their preferences and maturity level.  It is essential to have separate sections for media with explicit or uncensored content to prevent any inadvertent exposure, especially for children. By organizing books, music, and movies into distinct categories, libraries can maintain a safe and conducive environment for all patrons. Additionally, leaving materials on the shelves allows individuals to make informed choices about what they read, watch, or listen to, based on their personal preferences and interests.  In conclusion, the categorization of media based on genre and age appropriateness is crucial in maintaining a harmonious and inclusive library environment. By respecting the diverse needs and preferences of patrons, libraries can ensure that everyone can enjoy their chosen form of entertainment without encountering inappropriate content.
1130	4107	2	3	The libraries have to worry about enough as it is with people not returning books and other materials. They should not have to remove items just because some individuals find them offensive. It is important to remember that not everyone will be offended by the same things, and it is not fair to restrict access to materials based on the opinions of a few. People have the choice to not borrow items that they find offensive, and there are always alternative libraries to visit. It is essential to respect the freedom of expression of authors and creators, even if their work may be controversial to some. Overall, it is crucial to maintain the diversity of materials available in libraries and not remove items simply because they may be deemed offensive by a minority of individuals.
1131	4108	2	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     @CAPS1 I was growing up in my small little neighborhood, life could not have been more simple.  For children, life is eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing.  Their innocent minds do not ponder the meanings of life or of love, but curiosity does grab every child now and then.  With a stubborn persistance, a child would probably go to the ends of the earth to understand what confidential information they overheard their parents talking about.  But @CAPS1 does harmless curiosity mean the destruction of a child's innocence?  By viewing adult-oriented material, such as books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be harmful to their development.  However, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spend countless hours writing that book,  that book represents a portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @MONTH1 find the contents inappropriate.     Authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them, and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is unjust.  A censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice.  Thus, an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work.  Not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society.  Books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author intended.     Every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a portion of history of the human race.  Even fictional novels serve as monuments to the depths of man's imagination.  Therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material is.  Just as remembering the @CAPS2 has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes, keeping books of the most horrible content @MONTH1 save authors from repeating such dishonorable content.  In other words, if censorship removes the 'mistakes' of literature from library shelves, who is to say that an oblivious author will not repeat that 'mistake'.  By remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature.  @CAPS1 books are not 'mistakes', they serve as reminders of the high-points in literature.  All literature, appropriate and inappropriate, is a piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret.     Finally, who is to judge what is a 'mistake' in literature?  A book on @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be inappropriate in the eyes of a @CAPS4, but that book @MONTH1 be sacred to a @CAPS5.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Furthermore, for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message.  A library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person.  If one is offended by a literary work, perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests.  The decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government or library or activist group.     Censorship of material in libraries would strip authors of their chance to let their works be seen by others, keep records of the human race secret, and take away the privelage of the reader to decide what is appropriate.  Authors endure long hours of practice and writing in order to have their thoughts read, and such a motive should not be taken away from them.  Every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes.  And these 'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself.  Instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult-only section to house the 'controversial' books; as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent. -@ORGANIZATION2  Expanding on the idea that books serve as reminders of historical mistakes, censorship can hinder society's progress by suppressing valuable lessons from past literature. In essence, allowing unrestricted access to literature, even if deemed controversial, ensures a more informed and enlightened community. Letting individuals make their own choices regarding what they read promotes intellectual freedom and personal growth. In conclusion, the preservation of diverse literary works is essential for fostering a society that values creativity, critical thinking, and the exchange of ideas.
1132	4109	2	3	There are many different perspectives on censorship in our country. Different people have varying opinions on what should be censored, especially when it comes to materials in libraries that some may find offensive. While the intention is not to expose young children to inappropriate content, sometimes these materials end up in their hands. However, removing all offensive material from libraries would leave shelves empty and deprive adults of valuable knowledge and entertainment.  It is important to label all materials appropriately so that individuals can make informed decisions about what they consume. While some content may not be suitable for children, it does not mean it should be completely removed. Parents can monitor what their children access and make decisions based on what they find appropriate.  Instead of censoring all offensive material, libraries can explore alternative solutions such as keeping children's books in a separate area or implementing stricter guidelines for accessing certain materials. By finding a balance between protecting children and preserving access to information, libraries can continue to serve the public effectively without resorting to censorship. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides, but it is possible to find solutions that benefit everyone without compromising individuals' rights to access diverse content.
1133	4110	2	3	@STATE1 @NUM1, @PERSON1, IN @CAPS1 Katherine Paterson,  I read your article in the newspaper yesterday about offensive books in the library. I agree with you on this article. Some of the books, music, movies, or magazines in public libraries are very offensive to me but they can be normal to other people. There can also be some books that are normal to me and can be offensive to other people. Everyone has their own views and ideas on everything. The people of @LOCATION1 have freedom of speech so it is true that every mouth has got something different to say.  There are some books or movies that children cannot read or watch but children still do because once the child is in the library he can read, watch, or listen to anything. You cannot depend on the librarian because there are other people in the library too. The librarian probably has other things to do like arranging the books or checking out the books or making a library card or helping someone find a book.  In my point of view, the library should have different sections for different kinds of movies, books, or magazines, and there should be a person assigned for every section. This way, children would not be able to go to older people's sections. If there are books that are found offensive by everyone, then people should write a letter to the president to help remove those books from the library.  Yours @NUM2.
1134	4111	2	3	Have you ever been in a situation where you couldn't read a book because someone else had bitter feelings towards it? Are you frustrated when you finally get a chance to read a book you've been waiting for, only to find it unavailable due to its content? This is a common occurrence at libraries, where books are sometimes removed because of complaints from a single individual. However, censorship of books can lead to the loss of important historical and cultural material. While some content may be offensive to certain individuals, it is essential for understanding the context and message of the work. Authors, filmmakers, and artists often draw on history to create meaningful and impactful pieces of art, and censoring these works can diminish their value. It is important to strike a balance between protecting sensitive audiences and preserving the integrity of artistic expression. Censorship should be reserved for content that is gratuitously offensive and lacks any redeeming value. By being mindful of the need for diverse perspectives and open dialogue, we can ensure that important works of literature and art remain accessible to all. Let us strive to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and resist the urge to censor materials based on individual preferences.
1135	4112	2	3	I think that it is should be left alone the way it is because it put that way for a reason. They might not know the reason so thats why i think it should because the person might get mad if you mess it up just cause you dont like it the way it is because it is offensive to some people. Other reasons is because people are gonna home and watch it online or on tv so how is it gonna make a difference. It is not goiing to make one difference at all.
1136	4113	2	3	No, I believe all materials should be on the shelves at libraries. Because some people like stuff other people may find offensive. But you as parents should control what your kids are reading. If you find it offensive, tell them to pick out a new book, movie, or magazine. Some people like things from other cultures or religions, and it's important to have a variety of perspectives available. By creating separate sections for adult content and implementing age restrictions, libraries can cater to different preferences while still ensuring appropriate access for all readers. It's essential to embrace diversity and respect individual interests, even if they differ from our own. Ultimately, the freedom to choose what to read or watch should be preserved, with parents playing a key role in guiding their children's selections.
1137	4114	2	3	Everyone in the world has different opinions when it comes to censorship, especially in libraries. Some believe that inappropriate material should be kept away from children, while others argue that teens should have the freedom to access such content. Parents often play a role in deciding what their children can read, but some believe that kids should be able to choose their own books. Ultimately, the debate on censorship in libraries is ongoing, with varying perspectives on what is appropriate for different age groups. In the end, everyone has their own views on the matter, making it a complex issue to navigate.
1138	4115	2	3	"Offensive books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media should not be allowed on library shelves as they can incite violence and crime among individuals, especially youth. For instance, a CD labeled as a ""Black man's only CD"" could spark conflict when a white individual picks it up, leading to potential altercations. Such instances can lead to unnecessary tension and aggression, ultimately contributing to a hostile environment. Therefore, it is essential to monitor and regulate the content available in libraries to promote a safe and harmonious community."
1139	4116	2	3	What should and shouldn't be censored in a library really is just a matter of opinion from the people using the library. If everyone were to remove what they didn't like from the shelves of a library, then much information would be less accessible to the general public. Although some people may be offended by certain forms of literature, this doesn't mean that the literature should be removed for everyone. A solution must be made to satisfy everyone.  Currently, some individuals are unhappy with certain books, music, movies, and magazines available at libraries. They believe that the information may be unsuitable for some viewers, especially children. While this is a valid reason to consider censorship, others disagree with restricting access to library materials, as it would limit information available to the public.  One proposed solution is to have parents fill out a form before allowing their children to get a library card. This form would list specific content they wish to prevent their children from accessing, such as explicit language, nudity, or violence. This information would be linked to the library card, and if a child tries to check out restricted material, the librarian would intervene.  Censorship can be important, but it should not limit access to information. Finding a balance between protecting sensitive viewers and preserving intellectual freedom is crucial. A tailored approach, like the one proposed, could help address concerns while maintaining a diverse and inclusive library collection. It is essential to explore solutions that accommodate various viewpoints and ensure that everyone can benefit from the resources available in a library.
1140	4117	2	3	In the library, it is essential to ensure that literature materials are age-appropriate for younger readers. This includes movies, magazines, and books that may contain content unsuitable for children and teens. Dividing the library into sections for adults, teens, and children helps in maintaining a safe and suitable environment for all visitors. Bright and colorful displays in the children's section attract young readers and keep them engaged with appropriate materials.  It is important to carefully curate the collection in each section to prevent younger readers from encountering inappropriate content. Movies, TV shows, and books that depict drug use, violence, or sexual content can have a negative influence on children and teens. By reorganizing and monitoring the library's collection, the risk of accidental exposure to unsuitable material can be minimized.  In conclusion, libraries play a crucial role in providing access to educational and entertaining materials for all age groups. By ensuring that the content is age-appropriate and suitable for each section, libraries can create a positive and enriching environment for all visitors.
1141	4118	2	3	There are many books out there that contain obscene or vulgar content, which may not be suitable for children to read. However, this does not mean that these books should be banned from library shelves. Authors carefully choose every word they write for a reason, whether it be to evoke certain emotions or to convey a particular message. While it is important to consider the age appropriateness of certain books, that does not justify removing them entirely.  Libraries often have sections designated for children, teens, and adults, which helps to differentiate the content and ensure that age-appropriate material is readily available. By implementing such systems, both sides of the debate can be satisfied without resorting to censorship. Banning books with offensive material could potentially lead to the removal of classic and award-winning titles, which would be a disservice to literature as a whole.  While it is important to be mindful of what children are exposed to, there are better ways to regulate access to certain books without outright banning them. No book should be censored solely based on its content. By creating age restrictions and organizing books by genre and intended audience, libraries can effectively manage the availability of potentially sensitive material. In conclusion, it is possible to address concerns about offensive material in books without resorting to censorship, ensuring that a diverse range of literature remains accessible to readers of all ages.
1142	4119	2	3	I feel that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves just because someone finds them offensive. They only become offensive when people think they are. No one is forcing anyone to consume content they don't want to. Everyone has the choice to decide what they want to read or watch. What one person may find offensive, another may find interesting and exciting. It is important to respect everyone's right to access a variety of materials, even if individual preferences differ. There are a wide range of options available in libraries and stores, catering to diverse tastes and interests. Therefore, nothing should be taken off shelves simply because someone finds it offensive. It is essential to uphold the freedom of choice and diversity of content in our society.
1143	4120	2	3	I believe that there are many books in a library that should not be available to everybody that goes into a public library. Yes, there are some very offensive items in a library, such as a book about racism towards African Americans. No, that person who takes offense to those items does not have to be around them or even go into the library at all. The library is open to anyone and everyone.  Let's suppose you have a young child, and you take him/her to the public library with you. As you're looking for a book, the child reaches for the highest book that he/she can reach, pulls it off the shelf, and it lands on the floor open. You look down to see what happened and you see the book lying there with an inappropriate picture right in front of your child. That's your own fault, not the library's.  Although many times it's not the library's fault where certain books are placed, you should be more responsible and check out the area in which you are looking. I think there should be a select area for which the 'inappropriate material' should be kept. For a person to access the select area, they must show a membership type of identification and sign a waiver stating that the material they have checked out will cause no trouble or offense to anybody in their vicinity.  In conclusion, creating a separate section for potentially offensive material in libraries can help ensure that individuals are not inadvertently exposed to content that they may find inappropriate. This approach allows for freedom of access while also respecting the diverse sensitivities of library patrons.
1144	4121	2	3	Books should not be taken off the shelves just because they may offend someone. Libraries are meant to be inclusive spaces where individuals can access a wide range of information that aligns with their interests and preferences. Removing material that may offend some individuals could limit the learning opportunities for others. It is important to recognize that everyone has different tastes and perspectives, and what may be offensive to one person may not be to another. By maintaining a diverse collection of materials, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for individuals seeking knowledge and information. In the end, the primary purpose of libraries is to provide access to information for all, regardless of individual preferences or sensitivities.
1145	4122	2	3	Should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think that certain materials should be removed for many reasons. Many different people have many different thoughts on what's offensive and what isn't. Some people will find something funny that others may find nasty or inappropriate. If things deemed offensive were removed from shelves, there wouldn't be much left for people to choose from. Everyone has their own opinion, and while certain materials may not be suitable for young audiences, it should be up to the parents to regulate what their children are exposed to. Removing materials based on one person's opinion would limit the diversity of content available to the public. It's important to respect individual differences and allow people the freedom to make their own choices about what they consume.
1146	4123	2	3	I firmly believe that the removing of books, music, movies, etc., from a shelf just because someone finds it offensive will not solve the problem. A person can find many things in life offensive to their personal views, but they cannot just remove them. To remove books, music, movies, etc., from people who do not find them offensive could provoke chaos.  As Katherine Paterson stated 'And then we have no books left.' If everyone were to choose books, music, movies, etc., they felt were offensive and should not be placed in the library, the statement would probably be true. Besides the point, the library is sectioned off into different genres, so if you have a different view of a certain genre of books, movies, music, etc., skip over that section and go to the genre in which you prefer.  In other words, the things that offend one person may not offend another person. So to remove one particular thing would be unreasonable for the person who likes or finds interest in a particular subject. So instead of there being a problem with one person, there would be a problem with two unsatisfied people. Not saying that it is right, but the library has done particular things such as, separating the books for reasons like this.  According to Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' The library has a section for children only. Therefore, worries of problems like this have already been solved. The books, music, movies, etc., in the children's section are age-appropriate for a child. Books, music, movies, etc., are also sectioned off for teenagers and adults.  In conclusion, the removal of books, music, movies, etc., that are found offensive by others may not be found offensive by someone else. It is not like the library would purposely offend anyone by having the books, music, movies, etc., on the shelves. If you are mature enough to understand that and overlook something that may offend you, you would not be so offended. Also, if the library is sectioned off into different genres, you can easily bypass a particular genre you wish to avoid. Problems can be easily solved if they are dealt with in the correct manner.
1147	4124	2	3	I don't believe books with bad words should be removed from libraries altogether. What if that's all someone enjoys reading? Instead, books could be organized into different sections to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content. Librarians could create sections for kids, teenagers, and adults, and implement age restrictions for checking out certain books. There are many ways to categorize books without completely removing them, as a book with some bad words doesn't necessarily make it a bad book.
1148	4125	2	3	Keep it on the Shelf! What types of things do you go to the library for? Some go for books and others go just to relax in a quiet environment. Yes, the library is mostly used for books and studying, but there are many other things that libraries contain. Movies, magazines, music, etc., are all found in a library. Now, say you had to listen to a specific song, read a certain book, or review an article in a certain magazine, and you can't find it at the library because they have been removed because they are found to be offensive. All people have different views on what is and isn't offensive. Everything like books, music, magazines, and movies should all have their place in a library, regardless of the material.  Books can be used for many things. Some read just for the enjoyment and others read because it is assigned to them or they need to research some things. Books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately. What if you can't find that book because someone said that its material is inappropriate? What are you supposed to do about your research paper now? If a book is needed it should be able to be found on the shelf in a library and not be taken out because of the content of its pages.  Music is a great way to clear your mind and relax. Some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people. What if the only place you can find your favorite music is at your public library? You walk in and they no longer have it because it is considered to be offensive. Now you can no longer listen to the sounds that calm you down or motivate you to get your day started. Music should remain in libraries because of the cultural and educational sounds that most cannot find at their local music store.  Magazines are another great form of reading material found in a library. Magazines are a great way to stay up to date with the latest fashions and great dessert recipes. Without magazines our world wouldn't be able to keep up with the things that advance in our world every day. Magazines show us the hottest trends, the gossip in the celebrity world, and some great facts from educational magazines. Without the magazines in the library we probably wouldn't know anything about our advancing world.  You can find movies anywhere, but some believe that you can only find the really good and old movies at the library. The library has educational movies for children that may not be available anywhere else. They also have old classic movies that aren't even around anymore. The library has many movies that you wouldn't be able to find in our advanced world today.  Libraries hold a lot of important books, movies, music, and magazines. Without most of that, regardless of the material, we probably wouldn't know as much as we know today. The library has always been a place where you go to find exactly what you want and you know that they will have it. Removing these things from the shelves can be taking some history right out of our lives. All of these resources should stay on the shelves regardless of their material.
1149	4126	2	3	Can literature, which is the basis of civilization, be censored? Can you take these ideas away from those who wish to think them? I think not, for it would be a futile endeavor to even attempt. To keep something as important as written word away from the culture of the people, would be one of the highest crimes against humanity and could not rightly be condoned, in my mind. Not only would this attempt be a futile (for the people know ways to extract information) it would be downright idiotic of the 'administration' to do so. I will concede that there are explicit materials out there that are not suitable for children or even adolescents, but that is where the parent should step in by setting guidelines and positive examples which their children feel the need to follow. Not feel that they 'have' to, but feel that they 'need' to. If parents cannot take control and decide what is appropriate for their children, then in my mind, they are not doing their first and foremost job as a parent that is to protect the child. Some may say that the censorship of culture is protecting the children, but I say that this is not so. I believe censorship is a lousy excuse so that parents and upper government officials have to do less work. If every piece of written, filmed, or recorded work, that was offensve only one person, was thrown out on that basis, there would be none. There has never been a piece of literature, film, or music that has not offended someone in some way, whether it be spiritually, ethnically, or morally. The fact is that people cannot exist without strife and misery, and whatever people can do to cause that strife and misery, they will. People find all sorts of ways to do it, whether it be war, discrimination, media, or just downright obstinance, they will find a way to offend their selected party. I personally am appalled at the aspect of censorship, for if a person cannot speak his mind, then is he more than a mindless homunculi? Created and controlled by the government surrounding him. Made their slave through ignorance. If in a society I cannot say what I need to say then I do not wish to live in that society, for it is nothing but a horrible image of civilization. In short I do not believe that libraries should be censored, rather that parents should pay more attention to their children and dependents. If a person is offended by a certain thing, then it is their absolute right to not take part in whatever it may be, but these afflicted peoples have absolutely NO right to say what I may or may not read! If this offends anyone, then I apologize, but at least you knew enough (through your education by media) to be offended and not just another mindless sheep.
1150	4127	2	3	In my opinion, offensive materials should be taken off of the shelves. Factors such as age, beliefs, and awareness of potentially offensive content all play a role in determining what is deemed inappropriate. It is crucial to protect younger individuals from harmful content and to respect different races and cultures by removing any offensive material. Additionally, labeling offensive content can help individuals make informed choices. Overall, removing offensive materials from circulation is essential to creating a more respectful and inclusive society.
1151	4128	2	3	Have you ever came across offensive material inside a library? Well some people have and they think there should be some type of censorship in libraries to protect the offended people. I do not agree with this idea because people should have the right to express their self through art, literature, and even music. After all the freedom of speech is written in our rights.  Many authors, artists, and musicians have the freedom to express themselves through their work. If they saw their own work in a library being censored it would be very offensive to them. I understand that the artist's material could be offensive to certain people but it is their work, a form of self-expression. They do not publish their work to offend people, they do it for themselves and for other people to enjoy it. An artist's work is a part of who they are. A censor would just put a negative aspect to the art and literature of the library.  Over many years most libraries have developed and arranged their media into a system called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. This system separates all books, magazines, music, and movies into their own genres. For instance, if you are looking for a mystery book, you would find it in the non-fiction section. This system helps people find exactly what they are looking for. If people are offended by a certain genre they do not have to come in contact with it. This system is a better way to find exactly what you want instead of coming across a book or movie that you would find offensive. Almost every library uses this system so they do not have to use a censor.  Everywhere we go someone somewhere is going to find something offensive. It is basically part of our human nature. It is truly impossible to make every single person happy with everything in the world. In a library, there will always be a book that someone disagrees with or someone will find it offensive. The author of that book and other people who enjoyed it do not need to be punished by having the book taken off the shelves. Just because the book offends one person does not mean it has to be taken off the shelf or have a censor. If every time that happened there would be no books left to read in our libraries. Most people would not even call that a library.  In the end, a book is a book, music is music and we are not going to create censors or take books off the shelves because it is offensive to people. Authors write what they want to write, musicians play what they want to play, and actors act how they want to act. After everything, it does not matter what is offensive to people, they will just have to deal with it. There is no reason for a censor in a library.
1152	4129	2	3	'Everyone has their own preferences and dislikes. It is true that everyone has their own unique tastes, especially when it comes to books. For example, I personally do not enjoy reading books about illegal substances, but I do not believe in censoring materials that some may find offensive. While some may find certain content disturbing, it does not mean that everyone shares the same sentiment.  In a recent school project, a classmate chose a book about illegal drugs for a presentation. While I found the topic uncomfortable, others found it intriguing. It just goes to show that what may be off-putting to one person can be fascinating to another.  Similarly, when doing research on the human body systems, my friend was disturbed by graphic images of blood, while I found them fascinating. We each have our own unique reactions to different materials, and that is perfectly normal.  It is important for people to acknowledge and respect that everyone has their own opinions and preferences. Instead of trying to censor or remove materials that some may find offensive, it is better to simply seek out alternative resources that align with individual interests. By recognizing and accepting our differences, we can coexist harmoniously in a diverse society.'
1153	4130	2	3	I believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand. You shouldn't have to deal with it. If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpful place. Who would want to sit back and watch a racist movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develop a lot of problems. Music can be straight offensive.  If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is racist, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an effect on you. You may not realize that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a different race. If a person isn't racist and they see something that is, it could offend them. They may feel like they are 'cool'. They go out and say racist things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technically bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries.  Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie. They may not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They may go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These movies can also offend us. Make us feel uncool. Make us feel like we have to go out and try it.  In magazines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magazines. If you see someone in a magazine, you begin to want to look like them. You see how skinny they are. They are tan. They have perfect skin. It's normal for someone to be jealous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We may starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These images knock our confidence down. In today's society, people strive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stare. We use the girls in the magazine to help us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magazines can be offensive.  In today's society music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head every time you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realize that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just being a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band XYZ. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, 'I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self-harm? Depression and self-harm are a big thing in today's society. There is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut themselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries.  We should have a say in what is in our public library. The library is meant to be a good place. Anyone can go there. We are all unique in our own ways. If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself. We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of.
1154	4131	2	3	"Would you censor the Bible? I sure would not. The Bible is a very precious and religious part of our nation and history, but this is just a mere example. There are thousands of books, newspapers, articles, and media that play an important role in the history and the future of human beings. Common sense, also referred to as common knowledge, is something that we don't pick up out of nowhere. We absorb it through things we do, see, and read. For example, ""The Giving Tree"" is a book about a tree that meets a young boy and selflessly gives everything it has to make the boy happy. This story reflects that helping someone else is a key to life and that another's happiness is the true gift of life. Religion is often censored these days, but why? The Bible, for example, is just a book full of short stories that provide reminders of right and wrong, kindness and jealousy. It offers helpful advice, just like asking someone else for advice. While censorship can have its benefits, such as protecting children from adult content or maintaining national security, too much censorship can be harmful. Religious content and classic books that teach important life lessons should be preserved for future generations to come."
1155	4132	2	3	Shutting down libraries may be a drastic solution to the issue of inappropriate content in books, music, and movies, as mentioned in the original text. It is suggested that instead of completely closing libraries, creating separate sections for different age groups or genres could be a more practical approach. By segregating materials based on appropriateness, the risk of exposing children to unsuitable content can be minimized. Additionally, reeducating teenagers who may be influencing younger individuals with inappropriate language and behavior could help in promoting a more positive and respectful environment within libraries. Ultimately, it is important to consider alternative solutions before resorting to shutting down libraries entirely, as they serve as valuable resources for education and entertainment.
1156	4133	2	3	With the world's diverse cultures and beliefs, it is inevitable that some materials in libraries may be offensive to certain individuals. However, I believe that all types of content should be available in libraries to cater to a wide range of interests and perspectives. While some may find certain books or media offensive, it is important to remember that different works serve various purposes, such as entertainment, information, or persuasion. It is crucial for libraries to provide access to a variety of materials, even if they may not align with everyone's views. Additionally, individuals have the choice to avoid content that offends them and can request warnings or age restrictions on certain items. Ultimately, libraries play a vital role in providing knowledge and diverse perspectives to the public, and it is essential that they continue to offer a wide selection of materials for all individuals to explore and learn from.
1157	4134	2	3	As a place used to gain knowledge and wisdom, a library is a wonderful resource. Multiple varieties of books can be found at a local library from documentaries to science fiction or just fiction. The most amazing part of a library is the fact that one can choose what he or she reads. Yet if one man opposes the view in one book and believes a certain book should be removed from the library, then the freedom of choice is lost. The selection of reading should be open to every reader, and although some may disagree, heavy censorship of libraries is an unnecessary measure that constricts the ability to gain knowledge.  In today's society, many people differ in taste or genre. So much so, that at times it is hard to find a common ground in a large group setting. The library is a place where people should be able to enjoy their differences, reading different types of books spread across many shelves. Yet if one person dislikes a book, their opinion should not influence the removal of the book due to their preference. Author Katherine Paterson made a wise remark on the idea of censorship saying, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books.' If one person finds a work to be vulgar and believes it should be removed from the library, then what stops another person from removing a book that they dislike? If heavy censorship is allowed in libraries, then libraries will become diminished resources, only containing a few documents.  Still, censoring age-specific materials is necessary in libraries. Allowing a child to read or watch a movie or book that is inappropriate is an inexcusable action. Censoring books for children does not mean removal of said book though. Removing a book from the shelf of a library is just as wrong as allowing a child to read a book that is too mature for his or her age. Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But... then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The censoring of books in a library cannot lead to the removal of books that have shaped our society and ideas, even if it is to protect a child. A medium must be found between true censorship and opinionated removal of books, due to one's beliefs. Doing so will not only help libraries but also society.  There are many different opinions in modern society, and due to the differences in beliefs and ideas, at times people will disagree. Yet it is important that people agree on allowing each other to have a choice. A very important choice that each individual makes on a daily basis is what to read. Libraries allow for people to make their choices and help to expand one's knowledge in the process. Literature, whether it is found in a library or at one's home, should never be cast out due to someone else's opinion. Censoring of libraries should be considered, but not at the expense of knowledge. Libraries should not be censored.
1158	4135	2	3	I believe that the idea of removing materials from the library is not a good one. Students rely on the library for important information for their reports and assignments. The library is a valuable resource for students to have access to a wide range of materials that can help them succeed in their classes. Additionally, the library can inspire students to explore new topics and expand their knowledge beyond the classroom. It is important to keep the library well-stocked with a variety of materials to support student learning and academic success. Ultimately, the library plays a crucial role in the education and development of students, and its resources should be preserved for the benefit of all.
1159	4136	2	3	It really doesn't matter to me because I only go to the library to get a book when my teacher at school makes me. A library should be able to put whatever they want out on a shelf because the library is divided up into sections for kids, young adults, and adults. If a person doesn't like what he or she sees on a shelf at a library, then they don't have to look at it or check it out. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean someone else doesn't. Libraries don't make people look at or check out something they don't like, so why are people complaining about it? They are getting to check out books, movies, and music for free unless it becomes overdue. So people need to stop complaining about what the library has on their shelves.
1160	4137	2	3	In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, there are numerous libraries that offer a wealth of information to the public. While this information opens up new opportunities for exploration and learning, there is also a concern about the potential negative impact of certain materials. Some content in libraries, such as books, movies, and other media, can be offensive or provocative, leading to harmful behaviors and attitudes in individuals. Therefore, the implementation of censorship in libraries is essential, especially in a diverse community like @LOCATION1.  The diverse population in @LOCATION1 means that what may not be offensive to one individual could be deeply offensive to another. Establishing censorship guidelines can help ensure that materials available in libraries are appropriate for the community. This can be achieved through creating separate sections for different age groups, providing knowledgeable assistance to help individuals navigate through the collection, and implementing screening processes for potentially harmful content.  Organizing libraries into sections based on the target audience allows for easier access to relevant materials while also preventing exposure to inappropriate content. For instance, having a children's section separate from adult materials can protect young readers from harmful or confusing information. Additionally, having knowledgeable staff available to assist patrons in finding suitable materials can further enhance the browsing experience and minimize the risk of encountering offensive content.  While censorship is important to maintain a safe and respectful library environment, it is also crucial to uphold the principle of freedom of speech. Individuals should have the right to access a wide range of materials, but measures should be in place to protect vulnerable groups, such as minors, from potentially harmful content. Ultimately, while censorship should be exercised within reason, everyone should have the freedom to choose what they read or view.  In conclusion, while libraries are invaluable sources of information and knowledge, the presence of offensive or provocative materials necessitates the need for censorship. By implementing appropriate guidelines and providing assistance to patrons, libraries can ensure a safe and enriching experience for all individuals in the community. Balancing freedom of speech with the responsibility to protect vulnerable populations is crucial in maintaining a harmonious and respectful library environment.
1161	4138	2	3	My opinion is that there should be some items being censored, but we don't want to punish everybody just by taking the books off of the shelf completely. If I was an adult, I would not want my child renting very graphic books, magazines, etc., but I wouldn't want to block his whole life. There can be different censorship on individual people too. An idea is to have a parent come in to decide what type of censorship you can put on a child by putting this on his or her library card.  The censorship would be a great way to help parents watch what their children are reading and watching. A good suggestion for this is what I just brought up, a personal censorship. This would keep the child from reading too graphic of novels for their age and it would not offense the parents. Also for the rated X magazines, movies, etc. I believe they shouldn't be taken off the shelf and just moved to a different area that is secluded.  The censorship on books can also be completely outrageous too. A lot of books have graphic parts in them but yet are also a great read and can have great morals to learn. Graphic parts of the books are like the graphic parts of our lives, it's going to happen no matter what and we can't get away from it. Let the child, teenager, or whoever it is read the book if they are mature enough to read this and don't take it off the shelf.  Another point to get across is the library is also censored a little bit too. The libraries are organized into sections by categories of books. Some books are categorized by the age level they are intended for. Once you get into the actual novels, it isn't much like this but for younger ages this is the case, which people can see it work as a censor in ways. When you become to the higher reading level, you are most likely going to be old and mature enough to pick what you think is right to read and what is not.  With all this being said, there really doesn't need much censorship in libraries. Unless you have the personal censorship on the younger ones. There is no need to punish the ones that did absolutely nothing wrong to the community and to others when all they want to do is to simply check out items at the library.
1162	4139	2	3	Everywhere a person goes, there is always a media source. Media can range from newspapers, to magazines, to the radio, and through the television. Media is used to inform citizens of occurring events and to provide entertainment. Many media materials contain photos, language, and etc. that can be considered offensive to citizens. Media materials should not be taken off the shelf if they are found offensive. In the United States, citizens have the freedom of speech. With censorship, authors, directors, singers and other producers are deprived of this right. If the government enforces the censorship law, people can not say what they want to or how they truly feel about a subject. Also with censorship, citizens are neglected of their right to watch and listen to what they choose to. Not everyone has the same opinion about what should and should not be blocked out of everyday media materials. Parents and certain groups have a huge effect on the production of censorship. Parents and these groups complain that books, television, and other media materials are offensive and otherwise 'harmful' to their child, and that they should be removed from the media sources. I believe that if a parent has a concern with what his/her child is viewing, then they should take matters into their own hands by not letting the child view this material instead of having it censored so the rest of the people can not watch it. Parents and certain groups should not have the rest of the world be neglected of their choice to view these certain programs and read certain things. Censorship can include anything from photos, to language, to news reports. People who believe that offensive material should be blocked out for young viewers and other people do not understand that at some point in a person's life they will encounter these materials. Sometimes, in order to understand a major world event, such as the death of Martin Luther King Jr., have to understand the violence and forces that were used. If this material is taken offensively, no citizen will truly understand the real story and background of world-wide events. Censorship effects everyone, from a small child to a grown adult. It can deprive people of certain knowledge and understanding of certain concepts. Censorship should not be allowed in the United States and other areas of the world due to the lack of a citizen's freedom of speech and the rights that we as citizens hold.
1163	4140	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, and other things can be removed from the shelf. However, I think that @CAPS1 should be removed from the shelf when cleaning up. Other times, I don't believe they should be removed unless necessary. As a responsible individual, I always prioritize completing the chores assigned to me by my parents before engaging in other activities. While removing items from a shelf is not necessarily a bad thing, it should only be done when required, such as when the shelf is full and needs organizing. Overall, I believe in maintaining good behavior and being obedient, and I do not see the need to constantly remove things from a shelf unless it is necessary.
1164	4141	2	3	Should a library be able to remove a book or a movie from its shelves if someone happens to find it offensive? I believe that the answer to that question should be no. If a library decides to remove every offensive piece of literature or art in its possession, the shelves would be bare. Everyone has their own opinions, and what one person finds offensive, another may find beautiful. Offensive pieces of literature and art often evoke strong emotions and make people think. With the diverse society and culture today, someone is bound to be offended by something every day. Censorship is not the solution, as there is no way to avoid offending people entirely. Libraries should not waste their time on censorship, as someone will always find something that bothers them. Just because something is offensive to someone does not make it wrong, and depriving others of the chance to read or see it is not justified. Offensiveness is subjective, and libraries should maintain their collection without unnecessary censorship.
1165	4142	2	3	Everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people. People do still read or listen to it. And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves. I believe that anything offensive shouldn't be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves.  I listen to music all the time as long as I like the way it sounds. It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and I'm pretty sure that goes for a lot of people. But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying.  I don't really read a lot because I'm picky about the books that I do read. That's not the case for everyone though. A lot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world. It's an escape for them from everyday life. Which I can understand why someone would want to escape.  Movies are like books but you get a visual of what's going on. Which makes it more entertaining than a book. So more people would rather watch a movie. But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling. And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is.  So my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things. But just because someone doesn't like something doesn't mean that someone else won't like it. Like I said everyone is different. So why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well?
1166	4143	2	3	As a teenager, I am exploring ways to grow and express myself in life. I believe that materials like books, music, and movies should not be censored in libraries. While younger children should be shielded from violent content, high schoolers and older individuals should have the freedom to choose what they read or listen to. Censoring books and music limits our access to diverse perspectives and experiences. What may be offensive to some can be enlightening to others. It is essential for libraries to respect individual choice and not impose restrictions on content. In conclusion, censorship should be limited to materials that are deemed inappropriate for younger audiences, allowing older individuals to make their own decisions about the media they consume.
1167	4144	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves in a library. Libraries are meant to provide people with the varieties of media that they need. This action will pose three things: business loss, inconvenience, and a narrowing of people's book selections.  The first reason why libraries should not be censored is so they will not lose business. Just like any other industry, libraries need people to use their multimedia materials, such as books, magazines, music, etc. so they stay in business. The purpose many people go to the library is to get certain magazines, or movies, and so forth, and to get rid of certain movies and/or magazines is getting rid of certain customers. Another reason is the loss of business will lead to loss in customers, and if there are no customers to check out multimedia materials, the library will be closed down. No one wants their library to be closed, so libraries should not be censored.  Also, parents, instead of having an entire library censored, censor what children get from libraries. One way is to get the local libraries to participate in putting restrictions on the cards of young children. For example, if a thirteen year-old child wants to check-out a movie that is rated R they would not be able to. The restriction on their card could be to PG-13, or G movies. Another way is to have an adult monitor what the child gets from the library. For example, if a thirteen year-old child wants to get R movies, only allow them to get like one at a time. This will lower the risk of offending a parent or guardian.  Finally, there would be nothing left in the libraries. One reason is that out of all the books in the library, I'm sure at least one person is offended by each one. Does this mean that every library should close its doors? No, of course not, this just means that if something offends someone from their local library, stay away from it. Don't check out that book, movie, magazine, etc. A second reason is do not go to that library if the material in it is offensive to people's beliefs or religion. Libraries offer many things to help people in enriching their knowledge about a certain belief, so they should not be censored.  Sometimes what is considered offensive to one person, is essential to another. In every book of every library, there is something that people most likely think should be censored. But they must come to understand that those same books help people tremendously. Those same books transform lives, and are read to improve their understanding of something. So never will I think that the library should be censored.
1168	4145	2	3	Freedom to choose is a fundamental right that everyone should have, including the freedom to choose what type of clothes to wear and what books to read. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed because it restricts this freedom of choice. Instead of censoring books, there are alternative ways to prevent children from accessing inappropriate content, such as parental guidance and supervision. Adults, especially those over the age of eighteen, should have the autonomy to decide what they want to read or watch. Parents can play a crucial role in monitoring and guiding their children's reading choices. Additionally, offensive and inappropriate content exists in various forms beyond books, such as television shows and online content. It is essential to recognize that censorship in libraries is not the solution to protecting individuals from potentially offensive material. People should have the freedom to make their own choices and decisions regarding the content they engage with, without unnecessary restrictions. Ultimately, censorship should not dictate what individuals can or cannot access in libraries, as everyone deserves the right to exercise their freedom of choice.
1169	4146	2	3	These days, libraries offer a wide range of media beyond books, including music, movies, and magazines. Some may argue that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. However, I believe that such censorship is unnecessary. Children will eventually come across these offensive materials in one way or another as they grow up. Removing them from libraries would only limit access to information and knowledge. As Katherine Paterson, the author, pointed out, if one person has the right to remove a book they find offensive, then everyone else would have the same right, leading to the removal of many more materials. This would defeat the purpose of libraries, which is to provide access to a wide range of information. In conclusion, offensive materials should not be removed from library shelves as children will inevitably encounter them as they mature, and censorship would only hinder access to knowledge.
1170	4147	2	3	Should certain materials on shelves that are offensive be removed from shelves? I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are offensive to people should not be removed from shelves. These materials are taken in perspective by all different kinds of people.  Offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another person. People take things differently than other people might. For example, a lady might find a book to be disturbing or offensive, while the man next to her can find that same book interesting and useful to him. Not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing.  I also believe that if someone does not like the object that they are offended by then they do not have to look, purchase, or give attention to that object that is there on the shelf. He or she is not forced to buy, read, or watch what is offending them. The material that is offending that person is not purposely put there to offend them, it is there for people who are interested in it so that they can enjoy themselves in whatever it is that they might be doing.  Therefore, I do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off of shelves. People have the right to things that they enjoy. A material should not be taken off of a shelf just because one person is offended by it. Different people have their own perspective of things and opinion of how things should be.
1171	4148	2	3	The thought that Katherine Paterson had in her quote is quite understandable. If we were to censor books then there would be nothing to read in libraries. If you really tried, in every book you could find something offensive. I somewhat agree with her; however, I do believe there should be rules on where books are located.  Books are meant to be read and taking them away would be horrible for every book-loving person in this world. There are some things about where the books are to be found in the library that is up for debate. Personally, I believe the children's books should be on the opposite side of the building from the adult books and other reading material. In doing this, you, for the most part, prevent the children from entering an area that is not age-appropriate.  Teenage reading material should be separate from both children's books and adult reading material. In this way, they are not around the material that is 'above their heads', so to speak. If this were done parents' minds could be put at rest for the time being. They would not have to worry about their child or teenager finding reading material that is inappropriate or offensive.  Books that some people find offensive should be categorized, such as 'Young Adult (YA)'. They should also be categorized as 'Fiction', 'Non-Fiction', or 'Other'. In doing this most times where someone would have been offended are prevented from happening. Although there will be times where people will still find those books, and may be offended, it is mandatory that we do our best to limit those times. All necessary precautions should be taken.  At the same time, we should not remove any books from the shelves that are offensive to some. In removing a book from a shelf we would be eliminating a piece of knowledge or even life-long lessons that are difficult to teach without experiencing them yourself. Books offer us as humans so much, from knowledge to entertainment to even a form of comfort. Books are important to everyone whether they realize it or not. We have much to learn from books and we have much to offer our future members of the human race through books.  I do support Katherine Paterson's belief in that removing books from libraries would destroy the purpose of having them around. At the same time, I believe there are ways to limit the times where people would be offended by something. Removing books would destroy countless years of knowledge, past thoughts, and past experiences. Books should never be removed from libraries just because they may be found inappropriate.
1172	4149	2	3	I don't believe that certain material should be taken out of our libraries. If they take the books that people get a learning expression off of then what does that leave us with. Everybody in life should have their own choices, we shouldn't limit them. It's all about making choices in life, people should get the right to read the books, magazines, etc. they want, without people looking down on them or thinking the material they receive is unnatural. What one person might think is not good to read, the next person might think the total opposite.  Music is a creative aspect in our world, just as every person you meet is not the same, so should music be. You can't have the same ideas when it comes to making your creative outlook on the music in your community, it's not going to turn out the same as everyone else's will. If that was the case, then the world would be one boring place to live in. I think that everyone has their own taste in music. If you're the right age and you're not hurting anybody, then what's the big problem in listening to the music that encourages you to become creative.  There are a lot of movies that some parents might think are not good for their kids to watch. I think that we shouldn't be so worried about what our kids are watching and more about what they are doing. I believe that every movie you watch has a secret point in it, in other words, the lesson learned in the story. Some solutions that happen in real life might be in a movie that's probably rated. I don't believe that we should focus on the rating of the movie, we should focus on the lesson the movie is teaching you.  The children in the world are going to have to make their own choices and find what they find interesting, so should we ban everything we think that's not. We need to let the children grow on their own and also learn on their own. We can't make somebody listen, read, or watch what we want them to.  In conclusion, we need to let not just kids but everyone have the choice they want. The world is changing every day, so we need to change our ideas with it.
1173	4150	2	3	When walking into the library and children are finding books, movies, and magazines they should not look at, it can be offensive. I believe that it is not the author's fault for the offensive language in their work. I can understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at. My opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read, and if it is offensive to them, they should stop reading the book. Censorship in the library is to find books for everyone to read.  I think that they should not ban anything in the library because it can be used for something useful to the person. I find it hard to believe that libraries will remove every offensive book, movie, or music from shelves because the rating of the item can be horrible. I just don't think it should be a good idea for them to ban things from libraries if they need to use the information from the book. If it offends them, then they should not read the book and choose another book. Authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the publishing process.  My opinion is a no because I feel they should not remove items off shelves of the libraries because the content of the item is not appropriate for someone. My views can vary when I am older and have children of my own someday. But as of right now, I do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries.
1174	4151	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. Parents play a crucial role in shaping the media consumption habits of their children, and they must take responsibility for what their children are exposed to. Blaming offensive content for negative influences on children overlooks the role of parental guidance and oversight. If parents are more mindful of the media their children consume, the impact of offensive materials can be mitigated. Ultimately, it is up to parents to make informed choices about what is appropriate for their children, rather than demanding the removal of offensive materials from public access.
1175	4152	2	3	I certainly don't believe books, magazines, etc.. should be taken off the shelves in libraries just because they're offensive to a certain amount of people. For one of the reasons are in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 it states that you have the freedom of speech and when you write a book or an article in a magazine you are writing a story on whatever you want and if it is put on a shelf in the @CAPS1 place it should stay there. Also, just because it is offensive to one certain group or person doesn't give anybody the right to take something off the shelf in the library because the author is speaking what they want.   Also in magazines today there are many offensive things to certain people such as celebrities, sports stars, etc... but they don't go to the libraries and take them off the shelf. If you were one of those people that did take a book or magazine off the shelf I think you should ask other people what they think about that material, because some people @MONTH1 like it. Also if you keep taking all the books off the shelf what will we have to read and educate ourselves about today, and read stories that were told for generations? If you do see one of those reading materials and they are offensive to you just put it back up on the shelf; and act like you never picked it up.  In conclusion, it is important to respect the freedom of speech and the diverse viewpoints expressed in books and magazines. Removing materials from library shelves based on individual offense goes against the principles of intellectual freedom and limits access to valuable information and perspectives. It is essential to uphold the right to express varied opinions and allow readers to make their own choices about what they want to read.
1176	4153	2	3	I don't believe in censoring books or any form of media because everyone has different tastes and preferences. In my own experience, I was restricted from listening to the music I enjoyed by my foster parents who imposed their religious beliefs on me. This kind of strict control only leads to rebellion and stifles self-expression. All individuals should have the freedom to choose what they consume and express their own interests. It is important to respect people's preferences and allow them to be true to themselves without imposing restrictions. Everyone deserves the right to express themselves and enjoy what they like without judgment or interference.
1177	4154	2	3	One of the amendments in the Constitution of the United States is freedom of speech, which grants the right to express oneself as long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others. The issue of whether people should be allowed to censor books has been a contentious topic throughout history. Some argue that individuals should have the ability to censor materials they find offensive. However, if everyone had the power to censor books they disliked, there would be very few books left for people to enjoy. In our diverse society, literature has evolved to cater to various cultures, customs, and beliefs, allowing individuals to find works that resonate with them. Just as we are taught to accept and respect the differences of others in our daily lives, literature reflects this diversity. Despite ongoing debates, it is clear that differing opinions on book censorship will persist due to the uniqueness of individuals and their perspectives. In the end, it is essential to recognize and appreciate the diversity of thought and expression that enriches our society.
1178	4155	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic with valid arguments on both sides. Some believe that censoring books limits freedom of choice and access to information, while others argue that certain materials may be inappropriate for certain age groups. It is essential for parents to monitor what their children are exposed to and make informed decisions about what they read or watch. Libraries can help by providing age recommendations for books and movies to guide parents in their choices. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with parents to ensure that their children are not exposed to offensive content. By working together, both libraries and parents can create a safe and enriching environment for young readers.
1179	4156	2	3	I think other materials in libraries such as music and art should stay active in public libraries or school libraries. They show symbolic meaning to the ever-changing world as we know it. People have different beliefs about anything, and it is essential to respect diverse opinions. It is crucial to remember the saying, ''if you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all.'' In my experience, access to a variety of reading materials in libraries has been essential for individuals to explore different perspectives and histories. Restricting certain materials can limit knowledge and understanding. It is vital to preserve history, even if it may be controversial or uncomfortable for some. I hope that this essay will encourage protesters to reconsider their stance and recognize the value of diversity in library collections. Let's continue to support access to a wide range of materials that contribute to a rich and informed society.
1180	4157	2	3	I believe that libraries should not censor their literature, as all media is a valuable source of knowledge waiting to be discovered. No individual or institution should have the authority to determine what is appropriate for the public to access. The right to choose what is suitable for oneself should rest with each person.   Throughout history, media in various forms such as books, music, movies, and magazines has served as a reservoir of information and lessons from the past. It reflects our triumphs and failures, guiding us towards a better future by reminding us of past mistakes. The vast array of media available today continues to offer valuable insights that we have yet to fully comprehend.  While some media may be deemed inappropriate by certain individuals, there is still much to be gained from it. What one person finds objectionable, another may find enlightening or informative. Those who are offended by certain content can simply choose to avoid it, rather than imposing restrictions on everyone else.  Media holds significant power and should not be subject to censorship. Its impact on society is profound, and attempting to conceal certain aspects of it only hinders our ability to learn and grow. We have only scratched the surface of what media can offer, and it would be a disservice to limit access to it. Let us embrace the diversity of media and the knowledge it brings, without imposing restrictions that inhibit our ability to explore and learn from it.
1181	4158	2	3	Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, it should not be removed. Katherine says, 'I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor.' First of all, she can have the right to do that but there are people who have a say in this. There are people who can read, listen, watch, and see what they like. Definitely, I really think that it should not be removed even though it doesn't have positive things.  Although it might offend some people, they have a choice whether they should see, watch, listen, and read it. Many people might agree with the author about what she thinks about this. Though, many people might go against it. One reason why I think that people should be allowed to see, watch, listen, and read whatever they would like to see, it's because it's their own choice. We make our own decisions whether people like it or not. Another reason would be because people would want to see the funny things that people invent that actually make the shows. Some people do not like to be bored of the same thing.  Katherine Paterson, the Author, is right in some ways. She wouldn't want her children to see things that are inappropriate. I have a daughter and I wouldn't want her to see things that are abhorrent. The last reason would be children should not be allowed to see inappropriate things until they are eighteen or older. These things can influence children very intensely.  Indeed, many people in this world are influenced by bad things. The author stated, 'then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' Right, she is meaning that we have a choice of what our children would like to see. For example, there is a magazine full of negative words and full of horrid stuff. Would you pull it out of the shelf for your child to not have a chance to see that? You should if you love your child even though it's your own choice. You would want the best for your child to not see, read, watch, and listen to things that are inappropriate.  In conclusion, this would be your choice. There will always be things in the world that you don't like. You cannot stop the terrible things from happening. In the libraries, there shouldn't be anything negative anyway because you never know what your child might be doing. Simply, teach your kid what is wrong and right. Finally, from what you experienced. Teach them the right things from the wrong things you learned so they wouldn't do the same mistake as you did.
1182	4159	2	3	I believe that all types of books should be available to all types of people. A library should never be intended for a certain group of readers. As far as I'm concerned, books are creativity in text-form. Creativity is a large part of life, and without it, we would all be the same. There is at least one book for every person in the world, and whether reading is a hobby or not does not matter, there is a book that will interest you.   It is not fair to everybody to take books off the shelves of a library due to 'offensive' content. With different personalities comes different writers. With different writers comes different books. With different books comes different readers. There are a lot of people out there who like to read. What are the people who like 'offensive' content going to do when these books are taken off the shelves?   Books are written for two reasons: allowing authors to express themselves and giving readers the chance to explore and relate to the imaginations of authors. I think that if a writer has the ability to put whatever he/she wants in a book, that book should be available to anyone and everyone.
1183	4160	2	3	In my opinion, I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are at the library for a reason. The reason being if we wanted to check out a movie and everywhere else was too expensive to get it, why wouldn't you just get it at the library if they had it. Most libraries that I've gone to have certain sections for adults and children. That means there would be appropriate things for little children to read in the section that they have been given. If children under age were to wander off into the adult section and saw something inappropriate, that would be their fault, not the library's.  If every time a child or someone under age took a book offensive, I believe that the libraries wouldn't have as much of books in their buildings that grown-ups would like to read. Of course, I'm not trying to say that there should be extremely inappropriate books wandering around in the library that small children should see. Adults have the right to have books that they would be interested in.  I believe that no material should be taken off the shelf just because one person found it offensive. If a person doesn't like the idea of the library not taking the material off, it's the person's personal problem. For example, there is this book called '@CAPS1' about a teenager who got into drugs and got pregnant at a young age. If somebody finds that offensive and asks for the book to be removed, then it's their loss.  If there were a book about how to murder somebody, then I would ask for that material to be taken off the shelf immediately. However, no library in this entire world would have that kind of stuff up, so why worry about it? In conclusion, that is my opinion on this matter.
1184	4161	2	3	Offensive material should not be removed from shelves. Books cover a wide range of topics, and everyone can be offended by something. If we start removing books that some find offensive, then there would be very few books left for people to read.   @PERSON1 faced a similar situation with his music lyrics in front of Congress, leading to the creation of the '@CAPS1' sticker for albums with offensive content. Censoring books would hide the thoughts, ideas, and meanings behind the author's writing.   Parents concerned about their children reading offensive material should engage in conversations about the book's context to address their worries. Children go through various stages of growth, learning from both positive and negative sources, and it is the responsibility of parents to guide them in distinguishing between truth and falsehood.   My grandmother once shared a memory of me learning to read from an adult magazine. While the content was not intended for children, it helped me develop a crucial skill that would benefit me in various aspects of life. It is important to allow access to different materials to foster growth and learning, even if they may contain offensive content. Ultimately, censorship of books limits the exploration of diverse ideas and perspectives, hindering intellectual development and understanding.
1185	4162	2	3	Throughout the years, many events have taken place in our history. Throughout these times the events have been recorded, journaled, and filmed. These thoughts, opinions, and facts may be offensive to a select few in our society. The question is, 'Should our libraries take these 'offensive' pieces off the shelves?' The simple answer to this highly disputed question is no. Censoring our libraries would be a harmful and wrong thing to do to the general public.  Censoring our libraries creates an illusion of a perfect society. If libraries were filled with tasteless articles and perfect fairyland books, the library would become a place where reality is not present. Libraries hold information that is raw and true without leaving the facts behind. People need to get a taste of reality in order to survive in the 'real world,' and one of the greatest ways to attain this knowledge is through books. Being exposed to offensive material and different viewpoints helps shape ourselves into who we are or will become. To take this away would be harming our development and growth, thus creating an 'imperfect' society.  Certain points in history are not something that everyone can be proud of. The Holocaust, America's genocide, and other historical events are all devastating points in time that can be a touchy subject to one and few people. However, history is an important factor in everyone's lives; we know history in order to not repeat it. Losing this information is a way for people to not be clearly informed, harming the future outcome of our society. Without public records of these happenings, it can cause confusion and misconceived views of important topics. If we censor all the media from libraries across the nation, ordinary people, such as yourself, would be 'living in the dark.'  As people develop their own opinions and views over time, they begin to distinguish the difference between right and wrong. What may be offensive to you, may not be offensive to the person sitting next to you. Quoted by the author Katherine Paterson, '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' In truth, by removing offensive material from our bookshelves, there would be no media left. Not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance, but that is why the world goes around. We as a society have the right to guard our ability to share opinions; censorship destroys our ability to do so.  Everyone is different. The world is full of diversity and viewpoints that are bursting with interesting concepts. By censoring records of history, opinion, observations, our society becomes an illusion. We need to have these facts available to the general public. By ridding ourselves of 'offensive' media, we cannot share our opinions with one another for a more successful society. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it is harmful to our growth as a society and is overall the wrong thing to do.
1186	4163	2	3	There are books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media that are not appropriate for children. Banning them from shelves should not even be a question; if children should not be exposed to certain content, it is the responsibility of parents to ensure they do not have access to it. Removing these items from shelves could result in a loss of business from teenagers and adults who enjoy them. It would be more practical to separate offensive material from content appropriate for children, making it easier for everyone to make informed choices. This way, nothing needs to be taken off the shelves, and businesses can continue to cater to a wide range of audiences.
1187	4164	2	3	I go to the library every Saturday of every week. Although I don't really read that much. I usually get movies or music. If I do get a book to read, it's usually a magazine or something for school. I don't think that books should be removed. If you don't read them it doesn't mean that other people don't. If you don't like the book just ignore it and go on; it's simple as that. For instance, if I found a book about controversial topics or about a historical figure, I would not read it for myself but I would not take it down off of the shelf. Other people might want to read it. It's their choice to read it, not mine. It's like the radio now. The radio plays songs and cuts out the curse words. I don't think that they should do that because it messes up the song's lyrics and it is going against the artist's words. The artist sings the song but people change his or her words. To me, I don't think that's right. It's also like television now. You see the movie in theaters or on DVD and they have bad language or bad scenes in them. When you watch that same movie on television they take out about ten minutes of the movie because of the bad scene or they cut out the language. To me, I think everything should stay. I think if you don't want your kids to see it just block it but don't cut out parts from the movie; it's not fair to the other people. If people don't like some music then just switch the radio station to another area on the radio. There's no need to take the words out. Kids are going to pick the words up in school or off the streets anyway. I also think since we are having to pay so much taxes I think we should get the privilege to come home and watch movies on television and relax. In conclusion, censorship in various forms, whether in books, music, or television, limits artistic expression and individual choice. It is essential to respect diverse perspectives and allow individuals to make their own informed decisions about what they consume.
1188	4165	2	3	It is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world. If individuals are unaware, problems can only be helped to a limited extent. There is a fine line between freedom of speech and harassment, but it is crucial for individuals to educate themselves in order to effectively educate others. Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is being hidden, as everyone deserves access to information and knowledge. In today's digital age, it is becoming increasingly challenging to discern the truth from misinformation, making it essential to have access to a wide range of perspectives and sources. Censorship limits the flow of information and inhibits critical thinking and problem-solving. Everyone deserves to be heard, no matter how uncomfortable or controversial their viewpoints may be. Censorship hinders the progress of society and stifles the exchange of ideas that are essential for growth and development. In conclusion, censorship should be prohibited as it restricts the flow of knowledge and limits the potential for positive change and progress in the world.
1189	4166	2	3	"People will always take things offensive, as it is a fact of life. No one will ever be completely satisfied, no matter what. We cannot try to please everyone, but it will never happen. We have the freedom of speech, even if those words are offensive to others. Things on the internet are offensive, and no one can mandate how it is viewed either. The same should go for a library.  I understand a parent's concern with their child reading or listening to things that are not appropriate. Some of the things authors write can be either inappropriate or offensive. That is their freedom of speech. We cannot take that away from them, but there should be some censorship, at least to the appearance of books. For music and movies, they usually have a warning label if it is not intended for younger kids. It might be a good idea for some libraries to do the same with books and magazines.  In order to see a rated ""R"" movie, you have to be over 17, and for a good reason because of the mature content. The books being written now are more and more mature. But if we take on the custom of being of a certain age for books, we might invade the privacy of others.  No one has the right to remove books from a library's shelf on the count of being offensive. Who can judge whether something is offensive? The libraries are publicly owned and, therefore, have no one owner. The city owns them. If there is a problem with whether a book should be at the library, it is the city's decision. Even if there is such an uproar about one book, unless the decision is unanimous, no book should be taken off the shelves. The book should simply be put in a spot either behind the counter or where it is available only on request.  Taking books off the shelves, I believe, is taking away from the public's ability to read. If a parent is concerned about what their child might read, they should confront their local librarian. The librarian may be able to help them retrieve books that are appropriate and appealing to their child."
1190	4167	2	3	There are a lot of things that people find offensive in libraries, and it is important to address these issues promptly. Libraries should be a place of comfort and relaxation, where people can enjoy their reading without encountering disturbing content. If something offensive is found in the library, it should be removed to maintain a welcoming environment for all visitors. By ensuring that libraries are free from offensive material, we can create a space where everyone feels comfortable and at home. Ultimately, it is important to consider the feelings of others and make the library a place that is suitable for all.
1191	4168	2	3	This is a very difficult topic to argue with. In my opinion, I believe that there should be certain types of censorship in libraries. Material that is inappropriate for young children should not be accessible in elementary school libraries, but should be allowed in public and high school libraries. High school students are more likely to be exposed to inappropriate content through music and magazines, so they should have access to such materials. However, there are certain books that are not suitable for any age group and should be kept out of all libraries to prevent exposure. It is important for individuals to be able to make their own choices about what they read, listen to, or watch, but it is also essential to consider the appropriateness of the content. In conclusion, while some materials should be available in libraries, graphic and inappropriate content should be restricted to protect young audiences from exposure. It is crucial to make responsible choices about the media we consume.
1192	4169	2	3	Teachers and parents often censor what children and young adults read, watch, and listen to in order to protect their innocence. However, as young adults grow older, they tend to rebel against this censorship and seek out material on their own. In today's society, the strong feeling of public censorship may be considered too old-fashioned. Censorship in libraries, for example, should be limited as everyone has different views on what is appropriate. While some may find certain material offensive, others may not, leading to a situation where there would be nothing left if everything deemed offensive was removed. The United States prides itself on freedom of speech and expression, and censorship goes against this fundamental right. While age restrictions may be necessary, ultimately it should be up to parents to decide what their children can access. In conclusion, the issue of censorship is complex, but in a country founded on freedom, censorship should be limited to uphold constitutional rights and allow individuals to make their own choices. Only when people learn to accept differing views can this issue be effectively addressed.
1193	4170	2	3	Today's books in libraries can sometimes be offensive, covering topics like theft, drug use, and violence. While these themes may reflect historical events, some books lack meaningful content and may not be suitable for young readers. Exposing children to such material can send the wrong message about acceptable behavior. It is important to consider the impact of literature on young minds and ensure that age-appropriate content is available.  While adults may enjoy certain genres, it is crucial to restrict access to inappropriate material for children. While personal preferences vary, a collective effort is needed to regulate the type of books, music, movies, and magazines available in libraries. This ensures that the content aligns with societal values and protects young readers from harmful influences.  Parents play a crucial role in guiding their children's reading choices and media consumption. Allowing kids to explore and enjoy their childhood is essential, but it is equally important to instill values that discourage negative behavior. By promoting responsible reading habits and monitoring their exposure to questionable content, parents can help shape their children's moral compass and encourage healthy development.  In conclusion, while libraries offer a wide range of materials, it is essential to prioritize age-appropriate content and consider the impact of literature on young readers. By promoting responsible reading habits and fostering a safe environment for learning, we can ensure that children grow up with a strong sense of ethics and values. It is a collective responsibility to safeguard the well-being of our youth and empower them to make positive choices in their literary pursuits.
1194	4171	2	3	Today in our society, many things can be interpreted in various ways, including sayings, quotes, and words. Author Katherine Paterson once stated that a person has the right to remove harmful material from shelves, but the question remains: is it beneficial to do so? In my view, offensive materials should not be removed because someone without financial means may want access, children, particularly teenagers, may go to great lengths to obtain what they desire, and items often have multiple interpretations.   If a librarian deems something offensive, they may choose not to display it on the shelves to prevent children from accessing it. However, I believe this action is unnecessary as the material is still available elsewhere. A child can easily find the material at another library or purchase it online. Removing a book because it is offensive may also prevent adults from accessing it.   As a teenager, I have witnessed the lengths to which some individuals will go to obtain explicit material. If a teen cannot find what they are looking for at one library, they will simply seek it out elsewhere or purchase it online. This could potentially lead to problematic situations.   When listening to music or reading a book, individuals may interpret the content differently from the author's intention. What may seem humorous to one person could be offensive to another. Similarly, songs with explicit language may not be intended to be taken literally by the listener. The potential for double meanings makes it easier to find offensive material.   Censorship in libraries is unnecessary, as the responsibility should lie with parents to monitor their children's access to material. If a librarian finds something objectionable, they should refrain from engaging with it personally, but they should not restrict others from accessing it. Everyone should be able to make their own choices regarding what they read or listen to. Paterson's statement emphasizes that while efforts can be made to prevent children from accessing inappropriate material, it should not come at the cost of limiting access for others. In conclusion, it is important to consider the implications of censorship in libraries and the impact it can have on individuals' freedom of choice.
1195	4172	2	3	The idea of censoring books and music in libraries has sparked debates for years. Libraries are havens for exploration and learning, allowing people to immerse themselves in the creative works of others. Censorship would hinder this process, depriving individuals, especially young generations, of the profound impact of words and music on our emotions and thoughts.  Books serve as a fundamental source of information, offering diverse perspectives and insights into different cultures and beliefs. Removing offensive content from books sets a dangerous precedent, potentially leading to further restrictions on literary works. Reading broadens our understanding of the world, fostering empathy and tolerance towards varying lifestyles and societies.  Similarly, music is a powerful form of expression that should not be censored in libraries. Music has the ability to soothe the soul and stimulate the mind, providing a non-violent outlet for individuals to voice their opinions and feelings. Censoring music restricts artistic freedom and stifles creativity, hindering the ability to address important social issues peacefully.  In a society that values freedom of speech, it is crucial to uphold the right to express oneself through literature and music. By embracing diversity and respecting different forms of art, we can create a more inclusive and understanding community. Instead of censoring artistic works, we should celebrate the richness and variety of human expression found in books and music available in our libraries.
1196	4173	2	3	Can you believe that some people think that books should be banned for having bad things in them? Well I can, Children today are learning nothing but violence and cursing these days. Banned books could be the way we set them stait and make them recognise that stuff is bad. Only a handfull of kids these days are choosing to read books, a majority of them are playing video games and watching tv. Chilren shouldn't be alloud to swear, or think that violence is alright. Chilren will read these bad books and think it is ok to shoot someone if they are doing something they don't like, but it's not alright. Banned books are exaclty what children need when they are in their younger years.  Banned books might have foul language and violence, but I believe that it is ok to let your teen or young adault read them if they are mature enough to handle it. Teenagers should be mature enough to be able to read a book with a few swear words in it, or someone killing another person. Some banned books don't even have swear words in them; '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' doesn't have one swear word in any of the books but still it remains on the banned books list to this day.  Some books, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed for profanity and drugs. I do believe that someone is trying to make a difference with the banned books list. Censorship should only be used if a person is too young to understand why or what is happening when they say a bad word or do something confusing.  In conclusion I think censorship is a great thing that should be used moderatly. The children today dont need to be learning about sex, drugs, swearing, violence, etc. I do believe if they put an age limit on what you can watch/read that it will be a more controlled topic to talk about.
1197	4174	2	3	Censorship in libraries is unnecessary. Parents can monitor what their children read or watch, rather than restricting access to certain materials for everyone. Libraries are meant to offer a variety of content, catering to different tastes and interests. Removing items based on individual complaints would deplete library collections. Instead of outright removal, materials deemed inappropriate for minors could be placed in an adult section. This would allow adults to access a wider range of content while ensuring children are not exposed to unsuitable material. Ultimately, censorship should be minimized in libraries to preserve intellectual freedom and provide diverse options for all patrons.
1198	4175	2	3	Libraries are essential in providing a wide range of materials such as books, magazines, music, and movies to the public. These resources offer valuable information that may not be easily accessible elsewhere. However, it is important to consider the appropriateness of certain materials, especially for a diverse audience that includes children.   To ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all patrons, libraries should consider segregating materials that are rated for mature audiences, such as magazines and movies, into a designated adult section. By doing so, libraries can prevent children from encountering inappropriate content that may lead to potential harm or unsafe behaviors.   While music is a significant aspect of many people's lives, it can also have varying degrees of suitability for different age groups. It is important to strike a balance between providing access to music and ensuring that the content is appropriate for all library visitors.   Ultimately, by organizing materials thoughtfully and considering the diverse needs of library users, libraries can maintain a positive and inclusive atmosphere. By making these adjustments, libraries can continue to serve their communities effectively and without complications.
1199	4176	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines will always contain a statement that someone doesn't agree with, and by removing that, one may not fully understand the message the author is trying to convey. For these reasons, it is important to keep these different forms of media on the shelves. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and while not everyone will agree, it is essential to respect the diversity of perspectives that exist in society. Embracing this diversity allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the world around us.
1200	4177	2	3	When it comes to the decision of certain materials being allowed in the library, there are many different aspects that must be considered. There isn't a particular audience that visits a library. Many types of people go to libraries looking for different things. Blocking types of materials will lose an audience's interest and they will go elsewhere. Now that doesn't mean that offensive materials are acceptable and here is why.  There should be a level of intensity in which the item is offensive. Profanity, and action are minor types of offense. However, intense violence and explicit materials such as blood and such need to have conditions. Categorization is an acceptable method to blocking some from viewing harmful materials. Putting violent books in an area that is blocked to those under the age of 18 is an effective way to restrict children. Adults would not want to go into this section and therefore wouldn't be an issue. It is understandable that some people are offended by the materials showcased in libraries because a library is a place for everyone. If offensive items were available only to those who wanted it and hidden from the public, then this is something that could solve the problem.  Many individuals should realize that a library isn't a place for one type of person and must be shared by all types. When it comes to books, they can be placed in areas available to people who enjoy it. The same applies for magazines and movies. Movies are a form of entertainment that is strongly advertised over magazines and books. Any advertisement that shows explicit material or offensive pictures or text should be removed from the view of the public. These advertisements should be only viewable by the audience it was intended for.  If individuals wish to use computers, there are rules that need to be applied as well. Those under the age of 18 should have safety precautions that block them from using the computer to look up harmful material, while those over the age of 18 know how to avoid certain material and proceed at their own risk. These computers should be separated to avoid peeking eyes from children or anyone who finds the material to be appalling. Listening to music on the computer or by a device should require a couple of things as well. If there is a song that isn't preferable to a certain audience or it offends someone, headphones should be a requirement. The library is a place for peace and quiet, so headphones are necessary regardless. This can potentially eliminate the problem as long as the headphones themselves are at an appropriate level. If individuals want to check out any materials that are or can be offensive or explicit in some way, they must prove their age of maturity, due to some items with slight violence being available to those under the age of 18.  In conclusion, if the categorization of harmful or explicit materials is placed properly and out of view of unwanted viewers or children, this can eliminate the issue. Music is to be played through headphones only and must be at an appropriate volume. No items should be removed from shelves if they offend people, but conditions should be enforced. With rules and conditions, the library can be a safe and enjoyable place for everyone.
1201	4178	2	3	I think that the music and other things besides books should stay in the library. It is a place where people go to find new things and explore what others find interesting. The library holds a vast variety of music, movies, magazines, and more, catering to different tastes and interests. People should not be limited in what they can read, hear, or look at while at the library.   The library is a space for people to discover new music and expand their horizons. It is important to acknowledge that everyone has different preferences and not everyone enjoys reading books. Some may find magazines or movies more appealing, and that should be respected.   I believe that the library should continue to offer a diverse range of music to cater to the varied interests of its patrons. Taking away music would limit people's choices and may not cater to everyone's preferences. It is essential to embrace the diversity of music and other forms of media to ensure that the library remains a welcoming and inclusive space for all.
1202	4179	2	3	In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials should not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some people's religion and way of life. I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading? There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based off a book series, and that series may not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the screen and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do may not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble than they want to get in. I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them. There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?
1203	4180	2	3	I believe that many books in our local libraries may come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but it has a lot to do with the maturity level of individuals. While adults have the freedom to make their own choices on what to checkout, children and young adults are at an impressionable age where monitoring is crucial. Parents should be actively involved in their children's lives, setting limits on what they are exposed to through books and other media. It is important to ensure that books are appropriate for the intended age group, especially in the children and young adult sections. Ultimately, everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section, with guidance and supervision from parents playing a key role in shaping young minds.
1204	4181	2	3	Yes, I believe that offensive materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves. Libraries should only contain content that is appropriate for all ages, especially considering the presence of children. By removing offensive materials, libraries can create a more welcoming and enjoyable environment for everyone. It is important to have a diverse range of content available, but this should not come at the expense of causing discomfort or offense to library patrons. Ultimately, the removal of offensive materials can help prevent conflicts and ensure that libraries remain safe and inclusive spaces for all.
1205	4182	2	3	When it comes to censorship in public libraries, the topic can be quite perplexing. While there may be material that some find offensive, taking away access to a book, song, or movie because of controversy seems unfair to those who enjoy it. Instead of completely removing such content, a better approach would be to have a designated area for materials with adult content, allowing those who wish to access it to do so while still respecting the concerns of others.   It is important to remember that individuals have the right to express their opinions and beliefs freely. Censoring material simply because it is deemed offensive by a few goes against the fundamental right to freedom of expression. Authors who invest time and effort into creating their work should have the opportunity for it to be enjoyed by those who appreciate it, rather than being restricted due to the objections of a minority.  Ultimately, while censorship may have its place in certain circumstances, imposing it too heavily on what some consider offensive limits our freedom to express diverse viewpoints. It is essential to strike a balance between respecting differing opinions and allowing for the open exchange of ideas and perspectives.
1206	4183	2	3	Censoring offensive material can be a topic of debate, with both positive and negative aspects. While some may argue that censoring such content is necessary to protect children and individuals from harmful influences, others believe that it restricts freedom of choice and hinders the understanding of the real world. Parents may choose to censor certain books, music, movies, or magazines to shield their children from potentially harmful content, but this may also prevent them from learning and growing. It is important to consider that censoring material does not erase what is already out there, as offensive content has been widely distributed and consumed. Ultimately, allowing individuals to make their own choices regarding what they read, hear, or watch may be more beneficial than imposing censorship. Each person should have the freedom to decide what they want to engage with, without external restrictions.
1207	4184	2	3	The many books, movies, music, and magazines in the world could be offensive. In all of these examples there could be bad language, pictures, and messages. No matter where people go they can find something that could offend someone. No matter what, people will try and get rid of everything bad but the truth is they are gonna be around forever if not a very long time.  In all the students in grade ten just got done reading ' of .' The story is about a runaway  named ; and a runaway boy named . many libraries have banned this book because of the use of the n-word. ' of ' has profanity in it, and people don't want that book to be taught in . I personally think it should be taught, because it shows students today what it was like back when there was slavery. Music is something that mostly everyone listens to. Songs always have a meaning or a subject the artist sings or raps about. many song artists write about love, money, and fame, yet others write about drugs, profanity, and suicide. Hip-hop, rap, country, rock, metal, jazz, R&B, punk, etc., are only a few of the hundreds of types of music out there; and at least songs of each type have a bad meaning behind it. Magazines and movies are the same way. Magazines and movies have everything between cars to bad pictures in them and historical places, facts, and documents to action. Even though there are age limits to buy or see stuff it still doesn't mean that it couldn't get into a teen's hands.  Because there is bad language in music, movies, books, etc., doesn't mean it should be banned, just limited. No, it is not wrong to put what you feel into a book or into a movie just make sure it is analyzed right so it can only be checked out or sold to the people of the right age. What the children and teens are into now will affect the world in a later time and keep on going until there is a change made. Offending content should be regulated to ensure it does not negatively impact individuals. Ultimately, it is essential to strike a balance between artistic expression and societal norms to create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all.
1208	4185	2	3	"We live in a world inundated and persuaded by media. Ever since we were little, our young minds have been filled with opinions of others from history and the present. Whether we are reading a book, watching a motion picture, or even listening to a new music artist, our lives are being affected by such media. The art world is considered to be one of the most controversial businesses to work in. Each piece of literature or movie is shared by a vast community of critics. We all are given the right to our opinion on such pieces. Every piece of art is judged and then criticized. However, many find certain pieces to be offending in some way, shape, or form. It is quite impossible to produce such a piece that will fit everybody's satisfaction. For example, religious pieces are often scorned for their nonfactual information or for the director's or author's opinion on the matter. Since we live in such a diverse community of religions, these pieces will never satisfy the audience. Movies have been criticized for decades because they represent some sort of life lesson or truth that is not appealing to the audience. Why not learn from them and reflect? No piece of media can possibly be directed to satisfy the opinions of all the world. As a personal example, I can see that novels and books over war are heavily criticized. The men and women who fought for our country enjoy seeing such pieces written about them, but war protesters and peacekeepers see this as an insult to their cause. George Orwell wrote a book by the name ""1984"". This book was heavily criticized over the topic of censorship. The world in which they lived in had dramatically been affected by the impact of people's opinions. If a book or movie was offensive to a group of people, then they burned the books. History books about slavery and war were burned because others found the topics offending. Non-religious groups thought that religion was offensive, so they burned the Bible and other works of religion. Their government wanted a world of peace and a community where every man was equal and diversity was no longer existent. George Orwell denies the book was written over censorship but his book gives our generation a great lesson. For generations, we have grown up in a world of diversity. Every mind is special and different and will never share identical thoughts as his neighbor. Therefore, we must recognize that we have to survive and live together. We cannot escape the diversity in which we live in. The books we see on shelves, the movies we see on the big screen, and music we listen to through our earphones all make up our generation's history and the next. We need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal. If we throw away our history and our accomplishments, man is left with nothing to improve on, nothing to leave his or her marking on history. We have to accept others' ideas and build on them to improve our life and others'. As we stand in a world filled with diversity, we must move on and reflect. It is not a time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move on."
1209	4186	2	3	I am writing you today to propose an explanation on my views of censorship in libraries. I recently had visited a library and some of the things I read in my time being there was really overwhelming. I think it should be censored and taken off the shelf. If you are a place of business, you should not want things like that on your shelf. You should not want customers reading it and feeling disgusted. I hope something I write will propose my reasons.  I have plenty of reasons to censor things and have them taken off the shelves that are offensive to me and others who visit the library, but only speaking on my behalf, there were certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., that were offensive. I believe things of this nature should be handled with great authority. If anything, I am trying to help me and my fellow citizens.  Just think if a visitor comes in and picks up a magazine and it has insulting visual details of something that the reader can relate to or have experienced, and it is getting talked down about instead of being looked at, then they would be very offended. For them to come there, it had to be a reason that they came, I know it wasn't so they would feel insulted. It is very inappropriate to have things that are offensive in the library.  There are plenty of different reasons people come to libraries. Some come to get away, and to others, it's a daily routine. Whatever the case may be, they should feel comfortable in the place they are at. Why would you want people in the community or people, in general, to not be comfortable where they are at? Just think if they are uncomfortable, then they are going to tell others and you will lose a lot of fellow friends and a lot of business. Think strongly about the things you do and the way you approach things to get people's attention.  To answer the question, I agree strongly on getting the offensive materials moved from the shelves. I believe in making people happy, and one thing that is wrong with society today is too much judging and talking down and talking bad about people. If people would not judge or insult people, then the world would be a lot safer. It has to start somewhere, every little start causes a great ending. I think this would be a good start to making the world happier and bringing all of us closer together. I hope something I wrote will help you on your decision.
1210	4187	2	3	Censorship is a complex issue that involves balancing the right to freedom of expression with the need to protect individuals, especially children, from harmful content. While some may argue that censorship limits creativity and stifles freedom of speech, others believe that certain materials should be censored to maintain a safe and appropriate environment, particularly in places like libraries where children frequent.  It is important to consider the impact of offensive material on young minds, as exposure to inappropriate content can have lasting effects on their development. By censoring materials like music, movies, and magazines, we can ensure that children are not exposed to harmful language or images that may be confusing or distressing to them.  Ultimately, censorship is not about restricting freedom of expression but about promoting responsible and respectful communication. By taking steps to censor offensive material, we can create a better and more inclusive community where everyone feels safe and respected. Let us work together to make our cities and libraries welcoming spaces for all, by being mindful of the content we share and consume.
1211	4188	2	3	I do believe that certain materials should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive. Children should only have access to age-appropriate books, music, movies, and magazines. For example, movies like The Hangover, which contain explicit language, drug use, and other inappropriate content, should not be accessible to young viewers. Similarly, music with excessive profanity should be restricted from children. Magazines that focus solely on gossip and scandalous behavior should also be reconsidered for young audiences. By removing offensive materials from the shelves, we can ensure that children are not exposed to harmful content and are guided towards more positive and meaningful entertainment options. Ultimately, it is important to regulate what children are exposed to in order to promote a safe and healthy environment for their growth and development.
1212	4189	2	3	Offensive material like that should definitely be removed from the shelf. What if a child finds it? They might think it's the coolest thing they've ever seen. Children shouldn't be able to access this kind of material at all, especially from a place like a library. Somebody could easily pick it off the shelf not knowing what it is. If they start reading it and don't know what they're getting into, it would be their fault for picking it off the shelves. This kind of material should only be placed where it is welcome, not in libraries or public places like that. If the material was at a type of bookstore that was not meant for people under a certain age to go to, then it is meant to be on the shelf because children aren't allowed in that building, therefore they cannot see it unless it was brought out of the store to a household or something. Depending on where you go, if that material is on the shelf at a place that is not so public, and you pick it up and start reading or watching it, you have yourself to blame for not researching the book or the content of the material. If people want to get it, they can, but it would be at their own risk. Therefore, if the consumer takes it off the shelf, it's their risk of being offended. They cannot blame the place where the material was displayed.
1213	4190	2	3	Censorship is a topic that often sparks debate, especially when it comes to libraries. While some argue for the removal of adult sections to protect children, it is important to remember that these sections exist for a reason. Adults have the right to access uncensored material, whether it be books, movies, or magazines. It is not fair to punish adults by removing these sections because of mistakes made by children accessing them. Instead, the focus should be on educating children about appropriate boundaries and the importance of respecting designated areas. Ultimately, the adult section in libraries should remain intact, providing a space for adults to access a variety of materials without censorship. Let us not compromise the rights of adults for the sake of protecting children, but instead, find a balance that respects the needs of all library users.
1214	4191	2	3	I believe that all books and other materials should be kept on the shelves for everyone to access. Censorship is unnecessary, as individuals should have the right to choose what they want to read and learn about. Whether they encounter certain information now or later in life, they will still come across it eventually. It is important to respect others' freedom to explore different perspectives and ideas. In libraries and other public spaces, it is essential to allow individuals to make their own choices and not impose restrictions on their access to knowledge. Let us embrace the diversity of information and perspectives available to us, and trust individuals to make informed decisions about what they want to read and learn.
1215	4192	2	3	I believe that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials should be removed from the library. If people find something offensive, it can lead to issues, lawsuits, and a lack of respect for the library. By keeping customers happy and removing offensive content, the library can attract more guests and create a welcoming environment. Additionally, removing offensive materials can make individuals feel better about themselves and ensure that everyone is treated with respect. Resolving conflicts and issues without disrespect is essential in maintaining a positive and inclusive library environment. Ultimately, showing respect to others and addressing offensive content can help create a more welcoming and inclusive space for all visitors.
1216	4193	2	3	I do not believe that materials like books, music, movies, and magazines that some may find offensive should be removed from library shelves. Freedom of speech is a fundamental right, and just because something is deemed offensive by some does not mean it should be censored. Works of literature, music, and film are forms of expression, and individuals have the choice to engage with them or not. Removing offensive materials would not solve any underlying issues and would only limit access to diverse perspectives and historical context. People should focus on their own lives rather than trying to control what others can or cannot access in libraries. Ultimately, censorship is not the answer to addressing offensive content in society.
1217	4194	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic that is argued back and forth in today's society. It is something that we all should think about and voice our opinions about. I believe that items in a library should not be censored based on constitutional rights, the creation of gray areas, and the depletion of classic literature.   The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, clearly states the idea of freedom of the press. Not only does this give publishers the right to print whatever they please, but it also gives people a right to choose for themselves what they can and want to read. Censoring books in a library would be denying this right that is clearly spelled out in the Constitution. I refuse to support any idea that directly opposes the Constitution and the people of the country should be appalled that this sort of thing is even in discussion.  When it comes to censoring something based on how offensive something is, one always has to consider the gray areas that will be formed. For instance, what is offensive in one book may not be offensive to someone else who would benefit from reading it. The term 'offensive' is a relative one, in that the definition varies from person to person. No one thing can be deemed offensive by one hundred percent of the population and therefore no one thing can be removed without opposition. This creates areas of gray where there is no right answer. This would be extremely problematic for those trying to censor items within a library. Secondly, the decision on who would get to decide what is and is not offensive would cause as much controversy as the books themselves. Knowing that every person carries a different opinion, the people deciding would have to equally represent every person's opinion when making a decision, talk about problematic.  Finally, censoring books would eliminate classic literature and would deplete an understanding of the world through the eyes of great writers. For example, in Mark Twain's 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,' the 'n' word appears over one hundred times. Many readers take great offense at the use of this word. However, this book is seen as one of the century's greatest works and cannot be removed from the education of young people because of an offensive term. If people want to censor books, then censor them from their own children and not the children of others and inevitably an entire population.  In conclusion, the censorship of literature and other items in a library is not only impossible, but utterly unconstitutional. The idea of censoring items from children based on offense is not something that should be pursued.
1218	4195	2	3	There are many forms of entertainment in the world today, such as movies, magazines, newspapers, music, books, television, and radio. While these forms of entertainment may seem harmless to most, there are cases where they can be found offensive by certain individuals or groups. It is important to remember that what one person finds offensive, another may find inspiring or uplifting. Therefore, censorship in libraries or any other platform should be discouraged.  Censoring materials based on individual sensitivities would be a daunting task, as everyone has different views and perspectives. Removing all potentially offensive books, movies, or music would significantly limit the variety of content available to the public. Instead, individuals should have the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to, without imposing their preferences on others.  It is crucial to respect the diversity of opinions and tastes when it comes to entertainment. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it should be banned for everyone else. People have the autonomy to decide what aligns with their values and beliefs, and they can simply choose not to engage with content that offends them.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is unjustifiable. People should have the freedom to access a wide range of materials without the fear of censorship based on individual sensitivities. What may be offensive to one person could be enriching and enjoyable to another. Ultimately, it is essential to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and allow individuals to make their own choices when it comes to entertainment.
1219	4196	2	3	Living in today's society, there are many different people with diverse outlooks on the world. It is important to embrace this diversity and not restrict access to information. Each person can perceive a book, music, movie, or magazine differently, so it is narrow-minded to dictate what others should or should not know. Katherine Paterson's quote metaphorically uses a book and a shelf to emphasize the significance of passing down information through generations. Removing a book from the shelf indefinitely would limit the knowledge available to future generations. What may offend one reader could inspire another, as everyone has their own opinions and experiences. It is crucial to remember that individuals come from varied backgrounds and lifestyles. One book may not interest one person, but it could profoundly impact someone else, offering a different message or perspective. In a world where some see the glass as half empty and others as half full, it is essential to preserve diverse viewpoints and ideas. Restricting access to books would be like trying to create a world of identical robots programmed to think the same way. In our diverse community, it is impossible to remove books from the shelf. It is vital to celebrate the differences in people and embrace the variety of perspectives that literature can offer. In a world full of diverse individuals, it is crucial to allow everyone the opportunity to access information and form their own opinions.
1220	4197	2	3	I don't think they should be removed because in books tell you what it is about in the back. Movies tell you what it is rated. It is mom's or dad's fault. They are the one how allow us to read it, watch it, listen to it, or even play it. if they don't want us learn it then they should't even get for us and the reason they get it for us is because kids are spollied. they want every little thing in the world and the parants are buying it for them to make them happy.  The parants are not the only ones to blame. The kids are to blame to. They are the ones how want to go the rated @CAPS1 movies or get a rated @CAPS2 video games that have offensive language. kids also say offensive language to each other and suspect them to know what it means. The kids that heard the bad word will go to there parants and say 'what those that word mean'. It happen to me and I said those words to my parants.  When I fist read, heard, and watched it and told my parants what it means I got hit for saying that word. I thought to my self that they want to hear that from me. I was mad that i ever said that word I wished I can go back in time and never say that to my parants that. I don't know why I kept on saying it over and over. i just couldn't get it out of my head. I got in trouble by saying it just because I heard that stupid word that i wished never heard.  I heard it so many times I couldn't get out of my head it is like they knew what it ment but I knew they didn't know because they just said it randomly and I was preaty sure they didn't tell there parants because the one how told there parants got hit still woundering what it ment still having the red mark in there face thinking what they did wrong to deserve it. when I found out what it ment i never said it for a long time till someone got me so mad i started to say it again.  Now the two opinions still stands how should we blame the parants or the kids, should we take down the stuff that is offensive to us so the kids will learn the bad words? The choose is yours not mine beacuse it was mine i would blame the kids and no we shouldn't take it down stuff that has offensive language because for a lot of us we don't find it offensive to us or others. Just consider this 'what you decide people will be against it no matter what'.
1221	4198	2	3	Libraries across the world are facing the obstacle of censorship. Censorship has become a bigger deal in this day and age. It can affect books, music, movies, magazines, and many more. This poses the question: is censorship a good thing or is it bad?   Censorship allows certain books to be removed from the shelves of a library if a certain person finds the book to be offensive. Everyone has their own opinion about things so why should that affect what we are allowed to learn? What one person finds offensive could be perfectly fine with everyone else. Plus, you are not being forced to read something you don't want to. If you find it offensive, then one solution is very easy, don't read it!  Censorship not only affects the learner, it affects the writer. Censorship takes away the one thing a writer has, their freedom of speech. Writers create books, music, and magazine articles to voice their thoughts on topics, to show others how they see the world, and to share what has happened to them in their life. Because writers do this, it creates a connection with the reader that they can understand and relate to. Writers should be given the privilege to convey their thoughts to the world.  Even if you are able to put censorship on books and music at a library, you can't censor the internet. The internet has become a place where anyone around the world can find websites that they like, where there are books, music, magazines, and even shopping stores. A library is a public place just like the internet is public too. Everyone should be able to access it and enjoy what they like.  Putting censorship on things is almost equivalent to not letting a teacher teach because of their nationality or not letting our president give a speech because he is black. Censorship is based on an opinion someone has. It shouldn't affect the learners or the writers. Censorship holds back the voice of society and the thoughts of everyday people. Censorship should not even exist.
1222	4199	2	3	Libraries are often thought of as a room full of books inside a school building. On the contrary, they are all over the country, and are used by people of all ages. Because of that, I feel that there should not be a restriction on what books a library puts on their shelves. If the books and magazines are labeled, then a person can just stay away from what he or she finds offensive. However, in the case of a school library, all the books of course should be age appropriate.  Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean your neighbor won't. If someone finds a movie ridiculous and inappropriate, that doesn't mean someone else will too. Since all people are different, no one will like the same movies as the next person. Therefore, a personally offensive movie should not be removed from the shelves and prevent the enjoyment of another individual. That is the same with magazines, books, and anything available at a library.  Parental concern for their children is also a factor. However, if a public library has a section of books or magazines that is found to be offensive by a parent of a young child, I do not think that should require the library to remove the book. This is where I believe organization and limitations come in. The adult books and magazines that might be offensive for children should be in a section in a separate room, or on a different level of the building. That would prevent the accidental discovery by children. Along with organization, I think there should be a limitation, so that if a child was to purposely walk into that section and grab a book that was not appropriate, or offensive to the parent, then they would not be able to check it out at the desk from the librarian.  Outside of public libraries, the school libraries have a different requirement in my opinion. Elementary libraries of course, should contain no inappropriate material to any extent. All of the material in an elementary library should be strictly for education. At that age, children are far too young for any form of adult humor or magazine article. At the @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 level, I think things should change a little, but should still be much more strict than a public library, and contain absolutely no offensive content. I feel that magazines and joke books are welcome in the libraries of teenagers. Nothing that would be inappropriate for the school rules though of course.  Public libraries are a place for children and adults alike to find a book or movie to entertain themselves, and everyone has a different opinion. Because of that, there should be no restrictions in the public libraries, and you should be able to get the books or movies you want. Within a school corporation the environment changes, and the rules must be changed as well. Nothing offensive should be placed within a school library no matter how old the students are. Libraries should not be required to remove books from their shelves.
1223	4200	2	3	I don't think they should remove music, movies, magazines, etc. Taking away these forms of entertainment would leave people with nothing to do in their spare time, leading to boredom. If we had never experienced these sources of enjoyment, it might not be as big of a loss, but removing them now would be a huge blow. Imagine going on a long drive without music or magazines to pass the time; it would be incredibly dull. Ultimately, having access to music, movies, and magazines enhances our quality of life and should not be taken away.
1224	4201	2	3	Libraries hold more than just books, magazines, and movies... they hold history. With offensive material scattered throughout their shelves, the question arises: what is truly considered offensive? Everyone has a different perspective, making it difficult to determine what should be removed. Rather than censoring content, libraries could consider creating sections for potentially offensive material or marking books accordingly. Limiting library shelves would be detrimental, as it would result in the loss of valuable books. People may get offended, but that should not warrant the removal of books for everyone. In the end, it is essential to preserve the diversity of literature in libraries for the benefit of all readers.
1225	4202	2	3	Censorship has been a topic of much debate, with some advocating for government control to protect children, while others believe adults should have the freedom to choose what they are exposed to. While it is important for parents to be mindful of what their children see, completely sheltering them from offensive material may hinder their ability to navigate the challenges of adulthood. Similarly, adults who wish to avoid offensive content can simply choose not to engage with it, rather than advocating for censorship.   The idea of government control over media content is concerning, as it goes against the principles of freedom that our country was founded on. Giving the government power to dictate what is acceptable in media could erode our fundamental rights. It is up to individuals to decide for themselves what they find offensive, rather than relying on government intervention.   Ultimately, it is crucial for society to take responsibility for determining what they are exposed to, rather than relying on external forces to make those decisions. Our freedom of speech extends to what we see and hear, and it is essential to protect that freedom from government interference. It is time for us to take charge of our own choices and not rely on outside sources to dictate what is appropriate for us.
1226	4203	2	3	Have you ever felt that books are offensive? Maybe, but it all depends on who you are and what angers you. Some people think that books, music, movies, and other forms of media can be offensive in some way. I know they can, but it can only affect an amount of people if they together understand the problem. I think there are several reasons why and why not to take books out of our libraries. From what I hear, people do get angry over things, but the question is what gets them so angry? It is different for some people than others. For example, a fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them. That is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book. Others can get mad at a movie because it discriminates against races of other kinds. Like how in the past, some movies characterized certain groups as stubborn, ignorant human beings. In my view, actually being part of that group myself, it sort of aggravates me too, but nonetheless, we shouldn't argue because of one major amendment, freedom of speech. It depends on how it angers them as well, like how back in World War II, certain people were characterized in offensive ways. That can be offensive and is usually used to sway people to a certain side. If something offends you lightly, most of the time you shouldn't worry about it, but if you get offended very heavily and none of the things said about that topic are true, maybe you should get someone else to read it with the same dislikes and likes as you. That could help determine if it is truly offensive to people in general, not just you. Then the main question we would ask would be what should we do next? If a book offends me massively, I would contact the library it came from and ask them to review it, and if they think it is offensive, then they would more than likely take it off the shelves. Just because a book talks negatively about something you like, such as a sports team, doesn't mean you should report it to the library. Simply pick up another book and read it. I can understand how people will get mad over racism and discrimination, but not over a sports team. So I hope that people can someday understand the limit to where something can actually be offensive. Or maybe it's just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of. That is why I think that books should only be taken off shelves for very good reasons, not silly ones.
1227	4204	2	3	I believe that people are able to remove items such as books, music, movies, magazines, and other things from shelves because they need to use them. Access to these resources is essential for acquiring knowledge and solving real-life problems. People often lack the necessary memories to address various situations, so having access to a wide range of materials can be beneficial. Additionally, the desire to learn and increase one's knowledge drives individuals to seek out different sources of information. Overall, the ability to take items from shelves plays a crucial role in facilitating learning and personal growth.
1228	4205	2	3	Do you like what I like? Maybe and maybe not. What is or not offensive to you compared to other varies on both ends. Why? Everyone has their point of view. You @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree and we have others who do not care. There are many which includes: religious beliefs, having independence, and experimenting. Religious beliefs are important would you not agree? Certain material in this world maybe offensive to their own kind. Such as gay rights. This @MONTH1 apply to everyone else that they are not accepting it. For the ones who do accept it, you can tell they are open minded. Unlike the rebels going against it that is their own state of mind. I believe it is important you go along with your religious beliefs. Independence is what we are or what we assume to have or already have. Whether the music, movies, magazines, etc are offensive to others this has no effects to you. Why? It is because you know what is right and wrong. So what if all the non sense things @MONTH1 have caught your attention. Should you take control and get rid of it? No. It does not bother you. You take it as it is, being independent. Experimenting is self contained. As simple as it is you do it or do not. It is more than likey that people are/were under the influence. I, myself, have been in that siutation before. I'm known to be the crazy child in the family. My dad would always lecture me about being careful with who I hang with when I'm out. As a teenager I let those words pass by me. I was always the youngest out of the people I hung out with. Was I ever under the influence? Yes. Did I ever get hurt? No. I can and will say I experimented with life. Does it hurt to observe or experiment with the bad? It usually varies. Religious beliefs, it @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be disrespectful. To have independence, you are the one in control. Experimenting, that is a choice on your own. What is offensive to me @MONTH1 not be to you. I have my own state of mind and so do you.
1229	4206	2	3	I believe that the country should take off all the books, movies, magazines, and music that has any kind of offensive cover or any offensive content that could negatively impact children. Children should not be exposed to explicit material at a young age, whether it's through music, movies, or books. The inappropriate content in rap and hip-hop music, for example, with explicit lyrics about money, cars, girls, and sex, should not be easily accessible to children on the radio. Additionally, adult books containing explicit content should not be left around where children could stumble upon them. It's important for children to learn about sexual topics at an appropriate age, but they should not be exposed to pornography or explicit material at a young age. Removing these harmful materials from the streets and keeping them out of children's hands is essential for their well-being.
1230	4207	2	3	Banning books from libraries is a dangerous practice that undermines the fundamental right to freedom of speech and access to information. As Katherine Paterson aptly points out, if one person has the power to remove a book they find offensive, then everyone else could do the same, leaving no books left for anyone to read. This slippery slope could lead to a society where censorship prevails, and knowledge is restricted based on individual preferences. We must stand firm against the banning of books in libraries to uphold our constitutional rights and ensure that future generations have access to diverse perspectives and ideas. Let us not let the fear of offense dictate what we can and cannot read, but instead embrace the richness and diversity that literature has to offer.
1231	4208	2	3	One subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times to his or her own opinion.  I personally disagree with the concept.  Society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has systems in place to prevent such occurrences.  Enforced censorship goes against the principles of freedom enshrined in our constitution, and publications warning against censorship reveal the negative impact it can have on society.  However, there are already systems in place, such as age-appropriate sections in libraries and content advisory ratings in various industries, that provide a more acceptable form of moderation.  It is up to individuals to use these systems responsibly to prevent a situation where censorship becomes enforced and everyone is upset.  In conclusion, censorship should be approached with caution, and existing systems of moderation should be utilized to protect freedom of expression while ensuring appropriate content consumption.
1232	4209	2	3	The ideas conveyed by literature, music, and movies are an art that cannot be explained in any other way than themselves. Censorship is a problem that takes away the expression of human thought and emotion, leading to a loss of self-knowledge. Throughout history, the banning of books and media has led to the promotion of harmful ideologies, as seen in the actions of the Nazi regime. If we let our media get banned, we lose the right to have ideas of our own, ultimately leading to a general lack of understanding of who we are. In conclusion, censorship only serves to promote negativity and hinder personal growth through the expression of art.
1233	4210	2	3	What I think about that is that you have your own thoughts about a book, just because you don't like it doesn't mean that others won't. There may be something that you like in a book that you don't like in a movie, and there may be something that you like in a movie that others may not like in a book that doesn't mean that it should be taken off the shelf. About magazines if there are things in a magazine that you don't want to look at or have your children look at then yes they should be taken off the shelf. I mean come on now it's a library there should be certain things that are up there that's all I'm saying.
1234	4211	2	3	There are many different things in the media that are shown every day that can be offensive to some individuals. While everyone has the right to freedom of speech in a free country like ours, it's important to remember that what is said or portrayed in the media can have a significant impact on people. Some may argue that they are not personally offended by anything they see or hear in the media, but it's essential to consider that others may have different perspectives and experiences that shape their reactions.  It's true that media companies should not be held responsible for individual sensitivities, as they have the right to express their views and opinions. However, it's crucial for media outlets to be mindful of the potential impact of their content on diverse audiences. What one person may find harmless, another may find deeply hurtful or discriminatory. While it may not be reasonable to sue a company for offensive content, it's important for media creators to consider the broader implications of their work and strive to promote understanding and respect among their viewers and listeners.  Ultimately, while freedom of speech is a fundamental right, it's essential for media creators to approach their work with sensitivity and empathy towards diverse audiences. Offense may not be intended, but it's important to recognize the potential impact of media content on individuals and communities. By fostering a more inclusive and respectful media environment, we can work towards a society where everyone feels valued and respected.
1235	4212	2	3	Certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, and comics can be offensive to certain people. When we look at a comic and see that the writer of the comic has said something offensive, what may seem offensive to you may not be offensive to anyone else. Certain pictures or writings that seem full of knowledge and vibrance to you may be completely something else in someone else's eyes.  How many humans inhabit the world today? About 7.9 billion, researchers say. If you think about it, each and every one of those 7.9 billion minds thinks differently. If a librarian takes away the knowledge that you find so vibrant, it is like taking away a person's ability to learn.  In the world today, many teenagers and young adults are becoming more involved. What that teenager reads in that magazine article could spark a whole new reason to help the world. For all you know, the magazine could have gotten the young adult or scientist one step closer to finding the cure for cancer. How could you just take that away? Again, the magazine could be offensive to a person who may have cancer or a doctor who treats cancer, but will they be offended when their cancer is cured? Or when the doctor can successfully say that all of the cancer in your body has gone away?  If we take everything away that could possibly be offensive to other people, we might as well just take all the books, movies, magazines, and comics away that have ever been created. Once again, something that may be offensive to you would not be offensive to another person, because about 7.9 billion minds do not all think alike. If reading materials were taken away that are found offensive, our ability to learn and grow as humans might as well be taken away as well.
1236	4213	2	3	Culture and history are two very important aspects of the world, and libraries play a crucial role in preserving and providing access to this knowledge. Censorship of materials in libraries should not be allowed as it goes against the fundamental purpose of these institutions. While some may find certain topics offensive, it is essential to have access to all kinds of information, including controversial and uncomfortable subjects. By censoring materials, we risk losing valuable insights into our past and hindering our ability to learn from it. It is crucial to remember and acknowledge our history, both the good and the bad, in order to make informed decisions for the future. Libraries must remain unbiased and inclusive in their collection of materials to ensure that knowledge is accessible to all who seek it. Our ability to learn and grow as a society depends on our willingness to confront the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be. History should not be altered or hidden, but rather embraced as a tool for understanding and progress. Let us cherish the wealth of knowledge available in libraries and continue to preserve our cultural heritage for generations to come.
1237	4214	2	3	People of all ages have the right to read any material they choose, but parents may restrict their children from accessing certain content. Libraries should have clear age restrictions and sections to prevent children from being exposed to inappropriate material. It is important for children to be supervised in libraries to ensure they are not accessing harmful information about drugs, sex, violence, or pregnancy. Librarians should enforce these restrictions and prevent young children from checking out books that are not age-appropriate. By taking these measures, we can help protect children from being exposed to harmful content and promote a safe and educational environment in libraries.
1238	4215	2	3	I believe that libraries should have sections for adult books, with access restricted to those of age. However, I also strongly feel that libraries should offer a wide range of books for everyone in the community. While certain restrictions may be necessary for adult content, such as requiring someone of age to check out certain books, overall, libraries should be open and inclusive spaces for all readers. The only real limitation should be on age-appropriate material, with more explicit content kept behind the desk for access by adults. In conclusion, libraries should aim to provide a diverse selection of books without unnecessary restrictions, ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to explore different genres and topics.
1239	4216	2	3	What do we find offensive? In a library there are hundreds of materials that can be offensive to anyone. For example with movies there are horror, sci-fi, comedy, romance, adventure, etc. and all of them are offensive to someone. If we were to take down all of the movies that are offensive to a person all the movies would be taken off. Should we take all things that are offensive to us off the shelves, or leave them so people who do enjoy them do. I believe that we should leave these materials alone. It should not be right for us to choose what a public library should and shouldn't have on their shelves. If a person finds an item offensive, then they should ignore it, not make a big deal of it. Many people learn to keep their opinions to themselves but some do not. People who judge by what they don't like, tend to make themselves known. Ultimately, it is important to respect the diversity of opinions and preferences in a community, and allow individuals the freedom to choose what they want to engage with without imposing restrictions based on personal sensitivities.
1240	4217	2	3	Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society. Our lives have been taken over by political correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer our own. Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media. But now if something is found to be offensive in any way, it is essentially burned. Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our rights as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media.  The Constitution of the United States, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech. Censorship actively and violently violates that right. Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away. Our own words forced down our throats, never allowed to come out. Censorship ensures that no opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves. We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say. We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them. Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form.  Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world. In a way, this makes sense. We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life. We don't want them knowing what's happening behind closed doors. However, if we don't allow people to open these doors, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come. Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them.  We as people need knowledge. We live off of knowledge. And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media. Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually. It may not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp. Is this fair? Is this right? Is this helping us? How does cutting out knowledge ever help? It brings us backward in time, makes us fear. Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in society. This is wrong and immoral. It is unfair if nothing else. We should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists. No good comes from hiding it.  Lastly, this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways. Censorship is based off of offensiveness. If something could be offensive, it is disposed of. However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone. Therefore, everything and everyone should be censored to fulfill the goal of censorship. This means all media of any kind should be destroyed. No one should say anything. The world would be forced to be silent. All knowledge would be taken away. Chaos would ensue. The people's freedom would be completely taken away. This is our future if we allow censorship to continue. We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship.  Censorship is taking away our freedoms and rights, slowly stealing them away from us. It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and never be able to stop the very things that are being censored. Censorship is affecting society, ensuring that our freedoms are to be taken away. All knowledge will be trashed, and no one will be able to voice their opinions. A very dark future waits for us if censorship continues. Only by helping people understand censorship and the wrong it does to society can we gain back our freedom of speech; the freedom we are supposedly guaranteed, but censorship is desperately trying to take away.
1241	4218	2	3	Materials that are considered offensive should not be removed from library shelves. While some individuals may find certain materials objectionable, it is important to remember that these resources serve a purpose for research and information gathering. People have the option to simply ignore offensive materials if they come across them. Removing such materials could hinder the ability of others to access important information for their studies or personal interests. It is crucial to maintain a diverse range of materials in libraries to cater to the needs of all individuals, even if some may find certain items offensive. Ultimately, it is up to each person to decide how to react when encountering materials that they find offensive, whether it be reporting it or simply moving on.
1242	4219	2	3	To @CAPS1 it @DATE2 concern, @CAPS2 in life has to deal with something offensive towards them at least once. It @DATE2 be swear words in a popular song, or even people's behavior and actions on a regular basis. Be that as it @DATE2, nobody was made perfectly, and we all have to learn to cope with people's flaws. The library is for everyone; not just you specifically. Just like people's personalities we have to deal with different things that fit those specific personalities. @PERSON1's quote said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right...' @CAPS3 is a strong and truthful accusation, and I believe that things in a library should have some censorship, but up to a specific point.  We all realize that the biggest population of people in a library-- and perhaps the most innocent-- are children. Each parent has different values and standards for their child. What @DATE2 be offensive to one parent @DATE2 not be to another. If one mother thinks a book that talks about something she believes to be inappropriate to her children should be removed, another mother @DATE2 not. The first mother's opinion is different than everyone else; she could say she wanted @CAPS3 book removed from the library, but then so could the second mother about a different book. If everyone voiced their opinion on what books they didn't think were appropriate for their children, then we would 'have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' according to Katherine Paterson. I believe she is right. Besides, who is to say what is right for everyone?  Not one person has the same morals or values as another. For one person to declare what is right could highly offend another individual. I have dealt with situations like @CAPS3 before; everyone has. People tell me what they believe to be right, and I do not agree with them. It is simply a matter of everyday life; people's opinions and morals are going to clash. Everyone is different, and if one person doesn't like a certain magazine in the library, another person @DATE2 not like a different one. If we were to all voice our own opinion on what we want censored and what we don't, nothing would be left. The library shelves would be completely empty. Even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go, I do believe that there should be some censoring up to a certain point.  Taking into account everyone's diversification in @CAPS3 world, I do believe that there should be censorship up to a certain point. If something is in a book that a good majority of the population are against, I believe that the book, or books should be removed. I am not saying that because a couple of people weren't for a certain artist from the @DATE1 that it should be taken away at once. If it is a major issue that highly offends many people, it should not be in a public library. Libraries are for obtaining information, and for reading; not for brewing up offensive opinions on certain topics. There should be a certain limit on what is in a library, because there are things out there people really shouldn't be seeing or hearing. But it shouldn't get to the point where people can just remove books from the shelf at their own free will. Without some limit on censorship in a library, absolutely anything could be found there.  When we think of a library we don't think of things that are offensive. People view the library as a positive place, created for people's own personal enjoyment. That doesn't mean that we will never find something that @DATE2 offend us in some way there, but people should not be able to just remove books from the shelf because they don't agree with their morals. @CAPS2 is different, and nobody has the right to tell them what exactly is right or wrong, up to a certain point. I know from experience that it can be a tough thing to ignore sometimes, but we all seem to do it everyday with the people around us; we can't just choose to get rid of them. @CAPS2 wants to be comfortable, but sometimes we just have to deal with things in life like a book we don't deem appropriate. So I believe that in a way, an excessive amount of censorship on things in a library can be a bad thing. If we all could get rid of what we wanted in a library, there would be nothing left. After all, I wouldn't mind walking into a library with shelves full of magazines and books, instead of one completely empty.  Thank you.
1243	4220	2	3	Libraries are meant to provide a diverse selection of books, movies, music, and magazines for all individuals to explore and enjoy. While some may find certain materials offensive, it is important to remember that these items were created by individuals who put effort into their work. Instead of removing offensive materials from the shelves, they could be placed in separate sections with appropriate warnings to inform patrons of the content. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to exercise common sense and make informed choices when selecting items to borrow. Libraries should not be held responsible for individuals who choose to engage with offensive materials. By promoting awareness and providing clear guidelines, libraries can help patrons navigate the vast array of materials available to them.
1244	4221	2	3	I think censorship could be a good thing where there could be a room just for grown-ups. In the Dunkirk library, there is a room that has just adult books and kids cannot go in there without a parent. So whenever you go in there, your parents are with you. But I don't think you can check them out. If I had a kid, I would not want them to see that kind of stuff until they got older, so I think there should be separate rooms. When they are older and matured, they could go in there and see the books and maybe one day check them out and read one of them. But on the other hand, why not leave them on the shelf for kids to see because if not, they're going to see it elsewhere or from other people. Then they go home asking their mom what this means, why not let them learn on their own from a book. Some people would agree with that, but some would disagree. Maybe there should be rooms for different books, and you can go in them whenever you want, or maybe there should be rules that you can't go in there without a parent. I don't know what to do; maybe there should be a vote between people if they like it or not. But some people would be mad over that, so if you choose one, someone would not like it or something like that. My opinion is to just keep the books there and let the kids find out on their own. Some people would think I'm a bad parent, but would you want your child to find out somewhere else?
1245	4222	2	3	Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is a @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and the @CAPS1 to Write. The author obviously had a purpose to write the novel, compose the music, or to deliver the movie. There will always be items that will be offensive to some people, but to others there is a meaning behind it.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind. That @CAPS1 allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music, or in a movie. Sure there @MONTH1 be some parts that @MONTH1 be inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or a movie, but that doesn't mean the whole item will be inappropriate. Some people might think some things can be offensive while others don't at all. There maybe somethings out there in this world that you @MONTH1 think are offensive, but have you stood up and told that company yourself?      Being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the @CAPS1 to write. With that you can't be told not to do so. For example, the '@CAPS6' magazine maybe offensive to an abundent number of parents who don't want their kids to look at it, but that magazine isn't intended for children to look at. That magazine's purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy. It's not to be offensive to anyone and that company has the @CAPS1 of write to publish such a thing. The @CAPS1 to write serves its own purpose to all of the writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in a journal or to write a note.      I bet there has been a novel, a piece of music, or a movie that you just love. Well within it there most likely was a piece of information that was inappropriate, but would you like to see that taken off of the shelf? For example, I once read a series when I was in middle school that had inappropriate content about sexual interaction, but that series is what every girl wanted to read. If they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then I know plenty more novels that would be gone as well.         What would you say if there was nothing left on the shelves to read, listen to, or to watch? Without items such as books we could have a hard time learning new stuff all the time. These are the items that teach us new things everyday. Would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read, watching movies or @CAPS7 shows, or listening to music? It would be a very hard thing to get used to in today's society. We rely on such things @NUM1 to get us through the day and teach us things we were never taught.     Disagreeing with the quote that Katherine Paterson stated is one way to use @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 by stating my view of removing inappropriate items off of shelves. Removing items of the shelves won't solve the proplem of having too much inappropriate usage in today's society. If everything that had some kind of inapporpriate content in it removed from shelves, we would have a hard time finding a novel to read, music to listen to, a magazine to enjoy, and a movie or @CAPS7 show to watch. Lots of schools rely of books to read and without a book childrens vocabulary could have a great downfall.  Think about it...what would you be able to do in your free time if we had no more books, movies, magazines, or music.
1246	4223	2	3	Books, magazines, movies, music, etc, are all good to read, watch or listen to. When I listen to music or watch movies or even read books sometimes, I wonder how people come up with these ideas. The real reason is why people listen to music, read books, watch movies are so offensive. In today's world, there is music with all this negative content about people, talking about people, with curse words. It's not a good look for the people who create the music or for the people who listen to it. I believe that such content should not be allowed on the shelves and should be removed. Parents do not want their young children exposed to such negative music. If they grow up listening to it, they may emulate the behavior in the songs.   Movies, on the other hand, should not be removed from the shelves. Movies can be funny, scary, sad, and sometimes need to have offensive elements to make the story engaging. One of my favorites is a movie where characters from the past come together for one last mission. The movie may have offensive content, but it is still enjoyable because of the action, good characters, and storyline. Movies should not be removed from the shelves because without offensive content, they would not be as entertaining. People should be able to go to the movies with their friends and have a good time. When selecting movies for children, parents should choose appropriate ones for their age.   In conclusion, music is not necessarily a bad thing to listen to, but it is essential to be mindful of the content and not get into trouble trying to imitate what is portrayed in the songs. As for movies, they should continue to be made with a variety of themes and elements to keep audiences entertained. Let's keep the shelves stocked with good movies and music while being cautious about the content we consume.
1247	4224	2	3	People go to the library to find certain types of material. Some people get offended by some of the material and feel that it should be removed. However, certain materials should not be removed just because they are offensive to some individuals. History, for example, may contain offensive content such as racism, but it is crucial for people to learn about these aspects of the past in order to understand the world we live in today.   History classes are designed to educate people about the past, including events that may be uncomfortable or offensive. Removing offensive material from libraries would hinder people's ability to learn about important historical events and could lead to a lack of understanding about the reasons behind certain societal issues.   While some materials may contain offensive content such as sex and violence, it is important for libraries to have clear labeling so that individuals can make informed choices about what they choose to read or view. If someone finds certain material offensive, they have the option to avoid it rather than calling for its removal.   In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from libraries simply because it may offend some individuals. History, even if it contains uncomfortable truths, is essential for people to learn from the past and shape a better future. It is important for libraries to provide access to a variety of materials while also giving individuals the freedom to choose what they want to engage with.
1248	4225	2	3	I believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves just because they are offensive to a few individuals. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another, and everyone has the choice to avoid content that they find objectionable. It is important to consider individual beliefs and preferences when it comes to consuming media. Taking offensive content off the shelves could lead to a slippery slope where everything is eventually deemed offensive by someone. It is crucial to listen to both sides of the story and consider the perspectives of different individuals before making decisions about what should be available for consumption. In conclusion, it is essential to maintain a diverse range of content available for people to choose from, while also being respectful of differing opinions and sensitivities.
1249	4226	2	3	Movies, music, and literature in today's society are filled with subliminal messages of sex, drugs, and violence. The innocence of the youth is being destroyed by the constant exposure to these harmful themes. Music, specifically rap and hip-hop, often glorifies these negative aspects, influencing young listeners. Magazines and articles also promote similar content, with explicit material becoming more common. Movies, a timeless form of entertainment, are not exempt from this trend, as many films contain scenes of violence or sexual content. Libraries, which provide access to all these forms of media, need to exercise stronger censorship to protect children from being exposed to inappropriate material. The more children are exposed to these messages, the more likely they are to believe such behaviors are acceptable, leading to the erosion of innocence. It is imperative for parents and society as a whole to be more vigilant in monitoring the media consumed by children to preserve their innocence and moral values.
1250	4227	2	3	Why would you ever censor anything in a library? Apparently because things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. can be found offensive. If something is considered offensive, why put it in a library anyway if it's going to be open to anyone in the public, including children?  First off, censorship is important but we don't need it in libraries of all places. Libraries are a place where all sorts of literature come together in one place where it can be seen and read by those who admire literature. Censorship is stopping this by pulling books off shelves because they are considered offensive. If a book is offensive, first decide what kind of audience it would be offensive to. Then decide whether or not it is offensive to even an adult audience. If it is found to be offensive to an adult audience, then it should be pulled off the shelves of a library. Otherwise, it should be placed in the adult section of the library.  Libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other pieces of literature. As mentioned before, if a book is too offensive for anyone not of adult audience, it should be placed in an adult section. Books that are suitable for children should be put in the children's section. You can even have such a section for young adults for books that are suitable for teenagers. Sections in a library almost completely defeat the need for censorship. Sections help correctly place books and other pieces of literature in a library so that only readers of certain suitable ages can read them.  In conclusion, sections in a library can be used instead of censorship. If we were to censor what books were on the shelves in a library, then eventually there will be hardly any books for anybody. Sections help keep books in a library, but keep them in a place where the right audience can view them.
1251	4228	2	3	As a student at a public school, the libraries that I and many other students have access to are censored to an extent. With our library being censored I do not feel that the public library should be. Why is censorship a conflict in need of discussion; every book found on a shelf is a part of history so every author that was good enough to get published should be able to have their book on a shelf. While school libraries are already censored for their age group; I feel that public libraries should not be censored for the plain reason that you, your guardian, but also the library has control over what they find age appropriate. If disliking the book is a problem; then put it back. Find something more common towards your own interest. Some things may be considered inappropriate as many things are, but at the same time each person has their own limits to this. While someone may dislike a teen magazine because of how it affects youth, another may find it inspiring. If every person found a way to rate things according to their own taste, there would be nothing left on the shelves; as Katherine Paterson expressed in her quote.  When you enter a public library; it is divided into sections according to interest, age, author, etc. When you enter a school library it is done according to fiction, non-fiction and author. Censorship among public libraries is not needed. Adults, students, and children all go to a public library. So, as the case may be why would you censor a library that goes for all ages. I feel that yes an elementary, or high school library should not contain the same content as a college library. But a public library, is for the public. Hints the name.  In conclusion, if even more censorship was done to public libraries, libraries would be used less than they already are. Some of the content in public libraries can't be found in school libraries, but also adults wouldn't be able to find the content needed for their own interests, jobs, or even schooling. So as the fact may be that some things may seem inappropriate to certain age groups, it can help someone in a completely different age group.
1252	4229	2	3	I personally believe that there shouldn't be a whole lot of censorship in libraries, except for things such as complete smut and pornography. However, there are many different beliefs on this subject. Some parents may think it's necessary to control every bit of information a child takes in, while others are more forgiving.  The main conflict with this issue is how different everyone's restrictions are. A lot of parents believe that if any politically incorrect information enters their child, he/she will be corrupted for life, but that is completely false. Nowadays, almost every single person goes through something traumatic, witnesses something illegal, gets involved in drama, experiments sexually, and/or experiments with drugs. The truth is, it's everywhere, and your kids have already experienced it and are used to it. Reading one book with a couple of curse words here and there, or an intimate moment isn't going to ruin your child because chances are, he/she is already doing it all in real life. It may even be happening in your own home, and there is nothing that can be done to stop it. Trying to control our lives as if it were your own provokes kids to rebel even more when the chance arises.  I say don't worry about censorship in libraries except for the obvious things like pornography, sex novels, racist books, etc. Maybe if we quit hiding so much from the more mature teenagers and quit treating them like toddlers, they wouldn't go looking as much for all of the 'bad' things out there. Parents need to quit thinking they can get their child to believe there is nothing bad in the world. If they aren't aware of the mistakes that can be made and the consequences from it, they won't know what to do if they find themselves in a similar situation as one of the characters in one of these 'offensive' books.  In conclusion, a little exposure to mature content in books can actually help teenagers understand the world better and make more informed decisions. Censorship should be limited to extreme cases like pornography, and parents should trust that their children can handle reading about real-life issues in literature.
1253	4230	2	3	Offensive content in books, music, magazines, movies, and commercials can be harmful, especially to younger audiences. While some may not find certain material offensive, it is important to consider the impact it may have on children and those who hold different beliefs. Parents may not want their children exposed to certain themes, such as violence, drugs, alcohol, or explicit language. It is our responsibility to protect and guide the younger generation until they are able to make their own informed decisions.  Religion also plays a significant role in shaping our views on what is acceptable or not. Contradictions between media content and personal values can be confusing, especially for impressionable individuals. Ratings systems exist to provide guidance, but they may not always be enforced effectively. Creating designated areas for adult content in libraries and movie rental stores can help respect the preferences of those who disagree with certain material.  Personal experiences, like the one shared about a young sibling repeating inappropriate language from a movie, highlight the potential negative impact of exposure to offensive content. By shielding children from such material until they are mature enough to understand and interpret it appropriately, we can help cultivate a more respectful and well-mannered society.  In conclusion, while opinions on what constitutes offensive content may vary, it is essential to prioritize the well-being and development of younger generations by limiting their exposure to potentially harmful material. By instilling values of respect and discernment early on, we can contribute to a more harmonious and considerate community.
1254	4231	2	3	"The book called ""The Fighter"" is about a young high school student who faces bullying and decides to take up boxing and wrestling to defend himself. In the end, he stands up to his bullies and fights back. I believe this book should be kept on the shelves as it portrays a life-changing experience for the protagonist. Many readers may find solace and inspiration in this story, just like I have. It's important to give every book a chance, as you never know what you may end up loving until you read it from cover to cover."
1255	4232	2	3	When you go into a library have you ever seen the many subjects people write about? Some from their own experience and some made up. I personally disagree that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed. The authors or producer of these sort of entertainment were made to be read, hear or watched by people that are interested in them! Also if the libraries are having diffculties with the complainments towards the offensive materials they should just make a separate section.     To begin with, why are books, music, movies, and magazines produced for? Easy one! To entertain us; to expand our knowledge on things; to let us have intrest. If none of these things were invented, life would be boring, now i'm not saying we need these offensive materials, i'm saying it's there so we can think bigger about topics instead of them same-o-same-o. Producer produced 'offensive' material to catch attention and to be read, not so they can sit on the far back of library where nobody goes just because it has some things others @MONTH1 not like. If you don't like those type of things, stay away from them, don't bother reading or listening to them! Why should libraries stop the people that made those things from making money? Does that seem right to you? It's bad enough they're sencond guessing if they're good enough to be shelve worthy. There's many books out there that are horible and a waste of time reading it, so should they be removed to? Think about that one.     Secondly, I disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section. It @MONTH1 cost money, but what's more better loosing tons of costermers or finding extra room? Libraries are very big already and i'm sure they could find a little bit more room, they separate everything into genres already.     Although I see where others come from about removing these kinds of  materials from shelves. There @MONTH1 be some cautious parents that don't want their children exposed to that sort of stuff. Teenagers especially, they @MONTH1 get ideas of the language and scenes from these sort of stuff. I once read a story about a man that read a book one of his old pals from college wrote about killing women and teering there inside out, this man got a idea to do it to his mother. He beat his mom and cut her body open, leaving the insides on the outside lawn. The man is in jail now and the book was removed from shelves. Still I don't think it should have been removed because an imature, ignorate person thought it would be cool to do it. The book was made up and the guy was most likely dellusional and sick in the head to do it. And because of his actions and author has to suffer from money lost and big waste of his time and effort he put into it.     In conclusion no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive. Some people just have ignorance to not understand the books, music or movies was made for entertainment for those who like that kind of stuff exposed. Like i've said recently it was made to be either read; heard; or watched. A separate section would be a great idea.
1256	4233	2	3	All terms of offense are based on an opinion. If one person finds a particular word offensive, it doesn't mean the next guy will feel the same way. Some parents aren't as strict on their kids as others, and some just don't care.  Of course, there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and women being objectified that kids really don't need to be listening to. The horror movies that are rated 'R' for a reason, they could have nightmares for weeks. Children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age like ten. They still can't tell what's real and what's not. They need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel, to act, to do, even to think. Children just aren't mature enough to handle a majority of material in this world. No books should be taken away or hidden from society; it should just be given to you at your own discretion. Another possibility would be to have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particular material. All information is helpful, just not all is necessary.  These days it's hard to hide all harmful material from children, even some teenagers. This world is becoming less and less sensitive every day. Eventually, everyone will be completely insensitive to all 'harmful' movies, books, magazines, TV shows, and music. It won't even faze anyone anymore.
1257	4234	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic that garners mixed opinions. While some believe it is necessary to protect young readers from inappropriate content, others argue that libraries should offer a wide range of materials for all audiences. A community library is meant to cater to the diverse needs and interests of its patrons, which may include both children and adults. It is important for parents to monitor their children's reading choices and guide them towards age-appropriate material. Ultimately, the goal of a library is to provide access to a variety of books and resources, while also promoting responsible reading habits. Therefore, censorship in libraries should be approached with a balance that respects individual freedoms and safeguards the well-being of young readers.
1258	4235	2	3	Has anyone ever stopped to consider the negative consequences of censoring books? When individuals find certain content offensive, their immediate reaction is often to try to remove the book from libraries. However, banning books based on personal offense goes against the principles of freedom of expression and diversity of thought. If a book offends a particular group, they can simply choose not to read it, rather than preventing others from accessing it.   If we were to censor books that offend certain groups, where would we draw the line? Every individual has different beliefs and sensitivities, making it impossible to please everyone. Censoring books would limit the variety of literature available and hinder creativity in society. Imagine a world where only approved, inoffensive books are allowed - it would stifle imagination and innovation.   Censorship may provide a temporary solution to discomfort, but in the long run, it restricts intellectual growth and exploration. People should have the freedom to choose what they read and form their own opinions. By embracing diverse perspectives, we can foster a more open-minded and culturally rich society. Let's not let censorship hinder our ability to learn, grow, and think creatively.
1259	4236	2	3	To be honest, if I were a librarian, I would follow the state laws regarding the display of magazines in the library. If the state allows them to be on the shelves, then all students should have the opportunity to check them out. Magazines provide a way to stay updated on current events and trends, which can be valuable for students. Just like checking out a book requires a reading comprehension test, students could be asked to read an article from a magazine and write an essay on it. This would not only encourage reading but also enhance their critical thinking and writing skills. By incorporating magazines into the library collection, students can have access to a wider range of information and perspectives.
1260	4237	2	3	Many things such as books, music, magazines, etc., can influence children's behavior, but the most significant impact often comes from what they watch on television. Children may mimic what they see on TV, especially if they feel that their parents are not monitoring their viewing habits. Therefore, it is essential for parents to be vigilant about the content their children are exposed to on television.  While books, movies, and magazines can also contribute to children's behavior, it is crucial to recognize that television has a more immediate and powerful influence on them. Children may be more likely to imitate what they see on TV, as they often perceive it as acceptable or cool behavior.  In conclusion, it is important to consider the impact of various forms of media on children's behavior. While it is essential to monitor what children read and watch, special attention should be paid to the influence of television. By being mindful of the content children are exposed to on TV, parents can help guide them towards more positive behavior.
1261	4238	2	3	I have read a few books that I don't approve of, and I feel that I have the right to remove these books from the shelves. However, I believe that instead of banning or removing books, there should be a strict age limit on the books in libraries. There should be separate sections for different age groups to ensure that children do not have access to inappropriate content.   Similarly, I believe that while music should not be banned from libraries, there should be designated areas where it can be played to respect those looking for a quiet environment. Setting rules and age limits in libraries can help ensure that everyone can enjoy the resources available without being exposed to content that is not suitable for them. Overall, I see the value in everything that a library has to offer, as long as proper guidelines are in place and followed.
1262	4239	2	3	"They should be allowed to be removed because some books are offensive. Even if they are offensive, they can teach young teenagers about their past. The books could be about the KKK or the Holocaust. Some young teens like to read books like this so they can learn and see what people went through. The books could be a school assignment. If your teenage child is interested in the history or the violence of the past, you should allow them to read what they want. Some books such as ""Night"" and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" are great to read for school assignments. These books are very helpful to read because you can learn about your history and about the wars at the same time. The library should give the child a certain amount of time to return the book. If the child does not return the book in that amount of time, they should be charged for every day it is late. If the book is damaged, they should be charged for it. The book should be in the condition it was in when it left so other people can check it out after it is returned. The library should keep certain books at the library such as the Bible and college books. The library should allow six books to each person. Instead of three or four, this would keep books on the shelves and prevent people from losing books. People under twenty should not be allowed to check out movies or music. They should have to show ID to prove they are over twenty. There should be more rules than just being quiet in the library; they should make people start keeping books at the library and only allow them to take home three or six books. Magazines should never be checked out."
1263	4240	2	3	I think they shouldn't be pulled off the shelves because everyone has different opinions. One person may think a book is offensive, but the next may not. Some people may find books with references to God or Jesus offensive, but that could simply be because it is not their religion. If every person removed a book they found offensive, there would be no books left, as people think differently. Others may dislike books due to violence and gore, but these may be favorites for some readers, so it would be unfair to remove them. The variety of books reflects diverse perspectives on what is right and wrong, and it is important to respect differing opinions in a society that values freedom of expression.
1264	4241	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic that sparks debate among people of different backgrounds and cultures. While some argue that certain books or materials may be offensive and should be removed, others believe that censorship limits access to important information and diverse perspectives. It is important to consider the impact of censorship on education, history, and the freedom of expression. While some individuals may find certain materials uncomfortable or upsetting, it is essential to recognize the value of different viewpoints and experiences in shaping our understanding of the world. Ultimately, censorship in libraries should be approached with caution, as it has the potential to restrict access to valuable resources and stifle important conversations.
1265	4242	2	3	We as individuals have the freedom to express ourselves and access information as long as it complies with the law. Removing books from libraries due to their controversial content restricts our understanding of the past and hinders our ability to learn from historical mistakes. By censoring literature, we risk distorting the reality of our history and preventing future generations from gaining valuable insights.  Censorship may be appropriate in certain forms of media to protect young audiences, but when it comes to literature, it is essential to preserve the integrity of the text. Books serve as a reflection of the society in which they were written, including the use of language and depiction of sensitive topics like slavery. Changing or removing these elements erases important lessons and truths that should not be forgotten.  The concept of censorship in libraries undermines the purpose of these institutions as repositories of knowledge and diverse perspectives. It is crucial to uphold the freedom of access to information, especially when it comes to understanding the complexities of our shared history. By allowing literature to remain uncensored, we ensure that future generations have the opportunity to learn from the past and make informed decisions in the future.
1266	4243	2	3	"In my perspective, I believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should be prioritized in a critical manner. Each of these mediums offers a unique insight into various aspects of society, allowing individuals to gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. While some may prefer content that aligns with their interests or beliefs, others may seek out material that challenges the status quo and encourages critical thinking.  I think it is essential to keep these forms of media accessible to the public, as they can shed light on important issues that might otherwise go unnoticed. For example, I once listened to a song in Spanish called ""The Ruler"" that highlighted the rampant corruption in a particular country. The lyrics spoke of the disparity between the wealthy elite and the struggling working class, emphasizing the need for societal change.  By exposing audiences to diverse perspectives and thought-provoking content, books, movies, music, and magazines play a crucial role in fostering dialogue and promoting social awareness. Removing such material from circulation would limit our ability to engage with challenging ideas and hinder our progress towards a more informed and empathetic society. It is essential to preserve these forms of expression and allow them to continue sparking important conversations about the world we live in."
1267	4244	2	3	I believe that everyone's opinion deserves to be publicized fairly. Just because one person's view is considered to be right, doesn't mean another is wrong. What is offensive to one person may be informative to another.  I've read a lot of books that parents may not pick out for their children. In reading these books I see that there is no glamour in doing drugs or getting in trouble with the law. For some teens, books like these can show them the side of life they haven't experienced and find that they never want to.  If a book is too explicit for children, simply place the book in another section. I realize that there are books with graphic sexual details, and those should only be permitted to be checked out by adults. Parents should have concerns about their children's innocence. But I also believe that they should watch over what type of books they're reading to monitor the vulgarity of them.  Some songs contain profanity or sexual innuendos, some contain praise and worship, others even have screaming. Any of these types of music can be found offensive by someone. That doesn't mean to run off and hide all of them. There'd be no music left.  Not everyone shares the same opinions in this world, therefore there should be equal opportunity for people to read, watch, or listen to whatever suits them. I'm not saying that there should be a stock of porn in the library, but if there are movies or books about shunned religions or beliefs then they should be just as welcomed as the ones about common religions and beliefs.  Everyone finds different things offensive. If there was a bible in the library and someone found it offensive, should it be removed? It's one of the most popular books in the world, yet some people still find offense by it. Someone who is Mormon, Muslim, or atheist might find it offensive if there is nothing in the library about them because some people find it offensive.  The library is a place of knowledge, not judgement. I don't believe that certain books should be removed from the library if they offend someone. If you don't like something that is at the library, don't rent it. If you don't want your children to, don't let them. Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech. Authors express themselves through books and articles, directors through movies, and musicians through their music.
1268	4245	2	3	I believe that if it has offensive language then it shouldn't be left on the shelf. Also, it really does matter if it has offensive language because you don't know who, where, when your child is going to learn offensive words. Another important aspect is that children may mimic what they hear, so exposing them to offensive language can lead to them using it as well. It is crucial for parents to be mindful of their own language and behavior as children tend to emulate their parents. Additionally, media that promotes negative stereotypes or discrimination based on characteristics such as race, appearance, or language can have harmful effects. In conclusion, both the content of the material and parental guidance play a significant role in shaping a child's behavior and language use. Parents must be vigilant in monitoring the media their children consume and set a positive example through their own actions and words.
1269	4246	2	3	Every parent wants to protect their child's innocence. They do not want their children to come in contact with things that might influence their decisions. The truth is though that they are going to run into these types of things eventually, whether it be from other kids at school, what they see on television, or what they see on the internet. It is their choice as of what decisions they are going to make, so I do not think libraries should be censored due to the content of the material.  One reason libraries should not be censored is because nobody is forcing a person to pick up material that might have offensive content. It is all about choices. There are a lot of other options on the shelves that do not include such topics. Some people may want to read or watch something with such content. Taking these pieces out of libraries would not be fair to them. People should have the option to read or watch what they wish. Censoring libraries would take away these people's right to such topics.  Another reason libraries should not be censored is that eventually nothing would be left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' This is a very true statement. After one censoring, people might still think topics are inappropriate, and the libraries would have to be censored again and again until there is nothing left. People eventually will not be able to use libraries. Losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to that resource.  A final reason that libraries should be left uncensored is the difference of opinions. What may be offensive to one person might not be to another. How would what should be gotten rid of and what should not be decided? It would be much easier to just leave the people to make their own decisions on what okay to read and watch and what is not. Nobody is forcing people to pick up a book or magazine that is going to offend them. If you do not like what is being discussed, do not read or watch it. It is as simple as that.  There are many more reasons libraries' content should not be censored, but here are three reasons that are obvious. Censoring libraries are going to eliminate a person's choice. It will cause problems, as to what is appropriate and what is not. Eventually libraries will have nothing left. Of course every parent wants to protect their child, but eventually they are going to grow up and have to make their own choices. Censoring libraries is not going to stop children from learning about offensive things. All you can do as a parent is raise them well and hope that you have taught them right from wrong.
1270	4247	2	3	I think censorship of certain materials, books, music, magazines, etc., that are offensive should be removed from people who have yet to mature, unless a parent or guardian approves of it. Censorship can protect young individuals from negative influences that may impact their character and personality. Children should not be exposed to inappropriate content that could lead them to engage in harmful behavior. For older individuals, such as high school students, censorship should still be considered, but with the understanding that they have matured and can make informed decisions with parental consent. Ultimately, censorship serves as a tool to shield individuals from harmful content until they are ready to handle it responsibly.
1271	4248	2	3	Everyone has the right to choose what they like to read, listen to, or watch. Just because one person may find something offensive or inappropriate, it doesn't mean that it should be removed from libraries or stores. People have different tastes and preferences, and what may not appeal to one person could be valuable or enjoyable to another. It's important to respect diverse opinions and recognize that every book, music, or movie has its own purpose and meaning. So, let's embrace the variety and uniqueness of different forms of media, as it adds color and richness to our lives.
1272	4249	2	3	I believe that people should not be able to remove books, movies, magazines, etc. from shelves of the libraries. If someone finds a piece of work offensive, they should contact the author and express their concerns. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and beliefs, and they have the right to voice them. People can read summaries on the covers of books or movies to determine if they want to engage with the content further. It is important to respect differing viewpoints and engage in constructive dialogue. If someone strongly disagrees with a piece of work, they can choose not to consume it and instead create their own content to express their perspective. Keeping all materials available allows for a diverse range of voices and ideas to be heard and respected. Freedom of expression is essential in fostering a society where individuals can share their thoughts and beliefs without fear of censorship. Let's embrace the diversity of ideas and perspectives that exist in our world.
1273	4250	2	3	To whom it may concern: The idea of censoring books, music, movies, or any form of media is concerning due to the implications it has on freedom of speech, religious conflicts, and potential future issues. Censorship restricts the rights of writers to express their ideas and can lead to a suppression of differing beliefs. Additionally, censorship based on personal offense can lead to unnecessary bans on content that may not be universally problematic. The line between state and religion can become blurred, causing conflicts between different religious groups and potentially resulting in the banning of religious texts. Moreover, censorship can extend to marginalized communities, such as the LGBTQ+ community, leading to the loss of important resources for those individuals. Ultimately, the decision to censor content must be carefully considered, taking into account the impact it may have on freedom of speech and the potential consequences for society as a whole.
1274	4251	2	3	Devin, do you like the library? There is always an argument about how books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if people find them offensive. Which brings me to libraries; there is always the choice of a different library to choose from. You also don't have to look at the book or watch the movie. Being an author you have the freedom of speech, you can write whatever you feel like writing.  First, is your choice of library. There are several different libraries in one town. Some have children's sections, where all the books are appropriate for young children to read. Parents need to keep an eye on what their child will be reading or looking at. There are at least twenty to thirty libraries in one location, so you always have a different option.  Second, you don't have to read the book or watch the movie. If you see something you don't like about the book, why complain about it? Just put the book down, someone else might be interested in the book. You have the freedom to pick out the book.  Lastly, is the freedom of speech of the author of the book. Being a citizen you have the right to write down whatever you want to write down. So people do not have the right to blame the author for what he or she writes down. Many people have been inspired by certain books that throughout history have been controversial. Where would we be without those books and authors?  I have given you three reasons on the view of censorship in libraries. You have the choice of libraries, you don't have to read the book, and the author has the freedom to write what they choose.
1275	4252	2	3	Hiding the harsh realities of the world from individuals is not morally justifiable. Each person has the right to access information and make their own decisions based on that knowledge. It is important for individuals to be aware of the challenges and issues present in society in order to make informed choices. By attempting to shield people from difficult truths, we inhibit their ability to fully participate in shaping the world around them. It is crucial for everyone to be exposed to a wide range of perspectives and information, even if it may be uncomfortable or challenging. Ultimately, the collective knowledge and understanding of society are what drive progress and positive change.
1276	4253	2	3	The author Katherine Paterson emphasizes the importance of encouraging children to read by grabbing books from the library shelves. In a school in Warsaw, the principal decided to remove library materials due to lack of interest from the community. However, it is crucial for parents to take the initiative in promoting reading habits among children. If I were the principal, I would not remove any books from the library, as reading plays a vital role in a child's development. It is essential for parents to instill a love for reading in their children from a young age, as it helps them learn and grow. Ultimately, parents should take the lead in fostering a reading culture at home and in schools.
1277	4254	2	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2,  I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someone's development.  First off, you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published and it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a library at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.  Movies nowadays have come a long way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the library though. In all honesty, I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do some things like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult-only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.  In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam-packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines can be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that can show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at any time but other magazines that have an educational approach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand, you have to take a more careful approach to music.  Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a library because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can understand why they are taken off the shelves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.  In conclusion, censorship should not be done. Yes, there are some things that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained
1278	4255	2	3	Have you ever been reading something that made you mad? Well, to be honest I can't remember the last time I walked into a library and found something there that could have offended somebody. But that's just me, I'm sure that there is stuff out there that could really get to a person. No, I don't think that materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People go to libraries to find out information on stuff that they don't know. If you are checking something out then you already know that there is a possibility of something that you don't agree with. I think it should be nobody's business other than the person checking it out. Now, I'm not the type to get all frustrated or upset from something that I have seen on a shelf, but I could imagine that there are people out there who are like that. If I had found something that I disagreed with, I would not read it or just think nothing of it. I also think that you should be prepared before walking into a public place where they have all kinds of reading material. To you it may be offensive, but to others, it's hilarious. All I'm trying to say is don't get all upset over something that you have read.
1279	4256	2	3	Books are written for a reason, and the words within them are carefully chosen by the author to convey a specific message. While some books may contain offensive language, it is important to consider the intent behind the words. Changing or censoring these words could alter the overall meaning of the book. However, it is also important to acknowledge that some readers may find certain words offensive and may choose not to read a book because of this. Providing warnings about offensive language on book covers could help readers make informed decisions about their reading choices. Ultimately, it is essential to strike a balance between freedom of expression and respecting the sensitivities of readers.
1280	4257	2	3	Libraries are a center of learning and provide a wealth of information for all. Taking out offensive material from libraries would limit access to diverse perspectives and ideas, ultimately hindering the purpose of these institutions. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if individuals were allowed to remove books they found offensive, there would soon be no books left for anyone to read. Libraries have always maintained a good balance of material on their shelves, catering to various age groups and interests. Despite the convenience of the internet, libraries continue to serve as reliable sources of knowledge and entertainment. It is important to trust in the curation process of libraries and appreciate the valuable resources they provide for the community.
1281	4258	2	3	I think that no book, movie, music, or any form of media should ever be taken off the shelves just because someone doesn't like it. Everyone has different tastes, and what one person finds offensive or distasteful, another might enjoy. It's important to respect the creative work that goes into producing these forms of media, as well as the time and effort it takes to bring them to the public. Instead of banning or censoring content, individuals can simply choose not to engage with it if it does not align with their personal preferences. Let's celebrate the diversity of voices and perspectives in art and literature, rather than silencing them.
1282	4259	2	3	There are certain books, games, and music that should not be readily available to children in libraries or stores. As the future generation, children are highly impressionable and the media they consume can greatly impact their behavior and choices. For instance, many rap songs contain explicit content that can influence children to engage in harmful activities. Similarly, movies and video games often depict violence, drugs, and inappropriate language, which can desensitize children and lead them down a dangerous path. By restricting access to such content, we can help protect our children from negative influences and promote a brighter future for all. It is crucial that we come together as a community to prioritize the well-being of our children and ensure they are not exposed to harmful material that could jeopardize their future. Let us work towards creating a safer and more positive environment for the next generation to thrive in.
1283	4260	2	3	Let's say you walk into a public library and you look upon a book that is racist or is offensive to you.  You believe that the book shouldn't be on the shelf so you take it off.  I believe that you have the right to take that book off the shelf.  It isn't just books either; it can be music, movies, magazine, or many others.  The authors have the right of freedom of speech but it can go the other way around too.  There are many reasons why and I will explain this to you.  The first reason why is that the person might not come back to that place.  I mean if somebody walks into a library and trys to find a book to read, do you think they will ever come back if they are offended by one?  A little while back, I was in the library and I noticed a book that was offending.  It was talking jokes about black people.  I believe that isn't right because all people are equal no matter how they look or what they believe.  The next reason is that it could cause rate of the materials to go down.  If somebody gets offensive about a censored material, they are going to report it and cause the rate to drop low.  No library wants to hold books, music, movies, or magazines that have been reported by their community and nobody wants it.  How would the author feel about their material getting reported because of somebody getting offensive by it?  If the author wants to offend anybody, then they shouldn't even bother to publish it.  The last reason is to get rid of the materials.  Nobody wants to look at something that offends them.  How would you feel that you took a movie home to watch the family and it had bad stuff in it and you didnt like it.  You get offended and complain.  Complaining is bad for business especially if its a government building.  If we just get rid of the things that offend people, then we wouldn't have any problems.  I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf if sombody if offended by it.  There are really three main reasons.  One is the the person might never come back to that place. Next, is that it could cause rate success drop down low.  The last is to just get rid of the materials so they are no complains.  Now, what do you believe?
1284	4261	2	3	I believe that censorship within libraries and any other public media source is wrong, immoral, and unfair. Authors, artists, photographers, etc. have the right to freedom of speech. Why should consumers not have the same right to choose what they expose themselves to? The censorship of any media should not be allowed in public consumer spots, not only because it goes against basic American rights but also because it takes the responsibility, originality, and expression out of people's lives.  If a parent or guardian does not wish for their child to be exposed to certain genres of media, it is their responsibility to intercept that from their child's environment. Parents should create a safe surrounding for their children and monitor their exposure to inappropriate material. As children grow into teenagers and eventually adults, they earn the right to make decisions on their own, including choices regarding music, literature, and other forms of media.  Artists and creators have the right to freedom of expression, and censorship limits this right. By censoring what is available to the public, the government restricts the diversity and originality of artistic expression. If censorship were to increase, it could lead to a lack of freedom and creativity in society, resembling a communist country rather than a democratic one like the United States.  America prides itself on being a diverse and accepting nation, and censorship goes against these values. Restricting expression and originality through censorship diminishes the richness of our culture and limits the freedom of individuals to express themselves freely. Censorship, no matter the scale, is a form of discrimination and should not be tolerated.  In conclusion, censorship is a violation of basic rights and limits the freedom of expression for both creators and consumers. It is essential to uphold the principles of freedom of speech and allow individuals to make their own choices in a diverse and accepting society.
1285	4262	2	3	Lots of people come to the library to check out books, music, movies, and other forms of entertainment, with children being the primary users. Libraries should be a safe and educational environment, free from offensive or inappropriate materials. This includes censoring certain movies that contain explicit content, as well as magazines that feature nudity. Music in libraries should also be censored to ensure that it is positive and influential. Lastly, libraries should only offer books that are educational and enriching, such as those on history and math. By censoring materials in libraries, we can create a more suitable and beneficial environment for all patrons, especially children.
1286	4263	2	3	I think that movies, magazines, books, and music should be carefully curated to ensure that they are appropriate for all ages. It is important to consider the content that is being consumed, as it can have a significant impact on individuals, especially children. Offensive material should be removed from shelves to prevent negative influences and ensure that people are exposed to positive and uplifting content. By selecting books, magazines, and music that are suitable for all audiences, we can create a more positive and enriching media environment for everyone.
1287	4264	2	3	I feel that this test is not very effective because many students do not take it seriously until later grades, and teachers often only cover the material at the end of the year. I believe the focus should be on ensuring students can read and write at the appropriate level, rather than testing them on irrelevant material for an extended period. However, I do see the value in having a test to prevent cheating and reward hard work. It would be beneficial to offer an alternative paper-based test for students who perform better in that format. This is my perspective on the test, even though I was supposed to write about offensive material. Thank you for allowing me to express my thoughts.
1288	4265	2	3	In libraries, there are books of all genres, from mysteries to romances to biographies. Alongside books, libraries also offer magazines, movies, and CDs. However, there are certain books that contain explicit content such as sex, drugs, and offensive language. These materials can have a negative influence on young readers, leading them to engage in risky behaviors.   Children, whose brains are still developing, may not fully comprehend the consequences of what they read in these books. Exposure to such content at a young age can lead to premature sexual activity and other harmful behaviors. It is crucial to censor these materials in libraries to protect the innocence and well-being of young readers. Parents should have the opportunity to guide their children away from content that could potentially harm them in the long run. By removing these materials from library shelves, we can prevent another generation from making life-altering mistakes. Children should be allowed to enjoy their childhood without being exposed to inappropriate content that could jeopardize their future happiness.
1289	4266	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,  I have been through some different libraries lately to see what other kind of information they had. I am also afraid to tell you that I have seen a censorship problem with our public libraries. I can understand why they might censor some of the more mature/graphic novels because of the children going in and out of the library all day, but I do not believe that everyone else shouldn't be able to get the books they want because of content issues.  One reason why I think there shouldn't be censorship in libraries is because some people need to find information on certain topics and there might not be any reliable information on it on the internet. If students in high school or college don't have the information they need to write a paper or do a project for their classes then their grade could drop and also they could fall behind in work because they're trying to catch up to where everybody else in their class are working.  Another reason I think censorship in our libraries is because some of the things they censor could be the only copy of the book or the only one that's close to where you live. If they censor the one book that you need then that could possibly ruin the whole book for them. I believe that if a person is over the age of @NUM1, they should be able to take out any book they want and have it be uncensored. Some people @MONTH1 take offense to some things written in these books, but if they don't like something, they shouldn't check it out in the first place.  There are plenty of people around this world that have interest in millions upon millions of different topics. Also, some people @MONTH1 not be able to research or explore their topics as much as they would like to because of the censorship problem in public libraries. If people could learn more about their interests they could go on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little bit smarter.  In conclusion, I believe that censorship in libraries should be banned because of the problems it can cause and the effect it has on people. Censorship is a problem that needs to be dealt with as quickly and efficiently as possible.
1290	4267	2	3	Imagine a library without any materials that are considered offensive. In this library you wouldn't find many of the great pieces of literature that have impacted and influenced society. You probably wouldn't find too many books, magazines, or movies that everyone in the community feels are appropriate. Some of the great classic novels have contents that could be considered offensive to many people. Offensive materials should remain in libraries because something that is offensive to one person might not be to another person, who could be impacted by the piece of literature that is being banned. Music should also remain in libraries because the artist did not put the lyrics in the song to bring the listeners attention to the offensive material. Also offensive materials have made an impact in society for ages.  First, materials that one individual finds offensive could be viewed another way by many others who enjoy the material. Some comedy and action movies are viewed as offensive or inappropriate to some people, but many others enjoy the movie. If a movie, book, or magazine has the topic of a historical event, it could be considered offensive to people who were a part of it, but it could also inform the reader or the person who is watching about the events that happened. If children want to see or read this material they should get permission from their parents first.  Next, all music should remain in libraries. The music was created by an artist who made it for enjoyment and entertainment. The purpose of the music is not to bring the attention of offensive material to the listeners. The lyrics in some songs are inappropriate for children, but parents should not let their child listen to them. Lyrics can deal with really mature things that should only be heard and understood by adults.  Last, offensive materials have impacted society for ages. Many things the founding fathers of the country did were considered offensive, but that did not make them wrong, and it made the country a better place. Offensive materials impact everyday life for better and worse. If all offensive materials were banned, they wouldn't be able to have an impact on society for the better.  In conclusion, offensive materials should remain in libraries. The materials may be controversial, but they still are pieces of literature that deserve to be read and studied by the people of the community. Offensive materials contain many teaching tools in life that could help out the lives of many people. The community would turn into that of the society in Ray Bradbury's novel Fahrenheit 451, where all books were burned and society was not intelligent at all, if offensive materials were taken out of libraries.
1291	4268	2	3	I think that some books should be banned from libraries that are offensive or use certain words against people, especially in high school libraries. It is important to consider the potential impact of offensive material on students, as it could lead to conflicts and hurt feelings. By carefully selecting the books available in school libraries, we can create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all students.  If students encounter offensive content in books, it can make them feel uncomfortable and targeted. This can disrupt their learning and cause unnecessary tension among classmates. By banning books that contain offensive language or themes, we can prevent such issues from arising and create a safer space for everyone.  It is crucial for students to feel comfortable and accepted in their learning environment. If someone is being targeted or made to feel inferior because of their race or appearance, it is important to address the situation promptly. Reporting such behavior to school authorities can help prevent further incidents and ensure that all students are treated with respect.  In conclusion, it is essential to carefully consider the content of books available in school libraries to create a positive and inclusive learning environment. By banning offensive material, we can promote respect and understanding among students and prevent unnecessary conflicts. It is important for students to feel safe and supported in their academic environment, and taking action to address offensive content is a step in the right direction.
1292	4269	2	3	Censorship in libraries varies in different areas, especially when it comes to books, music, movies, and magazines. While some may argue for stricter censorship to protect younger audiences, others believe that individuals should have the freedom to choose what they want to read, listen to, or watch.  Personally, I believe that after a certain age, people should have the right to access and consume any form of media they want. It ultimately comes down to personal responsibility and maturity. If someone feels they are not ready for certain content, they can choose not to engage with it.  Books, in particular, are a form of expression and should not be censored simply because they may not align with someone else's beliefs or values. Music and movies, on the other hand, can have a more immediate impact on viewers and listeners, so some level of caution may be warranted.  In the end, it's important to remember that everyone has different tastes and opinions. Just because something may not be suitable for one person does not mean it should be banned or removed from shelves altogether. It's important to respect individual choices and allow for a diversity of perspectives in the media landscape.
1293	4270	2	3	When thinking about a library, the first thought that often comes to mind is a place of quiet, peace, and calm. However, this peaceful image can be disrupted when encountering offensive literature such as books, magazines, or movies. I believe that libraries should censor and remove offensive material to maintain their status as a place of tranquility and education. Such material can be found to be trashy and inappropriate for a setting where people of all ages, including children, come to explore and learn.   In my experience, libraries have always been a place for discovery and enrichment. I remember participating in reading events and enjoying the vast collection of books and magazines available. However, I also recall coming across magazines with explicit content that I felt were not suitable for a library setting. It is important to consider the impact such material can have on young minds and the discomfort it may cause to parents and other patrons.  Furthermore, offensive literature can have a negative influence on teenagers, potentially leading them to engage in harmful behaviors like drug use and smoking. By censoring and removing such material from libraries, we can help prevent the spread of negative influences and promote a healthier environment for all visitors. Ultimately, I believe that libraries would be better off without offensive material, as it not only improves the overall experience for patrons but also contributes to a safer and more positive community.
1294	4271	2	3	My views on censorship are strong. I believe that materials that discriminate against certain groups of people should not be readily available to the public. However, when it comes to historical materials that provide insight into the past, I believe they should be preserved for educational purposes. The decision to censor or not should be based on the content and context of the material in question. Ultimately, censorship should be approached on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the potential impact on society. It is important to balance the need to protect individuals from harmful content with the value of preserving historical information for future generations to learn from.
1295	4272	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Removing offensive materials could limit access to important information, disrespect the hard work of authors, and undermine the principle of freedom of speech. Instead of censorship, materials could be segregated or rated to ensure appropriate access. It is crucial to uphold the freedom of expression and promote open dialogue in society.
1296	4273	2	3	Yes, I believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are offensive and inappropriate. While people should have the freedom of speech, it should not come at the cost of promoting harmful or offensive content. It is important to consider the impact these forms of media can have on individuals, especially young audiences who may be influenced by what they see and hear. By promoting positive and appropriate content, we can create a more positive and healthy society where everyone can express themselves without causing harm. Ultimately, it is crucial to prioritize responsible and respectful forms of expression in order to foster a more positive and inclusive cultural environment.
1297	4274	2	3	Censorship has been a long-standing debate, with many people advocating for restrictions on various forms of media such as television, books, and magazines. While some argue that censorship is necessary to protect young children from inappropriate content, others believe that older teens should be trusted to make their own decisions regarding what they read or watch.   For young children, censorship is often seen as essential to shield them from exposure to explicit language and content. Parents play a crucial role in monitoring what their children are exposed to, as young minds are impressionable and can easily pick up negative habits if not properly guided. It is important to create a safe environment for children to grow up in, free from harmful influences.  On the other hand, older teens, like those in high school, are considered more mature and capable of handling more complex themes and language. They are likely to encounter explicit content outside of controlled environments, such as on public transportation or in social settings. Therefore, censoring books or media for older teens may be counterproductive, as it limits their exposure to diverse perspectives and ideas that can help them develop critical thinking skills.  In conclusion, while censorship may have its place in protecting young children, it should be approached with caution when it comes to older teens. Trusting older teens to make informed decisions and providing them with access to a variety of perspectives can help them develop into responsible and discerning individuals.
1298	4275	2	3	Imagine going to your favorite library only to find out that your favorite book or movie has been removed because it was deemed offensive. This can be frustrating, especially if you personally didn't find anything wrong with it. While it's important to consider age-appropriate material in libraries, there are alternative solutions that can cater to everyone's needs.  One solution could be to have a designated section with offensive material that is only accessible by the librarian. This way, the librarian can determine who is allowed to view or borrow these items, ensuring that children are not exposed to inappropriate content.  Another option could be to have a separate building for offensive material, only accessible to adults over a certain age with proper identification and a library card. This would further restrict access to potentially harmful content.  Lastly, having signed permission from a parent or guardian for underage individuals to borrow certain items could also be a viable solution. This would ensure that parents are aware of what their children are accessing and can set restrictions accordingly.  While it is important to consider the appropriateness of material in libraries, outright removal goes against the principles of free speech. Implementing these alternative solutions can help strike a balance between providing access to a wide range of materials while also protecting younger audiences from potentially harmful content. By taking these steps, we can maintain a diverse and inclusive library environment without compromising on important values such as free speech and access to information.
1299	4276	2	3	What other people take as offensive might be taken to others as something they value. I believe that all sorts of books, music, and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library. People value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is. Different types of books explain different types of things. Some people connect with books in a way that others may not understand. Taking certain types of books away can risk other people's feelings. Taking music, in my opinion, would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music. They use music to escape their problems and taking that away can leave them helpless. People love movies. It helps people understand what is going on in other people's points of view. Taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment. People like different movies and some movies can be offensive. But, it's not up to anybody else. Magazines help people keep up with news. Most of the news can be very offensive. It is the people around you causing the offensive news. Taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news. Taking away things that people use to connect with, what they use to escape with, their entertainment, and the news would most likely cause people to act out in a bad way. Everybody is different and everybody likes different things and taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people that think it isn't. What if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate? How would you feel? In conclusion, it is important to respect the diverse interests and values of individuals by allowing them access to a variety of books, music, and magazines without restriction.
1300	4277	2	3	'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2', 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4', 'The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2' are just a few of the many literary masterpieces that have faced banning in libraries. While some parents may feel the need to protect their children from certain ideas or concepts, censoring books ultimately limits a student's ability to think critically and form their own opinions. By restricting access to certain books, individuals are essentially restricting the freedom of thought and expression. Instead of banning books, parents should focus on teaching their children how to navigate challenging content and think for themselves. Encouraging children to follow their own moral guidelines and make informed decisions will ultimately empower them to engage with diverse perspectives and ideas. It is important to remember that censoring books not only affects the individual child, but the entire school community. Let's promote open-mindedness and critical thinking rather than censorship.
1301	4278	2	3	Certain books should be removed from libraries due to the harmful materials and inappropriate content they expose young children to. One significant reason for removing such books is the presence of racist themes that can negatively influence children's perceptions of different cultures. This can lead to discriminatory behavior and incorrect beliefs about people from diverse backgrounds.   Another important factor in removing these books is the inclusion of content that is not suitable for young readers, such as violence, drug use, or explicit language. Exposing children to such material can desensitize them to harmful behaviors and normalize actions that are not appropriate for their age group.   Overall, it may be necessary to completely remove certain books from libraries or restrict access to them to ensure that children are not exposed to harmful content. Libraries should prioritize providing a safe and educational environment for young readers, free from materials that could potentially have a negative impact on their development.
1302	4279	2	3	The reason for libraries is to provide a wide range of reading materials for people to choose from based on their interests. It is important to keep all books on the shelves to cater to the diverse preferences of the community. While some topics may be offensive to certain individuals, it is essential to respect the varying opinions and interests of others. Restricting access to certain books could lead to conflicts and limit the freedom of choice for readers. It is unrealistic to expect everyone to agree on what is appropriate, so it is best to maintain a comprehensive collection that accommodates a variety of perspectives. Ultimately, allowing all books to remain on the shelves ensures that people have the opportunity to explore different subjects and genres according to their preferences.
1303	4280	2	3	Books, movies, music, and magazines are widely enjoyed by people of all ages, but the issue of censorship arises when it comes to protecting children from inappropriate content. Parents want to be able to take their children to places like the public library without worrying about them being exposed to nudity, violence, profanity, or other offensive material. Censorship can help ensure that children are not exposed to content that is not suitable for their age. Categorizing items by age appropriateness can also be a helpful way to guide parents and individuals on what is suitable for different age groups. Overall, censorship is important in maintaining a safe and appropriate environment for all individuals when it comes to accessing books, movies, music, and magazines.
1304	4281	2	3	Corrupt censorship occurs when certain media or content is removed or blocked by those in charge of distribution, rather than the creators themselves. Libraries have the responsibility to decide what materials to publicly display, but they must also adhere to educational guidelines when it comes to potentially graphic content. It is important to remember that all types of content are forms of art created by individuals, and altering or censoring that work without permission goes against the rights of the creator.  While distributors have the right to choose what to display, it is ultimately up to the audience to decide whether or not to engage with the content. Libraries serve as a platform for a wide range of materials to be accessible to the public, and it is the responsibility of the individual to make informed decisions about what they choose to read or view. Censorship should not be used as a means to cater to the preferences of a select group, as it limits the diversity of perspectives and experiences available to the community.  When materials intended for those who appreciate and enjoy them are taken down due to censorship, it not only stifles the creativity of the creator but also deprives audiences of the opportunity to engage with meaningful content. As Katherine Paterson aptly stated, the right to remove certain books from shelves opens the door for all forms of censorship, ultimately leading to a loss of valuable and diverse literature for everyone. It is crucial to uphold the freedom of expression and allow individuals to make their own choices when it comes to consuming media and literature.
1305	4282	2	3	Nowadays, people can easily get offended over trivial matters, leading to a culture where individuals prioritize their own desires over the preferences of the audience. Despite the presence of fake or misleading content in stories, books, and articles, it should not diminish the enjoyment for others. It is crucial not to let the opinions of a few ruin the experience for everyone else.   In today's society, it has become common for individuals to take offense at the slightest provocation and feel compelled to take action. While it is important to address genuine concerns, it is also essential to uphold the principle of freedom of speech, allowing individuals to express themselves without fear of censorship.  The prevalence of fake news and misleading information poses a challenge for readers and writers alike. With the proliferation of articles and books, it can be difficult to discern fact from fiction. It is crucial for individuals to critically evaluate the information they consume and not take everything at face value.  Opinions play a significant role in shaping people's perspectives, but it is essential to remember that everyone is entitled to their own views. Reading and writing have been cherished activities for centuries, offering a means of escape and enlightenment. It is vital not to let the opinions of others detract from the enjoyment of these pursuits.  In conclusion, while it is important to be mindful of differing viewpoints, it is equally important to uphold the freedom of speech and not let the opinions of others dictate our experiences. By approaching reading and writing with an open mind and critical eye, we can navigate the sea of information and enjoy the rich tapestry of stories and ideas that the world has to offer.
1306	4283	2	3	Controversy surrounds the issue of censorship and parental control over what children read. While some may argue for the removal of offensive material, author Katherine Paterson highlights the danger of such actions, as it could lead to the removal of all books. Every publication has its intended audience, and what may be inappropriate for one group could be suitable for another. Ultimately, it is important for parents to set boundaries for their children, but also to trust them to make their own choices as they grow older. In the end, it is essential to use judgment and allow individuals to decide what they consume, as restricting access to certain materials may limit their exposure to different ideas and perspectives.
1307	4284	2	3	No I do not believe there should be any censorship in libraries. We have freedom of speech for a reason. Sure some things might not be appropriate for certain people or age groups, but everyone is gonna eventually hear, see, or be involved in something they are not supposed to like, enjoy, or agree with. Censoring materials in libraries restricts access to information and limits intellectual freedom. It is important for individuals to have the opportunity to explore different perspectives and form their own opinions. By allowing all types of content to be available in libraries, we promote diversity of thought and encourage critical thinking. Ultimately, censorship goes against the fundamental principles of democracy and should not be imposed in any form, especially in institutions dedicated to the dissemination of knowledge.
1308	4285	2	3	People should not take offensive books too seriously. While some may find certain materials offensive, it is important to remember that they are just words on a page. Libraries may have censored shelves, but ultimately, it is up to parents to monitor what their children are exposed to. It is unrealistic to shield children from all offensive content, as they will inevitably encounter it in the real world. Instead of getting upset over offensive materials in libraries, it is important to focus on teaching children critical thinking skills and how to navigate and understand different perspectives. Offensive materials can sometimes provide valuable insights and help individuals develop a deeper understanding of complex issues. Ultimately, it is essential to approach offensive books with an open mind and a willingness to engage with challenging ideas.
1309	4286	2	3	"I think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves. If a book, magazine, movie, etc, is found offensive then you should just walk away and ignore it. Don't go back and keep looking at it because what you find offensive someone else might like. The world won't change around you so you should do the smart thing and ignore it. If something is found offensive on censorship in libraries then maybe it's not a good idea for you to be where you are in that library. And if something does offend you, you should still act appropriately and deal with the situation the right way.  When I was younger I used to see books with a cover titled ""adults only"" and would think it was funny, but the adults didn't think so. The books are put there for people to read not just to look at. The books, music, movies, magazines are not there to offend you in any type of way. If you find something offensive then you should just move away from that area so that you won't worry about having to be offended.  Different people like different things, so they will have many different varieties to choose from in a library. They might have some things that really offend you or they might have some things that you really like. You have to make a wise choice and know that if something is going to offend you stay away from it.  Censorship in libraries have every right to put up any and every piece of book, music, movie, magazine, etc., because it is their facility. They shouldn't have to worry about people being offended by anything they put up. They shouldn't have to worry about people being offended because 99% of the time the things they put up are not bad at all, it may even be helpful, but to one person it may be harmful or offend them.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries should be able to post or shelve anything they want. If you're offended or not offended they have every right to shelve whatever it is because in the real world you don't always get what you want, and you won't always like what you see."
1310	4287	2	3	A library is a safe haven where people can escape the world and immerse themselves in books. It is a treasure trove of knowledge and information, offering a wide range of perspectives on various subjects. Censoring information in libraries, even if deemed offensive, goes against the principles of unbiased education. Every individual should have the opportunity to explore different viewpoints, even those that may challenge their beliefs. By allowing all types of information to be available, libraries remain true to their purpose as centers of learning and enlightenment. In a world where diverse opinions exist, it is crucial to uphold the freedom of access to information in libraries to foster open-mindedness and intellectual growth. Ultimately, censorship in libraries would hinder the pursuit of knowledge and deprive individuals of the opportunity to broaden their understanding of the world.
1311	4288	2	3	Hi, my name is @CAPS1 and I am writing this article today to talk about things that shouldn't be in the library. There are many, many things that shouldn't be exposed to children such as, sexism, racism, rated @CAPS3, and pornography. First off, books that have racist comments in them should not be exposed to our young children as it sets a bad example for them. Additionally, books that contain explicit sexual content should not be allowed in public libraries as they can negatively impact young minds.   Moving on, @CAPS2-@CAPS3 movies, such as horror films and pornography, should also be restricted from public libraries to protect children from harmful content. These types of movies can have a damaging effect on young minds and should only be viewed by mature audiences. Lastly, magazines that feature explicit material, including naked photos, should not be accessible to children in libraries. Exposing young children to such content can lead to inappropriate behavior and attitudes.  In conclusion, it is important for libraries to carefully consider the materials they make available to the public, especially children. By restricting access to content that is sexist, racist, sexually explicit, or inappropriate for young audiences, we can help protect and nurture the minds of our youth. Let's create a safe and positive environment for children to learn and grow without being exposed to harmful influences.
1312	4289	2	3	As a small child I remember my mom reading me stories to put my to sleep. There was always one book that I remember the most named, 'A Light in the Attic' by Shel Silverstein. As I was walking into my public library the other day, I was looking at the books that had been censored because it encouraged mistreating parents, offensive language, bad habits, and other things. I was mad that this book had essentially been erased from all of children's literature just because a few people thought that it gives a bad message. Think about it though, when you are a child either having a book read to you, or reading one yourself do you honestly pay attention to such small details? I do not think that books and music should be censored because society does a good job of thinking and figuring out what is acceptable and what is not. I understand the idea of warning labels, but I feel that censorship is too far. In the example I used in the paragraph above, that actually happened to me. So, I do not think that things should be censored just because a small group of people think that it is inappropriate. Even when I read that book today I do not see any of the reasons that were listed in the book. Therefore, I believe that it was unjustly censored, meaning that a really good book will never reach the eyes and ears of children that deserve to hear and read it.  Over the years, many things have been censored, some had an actual reason, others maybe were looked at and censored because somebody did not like how they read the book. The point is, people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library. Maybe, they should just give an idea saying that there is potentially inappropriate material in that certain book and should not be read to or by a certain age group. When you look back to your childhood and think of all the books that were read to you that you enjoyed, how many of those books have been censored for reasons that make no sense? That is the primary reason why I believe there should not be any censorship.
1313	4290	2	3	Almost every city in the United States has a public library. A place where the citizens can check out books, music, movies, magazines and more. Inside a library, there are different sections. There are kids sections, adult, fiction, and many more. Just like any ordinary store, there are items in a library that are not subject for children. A common question has been coming up everday life, 'Should we remove these offensive items from our shelves?' Libraries have been around for years and so have uncensored things that are being put in front of children. As a child, you want to explore and know everything. Bad things will always be put in front of you as an obstacle to make the right choice. Just like these degrading items found in everyday stores, libraries, or in general everywhere you go. A library, however, is not just intended for adults, teenagers, or young children. A library is made for everyone's access and not everyone is alike. Therefore there is plenty of variety in these libraries. It should never be a libraries fault for containing things not appropriete for children in my belief. Almost every library is very organized into categories. If children are separated and exclusive to adult material, I see no problem in having these items on the shelves. When I visit a library, these items are very out of reach for children. Society knows what should and should not be brought upon a child, so they know not to put it in any reach of children. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope non of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' said Author, Katherine Paterson. Katherine makes a very valid statement. If I have a child one day, I could think of plenty of materials I would hope my child never came acrossed. However, as a parent it is their job to protect their children from these things. Coming from a teenage perspective, at a young age, I was very clueless about all the terrible things sitting around me. A majority of children would not be able to get their hands on such uncensored items, nor would they understand them if they did. There are things in this world that are much worse for children to see then taking a quick glance at something not for their age at a library. If anything, concerned parents should be paying more attention to what their children come in contact with at stores, the people they are around, or what they are listening/watching. The internet is probably the most uncensored place a child can come acrossed. Reaching out to libraries about what they put on their shelves should be of their least concern compared to what is really out there in life. I do believe that no children should be handed or put in front of uncensored adult conduct because one-hundred percent unacceptable. If these items were placed in spots where only adults can get ahold of, then I see no problem in the situation. The children of our generation and more to come will always encounter something they should not be put in fron of. However, that is life and there will always be something come up in your life that you should not witness or be apart of. If libraries continue to keep these items out of reach of children, then there should be no censorship in libraries.
1314	4291	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a topic that often sparks debate. While some may argue that it goes against the principles of free speech, others believe that it is necessary to maintain a certain level of decency and professionalism in public spaces. Libraries are places of learning and should be treated as such. The presence of inappropriate materials can make it difficult for individuals to focus on their work or studies. By keeping certain items off the shelves, libraries can create a more conducive environment for patrons. Additionally, parents may feel more comfortable bringing their children to the library knowing that they will not be exposed to explicit content. In today's digital age, access to such materials is readily available outside of the library setting. Therefore, the decision to censor certain materials in libraries ultimately serves to uphold the integrity of these institutions.
1315	4292	2	3	There should be a certain age bookshelf that only certain aged people are allowed to look at. It's like the adult section at the library. There's no reason why they should be removed off of the shelves. I would understand if the little kids could come see the books and movies and be offended by it or scared but that's why you would make a certain section just for older more mature people. It would just depend on what offends people and what would make them offended. Some things could or would be bad to have little kids see them, but just make sure they couldn't get in the reach of young kids or not matured people. The only way I would say remove them if it was really offensive such as racism and things like that. Censorship in libraries in my opinion is a good thing. Just because of the fact that some people might not like the things that would be in a library or things that they have in the library. So I would have to say yes on censorship in the library.
1316	4293	2	3	There are many books, movies, and magazines that can offend people in various ways, such as those depicting war, slavery, or controversial religious topics. While some may argue for the removal of such offensive materials from libraries, it is important to consider the value that these works can offer.  Books and movies serve as a reflection of society, presenting different perspectives and issues that may be uncomfortable or challenging. Even if a particular book or movie is deemed offensive, it still has the potential to educate and inform individuals about important topics. For example, a story about the consequences of drunk driving could serve as a cautionary tale and help prevent similar tragedies from occurring.  By censoring or removing offensive materials, we risk limiting the diversity of perspectives and ideas available to the public. It is essential for individuals to have the freedom to choose what they read, watch, and listen to, as this allows for personal growth and understanding of the world around them.  Furthermore, offensive content in music, such as explicit lyrics or controversial themes, can still hold value for listeners. Songs that address difficult emotions or experiences can provide a sense of connection and understanding for those going through similar situations.  In conclusion, while it is important to be mindful of the impact of offensive materials, it is equally important to recognize the potential for learning and growth that they offer. Instead of censoring or removing such works, we should approach them with an open mind and consider the valuable insights they may provide.
1317	4294	2	3	Freedom of speech and the freedom of the press are privileges that we are fortunate to have. I firmly believe that censorship has no place in libraries. Authors, publishers, editors, and directors should have the right to express their opinions and ideas in their work without fear of censorship. It is up to individuals to choose what books and movies they want to engage with, and there are mechanisms in place, such as movie ratings and book reviews, to help guide these choices. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to select material that aligns with our own values and maturity levels. While opinions may vary on what is considered appropriate, it is important to respect the freedom of expression of creators. We should be grateful for the freedom to make our own choices about what we read and watch, and libraries should not restrict this fundamental right.
1318	4295	2	3	Do you ever feel like books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media can be offensive at times? In my experience, listening to music and watching movies can sometimes be offensive without even realizing it. For example, rap music often contains explicit language, and some movies may only feature characters of a certain race. Despite this, I believe that it's important not to overreact to potentially offensive content.   I recall watching a movie where white and black characters initially did not get along but eventually bonded over a common goal. This taught me the valuable lesson that people can overcome differences and become friends. Instead of taking offense, I see such media as entertainment that can also provide insight into current events and achievements.   While some may find certain media offensive, I choose not to dwell on it. If something offends you, simply choose not to engage with it. There are many other positive and meaningful books, songs, and movies available. Rather than condemning potentially offensive content, it's better to move on and not let it affect you.   Therefore, I do not believe in removing offensive media from circulation. It's a personal choice whether to consume it or not. Instead of focusing on the negative aspects, it's more productive to appreciate the positive messages that may be present. Let's continue enjoying the variety of media available and not let offensive content disrupt our lives.
1319	4296	2	3	Dear Newspaper,  I agree that libraries are valuable places for high school students to spend their time, but I also believe that the content available should be appropriate for their age group. While it is important for students to learn about drugs, alcohol, and sex, there is a fine line between educating them on the dangers and glamorizing these topics.   Books that provide information on medications and their uses are beneficial, but those that delve into the specifics of recreational drug use can be problematic. Similarly, while understanding the risks of alcohol consumption is essential, books that glorify teenage parties and drunken behavior are not appropriate for a high school library.   Magazines and advertisements often sensationalize drug use, alcohol consumption, and sexual activities, which can influence impressionable young minds. The images and stories portrayed in these materials can inadvertently encourage students to experiment with risky behaviors.   I believe that it is necessary to remove books from high school libraries that cross the line by promoting drugs, alcohol, and sex in a way that could be harmful to students. Instead, the focus should be on providing educational resources that inform students about these topics in a responsible and age-appropriate manner. By promoting a healthier and more positive environment in the library, we can help guide students towards making informed and safe choices.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1320	4297	2	3	Libraries are essential places for many people, offering a wide range of resources and services. While some visit libraries to borrow books, others utilize them for tutoring, research, or quiet reading. The strict rules and regulations enforced in libraries ensure a conducive environment for learning and studying. Children, like my little sister, can also benefit from libraries but must adhere to age-appropriate materials and obtain parental permission. Overall, libraries play a vital role in providing access to information and promoting literacy in the community.
1321	4298	2	3	In @LOCATION1, people enjoy a variety of leisure activities, from watching movies to taking peaceful strolls in the park. However, in today's society, there is a growing trend of censorship and restriction when it comes to the media we consume. I firmly believe that individuals should have the freedom to read whatever they choose, for several important reasons.  Firstly, we have the fundamental right to access and read any material we desire. Imposing limitations on what individuals can read goes against the principles of freedom of expression and personal autonomy. It is unfair to dictate what someone can or cannot read, as it restricts their intellectual freedom and individual agency.  Secondly, if a particular book or piece of literature is deemed offensive or objectionable by some, the simple solution is for those individuals to refrain from reading it. Everyone has different preferences and sensitivities, and what may be offensive to one person may not be to another. It is a matter of personal choice and responsibility to select reading material that aligns with one's values and beliefs.  Lastly, it is not anyone else's place to dictate what others should or should not read. Each individual has the right to make their own decisions regarding the media they consume, without interference or judgment from others. Respecting the autonomy and choices of others is essential in promoting a diverse and inclusive society.  In conclusion, the freedom to read what we want is a basic right that should be upheld. It is essential to respect individual autonomy and personal choices when it comes to selecting reading material. Let us embrace diversity of thought and opinion, and allow each person the freedom to explore and engage with literature as they see fit.
1322	4299	2	3	If you take offense to certain things, it's best to avoid reading literature that triggers those feelings. Research or ask friends about the content before diving in, as the front cover may not accurately represent the material. Understanding a piece of literature can lessen the likelihood of feeling offended, so try to see things from different perspectives to gain insight. If something continues to offend you, it's okay to avoid it altogether to maintain your peace of mind. Ignoring or avoiding offensive material can help prevent unnecessary stress and discomfort in the long run. Remember, it's important to prioritize your well-being and mental health by steering clear of content that doesn't sit well with you.
1323	4300	2	3	Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we have never thought about before. However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read? Well think what you want, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts. Different assortments of media should definitely not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be. Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right.  Even education is being influenced by people saying that students cannot be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people? If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library? Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning. These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyone's benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education.  Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them. With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better. Although this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for. The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics. Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well.  Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in our location, and hopefully globally someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit. People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance. Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have. Harry even argues in his popular book series that we must know the enemy to fight them. Would he have become such a hit if others did not believe this as well? To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed.  People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in libraries. These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives. Though there will always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it. We all certainly would not be the people we are without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only debilitating ourselves. These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever.
1324	4301	2	3	I believe that if some people don't like a certain book or movie, they should be able to inform the library about it, and the item should be removed from the library. The library should consider the preferences of its customers and ensure that offensive material is not readily available.   Parents often allow their children to explore the library independently, which can lead to children coming across inappropriate content if not supervised. It is essential for libraries to be mindful of the materials they offer, as children may unintentionally access adult content.   I recall a personal experience during a family vacation where an offensive image appeared on television, meant for adult audiences but visible to children as well. This highlights the importance of safeguarding children from harmful content, whether in media or library materials.   Libraries should be proactive in removing offensive items from their shelves if requested by regular patrons. This not only enhances the library experience but also ensures a safe environment, especially for young visitors.   In conclusion, libraries should prioritize the well-being of their customers by removing any offensive material upon request. By listening to their patrons and maintaining a family-friendly environment, libraries can positively impact the lives of children and promote a welcoming atmosphere for all.
1325	4302	2	3	The library should not have to take these types of offensive materials off the shelves. Instead, they can create separate sections for them, where access is restricted based on age and parental permission. Rated R movies can be available for adults, while music with explicit content can be rented by those over a certain age. By implementing these measures, libraries can provide access to a wide range of materials while still being mindful of potentially offensive content. Ultimately, it is up to individuals and parents to make informed decisions about what they choose to borrow from the library.
1326	4303	2	3	Reading is a popular activity enjoyed by many, both at home and in educational settings like school libraries. While some books may contain content that some find offensive, it is important not to remove them from library shelves. Books that explore sensitive topics such as sexuality or politics may not be suitable for all readers, but they still have value for those who can handle the subject matter. It is the responsibility of parents to monitor what their children read and ensure they are exposed to age-appropriate material. Additionally, music and movies with potentially offensive content should not be banned from libraries, as they cater to a diverse range of tastes and interests. Ultimately, libraries should maintain a wide selection of materials to accommodate the varied preferences of their patrons, trusting them to make informed choices about what they consume.
1327	4304	2	3	In every school or library, many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste. Everyone has their own opinion, and what might seem offensive to you, may be something that someone might want to know about. So should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves, or should we keep them anyways? Here is what I believe we should do.  Books are meant for learning and for pleasure, not to try to offend anyone. They each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written. There are tons of books out there that many people don't like, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't. We should keep the books in the schools and in libraries because they might help someone in a way, and if they weren't there, how would that person get help if nothing else was available?  One thing we can do is categorize the books by genre so that people know what they are looking for. Many people find these books that are 'offensive' because they come across them randomly. If each book was put into a certain category, then that incident wouldn't happen. It also helps keep everything organized that way. So when you go into the library, you know what you are looking for, you can just go right to that section and not look at anything else that may be offensive to you.  Keeping books on shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do. That is the main reason for libraries. They help you learn and get information about things that maybe you can't get anywhere else. If every library took off the books each person complained about, what is the point of having the library? There would be nothing left.  In all, everyone is entitled to their opinion and has a right to think that a book is offensive, but the reality is that it was written for a reason. If the library or the person who published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldn't have put it out there for the world to see. So keep the books on the shelves.
1328	4305	2	3	Going to the library can be overwhelming with the vast array of genres of books, music, and magazines available. Some individuals may find certain materials offensive or inappropriate, but that should not result in the removal of such items from the shelves. People have the autonomy to choose what they want to read or listen to, and they can easily avoid content that they find objectionable. Just like in a mall where one can avoid stores with items they do not like, individuals can steer clear of materials in the library that they find offensive.  Rather than removing books or music deemed offensive, libraries can consider organizing materials into different categories based on feedback from the community. This way, individuals can easily navigate the library and find what they are looking for without being exposed to content they find objectionable. It is essential to respect the diverse preferences and interests of library visitors and provide a wide selection of materials to cater to everyone's needs.  Personal preferences vary, and everyone has the right to choose what they want to read or listen to. The library should maintain a diverse collection of materials to accommodate different tastes and interests, ensuring that everyone can find something that resonates with them. By respecting individual choices and preferences, libraries can create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all visitors.
1329	4306	2	3	I think that they libraries should not remove any of the books they have now. If parents or people dont want to read those type of books they dont have to. But they should'nt be removed. I agree that some books are inappropriate and have bad language in them but thats part of the book and how the story was made. When a book is made they way it is and is already published there should'nt be any changes made to it.            If a story contains a certain scene that a person believes should'nt be in the book, that person needs to put that book back and choose another book they think is appropriate. Some people like to read stories with details so they can picture it in there mind. I know I do. In libraries they have books with inappropriate language and scenes discribed but to a certain age. I think you have to be thirteen or older to read them, and thats a good thing because by that age you know things better and your parents should'nt be too worried. So in my opinon I dont think they should be removed from libraries. On the other hand movies that have scenerios that are disturbing should be removed.           Movies are a whole different thing then books. They show the material that is being described and I dont think teens should be watching that. They can be very unappropriate and disturbing to some people like me. I would'nt want to watch that in front of my mom or dad and especially a younger sibbling. Then again its just my opinion. If parents are okay with there child or children watching that then it should'nt be a problem.           Music is'nt that bad. There are a lot of parents who dont want there child or children listening to a sertain type of music because of their religion and what they believe in. I totally agree. My parents at the beggining would'nt let me listen to music where all they would do is sing about sex and curse over and over. As I got older they did'nt care much because I would'nt listen to it as much. Im a teen and I also believe that some of the music now in days in not very appropriate for anyone at any age. Some of what they sing does'nt even make much sense. In libraries I think they should only have music that realates in some how to the books.     Magazines are not really a problem. Most of the magazines talk about beauty and fashion tips. They have horoscopes and give advise. A lot of the magazines keep people updated on celeberties and there life style. It has some what gossip. There mostly for older teens and grown ups. For younger teens and kids there's more appropriate magazines where they talk about younger celeberties.      This is my point of view on things. I know that a lot of people dont entirely agree with me but this is what I think. I also know that there may be a lot of people who agree with me and they'll most likely give the same reasons as I did to support their choice. In conclusion, libraries should maintain their current selection of books, allowing individuals to choose what they feel is appropriate for themselves or their children, while also considering age restrictions for certain materials.
1330	4307	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves just because they are offensive to some people. Censorship in libraries should be based on separation, allowing individuals to make their own choices about what they want to read or watch. Everyone has different opinions and what may be offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. Removing materials based on individual sensitivities would limit freedom of speech and expression, which is a fundamental right. It is important to respect diverse perspectives and allow for a variety of viewpoints to be available to the public. Ultimately, the solution to offensive materials is not censorship, but rather individual choice and the ability to avoid what one finds objectionable.
1331	4308	2	3	I visit the library every time after I finish my book, I have loved reading from the time I was little. Lately I feel like my reading interest has gone down though, not due to my act of being involved in other things, but possibly because lately I feel like every book I pick up comes off offensive. For example, I went to the check out a new book, I was mind-boggled at this time because unlike usual I had no clue on which book I was even interested in to read next. The librarian directed me to their new bestseller and said it was as hard to put down as a lollipop. I checked it out and after the first paragraph, I wanted to throw up. This book was too gory and I felt like it downgraded women; I was anything but satisfied. This wasn't the first book me or my friends had checked out like this, and I have a feeling it won't be the last. I just hope I could check out a book not so offensive and actually worth my time, but it seems like lately they are all changing and becoming too much for me, and it really upsets me.  Our library seems to be overpacked with magazines, which isn't a bad thing because I love them. I label magazines as a light read and very good at passing free time. I never get tired of all the pictures, all the gossip, and all the jokes at the end. Lately my opinion has changed though, these magazines are starting to alter and I don't like it. It seems as if I can't open my page without seeing a half-dressed girl, some inappropriate advertisement, or even tons of personal displays of affection. Seeing these vulgar images is enough to make me not only flip the page but also never second-guess about opening a magazine again.  Music is like a drug to me, and I am addicted. There is never a day that goes by that I do not listen to music, but lately music just isn't the same. I go to the library to check out some new CDs and it seems everything I bother listening to uses every curse word out there. I was furious after my purchase, but also disappointed that people actually sell this garbage. I am somebody who listens to music to relax, not develop a new inappropriate vocabulary.  I know there are plenty of good books, magazines, and music out there. We just need to find it again. I hope that we can banish these offensive, vulgar, and unnecessary items at the library. I know I'd greatly appreciate it, and from what I heard many others would too. We want reading utensils worth reading, we want magazines our eyes won't mind taking a glance at, and we want music that won't pollute our brains. Let's strive to bring back the quality and decency in our library selections.
1332	4309	2	3	I don't think certain materials should be removed from library shelves. People have the option to choose what they want from the shelves; librarians do not force them to select any particular item. It is a free country, and I believe people should have the freedom to choose what they want to read or watch. If someone finds a particular material objectionable, they can always read the back of the book or movie before making a decision. This way, individuals can make informed choices based on their own preferences and values. In a democratic society, censorship should be minimal, and individuals should have the autonomy to decide what they want to access in a library setting.
1333	4310	2	3	I believe that censorship has no place in a country that prides itself on freedom of speech, like the United States. It is essential for individuals to have the liberty to express themselves without fear of being censored. While some may argue for restrictions on certain content, such as in movies or magazines, I believe that instead of outright censorship, there should be measures in place to ensure that only appropriate audiences have access to such material. By allowing freedom of expression to flourish without censorship, we can truly uphold the ideals of a free society. In conclusion, censorship should not be tolerated in a country that values freedom of speech like the United States.
1334	4311	2	3	I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves just because someone finds them offensive. Everyone has different tastes and preferences, so what may be offensive to one person may be enjoyable to another. It is important to respect this diversity and allow people to express themselves through the media they choose to consume. Censorship can limit freedom of expression and creativity, so it is important to let individuals make their own choices about what they want to read, watch, or listen to. If something offends you, simply avoid it and focus on the content that brings you joy. In a world as diverse as ours, it is essential to embrace different perspectives and allow everyone to enjoy the media that resonates with them. Let us celebrate our differences and respect each other's choices when it comes to entertainment and artistic expression.
1335	4312	2	3	If a book is put on a shelf, it is there for those who enjoy that material. Libraries cater to a diverse range of interests, and what may be offensive to one person could be fascinating to another. It is impossible to make the world completely kid-safe, so trying to do the same for a library would limit access to a wide variety of books. While it is important to be mindful of the material children are exposed to, it is also important to recognize that everyone has the right to access the literature that interests them. By allowing books to remain on the shelves, individuals have the freedom to choose what they want to read, regardless of whether others may find it offensive.
1336	4313	2	3	I think that we should remove certain things like movies, music, and books should definitely be a debate because in these days people are doing things that they never done before. For example, music is a great cause of things that people motivate to do things and get really into the songs. They try to do the same things as what their favorite artist or actor does. I hear some songs and they talk about illegal things and I look around the world I hear children talking about those things and they tell their parents what is that? But they just don't want to tell them the truth but once these kids get older they will know what it is and it will be their choice if they want to follow that path or think about something else. But about the people who are singing this, they're putting it in a way that is not bad you could do this all the time and enjoy it without getting in trouble and in reality these kids are blind and don't know what they're getting themselves into.  Also, many books have offensive language that kids read all the time but people don't even notice. That's how kids could get in trouble in school because they learn a new word in some book they never read or can't even read cause they're too young to understand but they do it anyway because of curiosity, they don't know what they're doing. That's a way how a child becomes bad cause a person when he or she becomes older cause they learned things that they shouldn't have learned. I think that we as a good country should make sections into what people can read and can't read, and it should depend on how old the person is.  Some school libraries have movies that kids could watch and it could be if you're an elementary school, middle school, etc. But some of these movies have offensive language and some appropriate scenes, that kids would want and learn how to do those types of things. Or how they see the actors in the movie and they curse and they think is cool cause they're doing it as well. I think that elementary students should watch only PG movies, middle school PG @NUM1 and down, and for the high school, we should be able to see basically any movie, but at the same time I think most of the high school students have to be more mature, that's probably why we still don't have the privilege to see any movie cause people don't know how to handle themselves.  Finally, I really think they should minimize some movies, music, and books cause kids are learning things they shouldn't be learning until they get older, and that those three things change the world in so many different ways, some are good but most of them are bad, these are my opinions.
1337	4314	2	3	"There are a lot of issues concerning offensive material used for entertainment, such as movies, books, and magazines. Sometimes, these materials can be offensive to different races or religions. Censorship has been used in the past to keep such material out of circulation, like in the book ""Fahrenheit 451."" However, some argue that people who are offended by such material can simply avoid it. In conclusion, while individuals can choose to avoid offensive material, it is also important for society to consider the impact such material can have on others and to be mindful of not being intentionally hurtful."
1338	4315	2	3	Personally, I have no issue with the content found in libraries today. While there may be materials that some individuals disagree with, it is important to remember that libraries cater to a diverse range of interests and perspectives. Children typically visit the designated children's sections of the library, so there is no need for concern about them encountering inappropriate material. In today's society, children are exposed to a variety of information at a younger age, and it is essential for them to have access to a wide range of resources.  Libraries serve as valuable repositories of knowledge and information, and it would be a disservice to the community to remove any materials based on personal preferences. Everyone, regardless of age or background, should have the opportunity to explore and learn from the resources available in a library. Whether it is for school research or personal enrichment, libraries play a crucial role in providing access to information.  As an individual who values learning about their own culture, I believe that libraries should contain a diverse range of materials that reflect different perspectives and experiences. Restricting access to certain materials because of differing opinions does not benefit anyone. Everyone has the right to access information that interests them and helps them better understand themselves and the world around them.  In conclusion, libraries should remain open and inclusive spaces that welcome all individuals seeking knowledge and information. It is essential to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and provide access to a wide range of materials for individuals to explore and learn from. Removing valuable information from libraries would only limit the opportunities for learning and growth that these institutions provide.
1339	4316	2	3	I do not think people should take books off the shelves because the town libraries have those types of books. People should enjoy reading all types of books. Some people only read different books. Little kids like fantasy and picture books, teenagers like romance, and others like nonfiction. It should not matter what other people think. If people brought books off the shelves then what will the other people read. Before you bring books off the shelves, you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right. Think about what would happen if u brought books off the shelves. What would happen? I will tell you, you would lose customers. If you don't want children to read inappropriate books, then you should make a card saying that your parents give them permition to read those books. If that won't work, then make an age limit. Have the parents show you their berth certificate. Have a resticted section in the library. In order to get a book from the resticted section, then have a parent sign a note saying that their allowed. Children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines. If their the age of fourteen and up, then they can get a magazine. Music should not matter to parents, so there should be no problem there. If the movies are bought by the parents, then there should be no problem there either. The other things you can figure it out on your own. This is what I think should happen to books in a library. I told you how a library should work. I told you what I thought should go on in the library. I will give you some advise. Think before you do. That is all I am going to tell you.
1340	4317	2	3	I believe that all materials should be allowed in libraries, as we have the right to choose what we read, listen to, and watch. Even if some books are banned, people will find a way to access them. We have the freedom to live as we choose, which includes the freedom to read without restriction.  However, when it comes to music and movies, we may have gone too far. The easy access to pornography and music promoting negative behaviors like sex, drugs, and violence is concerning. The rating systems provided by organizations like the Motion Picture Association help guide us, but we need to be more mindful of the content we consume.  Magazines also have their own standards, with well-known publications like Vogue and National Geographic. Yet, there are many magazines with content that remains hidden from public view. We must consider the impact of these hidden magazines and the influence they may have on society.  In conclusion, while freedom of choice is important, we must also be aware of the content we are exposed to and the influence it can have on our beliefs and behaviors. Libraries should remain open to all materials, but as individuals, we must make informed decisions about what we consume.
1341	4318	2	3	Books, magazines, movies, and music are created with a huge diversity. Fiction, non-fiction, horror, fashion, science fiction, and many more categories of literature are made. There is something out there everyone will enjoy. What would you do if you did not have the choice to read, listen to, or watch the materials you like because someone else had an ill opinion of it? Everyone has an opinion. It may be in favor of something or it may not be. I believe every book, movie, magazine, and other piece of literature should have a rightful place on the shelf. To some people it may be offensive, but that does not mean they have to read it. Someone may enjoy a piece of work another finds offensive. It is all a matter of opinion. The opinion of one person should not affect materials being able to be on a shelf or not. If you walked into a library and the shelves were filled with books, but only books everyone had a good opinion about the shelves wouldn't seem very full. It is hard to get two people to agree on the same thing. Imagine trying to get everyone to agree on the literature in a public library. Censorship is understandable to an extent, but I believe the libraries should organize all their literature into categories and sections. In these categories and section people can look for the materials they wish to see and avoid the offensive materials they do not. Libraries have rated R movies. Many people could consider rated R movies to be offensive, but many people could enjoy watching rated R movies. Who wins, the people who find them offensive or the people who enjoy them? It is a hard choice to make. I believe the libraries should carry the movies and if someone finds them offensive they should simply not watch them. The same goes for books, magazines, and music. If you find it offensive simply do not read it or listen to it. There are hundreds of different styles of writing, plots of movies, lyrics of songs, and covers of magazines. They have such a diversity because everyone has a different opinion of the lyrics, covers, styles, and plots. They cannot censor things just because some people find them offensive. Others may enjoy them. What would you do if your favorite book was not allowed in your public library? In conclusion, it is important to respect the diversity of opinions when it comes to literature and other forms of media. Censorship should not dictate what materials are available to the public, as everyone has the right to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to.
1342	4319	2	3	I do not think that books, movies, music, magazines, etc., should be removed just because some people do not like them. Maybe some others do like them and like to read them. There should be no reason that one person or persons should try taking something off of a shelf at a library just because they find it offensive. Many people like many different things and somethings that you read may affect others, but you don't care about that, you just care about what you want and like and what is offensive to you. What if something you were watching or reading or listening to was offending someone else, would you care? Would it bother you if someone told you it was offending them? Everyone likes different things, and some others may not always agree with what they are going to be interested in.
1343	4320	2	3	I believe that certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. No one should have to be subjected to offensive content that can harm or hurt them in any way. It is important to create an inclusive and respectful environment for everyone. Therefore, removing offensive materials is a necessary step to ensure that everyone feels safe and comfortable. In conclusion, I support the removal of offensive materials from shelves to promote a more positive and respectful society.
1344	4321	2	3	It is known that anybody is able to rent books, movies, music, and magazines in libraries. It is also known that some of the material in libraries may be offensive or inappropriate. While some people believe that such items should be removed from the shelves, I believe that books, magazines, movies, and music should not be removed from the shelves. People should be able to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to, if someone doesn't want something that they find offensive in their house then he or she doesn't have to get it, and it doesn't mean that something that seems offensive still isn't enjoyable.  The most important reason why I believe that items that appear to be offensive should not be removed from library shelves is because people should be able to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to. Anybody is entitled to his or her own preference. Some people prefer R-rated movies or music with explicit content. If that's what people are interested in then so be it. Anybody should not have to stop renting something that they want just because someone else doesn't want them to.  Furthermore, if someone doesn't want something that they find offensive in his or her house then just don't get it. No one is forcing anyone to listen to or watch something that they don't want. It is actually a very simple matter. It's a choice whether someone wants to watch or listen to what they want, and they don't really have the right to be able to tell someone else that they can't watch or listen to what they want. If someone doesn't prefer something then they don't have to get it.  Finally, just because something seems offensive doesn't mean that it still isn't enjoyable. The example that I can think of is a movie that is R-rated. Just because a movie is rated R doesn't mean that it still doesn't have a good story or moral to it. There are plenty of R-rated movies that have won Oscars and plenty of other awards. Another example is the singer Eminem. While his music may be offensive, there are still many people that enjoy it. Certain things that offend people can be enjoyed by other people.  In conclusion, no one has the right to be able to stop anyone from renting what they want from a library. People just really need to mind their own business and not worry about what other people find enjoyable. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are only offensive if certain people believe that they are. People can only choose what they want, and nothing more.
1345	4322	2	3	Books and materials should not be removed from library shelves simply because they may not be suitable for everyone. It is important to have designated areas for children's books to ensure that they are only exposed to age-appropriate content. If a child happens to come across a book that is not suitable for them, it is the responsibility of parents or caregivers to explain why it is not appropriate. Every book has its audience, and just because someone may not like a particular book does not mean it should be removed for everyone. The same principle applies to other forms of media like movies, music, and magazines. It is impossible to please everyone, but that does not mean that certain materials should be censored. Ultimately, it is important to respect the diversity of preferences and opinions when it comes to library collections.
1346	4323	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries or not? Many people have their own personal views on this subject. Everyone should know their own boundaries of what they know is appropriate to look at and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have to remove books that they have purchased. Instead, libraries should consider creating a separate section for potentially controversial material. This way, customers who are interested can access these materials without imposing them on others. Libraries are meant to be a place of escape and exploration for all individuals. Censoring materials may deter customers from returning, and it is essential for libraries to have autonomy in deciding what is best for their facility. Ultimately, each library should have the freedom to manage their collections in a way that aligns with their values and serves their community best.
1347	4324	2	3	I think that any book or movie should have warning signs to inform people of the content they are about to experience. Additionally, age limits should be in place for certain movies or books to ensure appropriate viewing. While some content may be offensive to some, it is important to remember that not everyone will find the same things offensive. In terms of music, if a particular artist or genre is not to your liking, there are plenty of other options to choose from. It would be challenging to remove offensive content from movies and music without limiting creative expression and audience interest. Magazines also provide valuable information and entertainment, but parents can guide their children towards more suitable reading material if they are concerned about content. Ultimately, it is important for individuals to make informed choices about the media they consume and to respect the diverse preferences of others.
1348	4325	2	3	My name is @CAPS1 and my views on censorship in libraries are that if any material that are found offensive should be take off the shelves. I have never came across a material that was offensive to me, but maybe someone else has and it really offended them. I'm not the type of person who would start an argument but i am a type of person who will speak whats on my mind and tell you what i believe in. People are concerned about if libraries take off certain kinds of books that their will not be books left on the shelves for anyone else. I have to say there are other places you can buy books at beside the libraries such as stores as in @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and etc. Like i said i have never came across a book that i think should be pulled off the shelf, but of course i don't read a whole lot either but the books i have read i have never came a crossed any that were terrible.   Books that have like how people can kill themselves, or how people get pregnant, and so on, them can be pulled off the shelves, but if you have a child in the library they shouldnt even be in the adult book section anyways, they should be in the kids book section. I have never heard of a kid book that is terrible and that should be pulled off the shelf. Most authors are smarter then that, or at least i would hope so. Music is a whole story its self. In my opinon if you don't want your kids to listen to adult music then don't let them. I know a lot of music that is bad and that i would never let my children listen to it but i know well enough if i don't want them to listen to it them i'm not going to play it while their around. I grew up around rap music so thats all i listen to, but when i have kids i know what they will be able to listen to and what they wont be able to listen to.   Movies is the one that i have a problem with the most because in libraries, and other places such as, @ORGANIZATION1, and book stores they just put out movies for EVERYONE to see and it doesn't matter what's on the cover or what it's called. Now movies with bad covers and bad titles could be pulled off the shelves such as all the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' movies. The name of the movies aren't bad but the movie its self is not for a child to see so why even have it out on shelves for kids to see and want to watch it?   Magazines and etc i don't have a big problem with because libraries don't have bad ones, but book stores do such as 'playboy and play girl' but they are usually put back in the very back behind all other magazines so children can't see them only adults can. The only way a child would see them is only if you point them out. I think i've said all i can say about my opinions and my experiences about books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries that should or shouldn't be pulled off the shelves. I havn't had a lot of experience but maybe that's because i don't have kids yet, i guess i will find out when i do have kids. I happy to explain my experiences and opinions to people who really care and want to know.   In conclusion, while censorship in libraries is a complex issue, it is important to consider the potential impact of offensive materials on different individuals. By carefully evaluating the content available and considering the audience, libraries can ensure that their collections are appropriate for all patrons.
1349	4326	2	3	Library censorship is a topic that sparks debate, with some arguing that offensive books should be removed from shelves. However, it is important to consider alternative viewpoints that support the retention of such books. Parental supervision, librarian guidance, and individual common sense are key factors that support the argument against censorship in libraries.  Parents play a crucial role in monitoring their children's reading materials. By actively participating in their child's reading habits, parents can guide them towards educational and age-appropriate books. If a parent deems a book to be unsuitable for their child, they can redirect them to a more suitable section of the library.  Librarians also play a vital role in assisting readers in finding appropriate material. With their extensive knowledge of the library's collection, librarians can recommend books that align with a reader's interests and age group. Their guidance can steer individuals away from potentially offensive material towards more suitable options.  Additionally, individual common sense plays a significant role in determining suitable reading material. Readers are generally aware of their preferences and maturity level, allowing them to make informed decisions about the books they choose to read. If a reader comes across a book that they find offensive, they can exercise their judgment and explore other options in the library.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries should be approached with caution. Instead of removing offensive books from shelves, it is essential to rely on parental supervision, librarian guidance, and individual discretion to ensure that readers have access to a diverse range of literature. By promoting these principles, libraries can uphold their role as inclusive spaces that cater to the diverse needs and interests of their patrons.
1350	4327	2	3	I think that @CAPS4 is fine if you take them out. Your should be @NUM1 or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad. If they are that bad they should have something on them like movies that are rated @CAPS1. I have read some books that are really good, but kids shouldn't read them. I read this book @CAPS3 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' and @CAPS4 is really sad. @CAPS4's about this @CAPS2 and he tells us what his mom makes him do when he was little. I liked the book but @CAPS4 was sad, but I read @CAPS4 because people were talking about @CAPS4. Some parents won't let their children watch certain things on the t.v. because they think that they are bad. I was watching this t.v. show at my grandma's house and she said that I shouldn't watch @CAPS4 but I do. I'm @NUM1 years old so I think I should be able to pick what I watch. I don't think she likes @CAPS4 because they yell a lot on the show and she says that is why I yell. Some movies are better if they have bad things in them, @CAPS4 makes them funny sometimes and that is what everyone likes. I would rather watch a funny movie then a kid movie. I watched them before though.
1351	4328	2	3	No, the books and other materials should not be moved from the library. People have different interests and may come specifically looking for those items. Removing them could lead to dissatisfaction among patrons and potential loss of business for the library. Additionally, if the library were to close down due to decreased usage, it would leave many individuals without a place to study or access necessary resources. Furthermore, the library serves as a peaceful environment for many, including children and students, who rely on its resources for their educational needs. Therefore, it is essential to keep the books and other materials in the library for the benefit of all visitors.
1352	4329	2	3	Personally, I believe that if you see something offensive in a public library, you should speak up. Talking to the librarian about inappropriate materials can help ensure a safe and appropriate environment for all library patrons, especially children. Libraries should have restrictions on who can check out certain materials to prevent young individuals from accessing offensive content. If offensive materials are available, they should be kept in a separate section with age restrictions. By implementing these measures, libraries can create a more comfortable and suitable space for all visitors. Thank you for considering the importance of maintaining appropriate content in libraries.
1353	4330	2	3	I believe that some materials in the library should be removed to ensure that inappropriate content is not easily accessible to individuals, especially children. While most books are suitable for all audiences, some may contain language or themes that are not appropriate for young readers. Similarly, movies with explicit content should be carefully curated to maintain a safe and welcoming environment for all library patrons. Magazines with questionable content should also be considered for removal, with a focus on keeping materials that are informative and suitable for a wide range of readers. Ultimately, it is important to prioritize the well-being and comfort of library users by being mindful of the materials available for consumption.
1354	4331	2	3	"I have seen some truly offensive books on the shelves of libraries. Books that make you worry about what would happen if a child stumbled upon them, as children's minds absorb knowledge at a rapid pace. What if this knowledge was offensive to a certain race or religion? Children are the future of our species, and they should be protected from such offensive material in libraries.  Imagine if children came across books written by Nazis during the Nazi regime, or books by infamous killers. What if they saw photo books depicting the horrors of the Holocaust or watched movies about war-torn battles and atrocities like those in World War I, World War II, or movies like ""The Pianist"" based on the cruelty of the Nazis and the Holocaust.  Censorship is necessary to shield children from offensive content in books, music, movies, and magazines. All materials accessible to children should be censored. Just picture a world where there was no parental control over what children could access in media. It is essential to protect the innocence and well-being of our children by censoring inappropriate content."
1355	4332	2	3	The library is a public place that provides access to a wide range of information and entertainment for everyone. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries, as they offer various genres of music, books, and movies that cater to diverse preferences. Genres exist for a reason, allowing individuals to choose what they want to engage with based on their interests. The freedom of speech and press granted to the people includes the right to access and share different forms of media, even if some may find them offensive. Ratings for movies and books help guide individuals in selecting content appropriate for their age group. As long as no laws are being violated, all genres of entertainment should be available in libraries for those who wish to explore them. Ultimately, individuals have the choice to avoid content that they find offensive, ensuring that libraries remain inclusive spaces for everyone.
1356	4333	2	3	I believe that it should not matter whether certain materials are kept on the shelves of the library. People come to the library to relax and enjoy reading, listening to music, or looking at magazines. As long as individuals are not being disruptive to others, there should be no issue with having these materials available. Personally, I find it relaxing to listen to music while reading, and I know that others may feel the same. The only reason to consider removing certain materials would be if they cause disturbances, such as loud music or disruptive behavior. Overall, the presence of various materials in the library should not be a cause for concern as long as everyone can enjoy their time there peacefully.
1357	4334	2	3	I believe that books, movies, music, and magazines should not be removed from the library. These forms of media serve important purposes for individuals of all ages. Books are essential for studying, learning, and entertainment. Music can help people concentrate, relax, or cope with stress. Movies and magazines provide entertainment and information for both children and adults. Removing these items from the library would limit access to valuable resources and deprive people of the benefits they offer. It is important to preserve the diverse collection of media in libraries to cater to the needs and preferences of the community.
1358	4335	2	3	Did you know that libraries contain a variety of resources such as books, movies, music, and magazines? They offer a wealth of information and entertainment for those seeking knowledge or leisure. However, if you come across something that offends you, it is important to remember that it may be valuable to others. Instead of calling for the removal of offensive material, it is best to simply move on and focus on what interests you. By doing so, you not only respect the diversity of perspectives but also allow others to learn and grow from different viewpoints. So, the next time you encounter something that does not align with your beliefs or preferences in the library, remember to consider the value it may hold for others before passing judgment.
1359	4336	2	3	I don't believe that we should censor or take away anything from our library shelves that may be considered offensive or inappropriate. However, I would recommend that children who are not ready for such material should not be exposed to it until they are old enough to understand and handle it. It is important for people to be aware of the harsh realities and challenges that exist in the world, as they will likely encounter them at some point in their lives. By being informed, individuals can better prepare themselves and know how to react in different situations. Hiding certain truths or events from people only serves to keep them ignorant and unprepared. Therefore, I believe that nothing should be hidden from those who are ready to confront and understand the harsh realities of life, no matter how difficult or painful they may be. It is essential for individuals to be aware and informed, so they can effectively navigate through life's challenges.
1360	4337	2	3	Censoring literature is a dangerous path to take, as it deprives us of our history, our education, and our freedom. Language is the foundation of our legacy, and to censor books is to silence the voices of many great speakers. We have a responsibility to preserve the words that have been written, as they teach us valuable lessons about our past and guide us towards a better future.  Hiding words from our children only serves to limit their understanding of the world. The truth, no matter how difficult, must be shared so that we can learn from our mistakes and strive for a more just society. Literature holds a mirror to society, reflecting both our triumphs and our failures. By censoring one book, we open the door for censorship of all literature, a dangerous precedent that can lead to a loss of freedom and knowledge.  We must not repeat the mistakes of the past, where censorship led to ignorance and oppression. Education and free speech are essential to the well-being of future generations. Let us embrace our words, our stories, and our legacy, and ensure that they are passed on to future generations. Let us learn from the past and create a better world for all. Let our legacy live on, free from the chains of censorship.
1361	4338	2	3	The Author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does anyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I do believe certain materials, such as music, books, and movies shouldn't be on a children's shelf to read, but rather on an adult shelf.  I believe every author has his or her right to express oneself and to be accepted for that. We all have our own beliefs and standards that we would like others to respect even if we don't agree on their beliefs. If every book that was found offensive was taken off a shelf we would soon have no books left. The reason for that is because everyone finds certain things offensive.  Many children are interested in certain things, and we can't hold them back from that unless it is inappropriate or goes against family morals or values such as religious beliefs. It would be a good thing to monitor what your children are reading, watching, and listening to.  On the other hand, adult shelves will have many different things that would be offensive to many different people unlike children's books. Writing is a way to show a person's expressions and what they stand for although it may not be pleasing to me or any other person.  But what if we write a book and somebody does not like it then we wouldn't like it if they took it off the shelf. That would show disrespect to a person who has thought long and hard on their work. Learn to stand proud of what you believe. Learn also to respect others as well and to let children be around safe family-type books, music, and magazines. Respect for others' beliefs and freedom of expression are essential for a diverse and inclusive society where individuals can share their thoughts and ideas without fear of censorship. Let us encourage critical thinking and open-mindedness while promoting responsible media consumption for both children and adults.
1362	4339	2	3	I am against censorship for several reasons. Everyone seems to be in favor of censorship, but I have a different perspective. If someone is not old enough to access a certain movie or book, there is a reason for that. However, if they are old enough, then it should be their choice to consume it. People should have the freedom to make their own decisions. If someone wants to watch a movie with their kids that may have mature content, that is their prerogative. It is not the filmmaker's responsibility to censor their work; instead, edited versions are available for those who prefer them.  People have varying beliefs, and it is important to respect that. If someone disagrees with certain content, they have the option to avoid it rather than impose their views on others. If everything is censored to accommodate everyone's preferences, there will soon be nothing left to read, watch, or listen to. Those who advocate for excessive censorship may eventually find themselves with limited options for entertainment. It is crucial to uphold freedom of choice and respect individuals' differing beliefs to maintain a diverse and vibrant cultural landscape.
1363	4340	2	3	Censorship for the future children of America is a topic of concern, as exposure to explicit content in books, movies, and music can have a negative impact on young minds. Many of the media content today revolves around themes of sex, drugs, violence, and crime, which is not suitable for impressionable children. While movies have a rating system in place to guide parents and guardians, books and music are easily accessible to anyone.  As a potential parent, it is important to be vigilant about the content that children are exposed to. It is essential to ensure that children are shielded from disturbing material until they are old enough to understand and process it appropriately. The age restrictions on movies serve as a good example of how content can be regulated to protect young audiences from harmful influences.  In conclusion, it is crucial for authorities to enforce stricter censorship measures to protect the innocence and well-being of children. Parents also play a vital role in monitoring the media consumption of their children to prevent them from being exposed to inappropriate content that could negatively impact their development. By working together, we can create a safer and healthier environment for the future generation of America.
1364	4341	2	3	I believe that materials should not be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive. What is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another, and individuals have the right to choose what they want to read or watch. Some offensive materials can even provide valuable insights and guidance on how to handle difficult situations. It is important to remember that censorship limits access to diverse perspectives and can hinder personal growth and understanding. Therefore, it is essential to respect the rights and preferences of all individuals when it comes to accessing materials, even if they may be considered offensive to some.
1365	4342	2	3	Moving forward, it is important to understand that everyone has their own opinions and perspectives on different things. What may be offensive to one person may not be to another. Therefore, it is crucial to respect diversity and individual differences when it comes to books, music, movies, or any other form of media. Instead of trying to censor or remove materials that some may find offensive, it is more productive to engage in open discussions and dialogues about these topics. By doing so, we can learn from each other and foster a more inclusive and understanding society. Ultimately, it is essential to accept that disagreements will always exist, but it is how we handle them that truly matters. Let's embrace diversity and strive for mutual respect and understanding in all aspects of life.
1366	4343	2	3	No they should not have the CD's, books, and other items removed from the store shelves. They should leave them on the shelves. They should only remove old video games, books, and music. Keeping a variety of items available for customers to browse and purchase can attract more business and cater to a wider range of interests. It is important to maintain a diverse selection to meet the needs of different customers and ensure a pleasant shopping experience for all. Removing items arbitrarily could limit choices and discourage customers from returning to the store. Therefore, it is best to keep a well-stocked inventory to appeal to a larger audience and boost sales.
1367	4344	2	3	In many libraries across the nation, a numerous amount of books, magazines, movies, and music aren't provided because they are found offensive. I do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and may find different types of work offensive. Who is it that chooses these items to be taken out of libraries, and why should they be the only ones to say what goes and what stays? Everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions.  Some people are athletic, gothic, preppy, and nerdy. The library is open to anybody that wishes to enter. What happens if the people that choose what content is provided in the library don't like scary books, so they take all of the scary books out? What if there is a person that only reads scary books? What will they have to read? I bet if that person had the ability to choose what stays and what goes in the library, they would only have horror in the library. I do not believe that anybody should have the right to censor what content is provided in libraries. Everyone has their own opinion and interests so they should have everything open in libraries.  There is a reason that libraries are called libraries. That means that it is open to anyone and everyone. There should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from. Just because one person doesn't like a certain kind of genre or doesn't find it appropriate for a certain viewing audience does not mean that they can take it out of a library. That's why there are sections in libraries. If you don't find a certain type of book appropriate, place it in the 'restricted' section of your library.  If you remove a specific type of book, movie, magazine, or music from a library, and it's the only kind a certain person reads, what will they have to read? If everybody had the choice and right to do this, I don't think that anything will be left in libraries. All genres of everything should be available to the public. If you don't find a book appropriate, place it in the restricted section of your library to still have it open to anybody. You need to think of everybody, not just yourself. Libraries should be a place of diversity and inclusion, where individuals can explore a wide range of ideas and perspectives.
1368	4345	2	3	Books, magazines, and other forms of literature should not be censored or taken off the shelves in a library simply because they may be found offensive by some individuals. Libraries are public spaces meant to cater to a diverse range of tastes and interests. What one person finds offensive, another may find enlightening or entertaining. It is important to respect the freedom of expression and the right for people to access a wide variety of information and perspectives. Censoring materials based on personal preferences limits the availability of knowledge and restricts the freedom of choice for readers. Instead of censoring, individuals can choose not to read materials that they find objectionable and opt for content that aligns with their personal values. Ultimately, the diversity of literature enriches our understanding of the world and should be preserved in libraries for everyone to explore and enjoy.
1369	4346	2	3	I don't believe that any certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the library shelves just because they may be offensive to some people. In today's world, almost anything can be considered offensive by someone, so removing all potentially offensive material would severely limit access to important information and resources. For example, if all books about a certain topic were removed because some find it offensive, it would hinder research and learning opportunities for those who genuinely need that information. It's essential to understand that not everything will align with everyone's beliefs or opinions, but that shouldn't prevent others from accessing valuable resources. Instead of focusing on censorship, we should prioritize helping those in need and promoting understanding and empathy. Therefore, I strongly believe that libraries should maintain a diverse collection of materials to cater to a wide range of interests and perspectives, even if some may find them offensive.
1370	4347	2	3	When i go to the library, most of the time, I'm doing research on a specific topic. The information I want, is the facts that really happened, or took place. This would not be possible if they censored all the material the offended somebody.     Leaving libraries uncensored gives us the full effect of what we're reading, or researching. It is important for readers and researches, to connect and take in all the information they read. That is what keeps us interested in what we are doing.     Authors write the things they write, for a reason. Taking there hard work off the shelves, because some little thing offends someone, is not fair to them. Besides, either way, someone is getting offended, because the auther is goin to get offended, for taking his hard work off the shelves.     As you @MONTH1 tell, i am against censoring our libraries. The way i see it, is that if something offends you, then dont look at it.
1371	4348	2	3	I disagree with library censorship. Every person should be allowed to produce their reflection of their believes or ideas. If certian books found offensive were to be removed from libraries then there would be nothing left for anyone to read. If parents are concerned with what their children are checking out from the library to read then they should read it before their child to see if they think it is appropriate. In my opinion children should be able to read what ever they like and by doing that they can teach themselves many things. Books can also help children to escape from every day life. Admitedly, children should not always escape, or use reading to hide from real life, but occasionaly they need too. I know as a young child when things were not going so well I could always turn to reading to get my mind off of the bad things. If children are allowed these escapes they can do better on their school work and with their peers. Reading can help a child to expand their imaginations. If a child reads a couple times a day it is proven that said child will do better in life. No one likes boring people, and how can you be boring with such a wide imagination? It is impossible! In recent online polls, parents who's children can access books say that their children to better in school and in every day life. By reading, these children can easily expand their vocabularies. With this knowlege they can learn with less difficulty and can excell in acedemics with ease. In conclusion, If certian books are censored from the libraries they will be inavailable for children to read. Children need books to provide an escape, to expand their imaginations, and to help them in school and life. Do not let libraries censor books!
1372	4349	2	3	Some materials in libraries may contain offensive content that can be harmful to individuals. If the offensive content includes sexual, racist, or life-threatening elements, it should be considered for removal. Offensive material that is sexually explicit can make individuals feel violated and uncomfortable. Similarly, racist content can be hurtful and perpetuate harmful stereotypes, causing emotional distress. Additionally, material that contains life-threatening threats or implications can instill fear and anxiety in readers. Therefore, it is important to remove offensive materials from library shelves to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all individuals.
1373	4350	2	3	Taking offensive books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech. People in this country have the right to express themselves, and authors should not be silenced because their opinions may offend some. Writers draw inspiration from society, and censoring their work will not change the way people think. Banning books with provocative content does not prevent society from engaging in such behavior, as individuals are exposed to these ideas in various ways. It is up to the individual to choose what they read, and libraries should not be held responsible for the content that readers find offensive. Banning books is an ineffective way to shield individuals from certain ideas, as society will continue to shape the thoughts and actions of individuals. It is important to respect the freedom of speech and the diverse perspectives that authors bring to the literary world.
1374	4351	2	3	One could understand why some would wish to censor libraries and remove all rude, unwanted, or offensive forms of media from their shelves. However, one must take into account that, as Katherine Paterson said, if one person has 'the right to remove that [a] book from the shelf...then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' With that thought in mind, do we honestly think that censorship of libraries is a smart idea? If everyone was able to pick and choose which books to be taken off the shelf or which music to ban, then we would have nothing left. You simply cannot please everyone. Are there benefits? Of course there are benefits. One certainly wouldn't want one's child exposed to certain material at a young age. But one must not censor libraries! If one wishes, as a responsible parent, that their child keep away from a particular book or movie, they should take that matter into their own hands and not condemn the book off the shelf. By condemning the book, one condemns the author. As an @CAPS1, one has the freedom of speech, and this applies to media as well. The author has the right to author a book that some @MONTH1 view as offensive, and no one has the right to remove his or her right from the standing.  Paper burns at @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2. In the classic novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, the protagonist struggles through life in a world antagonized by the banning and burning of books. The story takes place in the future, however, it contains an interesting undertone that hints at the possibility that this 'future' @MONTH1 be nearer than first imagined. To be blunt, the protagonist's life is horrible, he lives in a world that bans books, yet he is quite the bibliophile. He is employed as a fireman, not to clear fires, but to create them. @PERSON2's firemen are responsible for the delicate task of book burning, which is a rather frequent occurrence. However, with the main character's love for literature, how can he burn books?  Throughout the novel, the character tries to come to terms with himself and attempts to put an end to the madness, only to be forced out of civilized society. The book is frightening, but an amazing read: it emphasizes the dire reality of censorship. It's everywhere.  Now, one certainly doesn't need to worry about @PERSON2's futuristic hell, coming to life any time soon. But one should know the dangers of censorship. No one person has the right to remove a book from the shelves that they feel is offensive, let alone ban it entirely. The banning of books is a banning of freedom. Freedom of speech, freedom of ideas, freedom of thought. Another dystopian world that comes to mind is the world of @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE1. Though, granted, our society is certainly not headed for that any time soon, if ever: it is still a valid point. Once some freedoms are removed, others will follow.  Libraries should remain entirely intact, forever. Every person, every man, woman and child should have ample access to knowledge. Whether this knowledge be gained through books, magazines, movies or music, it needs to be readily available. Instead of banning certain media, one should label said media with a warning. Parents should have enough sense to pay attention and thus, the problem is solved.  Censorship is wrong, censorship is unnecessary, and there are a plethora of alternative means for protection against potentially 'offensive' media. Thus, the case can rest with the knowledge that all forms of media need to be available, no matter what the content.
1375	4352	2	3	There are many books out there that parents would not want their children reading. Some books have violence and crimes, others have love and romance. But it is not the best idea to use censorship in libraries. There are many books out there that might not be good for children to read, but it might help them make better choices in real life. Also, we cannot forget about freedom of the press.  With freedom of the press, anyone can write about anything they want. They can write about the good, the bad, violence, crimes, love, and romance. Everyone has their own way of writing and their own imagination. Without imagination, what fiction would there be for children to read? There would be nothing to write about without imagination. With censorship, there would not be any books on the library shelves for children to read.  If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves, there would not be any books to read because every book has something to censor. Whether it is swearing, guns, killing, romance, or love, there is something in every book that is inappropriate for children to read. If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves, there would be nothing left to read, and the intelligence of children would drop dramatically.  Children read for many reasons, like to expand their minds and to enter a world where the book takes place. But what children might not know is that reading also strengthens their vocabulary. When children read, they learn many new words that are in that book. While they are reading, the book opens their minds to much more than what they are used to and normally around every day. When they are reading, the children expand their minds and also helps them with everyday situations. This is why I do not believe that censorship in libraries is a great idea.  If libraries censor books and everything else on the shelves, there would be nothing left for children at the libraries. They would be stuck reading books where they do not learn anything. They would read the same books over and over, they wouldn't learn anything new. There wouldn't be anything they could expand their minds with. That is something we certainly do not want for our community or anywhere for that matter.
1376	4353	2	3	the scary book that you dont want your children to pick up off the shelf i think if your kids read it they would be scared having night mares and you probaly dont want that and if u have the right to move it your kids will have the right to move it because they see what you do they gonna wunt to do so u can do it when they are not around  and yea i believe that cetrtain materials.
1377	4354	2	3	Children should be protected from offensive materials in libraries, as these can have a negative impact on their development. In today's digital age, it is easy for children to come across harmful content through various mediums such as television, computers, and music. Schools should take steps to remove offensive materials from libraries to create a safe and educational environment for students. Censorship is necessary to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content that can influence their behavior and attitudes. By promoting a positive and conducive learning environment, schools can help safeguard the well-being of children and young teens. It is important for parents, educators, and society as a whole to prioritize the well-being and development of children by limiting their exposure to offensive materials.
1378	4355	2	3	The common phrase 'knowledge is power' accurately paints the situation at hand. Through censorship in libraries, which are meant to allow free access to all media-related materials, we take away the opportunity for people to empower themselves through knowledge. The reasons for not censoring media in libraries are numerous and include, but are not limited to, unconstitutionality of censorship, the lack of proper definition for 'offensive', and the contradiction censorship poses to the core of what a library is.   The first, and most blatant, reason for not allowing the censorship of materials in libraries is the unconstitutionality of the matter. Freedom of speech and freedom of press are both protected by the constitution upon which our country was founded. Censorship of said materials will effectively undermine both of these rights. Authors, illustrators, journalists and the slew of other individuals who compose the materials available in libraries are exercising their right to free speech through their works. They are constitutionally protected in the things they say. Notice that we have a right to free speech and not a right to free speech so long as no one is offended. The freedom of press is the means by which they share their ideas and concepts with the world. They are utilizing their free speech by means of press. Censoring library materials would be limiting the means by which artists can share their ideas with citizens of the location. This would be a clear failure to uphold the rights of the citizens. For this reason, we cannot censor libraries.   The constitutional concept of equality of man plays into the situation as well. There is no adequate legal definition of 'offend'. People could be offended by something as serious as a personal attack on their beliefs and personal entity or something as light as a personal distaste for certain mindsets and ideas. So, because all men are equal, we would have to respect the 'offense' taken by all people and to all degrees. This leaves every single work of art, whether it be a book, movie, magazine or any other form provided by libraries, open to the fickle definition of offensive and vulnerable to the personal feelings of every individual. If said offense taken by individuals to works is able to mark a work as 'offensive' and thus make it open to removal from libraries, we are effectively allowing citizens to undermine the rights of other citizens. This is something that cannot be allowed in our libraries.   The final core issue is the essence of censorship versus the essence of a library. Censorship is meant to create a politically correct and non-offensive environment through the limitation of exposure to materials. Libraries, however, are meant to allow public access to works that stretch and challenge knowledge, beliefs, notions and all ideas held by people through the works of others. Censorship cannot be implemented without a clash with the essence of a library's purpose. If censorship were to be enacted, a library could not provide new information if someone else did not like what was being taught. A library could not provide works that challenge and stretch individual beliefs if someone was offended by the means by which the stretching occurred. Pre-conceived notions could not be defeated with the presence of factual knowledge if someone did not like the truth. In all of these ways, and many more, a library's core ideals and purpose could not be upheld with the induction of a system of censorship.   All in all, we can see that censorship could only hope to destroy the system libraries abide by. The constitutional rights of citizens would be infringed upon, the fickle nature of humans and the lack of definition for 'offensive' would allow people to undermine the rights of others, and the essence of what a library really is would be ravaged. We cannot, as a society with rights, employ a system of censorship. Thus, it is imperative to uphold the freedom of access to knowledge in libraries to ensure the empowerment of individuals through the unrestricted pursuit of information.
1379	4356	2	3	I think kids should be able to read whatever they want. Kids should never be told no when it comes to learning. There are no bad books that kids will find at school anyway. Why should kids not be able to watch and read what they want? This is how we learn and grow, unless it is adult content, which would be against the law for them to access. Our kids' minds should not be wasted on things they do not want to read. When a child starts to hate their work, it can lead to a chain of hating school and the books within it. It is important to let kids explore and choose what they want to read to foster a love for learning and education.
1380	4357	2	3	I don't think that certain materials in books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves because I believe in freedom of speech. However, I do believe that content appropriate for high school students may not be suitable for elementary school students. While I have not encountered offensive material in books, I have come across it in music, particularly in rap songs. Despite this, I still believe in the right of individuals to express themselves. Everyone has the right to say what they want to say, but it is important to consider the audience and ensure that the content is age-appropriate.
1381	4358	2	3	"We all have our favorite books and some we like others may not. Have you ever walked into the library in hope of finding your all-time favorite book that you nearly forgot about, or maybe a book a friend recommended to you? What happens when you get there and the book has been censored? Most books we see in our public or school libraries are books that are well-liked or are favorites of many. Books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away.  To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because it could be offensive to some people because of racial slurs or comments. This is a big problem because most books written years ago took place long ago like ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" for example, may be considered offensive but, this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in this time period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future.  Some books that are censored have great educational value. Everyone has their preference on books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others may not. If all books that are bad or offensive were taken off the shelves then eventually we would have no books left. We have the right to read any book out there no matter how horrendous it may be, besides you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries. If we couldn't read some books like many classics it would take educational value away from us all. Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored. Before someone gets into a book they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them.  I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse. If someone feels offended then they shouldn't read it, it's their choice to pick it up or not. Hopefully I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want."
1382	4359	2	3	Killings, murders, and controversial themes in books may offend some individuals, but this does not justify removing them from schools or libraries. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it should be censored for everyone else. Allowing diverse perspectives and content in literature fosters critical thinking and engagement among students. By exposing students to a variety of themes and ideas, we encourage them to think independently and form their own opinions. Removing books that may be deemed offensive would limit the range of reading materials available and hinder students' intellectual growth. It is essential to promote open-mindedness and tolerance towards differing viewpoints, even if they challenge our beliefs. Ultimately, the value of literature lies in its ability to provoke thought, spark discussions, and broaden horizons. Let's embrace the diversity of ideas in books and empower students to navigate through them with maturity and understanding.
1383	4360	2	3	Censoring any type of media such as books, magazines, movies, or music from a library is not right. A library is a vast source of information placed in common spaces for people to seek knowledge. When something is deemed offensive, it should not be hidden away as if it never existed. If any media is found to be offensive, it should be up to the individual seeking the information to decide if they want to engage with it. When something offensive is encountered, the initial reaction is often to remove it from the library or other platforms. However, it is more beneficial to explain the nature of the offensive content so that individuals can understand why it is considered as such. Determining what is offensive can be subjective, and just because a few people find something offensive does not justify its removal. It is essential to have discussions and consultations with various groups before deciding to eliminate potentially offensive material. If a book or magazine is deemed offensive, the decision to remove it from the shelves should be a collective one, made by those involved in the subject matter, rather than simply hiding it away. Ultimately, open dialogue and a shared understanding of what constitutes offensive content are crucial in making informed decisions about censorship in libraries and other media outlets.
1384	4361	2	3	Offensive material can vary in its impact on individuals, as not everyone will find the same content offensive. It serves as a form of expression, allowing creators to convey emotions such as anger, grief, or passion. While some may deem certain material offensive, others may see it as a way to add depth and interest to a story. Children will inevitably encounter offensive content, so rather than shielding them from it, allowing them to engage with it in a controlled manner can promote curiosity and understanding. Ultimately, what is considered offensive is subjective, and individuals may differ in their opinions on what crosses the line.
1385	4362	2	3	I dont just cause you dont like something or you dont approve of the reading material dosent mean it should be taken away. If it was like that @DATE1 than there wouldnt be any reading material or books or magazines. In my opinion if affends you in some way or another than dont read it. Plane and simple. Because im sure that theres thosands of books, magazines, news papers. ect, thats affends alot of people everyday. I dont mean to be harsh in any way, thats just the way I feel. This is only my opinion. that how I feel about this situation.
1386	4363	2	3	Have you ever thought about why teenagers are changing each day? Sometimes parents don't pay attention to why this is happening because they think their kids are just growing up, needing more freedom, or simply needing more time. However, as time passes, they may stop and wonder what has happened to their children and why they are changing so much. This change can often be attributed to what teenagers see in magazines, movies, books, and music, as these mediums can influence their behavior and attitudes.   While music, books, magazines, and movies can have positive impacts, they can also have negative effects, especially when they contain offensive or inappropriate content. For example, young children reading books with offensive words can lead to them adopting disrespectful language and behavior.   I recall a personal experience where a friend of mine started reading books with offensive words, which led her to disrespect her mother. Upon realizing the root cause of her behavior, I informed her mother about the books and movies with inappropriate content that my friend had been exposed to. Initially, my friend was upset with me for telling her mother, but eventually, she understood that I did it out of love and concern for her well-being.   It is essential to remove offensive and negative content from books, movies, and other media to help children and teenagers develop into respectable individuals. By doing so, we can guide them towards becoming positive and influential members of society. Let's work together to create a safe and nurturing environment for our youth.
1387	4364	2	3	Some books and magazines can be offensive and inappropriate for certain audiences. For example, a sports magazine discussing an athlete's bathroom troubles may not be suitable for all readers. Similarly, books with explicit content, such as sexual themes and strong language, should be carefully monitored in libraries, especially when children have access to them. It is essential for parents to be aware of the material their children are reading to ensure it aligns with their values and beliefs. Ultimately, being mindful of the content in books and magazines can help protect individuals from exposure to potentially offensive or inappropriate material.
1388	4365	2	3	Katherine's concern about the availability of books if everyone had the right to take them off the shelf raises important points about censorship and the appropriateness of certain content for young readers. While some argue for the removal of explicit material to protect children, others believe in the freedom to choose what to read. Finding a balance between these viewpoints, implementing age restrictions, parental consent, and warnings on explicit material can help ensure that children have access to a variety of books while also considering their maturity levels. Ultimately, the decision of what children read should involve both the child and their parents, allowing for a more nuanced approach to book selection.
1389	4366	2	3	I do agree with this topic at hand, some of the material that is being displayed on the shelves at our local library is inappropriate or sometimes vulgar. Way too many people get away with way too many things in this day and age. Our society we live in is just a total wreck and complete, utter disaster. Something has to be done to put an end to this madness.  Someone would think that if a librarian put an inappropriate book up on the shelf, that it is inevitable that a child or someone irresponsible would find the book. Yet we still witness children reading or looking at a book, type of media, or entertainment that is not suitable for their age group. Sometimes adults find books that are not pleasing, why would we put them on a shelf to be publicly displayed? That is a question that I have yet to find the solution to.  I got home from school a couple of days ago and I heard this hip-hop music coming from my nine-year-old sister's room. I started to listen to the lyrics and they were absolutely awful, it was singing about drugs, sex, and alcohol. I went into her room and turned it off and questioned her where she got the CD from. She replied 'the library.'  That's just another example of what I'm speaking about. If someone at the age of nine can check out a CD like that, then imagine what is available to me at the age of sixteen. Adolescents do not need those kinds of thoughts and words in their vocabulary. I'm just afraid for the next generation; what are they going to be listening to? What are they going to be reading?  And it's not just the library, it's everywhere! We can't even live a day of our lives in this society without hearing something bad on the radio, on TV, or even in public. Everywhere we turn is something bad or vulgar. So we need to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our acts a little bit. We need to stand up for what's appropriate and what's right. We need to make a change before it's too late.
1390	4367	2	3	I don't believe that we should remove any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from our libraries due to many reasons. This is the real world and the things you read about or watch in a movie may be something you don't want your kids to read about or even see. Life is about learning new things. To learn about these ideas, you usually read about or see them somewhere. The only way I would ever remove any of these items from a store is if they were going to seriously harm the people or have a negative effect on them. If I were to walk into a public library and I saw a book about a girl cutting herself or someone killing another person, I would be the type of person to turn away from it; even though it is what many kids are reading about today. Of course, every library has books that cover all kinds of topics. If you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things, well welcome to life. Most books have a true story behind them and I believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life. Most of what we learn today comes from the books we read. Also, everyone today listens to music. We find music as a way to relax and have a good time whether you're riding in a car or at a party. Many of the songs today contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean that you have to listen to them. Many older people don't want to listen to these kinds of songs but it is what many kids are listening to today. What many people don't see though, is that these songs have true meaning behind them and it is really a way of life. Finally, I believe that magazines, movies, and any other types of media shouldn't be removed from libraries. Many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete. We watch movies to also relax and have a good laugh every once in a while. No one should remove these sources of entertainment from our people even if some may think they are inappropriate. I strongly believe that removing any books, magazines, movies, music, or any other types of media would have a negative effect on a lot of people. You would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people. How would you feel if you went to your local library one day and most, if not all, materials had been removed? What would you do if you didn't have any of these materials available to you anymore?
1391	4368	2	3	I believe that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be readily available to young children. These forms of media can expose them to inappropriate content and send the wrong message. It is important for creators and distributors to consider the impact their content may have on impressionable young minds. By restricting access to such material, we can help ensure that children are not influenced in negative ways. Parents and guardians also play a crucial role in monitoring and guiding the media consumption of young individuals. Overall, it is essential to be mindful of the messages we are sending to our children through various forms of media.
1392	4369	2	3	I enjoy reading books from Mexico because they help me relax and escape into a different world. When I have free time, I often find myself immersed in a book, allowing my imagination to run wild. Many people share this love for reading, and I often see others at the bookstore or library, searching for the perfect book to enjoy.  Reading is a great way to unwind after a long day, and it is something that I look forward to. When I was in school, I didn't read much, but now I make sure to always have a book on hand. Whether I'm at home or on vacation, reading is a constant companion.  Books have the power to transport us to different places and times, and I cherish the moments when I can lose myself in a good book. It's no wonder that my friends and family also enjoy reading, as it provides a sense of comfort and joy. Reading is a simple pleasure that brings so much happiness, and I am grateful for the opportunity to indulge in it whenever I can.
1393	4370	2	3	No I as an @CAPS1 cetazine do not feel that any materials should be removed. There are many reasons I feel this way and I hope that after people have read this they will agree with me. There are three main points supporting my opinion and I plan to list them below.  First and foremost is the fact that this is @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is supposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, or at least that's what the national anthem tells me. So to me if someone removes a book or movie from a library because they find it offensive they are trying to take away one of my rights as an @CAPS1 cetacine. The right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom. I should be free to be able to walk into a library and grab any book I wish. I should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie I choose from the shelf. If they put a movie or book away if they make it to where I can't get to it then they are messing with my freedom, and this is something I can't stand as an @CAPS1. I should be free to read or watch whatever I choose to.  Which brings me to my next point. This point is a simple and logical one. My second point is that people have the choice to read or watch the movie. Just because it is there it does not mean that they have to read or watch it. If someone doesn't like a book good for them, don't read it. If someone doesn't like a movie good for them, don't watch it. It is rather quite simple in my opinion if someone doesn't like said book or movie then just leave it alone and don't mess with it. They shouldn't have the right to ruin it for everyone else. Just because one or two or even twenty people find a book offensive doesn't mean they have the right to remove it. There are five million other people out there who love said book so why ruin it for everyone just to make a few people happy. They do have the right to say no and not read or watch the movie, but they don't have the right to say I can't.  Finally, people say that said book or movie should be removed because a child might get it and it is not appropriate for children. Well to that I have to say it is the parents' job to make sure a child is not reading or watching something they shouldn't. If a child gets a hold of a book that is said to be bad it is the parents' job to tell them to put it back. People don't have the right to completely remove said book or movie just because a kid might get it.  So there is my opinion on this little matter. I don't feel that libraries should be censored. I feel we all have the right to make our own decisions and that we have the right to read or watch whatever we choose. It is not fair to get rid of a book just because a few people don't like it. Hundreds of others might love it, and like I said before if someone doesn't like a certain movie or book then don't read it or watch it. Don't ruin it for everyone else though.
1394	4371	2	3	Many people have different views on different types of things. There is not much that can be helped with that. No one can never make everybody happy. That is a major part of life. I do not think they should remove materials from libraries just because some people find them offensive. You cannot make everyone happy, some people enjoy those materials, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  The first reason they should not remove offensive materials from the library is because you will not make everybody happy by doing that. Just because some people take offense to certain things, does not mean that everyone does. If they do not like it, they do not have to read it or listen to it. They have libraries so you can pick out books (and other materials) that you like. You have a choice there. There are lots of books that are at libraries around the world. People are going to be mad whether they are there or not. Have you ever heard the saying 'don't judge a book by its cover?' Well that could also be a reason people want materials removed. They might see a 'suggestive' cover or something, and they might take total offense to that. Just because a cover of a book might make people take offense to it doesn't mean they should remove it.  The second reason offensive materials should not be removed is because it is enjoyable for some people. There is a reason it is in the library, and that reason is because some people enjoy it. If there was a book or magazine that never got checked out, do you think they would keep it? Nope. I am pretty sure if it never got checked out, they would get rid of it. Obviously someone has to read, listen, or watch it. People get offended by things everyday. Removing 'offensive' materials from libraries will not be much help to the problem. It may help a little, but there are still going to be people who get offended so easily.  The third reason they should keep materials is because everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Just because some people think that there are offensive materials in the library does not mean other people do. For some people, taking away things like that would be like making kids at school wear uniforms. It takes away freedom. We are living in a free country. It is really not a free country when you have people taking away books and movies because they are offensive to people. I got news for you. If you don't like it, don't read it. There is no harm at all by keeping materials on shelves.  No matter what, someone is always going to take offense to something. The world is not perfect, and it is never going to be perfect. Taking materials off the shelves because it is offensive to some people isn't going to make the world a better place. People are going to be mad or angry no matter what happens. Everyone has different views, and it is important to respect that diversity.
1395	4372	2	3	Some books are offensive but not all of them. Some libraries have begun to censor their book collection by removing ones they thought could be offensive. I believe there should not be any censorship in libraries.   One reason I do not believe that there should be censorship in libraries is that tons of good books are lost because of it. Some libraries do not carry certain books because of language or content, but instead of removing them completely, they could simply warn readers about potential offensive material.  A second reason why I do not believe in censorship is that some books on different religions get removed, depriving people of valuable knowledge and perspectives. Censoring books on certain religions limits access to information and understanding.  A third reason is that censorship can lead to unintended offense. By removing certain books, libraries may inadvertently upset individuals who value those works.   I propose that libraries organize books by subjects and genres and provide warnings for potentially sensitive content. This way, readers can make informed choices while maintaining access to a wide range of literature.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries should be avoided to ensure freedom of information and diverse perspectives. By allowing access to a variety of books and providing appropriate warnings, libraries can cater to the needs and interests of all readers.
1396	4373	2	3	Throughout time, fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive. It may be the way they were brought up, or simply what they believe. I do not believe that it should be up to anyone to say what should and should not be censored for anyone but themselves. Everyone has one life, and in this one life we create our personal opinions and beliefs on what is wrong and what is right. We are completely unaware of many people throughout our life cycles, and saying what should be banned from everybody is almost claiming you know the morals, beliefs, and customs of everyone in the world.  If I came to school one day and brought a book that contained material that I think is relevant and not just pure exploitation, then I should be able to read that as long as I don't influence others by their own will. Let's say another student sees me reading that same book and he has grown up in a household that taught him that the situations and material in my book are overly offensive, I do not think he should be able to create a ban of this book just because of his own upbringing. There is such a thing as mass agreement, but there is also a thing called mass ignorance, and to say that I know what should and should not be shown to other people is completely ignorant on my part.  I think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child. That is the only situation that someone should be allowed authority over someone else, because they have undeniable duties as parents, and they be able to say what is right knowing they are creating a child to think what is wrong and what is right in their mind. Ultimately, censorship should be a personal choice rather than a universal mandate, respecting individual beliefs and values.
1397	4374	2	3	At Jeffersonville High School, students do not have the authority to remove books from the library shelves. If there is a book that does not appeal to you, simply do not choose it, just like you would not watch a movie that does not interest you or eat a meal that you do not like. It is important to be selective in your choices to ensure you are engaging with material that is beneficial and enjoyable to you. Remember, just because a book is not to your taste does not mean it should be removed for others who may find value in it. Choose wisely and make the most out of your reading experiences.
1398	4375	2	3	Censorship is a contentious issue in society, with some believing that certain materials should be restricted to protect children, while others argue that censorship can hinder a child's understanding of the world. While censorship can be useful in shielding children from inappropriate content, it can also prevent them from learning important lessons. It is essential for parents to consider the overall message of a book or media rather than focusing solely on the potentially offensive content. Education and open communication are crucial in helping children navigate the complexities of the world. Ultimately, the decision on censorship should prioritize what is best for the child's development and knowledge.
1399	4376	2	3	Going to the library is one of the best ways to explore new things. Some items are not appropriate for everyone though. Certain books, movies, magazines, and music should not be accessed by everyone. Having an adult only section would be a way to solve this problem.   Removing certain materials from the library would not be in good interest. Any popular material should be available at the library. Many best selling books would be wrong for children to read, but they would be perfectly fine for adults. That doesn't mean these books need to be taken out of the library. Children should be restricted from viewing the explicit materials though. Having a section in the library from which only adults can rent the items, would remove this problem. People under @NUM1 should also be restrained from looking through these materials. Having a childrens' section in the libray would also keep them away from adult materials. The library needs to make itself user friendly.   People who frequent the library often pick up a book, not knowing what it holds. When inappropriate material is inside a child might innocently read into or see something they are not supposed to. Parents should not have to worry about their kids seeing inappropriate pictures or text. They should feel safe letting their children look through all the books at the library. Library workers should also make sure the adult materials stay in the hands of adults. Allowing children and their parents to feel safe and welcome is an important part of the library.   Taking adult materials out of the library is not a good idea. It would lower its popularity. Everyone has different interests, and they want to research them at the library. The safety of children is also important. Making sure children cannot reach these materials is a concern. Having separate adult and children sections could solve this problem. Not allowing anyone under @NUM1 to check out explicit materials would also help. Keeping the library full of information but still safe for children is the ideal situation.
1400	4377	2	3	I believe that not all books should be banned, but some books should. For example, there are many good books that are banned because they may contain a little bit of cussing, but I believe that is acceptable since children are exposed to similar language through other mediums. However, books that promote hate against other races or religions should definitely be banned.  For instance, I once encountered a banned book called The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. While this book may contain some controversial themes such as a rebellious protagonist and smoking, it is not as harmful as the negative portrayal of certain groups. On the other hand, a book discussing historical perspectives on slavery should be allowed as it provides insight into different beliefs of the time.  In conclusion, instead of banning books based on language or events that may not align with personal views, the focus should be on the message that the book is trying to convey. It is important to consider the impact and implications of the content rather than simply censoring based on personal preferences. By reevaluating the criteria for banning books, we can ensure a more open and diverse literary environment.
1401	4378	2	3	Whenever you go these days, you see violence in every store around the world. Children growing up in this environment are exposed to negative influences, and many thrive off the offensive materials that are readily available. I believe that offensive products should be restricted to stores for adults aged twenty-one and older to prevent young people from being exposed to harmful content. For example, magazines with inappropriate content should not be sold in bookstores, which are intended for books. It is important to protect young minds from being influenced by offensive material, as they may grow up thinking such behavior is acceptable.   As a child, I would often visit bookstores with my mom and pick up any book that caught my eye. However, my mom would sometimes take the book away if it was deemed offensive. In today's society, children are growing up too quickly and should be allowed to enjoy their childhood by reading age-appropriate books. While older students may not be as interested in reading, it is crucial to protect younger children in elementary school who are eager to learn.  Ultimately, the decision to publish offensive material often comes down to profit. Regardless of the content, companies and authors prioritize making money. However, it is essential to consider the impact these materials have on young, impressionable minds. By restricting access to offensive content and promoting age-appropriate reading materials, we can help shape a more positive and healthy environment for our children.
1402	4379	2	3	There are many different topics that could be offensive, it just depends on the person's own personal judgment. In my opinion, I do not believe that materials should be removed because not everyone has the same views or opinions. If someone comes from a different country or even a different religion, topics like abortion and racism are going to be viewed very differently. I think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way.  When I am older and if one of my elementary children were to bring home a book over abortion, I would be concerned. Honestly though, I do not believe schools would let inappropriate topics for younger children read books like that. It is a little bit different with a high school student though. Their maturity level is going to be mature enough to handle the material and I do not think it is right for schools to remove something that could actually help someone.  Libraries should be able to have a variety of different books. I am not saying, however, that they should have books on murder and saying it is alright, but books that will help expand the children's minds. It could even change their lives. Some books are a sensitive topic but who has the right to tell someone something they should believe? It would mean more to someone if they found their own way and beliefs than having people tell them what they should and should not do or believe in.  Racism, abortion, child abuse, unwinding your children, whatever the case may be, some people will support it and some will not. I think it is time for children around the world to discover for themselves what they truly believe in, and taking 'offensive' material from libraries is not going to help. My opinion on this topic is strongly advising to leave the material alone because for there to be a book about it, the author had to have had a reason to write it, and honestly, what is better for the future than a generation of children grounded in their own true beliefs.
1403	4380	2	3	Since the beginning of time, there has always been controversy surrounding media that some find offensive. Books, movies, and music have all faced scrutiny, leading to censorship in some cases. However, I believe that censorship in media is unnecessary. Instead of banning materials, they should be properly labeled or described to inform consumers of potentially offensive content. Everyone has different tastes and sensibilities, and it's important to allow for diverse expressions in media.   The Bible, for example, is a widely challenged book that continues to spark debates across different cultures and religions. Despite its controversial nature, it remains in print, highlighting the importance of free expression. By allowing for a variety of viewpoints and ideas in media, we encourage critical thinking and open dialogue among individuals.   While there are already measures in place such as parental advisories and content ratings, these should not limit access to different perspectives. Freedom of thought is a valuable asset that should be protected, as it allows for personal growth and understanding. Let media remain free so that people from all walks of life can explore new ideas and form their own opinions. Censorship may be prevalent, but it is up to individuals to challenge it and advocate for a more open and inclusive media landscape. In the end, embracing diverse viewpoints in media leads to a richer and more vibrant society.
1404	4381	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries should consist of appropriate material, but there can be value in having some offensive literature available for those who wish to learn from it. However, there should be an age limit for checking out such items to ensure they are accessed responsibly. It is important to maintain a balance when it comes to the content available in libraries. While some may find certain materials offensive, others may see them as valuable sources of information and education. By providing access to a range of materials, including those that some may deem offensive, libraries can serve as a place for learning and exploration. It is essential to have a designated section for offensive material and enforce age restrictions to ensure responsible consumption. Ultimately, the presence of offensive material in libraries can contribute to a well-rounded and enriching experience for patrons seeking diverse perspectives and knowledge.
1405	4382	2	3	I am not in agreement because young children should not be exposed to certain offensive books. However, I believe that books should not be removed or censored in the libraries. It is important to protect children from inappropriate content, but censoring books can be a slippery slope towards limiting freedom of expression. Instead of removing books, parents and caregivers can guide children towards age-appropriate reading materials and have open discussions about the content they encounter. By promoting critical thinking and responsible reading habits, we can empower children to navigate the literary world while respecting diverse perspectives and ideas. Ultimately, education and communication are key in shaping young minds and fostering a healthy relationship with literature.
1406	4383	2	3	I think that censorship in libraries should definitely be relevant. For example, requiring ID to check out adult books can help prevent children from accessing inappropriate material. Public libraries should adhere to state and city laws to ensure that adult content is not shown to children. In some libraries, manga and anime books contain graphic content that may not be suitable for younger audiences, despite being rated for ages 18 and up. Making changes to the library system to implement a censorship system can help protect children from accessing adult material. Ultimately, it is up to the individual libraries to decide if they want to make these changes.
1407	4384	2	3	I do not believe that materials in libraries should be censored. Parents should take responsibility for monitoring what their children are reading or listening to, rather than restricting access for everyone. Libraries cater to people of all ages and should not be limited to only children. Censoring library materials would alienate many adults and diminish the value of the library as a resource for the community. It is the role of parents to guide their children in making appropriate choices, rather than imposing restrictions on everyone. Libraries should continue to provide a wide range of materials for people of all ages, and parents should be proactive in teaching their children about what is acceptable for them to access.
1408	4385	2	3	Censoring books in libraries because a certain group of people finds them offensive is unfair. A diverse library should cater to people of different backgrounds. A compromise can be reached by regulating books with age limits based on content and maturity level. For example, books with mature content can be labeled and placed away from young readers' books. Censorship is not the solution, as it limits diversity in library materials. Just like movies have ratings, books can have age-appropriate labels to guide readers. People have the right to choose what they read, but age-appropriate labeling ensures that everyone can access a variety of materials. Ultimately, a balanced approach can allow for freedom of choice while considering the sensitivities of different readers.
1409	4386	2	3	I believe that some products should be removed from shelves, especially those that promote harmful behavior like drug and alcohol use. These products can influence young minds in a negative way and lead to serious consequences. Additionally, songs with inappropriate lyrics should not be played as they can influence children and lead to disciplinary issues. Magazines with explicit content should also be restricted to prevent children from accessing them. It is essential for parents to be mindful of what their children are exposed to and to ensure that inappropriate content is not easily accessible. Ultimately, the well-being and safety of individuals and families should take precedence over profit-driven motives in the marketplace.
1410	4387	2	3	Do you think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that could be offensive should or should not be pulled off the shelves? I believe they shouldn't. All kinds of people buy books or movies and they all have different types they like. Companies that manufacture books, movies, music, and magazines would be losing out on money if people can't find something they like, and if they don't have the money to make whatever it is they make, then they will go out of business. Then you might be out of luck for what you are looking for. All kinds of people buy things that they like. How would you like it if your favorite candy was taken off the shelves because it offended people? Well, that's how they feel when that happens to them. What would be put in their places? Stores have to have something to fill the shelves. Would they put more candy to make the world fat? If you come across something you think is offensive, just don't pay attention to it. Others may like it like you like your favorite candy. We have a great number of other things you can pick from.
1411	4388	2	3	A curious child goes into the library for the first time to find a story to read. Yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library because it is said to promote certain ideals to children. The child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. The older sister is too busy looking for her own book. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. She can't find the book she wants; the library has censored it.  Why would we censor libraries if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is not right to censor libraries because that is restricting what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper; it is relaying a story to entertain the audience that is reading it.  By censoring libraries, that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a way to express yourself. Authors share their expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendous day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life; the Harry Potter series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind. I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me.  Some may say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture, the slightest thing can be called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things, how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items, we will never learn, and neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.  Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red flagged. If certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this, a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose themselves to it if they did not want to, but others could.  In conclusion, censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech. We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system, it is fair to everyone. The 'offensive' material can stay in the libraries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are too.
1412	4389	2	3	I believe that no source of knowledge should be removed from library shelves just because some people find it offensive. What one person finds offensive, another may find reasonable. Censoring books based on individual sensitivities limits access to diverse perspectives and important information. Even if a book contains racist or sexist content, it can still provide valuable insights and provoke critical thinking. Reading controversial books can be thought-provoking and lead to personal growth. Libraries should remain open spaces where people have the freedom to choose what they read. It is essential to preserve access to a wide range of literature, including books that may challenge or discomfort some readers. Ultimately, the decision to read a book should be left to the individual, not dictated by the opinions of a few.
1413	4390	2	3	I believe that things should not be taken off the shelves just because a few people are offended. While some individuals may find certain content offensive, there are others who appreciate it. Removing items based on the feelings of a minority can limit the choices available to the majority. It is important to consider the overall impact and necessity of removing something before taking action. Offensiveness is subjective, and individuals have the option to avoid what they find offensive. Therefore, removal should only occur when there is a valid reason, such as preventing harm or legal issues. It is essential to strike a balance between respecting individuals' feelings and maintaining freedom of expression.
1414	4391	2	3	I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of entertainment are valuable tools that bring joy and learning to people of all ages. While some may find certain materials offensive, it is important to remember that there are plenty of other options to choose from. These materials are not meant to gather dust on a shelf but to be utilized for education and enjoyment.   Children, teenagers, and adults alike benefit from the knowledge and character development that can be gained from these sources. It is crucial to understand that everyone has the right to their own opinion, but attempting to censor or remove these tools from our communities sets a dangerous precedent. If we allow one form of censorship, it could lead to a slippery slope of restrictions on other forms of expression.   In the end, it is essential to embrace the diversity of opinions and perspectives that these materials offer. They have the power to enrich our lives and contribute to a more well-rounded and informed society. Let's not stifle creativity and learning by restricting access to the tools that have the potential to shape our world for the better.
1415	4392	2	3	I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive. Everyone has different tastes and preferences, and what may offend one person may be enjoyable to another. It is important to remember that these forms of entertainment are a reflection of reality, and removing them would limit freedom of speech and artistic expression. People should have the autonomy to choose what they want to engage with, and if something offends them, they can simply choose to avoid it. It is not fair to impose one's views on others and restrict access to creative works that may hold value or meaning for different individuals. Ultimately, it is important to respect diverse perspectives and allow for a variety of content to be available for those who appreciate it.
1416	4393	2	3	In this world, there are various materials that may not be suitable for individuals to consume, such as books, music, movies, etc. While some may argue that everyone has the right to choose what they read, watch, or listen to, I believe that certain materials are not appropriately rated for different age groups. Some materials should be restricted from minors, some from children, and some from the general population.  For instance, some movies may have excessive violence or explicit language, which may not be suitable for younger audiences. The current ratings may not accurately reflect the content, leading to exposure to inappropriate material. This can contribute to behavioral issues in children, as they may mimic what they see without understanding the consequences.  Parents should be vigilant about the content their children are exposed to and advocate for stricter regulations on offensive materials. By banning certain materials from minors, we can help protect them from negative influences and promote a healthier environment for their development.  Moreover, there are instances where materials are not suitable for any age group due to their offensive nature. Engaging with such content can have a detrimental impact on individuals, leading to desensitization to violence or inappropriate behavior. It is essential to recognize the harmful effects of such materials and take measures to restrict their access to the general public.  Ultimately, by being mindful of the content we consume and advocating for stricter regulations on offensive materials, we can create a safer and more positive environment for everyone. Banning certain materials from minors, children, and the general population is a necessary step towards fostering a society that upholds values of respect and decency.
1417	4394	2	3	A place filled with knowledge should provide access to a wide range of information, including news shaping the world today and historical content. Libraries offer a diverse collection of books, magazines, movies, and sometimes music, catering to various interests and learning needs. While libraries aim to educate and inform, it is essential to consider the presence of mature content and profanity in some materials.   Individuals, regardless of age, benefit from understanding past events and staying informed about current affairs to prevent historical mistakes from recurring and to make informed decisions. Libraries can provide signage or labels to indicate the content of specific sections, allowing visitors to choose their reading materials based on personal preferences. Ultimately, libraries should uphold the principle of providing unrestricted access to information, allowing individuals to expand their knowledge without censorship. The decision to visit a library and engage with its resources remains a personal choice, guided by the pursuit of knowledge and information.
1418	4395	2	3	I think that your parents should have to sign a piece of paper saying that it is okay or not okay for the person to go to that side of the library. It is up to the parents and the way their kids will handle it. On one side of the library, it would be more geared towards a more mature audience, with no pornographic material, of course, but content that wouldn't be considered appropriate for children. Kids fifteen and older would understand. They might also have to have an adult with them. On the other side of the library, it would be more of a children's area with child stories targeted for kids aged fourteen and younger. There would have to be someone at the dividing line checking the pass that says it's okay or not. It would be a little difficult but would satisfy both parties. It is up to the parent to decide if it is okay for their children to read certain content of language and description. The child must be at least fourteen in order to get a pass from the parent though. I definitely agree with Katherine Paterson; eventually, your kids will find out about all those things. I would rather have my kids learn from a book and ask me than find out on the streets where they could end up getting hurt or in trouble with the law, or even going to a party and ending up doing something that might harm them.
1419	4396	2	3	Do your rights end where mine begin? In such a diverse society, clashing opinions are unavoidable. Does that mean another human's rights should be abused because we don't agree with their practices, beliefs, or lifestyle? Everyone in this world is entitled to their own opinion. What is wrong to some people may be right to others. For example, one family may view their children using curse words as offensive while another may see no problem. Diversity in beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society from cursing, religion, or violence discussed in published works. These concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them disappear. It is understood that there is both bad and good in the world, and pulling materials from the shelves of libraries will not change that. Censoring books, magazines, music, and other media is denying someone the ability to see ideas from all points of view. Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspectives does not mean the bad and good do not exist. The saying 'one year older, one year wiser' can refer to the acknowledgment of different ideas and opinions. As a child grows, he will learn more about the materials that were censored. In some cases, such as in the classroom, your rights do end where mine begin. When it comes to learning about the beauty of diversity, everyone is able to choose what they pick from the shelf. The definition of 'offensive material' is simply a matter of opinion.
1420	4397	2	3	I do not think that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves. While some content may not be suitable for young children, it is important to allow access to a variety of materials for different age groups. Restricting access based on age appropriateness and obtaining parental permission for certain materials can be a better approach. This way, children can still explore a wide range of topics and interests while ensuring they are exposed to content that is suitable for their age. Removing these materials entirely could limit children's exposure to diverse perspectives and ideas found in literature and media. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between providing access to a variety of materials and ensuring that children are exposed to age-appropriate content.
1421	4398	2	3	Do you believe that certain books, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelf in a library due to censorship? There are many times when you hear a parent tell their child not to look at that magazine because they don't want them to see the vulgar things on the inside. I've heard parents tell their children not to ever watch that movie because it'll show things that they don't need to be seeing. Almost every day we're put in situations like these, not knowing whether we should pick up the magazine or just leave it on the shelf. In my opinion, I believe that libraries should remove anything vulgar from the shelves. Kids are encouraged to go to the library as much as possible, but not if there is vulgar things on the shelves.  Kids are told many times a week by their parents, teachers, and other adults to go the library. They can work on their homework, read a book, or do some studying for school. When they get distracted from finding the book they want with a book that has vulgar things in it, they're going to be curious. The main reason I disagree with having vulgar things on the shelves is because of young children. The last thing they need to be looking at is something that isn't appropriate for their age. It's hard for a child to turn down a movie or magazine they've never seen or looked at before.  In most libraries the adult section is separated from the children's section. This doesn't mean that a child can't overhear something that the adults are listening to or watching. The children's section is made for fairy tale stories and kid movies, but when the adult section has things going on over there that aren't the most appropriate then kids can overhear. If children and adults are going to be in the same library then I think they should make it completely impossible for children to veer over there and see what's new on that side of the library.  Another reason I think libraries should censor themselves more is because of teenagers in the community. After school hours, a lot of teenagers in our community enjoy going to the library. If this is such a good environment for teenagers to be then why are they able to download bad music off of the internet?  Some teenagers listen to bad music with cursing, vulgar language, and much more. Libraries should make it impossible for teenagers to do this. If they want to download bad music then they need to do it somewhere else where youngsters can't get ahold of any of it.  My last argument for this is a heads up for the parents. Parents should check out what stuff their kids are looking at when they go to the library. You might not think your child would look at something with vulgar things, but sometimes, they're curious. All children are and it's human nature to be curious. I, myself, would go with my child a few times just to see what's in the library and tell them not to take things off the shelves that look bad.  Some libraries can't completely fix everything. They can't take every bad or vulgar thing off of the shelves. In the quote it says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.', I can think of books and magazines that I would never want any child to look at, especially at a young age. Libraries need to be more interested in taking vulgar things off the shelves so that younger children cannot get ahold of. It's one thing for a child to see a book or magazine that isn't necessarily appropriate, but in a library it's a completely different story.
1422	4399	2	3	There are certain books that no child should ever read, but in some libraries, they don't seem to mind what is on their shelves. They are more focused on the fact that a child is reading, regardless of the content. Even though there are designated kid sections in libraries, children can still easily access books with inappropriate language.   I recall my own experiences of finding books with curse words when I was younger, and how we found it amusing to read and repeat them. It was even common for teachers to read books with curse words to us, eliciting laughter from the students. However, if we were to use those words outside of the context of reading, we would be reprimanded.  While some may find it acceptable for books to contain curse words for older children, elementary school-aged kids should not be exposed to such language. These books are intended for adults, as some stories may benefit from the use of curse words to enhance the narrative. Despite my parents' disapproval of me bringing home books with inappropriate language, they understood that I would inevitably encounter such words as I grew older.  In conclusion, books containing curse words should not be readily available to young children. It is important to consider the appropriateness of the content being consumed by children to ensure their language development and moral values are not negatively impacted.
1423	4400	2	3	Billions of books are circulated among shelves daily, encompassing a wide range of genres and themes. Authors from all corners of the globe contribute their unique perspectives and stories, catering to diverse audiences. With the fundamental right to freedom of speech, writers have the liberty to explore endless narrative possibilities.  Libraries serve as vast repositories of knowledge and imagination, housing books of varying genres, styles, and covers. Categorizing books based on their content is crucial for organization, but the idea of censorship should not impede the availability of diverse literary works. Each reader has their own preferences, and restricting access to certain materials based on subjective judgments can hinder the enjoyment and intellectual growth of individuals.  While concerns about inappropriate content for young readers are valid, implementing a rating system similar to that of movies could offer a compromise. By creating designated sections for mature content, such as an @CAPS1 @NUM1 cubicle, libraries can provide a solution without resorting to outright censorship. Ultimately, parental guidance plays a crucial role in guiding young readers towards age-appropriate material.  Censorship, whether applied to books, music, or other forms of media, undermines the creative freedom of artists and limits the diversity of thought and expression. Rather than imposing restrictions on content, a more nuanced approach that considers individual preferences and the role of parental supervision is essential. Allowing for a variety of voices and perspectives to be heard enriches the literary landscape and fosters a culture of open-mindedness and critical thinking. In the realm of literature, as in all forms of art, diversity and freedom of expression should be upheld as paramount values.
1424	4401	2	3	Censorship, or the ability to control what is seen or heard, is a term that is taken very differently from one person to the next. Music, if it is found offensive or inappropriate, can be censored or even banned from listening. Some magazines that are found at grocery stores, libraries, and sometimes even airports, have censored covers on the front to visually censor the front page of the magazine. Movies are given ratings based on their level of explicit material, and when shown on basic cable, they sometimes can have either silenced words, or more appropriate words brought in to fit the dialogue in the movie. Books, although very rarely, have been banned from libraries and censored from the entire world. Some books have been previously censored, but became uncensored and brought back to libraries. In my opinion, censorship should not be based on a single person's view of the material, but rather on the viewpoint of the public. Growing up, my parents would watch carefully about what shows I watched, what music I listened to, or the types of magazines that I looked at.  When I was growing up, I loved to watch professional wrestling. I loved to watch big scary guys as tall as seven feet hitting each other with steel chairs, crashing each other into tables, or throwing each other off of twenty-foot steel cages. My brother and I used to have a favorite wrestler that we would root for every week, @PERSON1 @CAPS1 could frighten any other wrestler who stood in his way. My brother and I loved to watch @PERSON1 @CAPS1 compete every week for a chance at a world championship belt. As time passed, professional wrestling began to welcome in beautiful women into their business. These women would come out onto the ring with tight, shiny lingerie on as they became eye-candy for the men who watched professional wrestling. One day, I'm watching two girls fighting in a match when my mom walks in. She takes one look at the half-naked girls fighting each other and turns off the TV and declares that professional wrestling is too adult for me. Even though I was twelve at the time, I didn't want to get in an argument with my mom about how much I should be allowed to see. Censorship can be based on the ideas and viewpoints of the parents and guardians.  I was in grade school when I fell in love with the show, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6.' @CAPS7 is a show about four boys who go on unintentional adventures to save their town. These four boys, who are all around eleven years old, use curse words that some adults would be afraid to use in everyday life. Their behavior is very controversial and the show itself has been forced to ban a few of their episodes for safety reasons. One problem with @CAPS7 show was that my dad loved @CAPS7 show as well, and tried to get my mom to like the show. When my mom saw the show, she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content. Now that I am older, I am able to make my own decisions about what I watch, but as a kid, my parents decided what was appropriate for me.  I grew up listening to several different types of music. My brother listened to rap, alternative, and even songs that were in musicals because he was in show choir. My dad introduced me to classic rock, and my mom loved soft rock. Although I didn't necessarily like the music that my mom liked, I learned to love my dad's music and my brother's music. I loved to listen to music from artists like @ORGANIZATION4, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and so on. My musical tastes branched out into a variety of different genres. One day, I'm walking in the hallway when I hear some music coming from the living room. I go to see what is playing because it sounds unfamiliar. My dad and my brother told me to go into another room and not listen to the music. The song was by a band named @ORGANIZATION2. Even though it might seem unfair, censorship, given by the parents and guardians, is very necessary.  Although some people might find a certain piece of material offensive, it doesn't mean that the entire world should be banned from the material itself. If that person wants to keep away from the material and keep their kids from seeing or listening to that material, they are able to do that. Censorship, given by the parents or guardians, is the best way to view censorship. Nothing should be banned from a library, music store, or any other place that sells these materials. Censorship is important, but the entire banning of a certain piece of material is unjust. Parents and guardians have the responsibility to monitor and decide what is appropriate for
1425	4402	2	3	Yes, there are many things today that face censorship, but that doesn't mean they should be removed from libraries. Instead of taking censored items out of the libraries, there are alternative solutions that can be considered. One option could be implementing restrictions, such as requiring individuals to be a certain age or have a parent or guardian present when accessing censored material. Another possibility is to create a designated room for censored items, located in a less prominent area of the library, with clear signage indicating the content within. By exploring these alternative solutions, we can ensure that censorship concerns are addressed without completely removing access to these materials for those who wish to engage with them. It is important to consider the diverse preferences and opinions of library patrons when determining how to handle censored items, rather than implementing a blanket removal policy that may limit access for all individuals.
1426	4403	2	3	If a woman were to walk into a library and throw a tantrum about the appropriateness of a book, it would not be appropriate to remove the book from the shelves. Everyone has their own opinions about what is offensive or inappropriate, and it is not fair to restrict access to certain materials based on individual preferences. Removing books from the library would limit the knowledge and information available to the public. It is important to respect the diversity of opinions and allow people to make their own choices about what they want to read. Keeping all books on the shelves ensures that everyone has access to a wide range of information and perspectives. Don't be selfish; keep the books on the library shelf.
1427	4404	2	3	Tuff @CAPS1 for a little @CAPS2      Censorship is a problem we are faced with today. I believe there are certain instances where censorship is necessary, but I also feel it must be kept in check. Thats why i have a great deal of reespect for organizations and industries that try and stop or put of censorship media untill your more mature and responsible enough to handle it.         The most common categories where censorship is not all right in my world are, books and music. A lot of book are very well writen and fabulous to read, but in history or racial, and more cultural books they use words/terms that are offensive to me and a lot of other people to.      Also, the main cause in thius is music. In today's society, nearly every person has an ipod and downloaded onto that ipod is music. Im not saying all music is terribly bad, but in most cases i hear about every word in the book and race topics. Rappers are setting bad examples for young adolecents like myself, who pose with guns and have marijuna and crack. Why do they do this? Just to mkae themselves more popular. That is hurting our education and making us think we shyould be criminals.      I in my opinion enjoy magazines and tru informative facts from professional reporters. Tghe reporters are on the citizens side and trying to get the true facts out there for us the people. Maqgazines also, tell about annual celbrations and good things happening in the world. Whyere you can find out the scores of sports game and what the weather is going to be like.      Last year, i remeber reading 'To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4'. It was so contraversial and talked about blackl slaves and whites treatinbg them like dirt. Also, about black never win a trial and there treated unfairly. I felt embaressed and i was the only african american in the class. It was akward. I felt like if we had a discussion people would talk badly about iot then remember i was in the room then theyd stop.     What is the world going to do? Censorship covers an entire multi media spectrum of what is bad and good censorship. It is up to the right people to stand up for what is right and wrong for your children and young adolecents in the world. To help fight this cause! Bring down all that is bad! We can do it, we will fight! Like @PERSON1 says, 'dont hope for a better change or wish for a new world.' If you want change you need to make it happen and stand up for whats right and make a differnce in the world. Remember, censorship should be used wisely and responsibly to protect individuals and society as a whole. Let us work together to promote positive and informative content while discouraging harmful and inappropriate material. By taking a stand against censorship in the right way, we can create a better and more enlightened world for ourselves and future generations.
1428	4405	2	3	Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The material should be removed if they offend their gender. Also, the material should be removed if it offend's their religion. Finally, it should be removed if it offend's their race.  The material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's gender. First, the material can make a person feel unworthy. Second, the material can cause an large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others. Third, the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text.  Also, the material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's religion. This can cause someone to hate every other person with the same religion as the writer, song writer, actor, and/or director. Second, the library should be about education, fun, and interesting contents not by offending someones religion. Finally, this can cause a person or people to act as terrostist from this offensive content.  The material also should be removed if it is offending someones race. First, the material may call the race of the person that is reading, listening, or watching a name that's very offensive (not directly but in general). Second, the material can speak of the race as if it was bad. Lastly, the material can influence other kids to disrespect that race and not like people of that race.  The material that is offensive to anyone's gender, religion, and/or race should be removed from the shelves of a library. The library is a place where everyone can read, listen, or watch about something that is interesting, not to offend other people in all ways.
1429	4406	2	3	Often we go to the library searching for a good book or magazine to read without actually knowing what books are available. In order to find a book that interests you, you have to explore by picking up the book and looking at the cover and reading its background. Sometimes we come across a book or magazine that is inappropriate for children, and wonder why that book is still on the shelf for anyone to pick up. I believe materials that are offensive to some people should be permitted from the public library.  To begin, the books selected to advertise on the shelves of a library are not restricted for a certain age level. Libraries are broken up into different sections on where to find a genre, but a young child may not be aware. I believe there are certain materials found in a library that should not be put out for the public. Perhaps you have a five year old child pick up a book about sex and drugs, this could lead the child to learn things they shouldn't know until they are older.  To continue, offensive books should not be put into libraries because they give that library a bad reputation. If someone were to come from out of town and the first thing they seen on the shelves of a library was a book with a naked body or drugs, they would immediately be taken back. Offensive types of books can include books you wouldn't want a first grader to see and also books about racial or religion. Certain people would take offense to a book that was against what they believed in. This could result in a huge confrontation.  Lastly, offensive books can include books about someone's opinion on a certain topic. If someone against the writer's opinion started to read the book, they would automatically be offended by what the writer was saying. There is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something.  To conclude, although some books are offensive to some people and not to others, we have to be aware of what could cause problems to certain people. I believe any book open about opinion, and books that would be 'x-rated' should not be kept in a public library. We could easily solve this problem by making a separate place to hold these books so people will not take offense to it.
1430	4407	2	3	Taking books, music, movies, and magazines that are considered offensive off the shelves is a controversial topic with varying opinions. Some argue that it is necessary to protect children and young teens from harmful content, while others believe in the freedom of expression and access to information. However, considering the impressionable nature of young minds, it may be best to restrict access to such materials for individuals under a certain age, such as @NUM1. By doing so, we can help ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content that could negatively influence their behavior and mindset. Ultimately, the decision to remove offensive materials from shelves can help create a safer and more responsible environment for young individuals to grow and develop.
1431	4408	2	3	Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc. be removed from libraries if they are found offensive? My opinion on this is no. In this essay I will explain my opinion and hopefully change other peoples opinions. I will also explain how the past has an effect on present day.  In some cases books, music, movies, magazines, etc. may offend any race or a certain sex, but that is what happened in the history of the world. Some may be very offensive but it only shows a past, others may just be plain out racist or sexist. Those that show the world's history are an education source so we can learn from mistakes. Here is exactly why I state this opinion, taking this material off shelves is like taking someone's freedom of speech away. I hate when I hear music that disrespects women but I'm not going to try and get it taken away because it might just be expressing how the artist of the song loved someone or how history for their family may have been.  In conclusion, I believe this material should not be taken off the shelves. After explaining my opinion think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory. If a past was offensive something today might be offensive, as I was told earlier in my life treat others as you want to be treated. I hope I caught attention and changed some opinions because a lot of offense today has resulted from the past.
1432	4409	2	3	Censorship in libraries? A yes or a No? I believe that there should not be censorship in libraries. There are not many things 'offensive' or 'harmful' in most libraries in @LOCATION1. I dont see who would come up with such an abserd idea. To me there are just way to many ways for people to get offended. @MONTH1 I remind you that we almost changed our plege to the flag of our country by getting rid of the word 'god' all because some people dont believe in god. Now we are suppose to get rid of good books just because they are child friendly?! Think about all the amazing books, movies and magazines that would have to be removed from our libraries just because one person says, 'I find this book offensive' or says, 'I dont think this book is apporaite for my child.' @CAPS1 about the people that do like that book and now wont be able to read it anymore all beacuse of that one person? There are sections in libraries for a reason! Just put the naughty books in the eight-teen year or older section so younger kids dont see them. The people who want to get rid of so called dangerous books to childern make libraries sound like there porngrapic shops. Most libraries are not filled with horrible bad books that will cause there child to be mentaly scared forever. Hell there are really that mant books out there anyways. Now sometimes a bad book @MONTH1 end up in the kids section but that dose not mean we have to remove that book forever form all the other people who want to read that book. All librarie workers just have to make sure to put all books in there rightfull spots and nothing bad will happen. The bad books will be in the adult section and the child frendily books will be in another. Have some libabrie workers watching the area and make aure little kids dont go in the libabrie. This will prevent childern from seeing the bad books because they will be in the adult section. In conclusion I answer this question by saying no. There are just way to many good books that would have to be gone forever.
1433	4410	2	3	I believe that all literature of any kind is useful even though it could be offensive. If society plans on taking something off the shelf because it offends a race or gender, then many life-lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be removed from the shelves. Things such as books or movies are there to take people to different worlds, to help them learn knowledge, to teach them lessons that the real world may not teach them. If materials are taken off the shelf in fear of offending someone, then not very many things will be left just like Katherine Paterson says in her quote. If certain literature were not around anymore then it definitely would not be the same as it is now. Literature is there for us, they teach us, and if one was taken away, it would start a riot.  Books are always there for us, when we are bored, lonely, or just want to escape reality. Imagine if you were not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society. If all books had to be appropriate for every age, it would take all the interesting out of everything. Whether it is a novel or a regular encyclopedia, all books would be dulled down to exceed the needs of our 'non-offending' society. Lots of music would lose its luster and magazines would not be able to gossip about the 'hottest new things.' Movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart.  Books, documentaries, magazines, are there to help people learn, either if it's a lesson about what not to do while you're young, such as smoking, if books about smoking were taken away because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke then how would any of the teens today know not to start smoking? Novels are usually fiction, but the characters come to life to readers. They have problems just like people of the real world even though they may not be real themselves, so if one reads that book, the way that character handles the situation could help a real-life person decide on what they should do about their problem. Important history books or movies could be taken away because it 'offends' certain people to have students learn about slaves.  If one is taken from the shelf because of offending someone then more and more materials would be taken away from society. What good does that do anyone? It leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about. It would disrupt the order in libraries if books were being removed because of appropriateness. If books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now. No good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries.  Books, movies, magazines, music, it is all too important to society, it keeps us company, it teaches us, it makes life easier at times when the world wants to kick you while you are down. If one person decided that a book was not appropriate then they can choose not to read it, but they should not decide to help remove that book from the shelves of libraries. They would start a landslide of trouble that would affect everyone in the community and maybe even across the globe. Information of any kind is a good thing no matter the content of it. So removing any sort of material from our libraries is a horrible idea.
1434	4411	2	3	The content in today's materials is not always suitable for young children. Information distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be surrounded by, including video games. By growing up in a violent environment, children observe and have a greater chance of becoming violent. The continuation of censorship in today's materials is a necessity for the well-being of children in today's society.  In video games, there are ratings that help explain what is suitable for each age throughout childhood and adolescence. Movies also have similar ratings, making it harder for younger children to see certain movies. Books and magazines are not as well protected, although they should be. Age and maturity play a huge role in determining whether a child should be allowed to read and be introduced to specific material. Violence is a major trend in video games today, and the influence it has on children can be unnecessary and eventually detrimental to their well-being.  The reason ratings should be enforced is that children absorb their environment and can become what they see. If they are introduced to violent behavior, they have a greater chance of becoming violent themselves. Libraries have sections for every age group and specific genres of books, fiction, and non-fiction. However, some explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before being distributed on shelves and made available to young teenagers and children. As part of the community, libraries should take part in safeguarding the well-being of children and not expose them to inappropriate information prematurely.  In my own experience, I have witnessed children growing up too quickly when exposed to certain knowledge. Today's music, for example, often contains explicit content. While radios do a good job of editing songs and placing parental advisory warnings on CDs, this does not prevent children from accessing the material. Video games like Call of Duty, Fortnite, etc., are normalizing behaviors that are not safe or conducive for children.  By censoring certain materials, we can prevent the perpetuation of negative behavior among today's youth, ultimately contributing to a safer and healthier society for children to grow up in.
1435	4412	2	3	I do not believe that libraries carry the responsibility to censor reading materials. When a person enters a library, they immediately must infer that, because libraries are a place in which knowledge is accumulated, some of that information they find may not coincide with what they believe. If a person believes a book is offensive, they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up.  Obviously, however, there are certain exceptions. Children's sections should be limited to those intended for younger readers. Putting mature content into a children's section hardly seems logical, just as much as putting children's books into the adult section.  In addition, author @PERSON1 once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well. Thus, leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read, the knowledge contained within them unknown.  There are, as with any ordinance, exceptions. For example, if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should hardly be considered a crime. The exclusion of inappropriate items, such as promiscuous reading material, keeps children from formulating ideas about concepts they may not be able to fully understand.  With all these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action. A library should be a place of enlightenment where opposing ideas are presented, leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe. Because books are like atoms. When two opposing types collide, a burst of energy is released.
1436	4413	2	3	A library is a place where people of all ages can access a wide range of materials for learning and entertainment. While libraries are essential for promoting reading skills and knowledge, it is important to consider the appropriateness of the materials available. Offensive content, such as explicit movies or books, should not be accessible to all library visitors, especially children. Parents should feel confident that their children can explore the library without encountering inappropriate content. However, materials related to religion or culture should not be censored, as they serve as valuable resources for education and understanding. Ultimately, libraries should be a safe and welcoming environment for everyone to enjoy and learn from.
1437	4414	2	3	"The subject of censorship in libraries has been brought upon many times. Censorship is a rule prohibiting the view of a book, music, movies, magazines, etc. This censorship is because of its rating or the content in it is inappropriate for some viewers/readers. Of course, many people have their own opinions about this censorship in libraries, as do I.   I believe that censorship is a good idea in some cases. These cases being music, or movies. However, I don't believe censorship is a good idea in books. Children all over the world read books and as time goes on, our children are becoming more and more advanced and read on higher levels. This is where censorship comes into play. Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adultery. I disagree with the censorship of these books because this is basically telling our children that they can't challenge themselves or they can't learn about certain things because of their age.   These books, in my opinion, can only help them. These books will help them learn about society, what's wrong and what's right, and will help them grow as they get older. The higher reading level books help them understand words better, and also help them learn about literature and past times.   When I was in middle school, I was not an advanced reader by any means, but I did like to read occasionally. One day, I went to the library in search of a challenging book. The book I found was a book called ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee. This book was a fictional story taking place during the Great Depression. As I put in my pin number to check out the book at the front desk, the librarian informed me that I couldn't check out the book because it was a young adult book, meaning 'too advanced' for me. She said I needed parent consent before I was able to check it out.  That night, I asked my parents about it and asked if I could read it. They said yes, mostly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read a book so challenging. The next day I got a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book. I was so thrilled when I was finally able to check out the book and read it.  From my experience with the library censorship, I think that the best route to take is that if there is a parent/guardian who is over 18, and they approve of the checking out of the book/magazine or whatever it may be, then the child or student is allowed to check out said book/magazine etc.  In conclusion, the censorship of books, magazines, etc. is an overall mediocre idea, with some exceptions. The rule of parent/guardian consent is the best route to take in my opinion. Of course, this subject will be argued for many years to come and many people will have their own opinions. Each side of the argument has valid points, but I think that it is imperative that we keep censorship out of books and keep our children learning and reading at their highest ability, no matter what the reading level is."
1438	4415	2	3	Should certain materials in libraries be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think books or any other materials should be taken off the shelves for some people? There are many reasons that the books should stay on the shelves. I am going to tell you all of the reasons I think the books should stay on the shelves.   One reason I think the books should stay on the shelves is because some people might need the books for a school project. For example, a student could have a project over @CAPS1. A book on @CAPS1 could offend many people. Just because it offends some people does not mean it should be taken off the shelf because other people might need that book. Someone might need a certain book for a project. If the one book they need is taken off a shelf because it offended someone they could fail a class. That is one reason I think the books should stay on the shelves.   Another reason I think they should stay on the shelves it's their opinion if the book offends them. Just because they don't like the book and it offends them doesn't mean other people do not want to read it. Why would you take a book off of a shelf because it offends one or a couple people? There could be many more people who want to check out that book and read it.   If a book offends you just dont look at it. Why would you look at something that offends you? I don't understand why libraries would have to removed a book from the shelf just because it offends someone. Especially, when that person could just ignore the book and pay no attention to it. That is my last reason my opinion is what it is.   So after reading this I hope you understand why my opinion is what it is. There is no point in taking books off the shelves. People need them for research and projects. It is someones opinion if they do not like what the book is about and if it offends them. For example, if i didn't like something on a menu at a resteraunt they are not going to take it off the menu for me. My last reason the books should stay on the shelves is the people can just ignore the books and not look at them that would be easier than taking books off the shelves.
1439	4416	2	3	Is @CAPS1 Right?   Is @CAPS1 right to have censorship in libraries? This question could be answered in two very different opinions. Some people may want all censorship items out of public areas. On the other hand, there are people that like to read this type of material. This is a very opinionated topic.   In my opinion, libraries are places I go to find a book to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while looking at a magazine. Libraries are public areas and not everyone is going to agree. Everyone has their own favorite book or genre. I believe it is unjust to take away censorship in libraries because this may be one's favorite genre. Why do libraries need to limit their choice while no one else does? For example, many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are too revealing. The stores don't. They do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans. American society is not going to ban capris just because I do not like them. There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions.   A great resolution for this disagreement is categorizing. By putting all of the censored books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, it will decrease arguments on this topic because all of the people that like censorship in libraries will be together in their area. Whereas the people that do not want censorship in libraries do not have to be around it. This is a quick and easy fix.   There is no reason to take away one's favorite genre because someone doesn't like it. If this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing. For instance, I do not like blue Aeropostale shirts. Pink is my favorite. My friend likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts. We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like. This is non-beneficial for either of us because now the one we do not like is gone but so is the one we do like. This is nonsense. There will be nothing left in the store. People in charge can easily sort material at a store or a library to make it fit the community's likings. Getting rid of material is not the answer. Categorizing is the fix that needs to be put into action immediately.   In conclusion, censorship in libraries should not be completely eliminated. Categorizing the material can help accommodate the preferences of all library visitors, allowing everyone to access the content they enjoy without infringing on the rights of others.
1440	4417	2	3	In our society today, there is a significant amount of exposure to materials that many adults did not have access to when they were children. Young children are exposed to drugs, alcohol, sex, and teen pregnancy through various forms of media, which can influence their perception of what is acceptable behavior. Censorship of materials, such as books, movies, and music, is essential to protect children from being exposed to inappropriate content.  One crucial reason for implementing censorship in libraries is the fact that children may not always know what type of book they are picking up. Despite most books being age-appropriate, there is still a risk of children choosing something unsuitable for their age. Censorship in libraries would create a safer environment for children to explore books without parents worrying about the content.  Another reason to support censorship in libraries is the existing practice in video stores, where materials are categorized based on content and age appropriateness. This system ensures that minors cannot access materials intended for adults without parental consent. Implementing a similar system in libraries would allow parents to have control over what their children are exposed to, promoting responsible viewing habits.  Moreover, early exposure to inappropriate materials can have a detrimental impact on children's development. The portrayal of risky behaviors like underage drinking and drug use in media can lead to harmful consequences, such as peer pressure and unsafe decision-making. Censorship in libraries can help limit children's exposure to such negative influences and promote a healthier upbringing.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is crucial to protect children from being exposed to inappropriate content. By implementing measures to regulate access to certain materials, we can create a safer environment for children to explore literature and media. It is essential to prioritize the well-being and development of our youth by ensuring they are not exposed to harmful influences at a young age.
1441	4418	2	3	Library books should not be removed based on individual opinions of offensiveness. The decision to remove a book should be left to the librarian, who is knowledgeable about what is acceptable for the library. While some may find certain books offensive, others may find value in them. It is important to remember that the library is a place for knowledge and entertainment, and differing opinions should be respected. If there are concerns about the content of a book, it is best to have a calm conversation with the librarian rather than demanding its removal. Ultimately, the choice to keep or remove a book should be made by those who are informed and responsible for the library's collection.
1442	4419	2	3	"To whom it may concern,  Censorship is an issue that has plagued our society for centuries. It is not only unnecessary but unconstitutional. As citizens, we have certain rights that are guaranteed by the documents that keep our society out of anarchy. If the right to pick what literature to read, watch, or listen to is taken away, where will that put our country? Censorship should by no means be allowed in our country today.  In the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, we are given certain rights. Some of these rights, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, have already been constricted. We may not have lost these rights, but they have definitely been limited. Why should the government be able to tell us what to read? If censorship is allowed, what is to come is frightening. If our government, which is supposed to be for the people, tells us what we can read and not read, what is going to stop them from telling us what to wear, drink, or even eat?  Censorship in libraries is one of our biggest issues. There are countless examples of why censorship of written literature should not be allowed. For instance, if a college student is writing a research paper about the effects of rape on a child, but the government sees rape as too graphic, what is this student to do? He or she should be given the right to use what materials are necessary to write a fully-informed paper. But by censoring our libraries and taking books out, the government is hindering the education of its country's youth.  Some literary classics are also being speculated against. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been known as a classic since it was written. It is used in classrooms everywhere around the country for education. But recently, the availability of the book has been questioned. Throughout the novel, the n-word is used, but never as an insult. During the time-period of its writing, this word was more common and had a much less severe meaning than it does in modern-day societies. But because time has changed its meaning, it is being removed from libraries and curriculums across the country. This is unlawful censorship. One of the greatest books of our time, a literary classic, is being removed from the lives of our youth because of racy language.  Censorship is not only taking place in written literature. Movies and music are also under the magnifying glass of censorship. Movies are rated for a reason, to give the viewers an age group for which the movie is appropriate. This is helpful to parents to be able to self-censor their children. But it is not up to the government to choose what a specific child is able to view. It is a parent's right to expose or not expose their child to whatever they see fit, not that of our country's lawmakers.  Music is one of the biggest parts of our society today. With the invention of iPods and other devices, music has become much more common and portable. Censorship is becoming more severe with the change of music style. The music styles of modern teenagers greatly differ from that of their grandparents. Almost nothing is seen as unacceptable by many of today's rappers, as displayed in their choice of lyrics. The music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular. With the most common themes of sex, drugs, and money, it may seem offensive to some citizens, but others just shrug it off as a normalcy. So how can someone say, ""No, you cannot listen to that""? This should not be allowed, yet it is.  How can one person or a group of people decide what is acceptable and what is not? They cannot. Censorship is morally wrong, as well as lawfully wrong. Taking the media from its citizens, such as books, movies, and music, is unconstitutional. What would our forefathers think of what censorship has become? Before you pull that unacceptable book off the shelf, remember the rights of our great country's citizens, and the rights of individuals like yourself.  Sincerely, [Your Name]"
1443	4420	2	3	It is a prominent question of debate whether or not certain materials in libraries such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Although there are materials that may be harmful to children, freedom of information is far more important than protection because censorship is unconstitutional, prevents readers from an impartial perspective, and in some cases hides pressing societal issues that are deemed improper by the censors. The United States Constitution states that freedom of speech, religion, and the press shall not be denied or abridged. In more general terms, the Constitution grants freedom of expression. Censorship is effectively unconstitutional as it prevents freedom of expression. Censors often ban particular books because of personal views of alleged 'immorality.' Without a clear and complete access to all information, how can one make any valid conclusion about anything? Many books are banned that address great problems of society. Censorship is a great problem. Although there are many works that are meaninglessly violent, brutal, and cruel, no book or any other material should be censored. In public libraries and schools, censorship is blatantly unconstitutional. Censorship prevents people from seeing the whole perspective, and censorship hinders societal change. Censorship must be denounced as a restriction on our intelligence and liberty.
1444	4421	2	3	Children are our future, and as such, censorship in public libraries is a significant concern. While I believe that most books should be allowed to remain on the shelves, there are certain extreme cases where censorship is necessary. Books that contain extremely racist content, for example, should be kept away from children to prevent them from being influenced negatively. One way to address this issue is by separating adult books from children's books in the library and placing more explicit material out of easy reach for young readers. These measures can help maintain a balance between freedom of expression and protecting children from harmful content. Ultimately, finding a middle ground in censorship is crucial to ensure that public libraries remain accessible and safe spaces for all individuals.
1445	4422	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines are all forms of expression that allow individuals to convey their thoughts and feelings. However, there is a concern that some content may be too graphic or inappropriate for certain audiences, especially children and individuals who are easily influenced by external factors. Therefore, censorship in libraries is deemed necessary to protect the minds of these vulnerable groups.  Children, in particular, are highly impressionable, and the material they are exposed to can greatly impact their behavior and mindset. Books and comic books with excessive violence or inappropriate themes can leave a lasting effect on young readers, shaping their perceptions and attitudes towards the world.  Similarly, music, movies, and magazines also play a significant role in influencing individuals, especially teenagers. Artists like @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1, known for their explicit lyrics about drugs, sex, money, and violence, can easily sway young listeners into emulating their behavior. This highlights the importance of regulating access to such content to prevent negative consequences on the audience.  The movie industry is also guilty of producing films that glamorize harmful behaviors, such as drug use and violence. While these movies may be entertaining for some, they can have a detrimental impact on individuals who are easily swayed by what they see on screen.  In conclusion, while freedom of expression is essential, it is equally important to consider the potential harm that certain content can have on vulnerable individuals. Censorship in libraries serves as a protective measure to safeguard the minds of children and those who are easily influenced by external factors. By carefully monitoring and regulating the material available to the public, we can create a safer and more responsible media environment for all.
1446	4423	2	3	I think that offensive books should be removed from shelves because they can have a negative impact on children who are still developing and learning. Children are like sponges and can easily absorb and remember information, so exposing them to offensive content can be harmful. It is important for children to have access to educational and appropriate books that can help them learn and grow in a positive way. Offensive books may not be suitable for young readers and can potentially teach them the wrong values. Therefore, it is best to prioritize the well-being and education of children by removing offensive books from shelves.
1447	4424	2	3	I think that books and magazines that contain explicit content should be removed from shelves if they are too inappropriate for young children. Material that deals with subjects like sex or violence should not be easily accessible to kids. Only age-appropriate content should be displayed on shelves for everyone to see. If certain materials are deemed too mature, they should be kept out of sight or restricted to adult-only sections. Ultimately, people will make their own choices, but it's important to consider the impact of exposing children to inappropriate content. Have a great day.
1448	4425	2	3	Katherine Paterson made a valid point in stating that some books are too offensive for some people to read, but that does not mean they should not be read. Time and time throughout someone's life we hear things that we do not like nor want to be bothered with, but it is good that we do. Libraries should have the right to open all types of books to their shelves and not have them be censored by the public, this is why.  We, as people of the world, have battled through hard times. War, racism, and extreme poverty or depression are just a few to recall. Having dealt with those issues we always tend to repeat them out of lack of knowledge. Slavery and civil rights movements were some of the world's lowest moments and they were also very gruesome. Recalling those memories is difficult but something that needs to be done; if books were to be censored then many young adults would not be educated and could repeat such horrible actions.  Pertaining to movies, music and magazines the same laws apply. Though not in the same way, many times these publications are written about current news or social aspects of life. Music is a form of expression and everyone has their own taste. Not having the option to choose from a variety of styles is wrong and unfair. Music can not only be an expression of feeling about love or anger but it can also teach life lessons. Some artists like to sing or rap about their life journey. This can educate others into knowing that if you do this then this is the result, good or bad. In a magazine they tend to lean towards more current topics such as politics, jobs, or young adults lifestyles. Movies apply to the same rights and topics. Each one is equally as important and if a group of citizens feel that it is not then who are they to make that call.  What gives a group of people the right to say this is inappropriate and that you should not read it? They do not have it. In the constitution it states that you have freedom of speech and that means you can express it any way you choose. By censoring what people read that is in a way taking away that author's right to speak. Now, that is unfair.  Though Katherine Paterson made a valid point in saying that some books are too offensive to read, she simply is not right. A library is supposed to be a place where people can find a book, music, movie, magazine of any genre and read it. If materials were censored then that is unfair to someone else who does want to read it. The bottom line is that you have free will and you have the power to choose whether or not you want to read something.
1449	4426	2	3	There are things in the world that are not meant for certain people to see. Things like rated R movies, mature books, alcohol, and explicit music are not suitable for children. While people have the right to view whatever they want, there should be age limits in place to restrict access to such content for minors. If a child wants to engage with mature material, it should be the responsibility of the parents to make that decision, not the storekeeper selling the products.  It is reasonable for a storekeeper to deny a child access to inappropriate material. For example, if a child is trying to purchase a movie with violent content, the storekeeper should have the right to refuse the sale. It is difficult for the storekeeper to gauge the maturity level of every child, and it is better to err on the side of caution when it comes to potentially harmful content. By enforcing age limits, we can prevent children from being exposed to content that could have negative effects on their behavior and decision-making.  Age limits are also crucial when it comes to substances like alcohol. Allowing underage individuals to purchase alcohol can lead to dangerous situations like drunk driving. Teenagers may not fully comprehend the consequences of their actions and could put themselves and others at risk. By implementing age restrictions, we can help prevent tragedies and protect young people from making harmful choices.  In conclusion, age limits are necessary for certain things to protect children and society as a whole. By restricting access to mature content and substances like alcohol, we can ensure that young people are shielded from potential harm and can make safer choices as they mature. It is the responsibility of parents and society to regulate what children can access to promote their well-being and safety.
1450	4427	2	3	What do you go to the library for? In earlier times libraries used to be the place where you went to study. They were no computers, and so you had to go look up your work in an educational book at the library. Is that truly what people are doing at the libraries now, or are people there to look at vulgar books, magazines, and movies? A library is meant to be the place where you can go to work in peace and have a helpful resource of educational books. But, now you can go to the library and be tempted to look at books you shouldn't be looking at. Instead you could be on the computer the whole time playing games of some sort. The possibilities are endless. People now could go to the library and check out a magazine, movie, or book on: pornography, drugs, alcohol, or worse. Is that really what you want your kid to accidentally pick up at the library? Personally, I myself witnessed a little kid pick up a porn magazine at the library, and his mom had to grab it very fast before he had the chance to look at the magazine. The library should not be used for this, and the threat of young kids accidentally looking at these materials should not be happening in the library. The music someone could listen is also very bad, and your child could listen to that. Then what if they want to keep listening to it? Yes, the world does have a huge impact on what is put into the library; because, drugs, sex, scandals, and alcohol seem to be what most teenagers are interested in at some point in their young life. But a library is a community building and there is no stopping someone from coming in and easily getting these vulgar things. The thoughts of the youth are completely swayed after they watch, read, or listen to this. And, this needs to be controlled. Women and children can find all of these materials offensive. These materials need to be censored more than what they are right now. Libraries should be a safe place where people can go to study or get a book, and not to be tempted to look at something they should not be looking at. Many people find this offensive. Yes, in the end libraries are a great place, but the people who do not use libraries for the right reasons are why these materials need to be censored at the libraries.
1451	4428	2	3	A library card is a valuable possession for a child, opening up a world of entertainment and knowledge. However, there is a risk of children accessing inappropriate material in libraries. To address this issue, libraries could consider creating a separate section for adult content, implementing a rating system similar to movies, and allowing viewers to leave comments on items. These measures would help protect library users from stumbling upon offensive material and ensure a positive experience for all visitors. Libraries should be a safe and enriching environment for everyone to enjoy without the worry of encountering inappropriate content.
1452	4429	2	3	I believe that it is possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone then it is just a book. A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time. They use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time. Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book to just to put someone down. I tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book.  Music on the other hand could be thought of as different. Many people could take music in the wrong way. A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap. Rappers tend to express themselves throughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language. I personally don't get botherd by the music, because they are usually refering to their own life and how things went with them. Music can also be on the good side too. When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax. Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to.  Then you have magazines. Personally I think they are the worst of all. Magazines tend to go one way or the other. They either put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are positive and say nothing but good about them. One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full story. In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about. Magazines always have a positive, but where there is a positive they have a harsh negative thing to put in with it.  In these regaurds, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library. There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to stick with the positive side. Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it. With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that music. Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy. There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book. In saying this, it can go either way. I don't believe there is anything worng with libraries censorship as long as you can use your own good judgement.
1453	4430	2	3	"Imagine your favorite book, song, and movie. The ones that you love to watch, listen to, or read a million times over. The ones that you keep on checking out from the library again and again because you love it so much. Now imagine it gone from the libraries. What happened to it? You think that it has been checked out, but later you find that it has been removed from the shelves because someone found it offensive. What can you do?  When you go to the library, you usually expect a huge selection of books and other materials to choose from. A library helps many people of all ages be able to choose whatever they are interested in. This is one reason why libraries are so popular among all people. If the libraries were to begin to remove items off of the shelves that they found offensive, many people would not be able to find all the items that they enjoyed anymore. I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Libraries should accommodate as many people as they are able. Removing material from the shelves may make some people happy, but it would also take away items that many people find enjoyable.  Libraries should not remove items from the shelves if they are found offensive. Doing this could result in less material for people of all ages. If you find something to be offensive, all that you have to do is not check the book or other material out. In Katherine Paterson's words, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that if items were to be removed from the shelves, there would be less for others to enjoy.  Taking materials off of the shelves would be unfair to all readers. Everyone has a favorite book or movie that they love to read or watch. If someone were to disagree with this, this would not only disable you from reading or watching what you love, but it also takes away from other readers who didn't have a chance to make their own opinions on the material.  Many people have different ideas on what they feel is offensive. While some may think that some books have subjects too racy for readers, others may not feel that this is the case. Take a popular children's book like ""Charlotte's Web"". To some, this may be one of the best books ever written. If someone disagreed with this and felt that it was too serious or offensive to young readers, many new readers would never know this book. They would have never had the chance to make their own opinions.  I feel that censorship in libraries is an extreme show of personal opinion. It is only natural to disagree with someone. You can always run into people that don't share the same feelings about certain types of music or movies. Eliminating material from the shelves would be unfair to people. If everyone were to take their least favorite book off of the shelves and replace it with one they like better, soon the libraries would be filled with items that would only reach out to a certain audience. Libraries are meant to fulfill everyone's desires and taste.  To conclude, taking items off the shelves because they are offensive to someone would not be fair. In fact, I believe that doing so would create more problems for people. If an item that someone was looking forward to checking out was no longer available due to censorship, many people may even decide that they don't want to go to the library anymore. What is great about the library is that you have a huge selection of items to choose from. If censorship were to take place, the library would no longer be a place to enjoy. Censoring material would be like telling a reader that their opinions were not as important as those of the people who found it offensive. I believe that if you find something so terribly offensive that you don't want it available to check out at the library, first think to yourself what you would do if the library didn't have your favorite things. Because after all, what you think is offensive may be the best thing in the world to someone else."
1454	4431	2	3	Everyone has books that they do not like or do not approve of. My view on censorship in a library is that if you don't like it then don't read it. I think they should have a children's section and an adult section in the library so you won't have to worry about the problem. If a child wants a book from the adult section then he or she would need to have a parent with them. That way the kid wouldn't bring home any books that their parent wouldn't approve of or allow them to read. If you are an adult and you don't like a book then simply just don't read it. Maybe other readers like the book and don't want it taken off the shelf. They wouldn't be able to say that they want it off the shelf because they don't want their children to see it because their children would need their permission to check out the book anyways. I think this way would be much easier for all readers to enjoy the library and they would not have to worry about picking out a book they don't like or their parents would not approve of.
1455	4432	2	3	I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from libraries. Instead, they could be placed in a separate section to prevent easy access for those who may find them inappropriate. Removing these materials could hinder children from learning about the truth and limit their exposure to different perspectives. It is important for individuals to have the freedom to choose what they want to read, listen to, and watch, as long as it does not harm others. By keeping these materials available, individuals can make informed decisions and gain a better understanding of the world around them. It is essential to teach children about responsible consumption and critical thinking, rather than sheltering them from potentially controversial content. Overall, I believe that offensive materials should be retained in libraries to promote intellectual freedom and encourage open-mindedness.
1456	4433	2	3	Being a parent or responsible child means understanding that censorship is not something that can be completely avoided. It is a personal choice whether to engage with certain material or not, and there are ways to keep children away from inappropriate content without completely removing it from public access. Censorship can provide valuable information and expand one's mind, allowing individuals to make their own decisions about what they want to read or watch. It can also serve as an escape for some people and keep them interested in various topics. Ultimately, censorship should be viewed as a way to protect children while still allowing individuals to make their own choices about what they want to consume. It is important to strike a balance between protecting young minds and allowing for freedom of expression.
1457	4434	2	3	I do not believe that these types of books should be taken off of the shelves. Everybody has their likes and dislikes with music, books, movies, magazines, etc. If the reader does not like the book, then the reader will not continue reading the book. If the listener does not enjoy rap music, then they will stop listening and try to find a different kind of music. This topic is about personal opinion and choice. If it was me, then I would say yes to allowing censored materials. I like getting the full effect out of things. I wanna hear the rawness of a song or the anger of a character in a book. I don't want to read and see a bunch of little stars on a censored word. I want to see that word and feel its full effect.  I am actually reading the very controversial book 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. As you may know, the author of this book is named Harper Lee. Another thing you may know is the use of the 'N-word'. This is a very controversial book because Lee doesn't call colored people black or colored, she calls them the 'N-word' throughout most of the book. Most people now think this is very racist. But back in Lee's time it was very commonly said and used in her society. It wasn't racist back in that time, I mean it still was but it wasn't as controversial as it is today. Now critics and some readers don't agree with this term and think the book should not be held in libraries or read at all for that fact. I have to disagree though. I understand why she used the word, it was a common word in her time. If you take that word away from the book, you lose some history of the old south.  People have the freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say, whether that be in written form or verbally said. I honestly say some of these censored words. Most of the time these words are said when I am angry at myself or another person. People can't control what we say, so why should they be able to control what we write or sing? Just a thought. Saying that, on the other hand I can see why people don't want these censored words. Maybe they just don't want their little kid to say a censored word in class to the teacher or to another classmate. That's understandable, but you can't protect your kids from censored words. They are everywhere. From video games, to movies, and even most books now. You cannot control what other people do or say. It is their freedom to do whatever they want.  In conclusion, while some may argue for the removal of censored materials, it is important to consider the historical context and freedom of expression that comes with such works. Censorship can limit the full impact and authenticity of artistic expression, and ultimately, individuals should have the choice to engage with these materials based on their own preferences and beliefs.
1458	4435	2	3	I don't think that censorship in libraries is right, for many reasons. First, all books and content that a public library offers should be open to everyone in the community. Restricting access to certain materials limits the knowledge and information available to individuals seeking to learn and explore different perspectives. Second, what one person may find offensive or inappropriate, another may not, making it unfair to impose personal beliefs on what should be accessible to all. Lastly, authors have the right to express themselves freely in their works without fear of censorship, as it is essential for creativity and diverse storytelling. By allowing censorship in libraries, we risk hindering intellectual freedom and restricting the variety of voices and ideas available to the public. In conclusion, censorship in libraries undermines the principles of open access to information, diversity of thought, and freedom of expression, ultimately limiting the enrichment and growth of individuals and society as a whole.
1459	4436	2	3	No book should be taken off the shelves for any reason. Books are a vital part of daily life for many people, serving educational and entertainment purposes. People have diverse tastes and interests, and everyone should have the freedom to read without concerns about book removal. Books offer valuable insights, stories, and information that authors have worked hard to share with readers. While some books may be offensive to certain individuals, it is essential to respect the author's intent and the readers who appreciate their work. Removing books based on personal offense would limit access to diverse ideas and perspectives. Books play a crucial role in education and personal growth, and their availability should be preserved to enrich society. In conclusion, the importance of books in people's lives underscores the necessity of keeping them on shelves despite any potential disagreements or discomfort they may cause.
1460	4437	2	3	Libraries should censor some of the materials that they have available to the public, especially when it comes to offensive content that could be harmful to children. It is crucial to protect the youth from being exposed to inappropriate materials that could negatively influence them. By moving offensive materials to a designated adult section, libraries can ensure that children do not have access to content that is not suitable for their age group. While there may be instances where access to offensive materials is necessary, such cases can be handled individually. Overall, the priority should be to safeguard children from potentially harmful content and create a safe and appropriate environment for all library users.
1461	4438	2	3	@CAPS1 I believe that books, magazines, and other forms of literature should not be removed from shelves. These literary works play a crucial role in helping people read, concentrate, and learn about the past. Books provide us with valuable information, entertainment, and opportunities for personal growth. Removing them would deprive us of the chance to explore different worlds, perspectives, and ideas. Additionally, magazines offer valuable insights into our society and help us stay informed about current events. Therefore, it is essential to preserve these sources of knowledge and inspiration for future generations. Let us continue to cherish and celebrate the beauty and power of literature.
1462	4439	2	3	Although possibly offending some people, materials that are in libraries that could possibly be considered 'offensive' are actually good to keep around. If people who find the materials in libraries offensive are getting upset over the lack of censorship within the library itself, they should re-think the situation and consider that the 'offensive' materials that are left within libraries could be considered appropriate IF the viewer is ready to experience them. If a person does not want to be exposed to things in libraries that could be considered offensive, then they can altogether avoid these materials. If parents find the materials that are within libraries offensive, they should monitor their children while they are visiting their library. The materials that could be considered offensive may actually be good, educational media that a person could learn from. If censorship within libraries increases, 'then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Censorship in libraries should remain the same as it is now. Some books, movies, and any other number of things that can be found within libraries are being labeled as inappropriate. These materials can be educational, however, and should not be removed from libraries altogether just because some of the materials are found to be too crude, vulgar, or adult-like for younger ages. Parents should monitor their children while in a library as to not let them stumble upon something that they would not want them to see yet. If something is labeled as inappropriate for children to view by parents, then it is the parents responsibility to make sure their child does not stumble upon it. Much of what may be considered as inappropriate and needing censorship in libraries to this day may actually hold some educational value or meaning to it. There are books and movies that are based off of true stories that have taken place that could be announced by parents as 'not appropriate to be viewed by children'. However, this does not mean that libraries should have to remove the material from their shelves just because parents do not think or necessarily agree that it would be appropriate for their child to read or see. It is the parents responsibility to see that their child does not check out what they would consider inappropriate. Much of the things within libraries that might be considered inappropriate for children hold good educational value and should not have to be removed from the shelves of the library simply because parents find it not age appropriate for their children. Censorship in libraries should remain the same as it is now so that those who want to see or read the stories or movies can do so without having to buy them. If parents want to make a big deal out of how libraries hold materials that are not appropriate for their children, they can either altogether not go to a library or they can monitor their children closely if they bring them along on a library visit. I have found that when I visit my library, I look at it as a source of knowledge that has been pooled in one place, written and created by thousands of authors, all of which took time out of their own lives to create it. If we are going to remove these books or movies from libraries, I think it would be taking away the rights that people have to the materials that SHOULD be provided by a library. Censorship in libraries should remain the same as it is today so that people can enjoy all that should be within it, even if some of it is labeled as inappropriate by parents.
1463	4440	2	3	Imagine a world where nearly every other book is banned for some reason or another. That world is not a world I want to live in. I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. For three reasons, really, the first being that people have the right to any information that they desire to have. The second, people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people. The last point I will make is that no information is bad information.     Because we are in @LOCATION1, I asume that we are talking about censorship in @CAPS1 libraries. If that is the case, then I think that it is unconstituitional to ban any book, or censor any material. Censoring books is like putting a blind fold on whoever is reading the material; they don't see it for what it really is, or for what the intended purpose is.     If the prompt does happen to be including foreign countries, then I think humans do not have the right to influence what other people read. This is idealistic, yes, and in a perfect world, all countires would have equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender. I think that people should see everything the way it is. If something is offensive, it's offensive. It's the person's choice whether or not they read or listen.     That leads me to my last point, that no information can be bad information. Whether it is profane, or offensive in any way, there is always some kind of meaning behind it. From rappers like @PERSON2 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, who I've found all of their songs have meaning, whether it's personal, or they are trying to send a message out to the people. There are books like @CAPS4 for @LOCATION2, by @ORGANIZATION1, which has recently been banned by some school libraries because of graphic scenes. The people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes. There is a much deeper message about guilt and grief, and redemption beneath it. Another, more famous book that was banned from school libraries is The @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6, by @PERSON1, which is a coming of age story about a boy.      In conclusion, I don not think it is right to ban books or music from libraries. No one has the right to.There is always meaning within. The way an author writes a story or a piece of music always has meaning; they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason. By banning books, they are taking people's chances to grow and expand.
1464	4441	2	3	Censorship is crucial in libraries to ensure that offensive material is not easily accessible to the public. While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, it is important to consider the diverse perspectives and sensitivities of individuals in society. If someone finds a certain book or movie offensive, they should address their concerns with the appropriate authorities rather than unilaterally demanding its removal. It is essential to respect freedom of speech while also taking into account the need to protect certain groups, especially children, from inappropriate content. Creating designated sections for adult material can help address these concerns and ensure that libraries remain welcoming and inclusive spaces for all individuals. Ultimately, the goal of censorship in libraries should be to strike a balance between freedom of expression and the need to maintain a respectful and safe environment for everyone.
1465	4442	2	3	"A few months ago, I was at the local library searching for the perfect book. After an hour of searching, I decided on one. I was happy with my choice as I checked it out. However, as I anxiously started reading my book, I found language, drug abuse, and sexual content. As a teenager, I do not want or need to be exposed to any inappropriate material. No one should be exposed to that, and because of that experience, I believe that censorship in libraries is a must.  Due to sexual content, drug abuse, and vulgar language, one must be seventeen to purchase a ticket for a rated-R movie. I believe that since that is true for movies, it should also be true for books, magazines, and music. Inappropriate literature is not necessary for any age. The world exposes certain literature to children, and then is shocked when they see children in jails, gangs, and other horrible situations.  The world has set their standards too low, and the children of today's society are following after our footsteps. Author Katherine Paterson once said, ""...if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right so does everyone else."" This quote shows the impact that people have on generations to come.  Everyone has their own opinion, and this is mine. As a daily newspaper reader, I could not quiet my voice any longer. I had to step up and say something. I am part of a generation that is being affected greatly by the world in a negative way. The first step to changing that is to set the standards high. Protect the future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to. Situations will become better when libraries choose to censor and remove offensive materials from shelves. If libraries censor materials, then next time I want to find the perfect book, I will."
1466	4443	2	3	Every individual has their own opinion on censorship. Some people believe that, in some instances, it is perfectly fine, but others disagree. I'm one person that thinks that, in some instances, things should be censored.  Schools have the right to censor what is put in their libraries for their students to read, especially magazines. Some of the magazines out there have articles in them that aren't appropriate for school hours or even in the school building. Schools may not want something inappropriate on their shelves where students can see it. Censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools. Younger students' libraries should be monitored even more carefully. Younger kids, such as elementary age, don't really know what they should and shouldn't read.  In public libraries, things are a little different. Parents can usually monitor what their kids check out. Most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out. If the summary is too vague, then they know to read a few pages inside the book.  A couple of times, I've gone to the public library and I checked out a book that I thought was a suspense. When I got home and began reading it, it turned out I was wrong. The book was a romance book that I didn't care to read. So, I returned the book to the library. Most of the time you can read the synopsis on the back of the book, but that doesn't always reveal too much about the book. So, the best thing you can do is read a couple of pages out of the book before you check it out.  Everyone has a right to their own opinion on censorship. I believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored. In other instances, things should be left up to the adults and the parents to decide what they want to be allowed to be checked out.
1467	4444	2	3	If one person has a right to something, it would only be fair for others to have the same right. Just like how it wouldn't be fair to give some kids cookies and not others, everyone should have equal rights. If one person wants a book, and another person wants the same book, they should both have the right to it. It's important to treat everyone equally and give them the same opportunities. In situations like fights where some are involved and others are not, those who are actively participating should face consequences, while bystanders should not be unfairly punished. It's important to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and given the same rights and opportunities as others.
1468	4445	2	3	When I heard about the problems some libraries were having with censoring materials, I couldn't help but think about the importance of protecting children from inappropriate content. I believe that libraries should implement age-appropriate sections and guidelines to ensure that children are safe and exposed to suitable material. By creating designated areas for different age groups and enforcing strict rules, we can help parents feel more secure about their children's visits to the library. It is crucial to provide a safe and educational environment for children to learn and grow without being exposed to harmful content. Let's work together to create a positive and enriching experience for our children in libraries.
1469	4446	2	3	No, I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries. Even if some content may be perceived as offensive to some individuals, such as war movies, they still serve a purpose in telling the stories of those who have fought and sacrificed. Every book in a library holds value for someone, whether it be for research, education, or personal interest.  However, I do believe that certain types of music, like rap, should not be allowed in libraries as they can promote negative behaviors and attitudes. Magazines on topics like racing, sports, or military can be beneficial, but those with harmful or inappropriate content should be kept out to protect the minds of library visitors.  In conclusion, while some materials may be controversial or challenging, it is important to preserve a wide range of content in libraries to cater to diverse interests and informational needs. It is crucial to strike a balance between freedom of expression and ensuring a safe and enriching environment for all patrons.
1470	4447	2	3	There are all kinds of books, movies, and even magazines out there. Most libraries have a huge selection for all types of readers or people who would like to watch a movie. They could even have stuff that the young minds should not read. Have you ever thought about what would happen if a little kid grabbed onto something that he/she was not supposed to read? When it comes to things like this, there is a huge range of topics. Some of them are not supposed to be looked at until an older age. Thats why I think there should be a certain section where only a certain amount of ages are allowed to go.     When it comes to books, there will always be some books that are not apporbiate for the young mind. They could include multiple things that could scar a kid for life. Some of the things that they might read are probably things that their parents would like to talk to them about later on in the future. Books are great for learning, dont get me wrong, but there are some that are more adult related. Now there are a ton of books that kids can read and parents won't need to worry about them reading.     Another way libraries can help is put the movies in a certain section. The library could make a section called 'family and kids'. This section would hold a perfect spot where parents wouldn't have to worry about their kids getting the wrong ideas from movies. In our library, we have this section. My grandma and I would always go there and find an incredible family movie to watch together. Finding a great family movie to watch is the best feeling ever.     Finally the last way a library could help is by making sure the child is old enough to check out a book or a movie. Clearly a child of @NUM1 shouldn't check out a movie that is rated @CAPS1, thats just wrong. Libraries should make sure the child is at the correct age to check out the movie. Thats why the movie companys rate movies, so they can give people heads up about whats good and bad about the movie. Also the libraries should make sure a kid is checking out the apporbiate type of magazine or book. The people that work there could look through it before and make sure its the right type of book they should read. There are an infinte amount of ways we can protect the minds of young ones.     I dont think libraries should banned books, magazines, movies, or even music. I think they should just make sure the kids are checking out what their allowed to read. Books are a great way to learn things, but they should be learning about the stuff that is sustable for their age. Libraries are there for us to learn and enjoy ourselves. I believe people would get upset if they would banned the stuff they love. They should just keep an eye out of what kids are looking at. Thank you for your time.
1471	4448	2	3	The last thing I would want my children seeing in a library is offensive material. A library is thought of as a learning zone, somewhere for people to learn about new things and expand their knowledge. If there are dirty magazines, movies on sexuality, offensive music, or inappropriate websites available to children, it completely defeats the purpose of having a safe learning environment. My opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes. That means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age-appropriate. Computers are also a great resource but can contain many offensive materials. My standpoint on this issue is that the computers in the library should be monitored. If someone wants to look up inappropriate images and websites, then they should do it on their own time, in the privacy of their own home. It should not be allowed in public where innocent children will be exposed to it. That isn't fair to the kids, and it isn't fair to the parents who have tried to protect them from that kind of suggestive material.  I'm sure that there are many people out there that would disagree with my proposal. However, those may be the type of people who aren't morally structured as I, or those who don't have kids to look out for. Or perhaps they just aren't as concerned about the issue. They will argue that there is really no severe need for the computers to be monitored, or that they have blocked websites. Yes, they may think that there is no real harm. But that may just be because that is the way they were raised, causing them to think in that same respect. With the magazines, some may argue that children will be exposed to suggestive material sometime, so why not now? But if everyone were to start thinking like this all morals would be forgotten.  In some cases, morality might not be the issue at all. In fact, religion might be the most important issue. A lot of people are religious, and their particular religion may be against looking at suggestive and 'unholy' material. Parents will not want to walk into a library with their children and find them staring at images that go against what they believe in. They will think of it as losing their child's innocence. Having these things out in the open and accessible to kids and teenagers could unintentionally send a message to them that indulging in sexual activities is acceptable when according to their religion it is not.  When I was a little girl, I remember going to the library often with my mother to pick out books for school. I distinctly remember seeing naughty magazines laying across a table as I was walking toward the children's section. My mother was appalled that they had those laying out in the open like that, and especially right next to where the children's books were. She complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them. The librarian apologized and agreed that the placement of the magazines was a little out of line. Ever since then, my mom has been a little skeptical and dreads going to that library. I suppose that is why I am so involved in this issue and the reason for this informative article.  I did not write this to place blame on anyone or to judge people for their beliefs. On the contrary, the purpose of my writing this was to inform the general public of these issues and to explain my side of the argument. I don't see the reason for having these materials on hand at a library where almost anyone has access to them. I do not understand the need for them to be obtainable at a library, or if there is a need at all. I'm hoping that by reading this I have opened the eyes of some concerned parents out there, or have at least made them aware of the matter. Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
1472	4449	2	3	How would you feel if someone confiscated a book from you simply because it contained offensive language or disturbing content? While there are certain books that may warrant censorship, banning them would mean excluding many great novels from the past that were considered acceptable in their time. If you feel the need to censor books, do so in your own personal library.  Personally, I am against the censorship of books. If an author chose to write a book a certain way, then it should be preserved in its original form. Censorship only serves to diminish the educational value of books and restrict the learning experience for students. While it may be necessary to censor a school book with explicit content, wholesale censorship of literature can have negative consequences.  There are numerous books that contain offensive language and controversial ideas, but these works were created to enlighten our society. By removing such books, we would be hindering our ability to learn and grow. Reading should be a stimulating and enriching experience, not hindered by unnecessary censorship.  In my own experience, I have read many excellent novels that may have contained some graphic details or offensive language. I do not believe that the presence of explicit content detracts from the overall value of a book. Those who advocate for censorship often do so for personal reasons rather than for the greater good, which is detrimental to both literature and culture.  When the Nazis burned books during World War II, they nearly eradicated an entire culture and body of literature. We must not allow the same fate to befall today's literature. Censoring books in public libraries would be a disservice to our culture and heritage. Libraries are meant to be accessible to all, and censorship should be reserved for individual preferences in personal libraries.  In conclusion, censorship should not be imposed in libraries as it stifles public access to literature. Books should be preserved in their original form, as they are a reflection of our society and history. Let us not be the arbiters of what is deemed appropriate for others to read, and let classic literature remain intact for future generations to appreciate and learn from.
1473	4450	2	3	I do not believe that items should be taken off the shelves just because some people find them inappropriate. Everyone has different tastes and preferences, so what may be offensive to one person might be enjoyable to another. It is important to remember that individuals have the right to choose what they want to watch or read, and it is not fair to impose restrictions based on personal opinions. Instead of removing such items altogether, they could be placed in a separate section to ensure that they are not easily accessible to children. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide what they want to engage with, and judgment should not be passed based on personal preferences. It is essential to respect diversity in tastes and preferences, as everyone is entitled to their own choices without being judged.
1474	4451	2	3	In my opinion, books that seem offensive to someone should be kept on the shelf. Meaning that people should be allowed to check them out in the library and read them even if some people think those books in particular are offensive, or come off as offensive. A person should be able to read an article without feeling like someone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive. Yes, but at the same time it is up to you, the reader, to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable. Do not pick a book to read that discriminates against football players if you are a football player, because most likely it is going to upset you, or make you uncomfortable. Well, say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players, and it does make you feel uncomfortable, do not take the book, and go complain to someone about how the book, or article makes you feel if you picked it out to begin with. If it makes you uncomfortable, put the book, or article down. No one is forcing you to read it or look at it. People should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like, and about anything that interests them. Just because an article, or book is offensive to you, does not mean it is offensive to other people. If we were to take all the books, articles, magazines off the shelves of libraries, there would not be any books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person. Movies are a whole other issue in itself. There are many types of movies, and within those types of movies are types of things people do in the movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc. If you do not cuss and say you go watch 'Scarface' you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word. If you do not like people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you, then you are not going to watch 'The Conjuring.' If people find movies offensive or not to their liking they usually go and try to make a big deal out of it, and sue the people who made the movie. You doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth. The same thing with movies as books, if we were to take all the movies out of movie stores, and just stores in general that were offensive to at least one person in any way, we would not have any movies left to watch because at the end of the day; there are tons of movies that would offend some people, and make them uncomfortable. In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine that is offensive to you, get over it. Keep that book or whatever it is out of your reach and in other people's, because at the end of the day no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they wrote, directed, or sung offends you. In my opinion you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to.
1475	4452	2	3	Should books, music, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? This question sparks a variety of opinions. In my experience, I have come across some questionable content in books, but I believe that others may still find value in them. Personally, I do not think that anything should be removed from shelves. While it is understandable that parents may want to shield their children from certain materials, I believe that it is important to let them know about the realities of the world. By censoring content, are we not essentially lying to our children? I believe that individuals should have the freedom to choose what they read, see, and listen to. We should not shield them from the harsh truths of the world, but instead, educate them about it. In conclusion, I stand by the belief that people should have the freedom to access a wide range of materials without censorship. It is essential to provide individuals, especially children, with the knowledge and understanding needed to navigate the complexities of the world.
1476	4453	2	3	Children should have the freedom to explore the world of literature in libraries without unnecessary restrictions. While it is understandable for parents to want to protect their children, it is important to remember that books and other forms of literature do not corrupt children. Rather, it is the environment and influences around them that play a significant role in their development. Libraries offer a diverse range of materials that can help children learn and grow in various ways. Therefore, it is crucial for parents to support their children's curiosity and encourage them to explore different genres of literature. Ultimately, libraries should not limit the availability of books and other materials that can enrich a child's learning experience.
1477	4454	2	3	Well, people should have the freedom to choose what they want, especially as adults. Children may not always make the best decisions, but it is important to respect individual choices. Taking away things that bring joy or satisfaction to someone wouldn't be fair. Everyone deserves the right to pursue their interests and preferences, as long as it doesn't harm others. Ultimately, respecting personal choices and preferences is essential in promoting individual autonomy and happiness in society.
1478	4455	2	3	Libraries are filled with millions of books that have the power to influence readers of all ages. While some books may contain adult themes or references that some deem inappropriate for certain age groups, it is important to consider the value of diverse perspectives and experiences in literature. Censoring books and restricting access to certain materials may limit the opportunities for readers to explore different ideas and viewpoints.  Books have the ability to inspire, provoke thought, and encourage empathy. They provide readers with a window into different worlds, perspectives, and experiences. By reading about historical events, personal struggles, or complex emotions, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of the world around them and develop their own critical thinking skills.  Young adults, in particular, benefit greatly from exposure to a wide range of literature. Reading allows them to explore their interests, expand their horizons, and develop their own unique voice. By limiting their access to certain books, we may be depriving them of valuable learning opportunities and stunting their intellectual growth.  Everyone, regardless of age or background, should have the freedom to choose what they read. By embracing a diverse range of literary works, we can foster a culture of creativity, curiosity, and open-mindedness. Instead of censoring books, we should encourage readers to engage with challenging material, think critically about what they read, and have open discussions about different perspectives.  In conclusion, censorship of books limits the richness and diversity of literature available to readers. It is important to uphold the freedom of expression and the right to access a wide range of ideas and viewpoints through books. By embracing the power of literature to inspire, educate, and provoke thought, we can create a more vibrant and intellectually stimulating society for all.
1479	4456	2	3	Materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. Instead, libraries should consider placing them in sections designated for specific age groups or in areas where adult content is located. It is important for libraries to cater to a diverse range of interests and preferences, while also ensuring that inappropriate material is not easily accessible to young children. By implementing age restrictions and organizing materials accordingly, libraries can maintain a balance between providing a variety of content and respecting community standards. It is essential to preserve the freedom of choice for library visitors, while also being mindful of potential sensitivities. Ultimately, libraries should strive to offer a welcoming environment where individuals can explore different forms of media without imposing unnecessary restrictions.
1480	4457	2	3	"Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. People should have the choice to read or watch whatever they want to. Just because one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean that another person will also find it offensive. The library should let the community decide what they find offensive or not. Some parents may not want certain materials in the library because their children might come across them. If parents are concerned about what their children see, they should sit down with them and discuss why they should not read or watch that type of material. Parents should be able to help their children understand why they shouldn't engage with certain content instead of blaming the library for having it.  If certain books or movies are considered very offensive by the public, they could be placed in a special area marked with a sign indicating ""@CAPS1 content"" and only accessible to adults. This way, those who wish to access such material can do so, while preventing children from easily encountering it. By implementing age restrictions and segregating offensive material in a separate section of the library, both the freedom to access controversial content and the protection of children can be balanced. This solution addresses concerns regarding offensive material in libraries while still respecting individuals' right to choose their reading material."
1481	4458	2	3	I understand that some parents wouldn't want their kids reading a book about drugs or watching a movie about gangs, but libraries shouldn't have to remove them from their shelves. There is not one movie, book, or magazine where everyone will approve of it. Just because a couple of people find it offensive doesn't mean they should have the power to determine what materials libraries have or don't have on their shelves. One reason why I believe certain items shouldn't be removed from a library just because a couple of people find it offensive is because what Katherine Paterson said in her quote. She is saying if there was a book a couple of parents didn't want their kids to see and they were to complain and have the right to remove it from the libraries shelf. Then sooner or later, more and more parents will be coming in complaining about a different book, movie, or magazine every other day. Soon, there wouldn't be any books, movies, magazines in the library. Another reason why I believe we should have no say in what items libraries hold is this. As you know, there are many different cultural families living in the community. Some people say bibles should be allowed in libraries. Half the population agrees on that statement, the other half thinks that is ridiculous and they're thinking how they would even suggest doing such a thing. How would a library handle this situation? If we gave people the right to decide what was held in libraries, there would be constant conflicts and ultimately, no way to please everyone. My third and final reason why I think the public should have no say in this matter is that if libraries were forced to take items off their shelves just because a couple of people complain about certain books or movies, then why couldn't people do that at restaurants, movie rental businesses, or outlet stores with clothes they don't approve of? If it was to happen to one business, then it should happen to every business. The only person who should have the say in what they have in their store/library is the person who is paying for it – the owner. It's their responsibility to decide what is appropriate for their establishment, and the public should respect those choices. After reading all those opinions of mine, I would hope that you see where I'm coming from and understand that it just wouldn't be humane to censor materials based on the opinions of a few individuals. It's not our place to dictate what should or should not be available in libraries – we must trust in the discretion of the owners and respect their decisions.
1482	4459	2	3	Today, we live in a world where there are many different political, religious, and personal views, and with time, these views are only going to become more varied and widespread. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to cater to every single person's individual takes on the world. When it comes to libraries, it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions.  Let's take @LOCATION1 for example. There are many different races and people with different religions living here. This is a place that has already been through a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and has fought against racism and slavery. Although these are things that our country has overcome, there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems. When there are different opinions, there are always going to be different books out there about the same topic from multiple points of view. As the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs. This is where the offensiveness comes from. We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do.  When I was in eighth grade, I was @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 with some friends. One of them was pulling her eyes back (like someone would do if they were imitating an @CAPS3 person) because they were itchy. A very pregnant @CAPS3 @CAPS5 woman walked in and took offense to my friend's eye movements. She yelled @CAPS6 us and said, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' @CAPS6 first, we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back. This showed us that different people can take offense to different things because of their heritage.  There is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country. We cannot change the views of certain people in order to match those of our own beliefs nor can we change the fact that all the different people are going to voice their opinions and view them as 'right'. However, we can change the way that we view these people. We need to understand that there is no 'right' when you are dealing with multiple opinions. @CAPS6 this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs.  So next time you pick up a book @CAPS6 the library, read the summary and check to see that the author agrees with you before you take the book home or there are going to be disagreements in your views. If you get a book and you don't agree with it or if you are offended by it, there is no one to be mad @CAPS6 but yourself for not checking to see the author's stance on the topic before you started reading it. Remember, understanding and respecting different perspectives is crucial in a world filled with diverse opinions and beliefs.
1483	4460	2	3	I strongly believe that books in libraries are meant to be read and for people to gain knowledge from. While some materials may not be suitable for children, it is the responsibility of parents to monitor what their children are exposed to. Libraries are divided into different sections for a reason, and parents should guide their children to appropriate materials. Censorship in libraries should not involve removing certain materials altogether, but rather restricting access to them for children. Everything in a library, from books to movies, serves an educational purpose and should be available for those interested. Parents should take an active role in monitoring their children's reading choices, rather than expecting libraries to remove materials that they find objectionable. In conclusion, libraries should not remove books, movies, magazines, or music based on individual preferences, but instead, parents should take responsibility for guiding their children's reading choices.
1484	4461	2	3	Offensive books containing content related to drugs, alcohol, or sex can be concerning for parents who do not want their children exposed to such material at a young age. While some adults may find these books informative or useful, they are not suitable for children or young teens. To address this issue, libraries could consider creating a separate section for adult-oriented material, ensuring that children do not have access to offensive content. By implementing measures to restrict access to inappropriate material, libraries can help protect the minds of young readers and provide a safer environment for all patrons.
1485	4462	2	3	I believe censorship is necessary. If all of the kids in the world grew up listening to hardcore gangster rap and watching porn, we would have shiftless and violent leaders tomorrow. It's important that we are held back somewhat by these offensive outlets so that we grow into mentally healthy adults. However, censorship can go too far. When it comes to removing an author's work from a public library altogether, we have crossed the line. With the rights given to us by our founding fathers, our rights given to us at birth, and the duty we have to express our opinion, it is a crime to remove the hard work of authors and artists from the shelves.   Of course, the first point of argument that comes to mind to defend my position is the fact that we are all given a legal right to express ourselves through the First Amendment of our Constitution. The writers of this Constitution were aware that freedom of creativity should not be held back from the people. That law still exists, and has been used many times to defend people arguing to keep their work, their words, and their ideas out in the world. As far as I know, taking any form of media, book, or entertainment away from the general public would be illegal. Still, even with this point made, some may not be convinced that we are allowed to say what we want.  A man by the name of John Lennon comes to my mind when asked about censorship in the media. Lennon was a musician, composer, writer, public speaker, and human rights activist. He spoke out against censorship, saying that it was a way to judge artists on their work when it wasn't even fully listened to. If someone as convincing and passionate as Lennon could feel that way, then everyone should see that the human race is given the right for their creation to be revealed. In some cases, it's necessary and needed for people to show their ideas to the public.  People like Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Gandhi, and the list goes on, were all avid believers in the rights of humans. Imagine if they had just said, 'I don't think people want to hear me so I'll just stop and let someone else take over for a little bit.' Do you think the world would be as amazing and integrated as a place? The point is, we never know how great and life-changing someone's point of view could be. Whether it's leading a civil rights movement, or attempting to bring peace to a world that needs it the most, censorship might be the one thing stopping people from seeing the most influential person they need.  In fact, we are all called to share our ideas. It's our duty to make sure people see the world not only from their view, but from the view of a poor homeless man, a single mother of five, a kid in elementary school, and a rebellious teenager. The world might not be ready for change, but it needs it.  Whose right is it to judge an artist's work? Some call it God, some call it the man, and others call it the government. It's hard getting your work acknowledged by someone, let alone a whole nation. However, that doesn't mean we are to just give up. Censorship in public places is a crime against the law, nature, and our unalienable rights, and it's our job to go out into the world to create a new one.
1486	4463	2	3	Censorship is a dangerous practice that can hinder the knowledge and awareness of a society. By withholding information, whether it be historical events, political corruption, or inappropriate content, individuals are deprived of understanding their past, present, and potential future. This ignorance can leave a society vulnerable and unprepared for what lies ahead.  If crucial information is censored, such as environmental warnings or political scandals, the consequences could be catastrophic. Without access to this knowledge, people may not be able to address pressing issues like climate change or governmental misconduct. In extreme cases, censorship can lead to brainwashing, as seen in dystopian literature where societies are kept in the dark about their own history.  While some information may be sensitive or distressing, it is essential for individuals to have access to a wide range of perspectives and historical events. Censorship in libraries, bookstores, and other media outlets should be prohibited to ensure that people have the opportunity to educate themselves and make informed decisions.  In conclusion, censorship has the potential to limit understanding, manipulate perceptions, and impede progress. It is crucial for a society to have unfettered access to information in order to learn from the past, navigate the present, and shape a more informed future.
1487	4464	2	3	Dear Katherine Paterson,  I believe that it is essential to uphold the principles of equality and freedom in our society. While there may be concerns about certain content in newspapers, magazines, or movies, I think that censorship is not the answer. Instead, implementing age restrictions and requiring identification for certain purchases can be a more effective solution.  By using ID verification, we can ensure that age-appropriate content is accessed by the right audience. This way, individuals can still have the freedom to choose what they want to consume, while also protecting young people from potentially harmful material. Therefore, I suggest that newspaper organizations continue their work but with stricter regulations on sales to maintain a balance between freedom of expression and responsible content distribution.  Sincerely, Zack
1488	4465	2	3	This writing is socially unacceptable! There are many books and media sources that include language, sexual tones, and other immoral things and ideas. However, culture does need to be obtained, although immorality on this earth is at an all-time high, we need to stop focusing on books that will always be on the shelves and turn our attention to people's hearts and morally right things.  When a person walks into a library, he or she can expect certain things, for example, the smell of the older books, the noise of a group of kids, and the librarian yelling to keep them quiet. What he or she would not expect is kids doing drugs and watching porn on the computers. This is not a book's fault or 'the evil computers' fault. This is the fault of an immoral world.  I myself have witnessed some evil things kids do in the school system, and it gets worse every day. There is good, but it certainly is not because they themselves are caring and loving about what they do on this planet. I can quote from many in my grade class that have told me 'The only thing that is wrong is telling someone they are'. This thought process is immoral. But who is going to tell them that, and what is the answer.  Jesus is the answer. In the Bible, it says, Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. This is the truth. In the book of Romans, it says, God gave many people over to their sinful passions. God is the only good, and the only light comes from Him. The only man to live a perfect life was Jesus, and He was God in a human body. We as a planet need to turn to God, the only good thing, and try to be like Him because this world needs Him.  Only God can change a heart. We need to focus on Him, and once we do that, the way we think, write, and act will change, and we will not need to discuss this problem any longer.
1489	4466	2	3	"I think that only if there is real offensive material should it be censored. It is wrong to make fun of or joke about people, especially when it comes to mocking disabilities. For example, the movie ""The Ringer"" portrays a man pretending to have a disability to compete in the Special Olympics and win money, which is highly inappropriate and offensive. It is important to consider the impact of such content and ensure that it is not promoted or normalized. Ultimately, decisions about what should be censored should be based on the level of offensiveness and harm that it may cause."
1490	4467	2	3	I believe that any kind of material, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be censored except for mature content like pornography, violent and horrid movies, and video games. However, age-appropriate restrictions should be in place to ensure that individuals are exposed to content suitable for their level of maturity. Maturity levels vary among different age groups, with some individuals developing maturity at a faster rate than others. It is essential for individuals to behave in a civilized manner and not engage in inappropriate behavior. Implementing age grouping systems for books and keeping adult content out of reach of children can help prevent them from encountering unsuitable material. Additionally, using safety locks on devices can further restrict access to mature content. By taking these precautions, we can help protect individuals, especially children, from being exposed to inappropriate or vulgar material.
1491	4468	2	3	"Everyone has an opinion. That's what makes us unique and diverse. Some prefer certain forms of entertainment over others, just like some people may find certain materials offensive in a library. However, removing such materials would limit the variety and richness that libraries offer to the community. As Katherine Paterson wisely said, ""And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us."" If we start censoring based on personal preferences, we risk losing valuable resources that cater to different interests and perspectives. Libraries should remain inclusive spaces where individuals can explore a wide range of materials, even if they don't align with everyone's beliefs. Let's embrace the diversity of opinions and preferences that make libraries such vibrant places for learning and discovery."
1492	4469	2	3	Books in libraries should be available to everyone, and it should not be the job of any individual or group to decide what is appropriate or not. Parents and adults should focus on teaching children morals and values so that they can make informed decisions on their own. Censoring books in libraries could lead to a slippery slope of censorship in other areas, such as the internet, ultimately restricting freedom of speech. Offensive books can still provide valuable information and lessons, and individuals should have the right to choose what they read. Ultimately, people are responsible for their own choices, and it is not up to others to dictate what they can or cannot access.
1493	4470	2	3	Yes, I do believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the bookshelf. One reason for this is that it could lead to others using the offensive material against the individual in a hurtful manner. Additionally, constantly being exposed to something that offends you can be emotionally taxing and create a negative environment. On the other hand, music may not have the same impact as books since it is something you hear rather than read. Overall, it is important to address offensive material to create a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone.
1494	4471	2	3	Books are pieces of art, and authors are artists who use writing as a form of expression. In a society that values freedom of expression, it is important not to deny anyone that right. Removing books or any form of art from library shelves is not the solution, even if some may find certain content offensive. While parents may want to protect their children and keep them innocent, it is essential for children to grow up, explore, and learn about the world around them.  As the musician @PERSON2 once said, shielding children's eyes from the world may seem like a protective measure, but it also deprives them of the beauty and complexity that life has to offer. Deciding what is offensive is subjective, and everyone has different opinions. Censoring too much content would lead to a lack of diversity and creativity in the arts.  People have the right to express themselves through books, music, and other forms of art, and censorship takes away from the original intent of the creators. While individuals have the choice to avoid certain content, they should not impose their views on others. Art may evoke strong emotions, but ultimately, people are responsible for their own actions.  In conclusion, while there may be age restrictions or designated sections for more mature content, it is important to preserve the diversity of artistic expression. Limiting access to books or other forms of art based on personal preferences deprives individuals of the opportunity to explore new ideas and perspectives. Let each person choose what they consume, and do not take away the chance for someone else to discover something meaningful or transformative.
1495	4472	2	3	Books are part of history and should not be censored, as they provide valuable insights into the past. They serve as educational tools and offer lessons that can be learned from. While some books may contain content that is not suitable for younger audiences, it is important for individuals to be exposed to different perspectives and ideas. Teachers play a crucial role in selecting appropriate reading material for their students, ensuring that the content aligns with the educational goals of the classroom. Censoring books would limit access to important information and stifle intellectual freedom. It is essential for individuals to be able to make their own choices regarding what they read and to be responsible for their own consumption of media. Overall, censorship of books would be detrimental to the learning process and hinder the exploration of diverse viewpoints.
1496	4473	2	3	Removing books off of shelves in our public library? To me, that sounds crazy. I can see how some people might be offended by some books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but some people appreciate it. It's diversity, some people love the down-to-earth literature, but some people can't handle it. Why take away something that only a few people disagree with?   I believe some of the best entertainment in libraries are the most offensive, but it is all fact. I mean, if this is such a problem there should be a certain section to find those things in. If people want to complain then they can get out of that section, because people like me will be in that section ready to learn about all these different varieties of entertainment. Whether if it's offensive or not. People may find some of it offensive, but I believe it makes that person stronger. It helps them realize how lucky they are that they're not being treated a certain way in the offensive book they're reading. It's just a piece of entertainment! If it offends you and you're not entertained, go find something that does!   Even though I hear of people reading offensive books I've never really seen one myself. I think some people just get offended too easily. That's where we should reason with them instead of giving into their demands. So what if they aren't taken off the shelves? Like I said, we can make a certain section for them type of things. If they aren't happy with the outcome, they will get over it.   Now that you read what I had to say, what do you think? Do you think we should remove certain entertainment off of library book shelves? Or should we just reason with the people who are offended? I hope what you read today helps keep books on the shelves and readers happy!
1497	4474	2	3	Should we have censorship in our libraries? This is a question that both sides can argue with credible facts. However, censorship is mostly defined as not allowing certain items or things to be seen or heard until a mature age. How can you tell when someone is of a mature age? Maturity lies behind one's ability to cope with various thoughts, ideas, actions, etc. Censorship should be allowed to an extent.  Censorship plays a big role in society today, shaping the content on television and in other media. While censorship has evolved over the years, it is still important to consider the impact of certain content on different age groups. Books should generally be accessible to children and adults of all ages, as literature can provide valuable knowledge and insights. Books can help expand the mind and facilitate learning.  When it comes to movies and magazines, some level of censorship may be necessary to protect the innocence of youth. Certain content, such as explicit sexual scenes, may not be suitable for young audiences. However, music should generally remain uncensored, as it is a form of expression that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  Ultimately, censorship should be a personal choice, with adults determining what is appropriate for themselves and their families. While some forms of media may require censorship for certain age groups, it is important to allow individuals the freedom to explore and learn from a wide range of materials. In the end, everyone should have the right to choose what they read, watch, or listen to, as long as it contributes to their growth and understanding. Let's preserve the diversity of content in our libraries and trust individuals to make informed decisions about what they consume.
1498	4475	2	3	I don't believe that books, movies, and music should be removed because people should have the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, and listen to. It is not up to others to dictate what content is acceptable for individuals to consume. People have the right to make their own decisions about what they find interesting or entertaining.  Individuals will naturally gravitate towards material that resonates with them, and they will determine what they want to expose themselves and their children to. It is not the responsibility of others to censor or restrict access to certain content based on personal preferences or beliefs. People are capable of making informed choices about what aligns with their values and interests.  In conclusion, people should be able to decide for themselves what they want to engage with in terms of books, movies, and music. It is a personal decision that should not be influenced or controlled by external factors. Everyone has the right to choose what they want to read, watch, and listen to without interference from others.
1499	4476	2	3	I feel that individuals should have the right to access a variety of materials from the library for personal information or research purposes. However, it is important to handle such materials maturely and ensure that inappropriate content is kept separate from general access to protect children and individuals who do not require such information. Creating designated areas or rooms for explicit content, with restricted access based on age and valid reasons for requesting such materials, can help prevent censorship while also safeguarding against unsuitable exposure. Ultimately, while freedom to access information is crucial, implementing certain guidelines and safeguards can ensure that the library remains a resourceful and responsible institution for all individuals.
1500	4477	2	3	How would you feel if someone told you that you couldn't have certain food in your fridge that sence its bad for your health or they might think it taste bad. You would not be too happy about it. Well its the same thing when people want to censor the libraries.  When people try to censor the libraries they try to take out books that are 'offensive'. If someone that likes those kind of books and they are being taken off. Its unfair for that person because they are being limited on what they can get from the libaries. Libaries are soppose to be a place where you can get books or magazines that you like to enjoy but they cant do that because people are trying to cencor the books.  The people that want to cencor certain books say that they might offensive not only to them but they could also for the kids. Well I say to that, you don't have to bring your kids to that section. You don't have to read those books you can just leave them alone for the people that like reading them.  To the people that want to cencor certain books what makes a book offencsive? Whos to say if that is offensive or not? The two views are differnt just because one person thinks its offensive doesnt mean another person thinks the same.  My opinion is leave the books there and let people enjoy the books they like to read. No book is bad every book does good for you because it builds your education, it could also be a stress reliever, and something you like to do on your free time. The people that are getting cheated out on the books they like because they are being cencored. What if the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series got cencored because of the magic.To some people that might be an offensive book and if that book was taken off the shelve we would lose one of the greatest books and @CAPS3 of people would be upset.  So the way I see it everyone should be entitled on what books they can choose. To the people that don't like certain books just leave them there you don't like to read them thats fine. Everyone is entitled to there rights like Katherine Paterson said 'You have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for an of us' So we should all get to read what we enjoy to read, cause reading is endless.
1501	4478	2	3	Books should only be removed if they are found to be offensive to a certain degree. While some books may be meant for educational purposes and not intended to offend anyone, there are others that promote harmful ideas and stereotypes. It is important to strike a balance between allowing freedom of expression and protecting individuals from harmful content. Education is a key aspect of books, and many stories serve to inform and educate readers about important historical events and social issues. While censorship may be necessary in some cases to prevent the spread of harmful ideas, it is also important to consider the value that books can provide in educating and enlightening readers. Ultimately, the decision to remove books should be made carefully, considering the impact on society as a whole.
1502	4479	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' wrote by Katherine Paterson. If you think about it when you go into a library there is a ton of books to choose from. But how many do you think is appropriate for every age and including children, not very many. That is why they have sections for the books, but there are times people are rude and mix them up on purpose.          How many times have you been in a library and find a misplaced book? Many of times right, that can be accidental or on purpose. I know if I took my child or children to a library and they got a book that was inappropriate for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book. Now if it was a book that has been misplaced I would take it from them. But, yes there are some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the library.      I remember from when I was a little girl going into the library to check out books with my mom or my dad, it did not matter they both enjoyed taking me to the library. They were pleased that I loved to read but, one day my mom took me to get books from the library, she did not think about looking at the books I got until we got home and she realized on of my books had a cursing word in it. She was not happy at all, I had no clue what she was doing. But I figured it out, she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car. She fastened me in and off we went, back to the library. She had no problem going off and complaining, I can remember her every word she said it sounded like this. '@CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION2 and this is my daughter @PERSON2 she is six years old. We were just her about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we are back. Well if you can give me a funny reason for why my six year old daughter has a child's book from here with cursing in it. Please speak up and explain I would love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there. But the book is no longer in the @LOCATION1 library, I can not remember the title of this book, I just know that with a mom like mine she can get something done.   Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I can tell you from experience and observation, you can do and get whatever you want with a little power and persuasion. It @MONTH1 cause trouble but just set your mind to it and you can help and solve problems when you do set your mind to it.
1503	4480	2	3	When you have children would you want to shield them from something you think is wrong, even though it goes on in the world around you every single day? Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship.   One thing about censorship is that it is just a way the government can control what everyday people say, hear, listen to, read, or even see in today's society. We shouldn't be controlled on what we can or can't read, watch, or listen to. I have experienced these things almost on a daily basis if it isn't on the radio it's on television. When someones words get beeped out for saying something vulgar or innapropriate.  The second thing about censorship is that no matter what it is, where it is, or even who it is someone will always have a problem with it. Just recently in one of my own classes we read an article about a very popular chldren's and young adult's film and a school tried to ban its books from its library because it dealt with sorcery. Most of every person I know that has read those books knows that sorcery isn't real. Why do people find it necessary to do things like that? I think most people just view something that could be entertaining to one person as completely disgusting and disturbing, just because it is a little bit different, I find that as unique not bad.  The third thing is no matter what public libraries shouldn't be censored. Everyone views things differently and they all have different tastes in music, literature, and films. Just because someone likes something someone else @MONTH1 find vulgar doesn't mean they should just be able to remove that from the library's public shelves. After all the library is public and I put a great deal of stress on it being public because every person in the world today are all different.  Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship. Leaving off on a lighter foot, whether it is purple or green, or old or new, someone will always be able to find something wrong with it. I'm sorry to today's society for not being able to realize that most of its problem is trying to control everything that everyone does.
1504	4481	2	3	Libraries should not have the right to decide what is offensive and what is not. Censorship should not be in the hands of the library, but rather in the hands of the people who rent or buy the items. The @CAPS1 may have their own views on what is offensive, but they should not be the ones making that decision. It is important for libraries to prioritize customer satisfaction if they want to maintain business.   People have varying opinions on what is considered offensive, and it is not fair for libraries to impose their own beliefs on the community. Instead of removing potentially offensive items, libraries could consider creating a separate section for such materials. This way, individuals who do not wish to come across offensive content can easily avoid it.  Another solution could be to organize the library's collection into categories such as offensive and non-offensive, allowing individuals to make their own choices. Conducting surveys to gather feedback from the community on what they find offensive could also help libraries make informed decisions on their collection.  Ultimately, censorship by libraries could lead to loss of customers and revenue. It is important for libraries to respect the diverse views of their community and not impose restrictions on what individuals can access. By allowing people to make their own choices and providing options for avoiding offensive content, libraries can better serve their patrons and maintain a positive relationship with the community.
1505	4482	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed if they are offensive to a race or any other beliefs unless they are biographical or historical. If the reading material is offensive to you or your beliefs, it is important to speak to a librarian and voice your concerns so that the material can be removed from the shelves. No one wants to encounter content that goes against their beliefs, which is why it is essential to keep offensive material out of libraries. It is important to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all individuals, and that starts with ensuring that offensive material is not readily available for consumption. By taking action and speaking up against offensive material, we can work towards a more respectful and understanding society.
1506	4483	2	3	Parents play a crucial role in guiding their children on what materials are appropriate for them to consume. While some books and movies may not be suitable for all children, it is important for parents to be proactive in monitoring their children's exposure to potentially harmful content. By setting boundaries and providing guidance, parents can help their children navigate the complexities of the media landscape and make informed choices. It is essential for parents to engage with their children, discuss the content they are exposed to, and teach them how to distinguish between right and wrong. Ultimately, by taking an active role in their children's media consumption, parents can help shape their children's values and ensure that they grow up to be responsible and discerning individuals.
1507	4484	2	3	A library is built for the enjoyment of all people, and just because something may be offensive to one person does not mean it should be removed. People create books, music, and movies to express themselves, and it is not fair to censor their expression just because it may offend someone. It is important to see the positive side of things and recognize that what may be offensive to one person could be meaningful or enjoyable to another. Therefore, I believe that nothing should be removed from libraries simply because it is offensive to some individuals.
1508	4485	2	3	Have you ever picked up a book, video, or music and wondered why it was there, as it may not be suitable for our younger kids to read, watch, or listen to? It is important to consider removing such content from our library shelves to create a safer and healthier community for our children and future generations. Books, videos, and music that promote sexual activity, violence, drug use, and other harmful behaviors can have a negative impact on impressionable minds.  The rise in crime and drug rates in recent years may be attributed to the influence of such media content. When individuals are exposed to material that glorifies criminal behavior, they may be more likely to emulate those actions. As humans, we are influenced by the media we consume, whether consciously or subconsciously. By removing content that promotes negative behaviors, we can help reduce the prevalence of such actions in our society.  Music also plays a significant role in shaping attitudes and behaviors. Songs that contain explicit language or encourage destructive actions can warp perceptions and lead to harmful decisions. As parents, we should be mindful of the messages our children are exposed to through music and other forms of media.  Communities that prioritize values such as abstinence from harmful behaviors tend to have lower rates of drug use, violence, and other negative activities. By following a moral compass and avoiding media that promotes destructive behaviors, we can create a safer and more positive environment for ourselves and future generations.  If we work together to remove harmful media from our libraries and other sources, we can help shape a better future for our children and grandchildren. Let's take a stand against content that glorifies sex, drugs, and violence, and strive to build a community that upholds values of respect, compassion, and integrity. Together, we can create a brighter and more promising world for the generations to come.
1509	4486	2	3	Should materials that some people find offensive be removed from libraries? No, all materials should be kept in libraries to cater to the diverse interests and preferences of the community. Having a wide range of books, magazines, music, and movies allows individuals to explore different genres and topics, enriching their knowledge and understanding. Removing offensive materials may limit access to valuable resources and hinder the opportunity for learning and exploration. It is essential for libraries to remain inclusive and provide a variety of content to engage and educate their patrons. Therefore, it is important to preserve the freedom of choice and uphold the principle of intellectual freedom by keeping all materials available in libraries.
1510	4487	2	3	There are many ways in which people seek help and guidance in life, whether it be through reading books, listening to music, watching movies, or flipping through magazines. Each of these mediums offers a unique perspective and can provide valuable insights into different aspects of life.  Books have the power to transport readers to new worlds and teach valuable lessons. However, it's important to remember that not everything in books is necessarily true, and critical thinking is essential when interpreting the information presented.  Magazines often focus on the lives of celebrities and offer a glimpse into their world. While they can be entertaining, it's crucial not to get too caught up in comparing oneself to the glamorous lives portrayed in these publications.  Music has the ability to evoke powerful emotions and memories. It can inspire, comfort, and uplift, but it can also have a negative impact if the messages in the songs are harmful or promote destructive behavior.  Movies, like books, can tell stories that teach important lessons and provide insight into different cultures and historical events. They can also serve as a source of inspiration and motivation to pursue one's dreams and be true to oneself.  In the end, it is essential to listen to your inner voice and follow your dreams and passions. While external sources of information and entertainment can be valuable, ultimately, it is crucial to trust yourself and stay true to who you are. So, whether it's through books, music, movies, or magazines, remember to take what you need from them and forge your own path in life.
1511	4488	2	3	I think that movies and magazines should be censored for kids at the library. There are several reasons for this censorship. Movies rated R are not suitable for children, as they may contain inappropriate content such as sex scenes that parents may find uncomfortable to explain. Magazines like Cosmopolitan, Maxim, and Playboy offer explicit content on topics like sex and unhealthy diets, which can be harmful for young minds. While some books may contain romance themes, they are generally not as explicit or harmful as certain movies and magazines. Overall, censoring certain content at the library can help protect children from exposure to inappropriate material.
1512	4489	2	3	In libraries, it is important to consider the appropriateness of the materials available to the public, especially when it comes to children. Children are naturally curious and may pick up anything that catches their eye, so it is crucial to ensure that the content they encounter is suitable for their age group. While there may be a variety of books, music, magazines, and movies available, not all of them may be appropriate for young audiences.  It is the responsibility of the library to curate its collection and ensure that offensive or inappropriate materials are not readily accessible to children. This may involve screening materials before they are added to the shelves and being mindful of the content of books, music, magazines, and movies that are made available to the public. Censorship can play a role in maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for library patrons, especially children who may be more susceptible to negative influences.  By implementing censorship measures and carefully selecting materials that are age-appropriate and inoffensive, libraries can help protect children from exposure to harmful content. It is important to consider the impact that books, music, magazines, and movies can have on young minds and take steps to ensure that the materials available in the library are suitable for all audiences. Ultimately, censorship can serve as a tool to promote a positive and enriching experience for library users, especially children who may be more vulnerable to the influence of media.
1513	4490	2	3	Censorship can be considered a significant problem as it infringes on our right to access information freely. It is essential that we have the ability to read, write, and watch what we choose, as long as it does not harm others. Allowing censorship based on individual opinions can lead to a slippery slope of restrictions on knowledge and expression. In a democratic society, it is crucial to uphold the principles of freedom of speech and information, rather than adopting communist ideals of control and limitation. Ultimately, censorship should not be permitted as it goes against the fundamental values of democracy and individual liberties.
1514	4491	2	3	Throughout history, there have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others. Whether in past times when statues were censored by removing offensive elements or when books were burned to preserve certain ideologies, the issue of censorship has been a contentious one. However, in today's world, with the accessibility of information through the internet, the blame for exposure to controversial content cannot solely be placed on libraries.  Modern libraries cater to specific demographics with their collection of movies, music, and books. They have restrictions in place for certain age-appropriate content, such as not allowing young children to check out certain movies or music with explicit lyrics. It would be unfair to force libraries to censor materials that are popular and bring in revenue, just to prevent children from accessing them.  Some argue that books are the most dangerous form of media, as they can influence young minds over the course of many pages. However, the responsibility ultimately lies with parents to instill strong moral beliefs in their children, so they can navigate through different ideas and perspectives without being negatively influenced.  If you find materials at a library offensive or are concerned about your child's exposure to certain content, the solution is simple: do not visit the library or allow your child to go. But for those who appreciate the diversity and freedom of information that libraries provide, it is important to not let censorship infringe on the rights of authors, artists, and individuals to access a wide range of perspectives and ideas. Libraries play a vital role in fostering intellectual growth and should continue to offer a variety of materials for those who seek knowledge and understanding.
1515	4492	2	3	Everywhere we go, censorship seems to be present. Children are exposed to cursing from their parents and are likely to pick up on these behaviors. While it is important for children to understand what cursing is and why it is inappropriate, they should also have the freedom to choose what they read.   Books targeted towards children should be censored to ensure they are age-appropriate. However, adults should have the freedom to read whatever they choose. By censoring books, children may miss out on valuable lessons and information that can only be found in literature.   The idea of rating movies is unnecessary, as parents should have the ability to decide what is appropriate for their children to watch. This gives parents the control over what their children are exposed to, rather than relying on external ratings.   Derogatory images in magazines can have a negative impact on children, leading to feelings of insecurity and low self-esteem. Children are highly impressionable and can internalize these negative messages. Therefore, it is important to consider the impact of such images on young minds.   In conclusion, while some level of censorship may be necessary to protect children, it is important to balance this with the need for freedom of choice and access to information. Parents play a crucial role in guiding their children's exposure to different forms of media and should be actively involved in monitoring what their children are exposed to.
1516	4493	2	3	Taking books off the shelves just because someone finds them offensive is not the solution. People have different opinions and sensitivities, and it's impossible to please everyone. Instead of censoring books, implementing age restrictions could be a more reasonable approach. Just like movies have ratings, books could have age limits to ensure that age-appropriate content is accessible to the right audience. Ultimately, individuals have the choice to avoid material they find offensive, and censorship should not be the default response to complaints. It's important to maintain a diverse range of perspectives and allow for freedom of expression in literature.
1517	4494	2	3	Taking books off the shelves? I don't think so. When you go to the library, what kind of books do you look for? I like mysteries and scary books, they keep me on the edge of my seat, however; some that I have read @MONTH1 not be appropriate for children younger than me. People are saying they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are found offensive, but I think that is a bad idea.  People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice. You can find a lot of younger kids at the library theses days for school purposes. From my own experience, I had to get a movie at the library once for a project. It was about the civil war. The movie had some disturbing scenes in it, but I had to watch it for school. If it had not been at the library, what would I have done? That is one reason why I do not think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea.  As I said at the beginning, I like mystery books. Some mystery books have parts in them that @MONTH1 be offensive. The book I am reading now is about a murder of a young girl. I think this would be an offensive book for someone young, or for someone who's loved one was murdered, but that does not mean I think they should remove it from the library. If they took books like that away, what would the people that like them do? It does not seem fair to me.  For people who find books, movies, music, or magazines at the library offensive, simply do not use them. The library is a place where you can find almost anything you are interested in. So let's keep everyone in mind, and their different interests. It is also a place where you can find a lot of information even though it could be offensive. It would not be fair or right to remove books from the library.
1518	4495	2	3	In my opinion, censorship of any kind shouldn't exist, especially in libraries. Libraries are where anyone can go and check out a book, magazine, or movie. It's where the poor can have access to the same materials the better off have. If you take away opinions in books, music, film or magazine/newspaper articles, then you're taking away the author's right to freedom of speech just because someone deemed it offensive. The right to free speech is an important one in the US, we can have opinions here, we can choose our beliefs, and if someone wants to share their beliefs and opinions by form of writing, then they should be allowed. Writing is a form of expression, writers can express their thoughts, use their imagination to come up with fantasy worlds and unique characters. Who does one think they are to say it's offensive? Who gets to decide that this book of movie is offensive? If we take away books that one person finds 'offensive', we wouldn't have anything to read. Some people find the Bible offensive, but we still put that in libraries, some people find books on wizardry and vampires offensive, yet those are all rage now, we wouldn't take those away. Things that people find offensive are just opinions--just like the ones of those of the writers. It just simply wouldn't work out--if you want young people to read, you have to give them something to read that will stimulate their interests, and sometimes that can be 'offensive.
1519	4496	2	3	There are many different kinds of books in the library, some of which may not be suitable for young children. To ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content, libraries should consider censoring certain materials or placing them in designated adult-only sections. This will allow parents to feel more comfortable bringing their children to the library without worrying about what they may encounter. By segregating materials that are not suitable for children, libraries can create a more family-friendly environment where kids can freely explore and discover new books and movies. This approach can help maintain the integrity of the library as a safe and educational space for individuals of all ages.
1520	4497	2	3	There are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing, or a bad thing. I am against censorship. My reasons are that just because someting is there that you don't like, doesn't mean that you have to look at it or use it. There are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment. Another reason is, that if there's something that someone doesn't  want their child looking at, then they should either trust that their child won't look at it, or prevent them from seeing it. Finally, what would be left if everyone were to remove somthing that they took offense to? Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch.   First, why I think censorship is wrong, is that the people that take offense to what they want removed, don't have to look at whats offensive. No one is forcing them to look at it or use it. They're better off just ignoring it. Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it. The library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material. So if someone were to remove that material, the person that needs or wants it, would not have the access to use it. And they are given the right to use it. Their child might even have the right to it.  Second is that some people wouldn't want their child seeing those things. But removing it shouldn't be that persons first instinct. I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it. And if they can't, then they need to somehow prevent their child from viewing it; not by removing it. The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child, and the whole community.  Lastly, let's say that in a library, theres at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person. If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive. Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library.   Thats what I think about cencorship. It's really just wrong. Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book. And I know other people like to do that too. So why should anyone else be able to take that away from them.
1521	4498	2	3	Have you ever encountered something so disturbing that you questioned how it was even allowed to be published? Nowadays, music, books, and magazines are filled with inappropriate content that children are exposed to, shaping their thoughts and behaviors. These materials can easily be found in libraries, raising concerns about the need for censorship in these resources.  Libraries are often perceived as dull places, but when a student discovers a popular book with controversial themes like drugs, it spreads like wildfire among their peers. This leads to children emulating the negative behaviors depicted in these books, resulting in harmful consequences.  Similarly, modern music contains lyrics glorifying sexual references, drug use, and inappropriate behavior, as artists chase commercial success. Music videos further amplify these messages, portraying a glamorous lifestyle that children aspire to emulate, thus perpetuating harmful behaviors.  Movies have also followed suit, incorporating such themes to cater to audience demand and boost ratings. As a result, these harmful messages have infiltrated various forms of media, influencing children in detrimental ways. It is imperative to enforce censorship in libraries to prevent minors from accessing materials that promote negative behaviors.  In the past, art was revered for its talent and creativity, rather than its ability to entice trouble. It is crucial to implement censorship in libraries to protect children from being exposed to harmful content and steer society back to a time where art was celebrated for its positive impact. Let us strive to return to a time when media served as a source of inspiration and creativity, rather than a catalyst for destructive behaviors.
1522	4499	2	3	I personally don't think any books should be taken off the shelves of any library anywhere. Removing books is like telling people to stop reading. People have the right to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to, and just because something may be offensive to one person doesn't mean it should be censored for everyone else. It's important to respect different perspectives and opinions, and if something offends you, you always have the option to simply not engage with it. Let's focus on living life and enjoying the diversity of content available to us, rather than trying to control what others can access.
1523	4500	2	3	They have a book in the library called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' that tells a heartbreaking story. The protagonist, @CAPS3, endured extreme abuse from his parents, being forced to eat off the floor, consume his brother's vomit, and even worms. He suffered physical violence, resulting in broken bones and scars all over his body. Eventually, his siblings couldn't bear to see him suffer anymore, leading them to call the authorities. Two years later, @CAPS3 and his brother were adopted by a loving family with eleven siblings in total. Despite the large family size, they all lived harmoniously and happily after the passing of their biological parents.
1524	4501	2	3	When someone goes to the library, there is multiple items to choose from. There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc. But not all of this is necessarily a good thing. There are several books, movies, and music albums that can be either offensive or not right for a library's audience. The material that is offensive should not be on the shelves for children's sake.  Although there is much good material in a library, there is also bad or offensive content as well. Explicit music albums, R-rated movies, and harmful books can all be found in libraries. These items can have inappropriate content that is not suitable for children. By removing offensive material from libraries, it creates a healthier and safer environment for all library users, especially for young kids.  Explicit music albums can contain inappropriate language or themes that are not suitable for children to listen to. R-rated movies often have adult content that is not appropriate for young audiences. Harmful books with derogatory or racial statements can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and ideas. Removing offensive material from libraries can help protect young children from being exposed to inappropriate content.  In conclusion, for the sake of children and young kids, any material that is found offensive in libraries should be removed. By eliminating offensive material, libraries can create a more educational and positive environment for all visitors. It is important to prioritize the well-being and safety of library users, especially children, by ensuring that libraries offer appropriate and enriching content.
1525	4502	2	3	Offensive materials in libraries can include inappropriate and uncensored books, music, magazines, movies, and other media. While some may find certain content offensive, such as racial slurs or nudity, others may see them as a reflection of the harsh realities of the world. It is important to consider the context and purpose of these materials, as they can serve as educational tools and help individuals learn about different perspectives and experiences. Ultimately, the decision to keep or remove offensive materials from libraries should take into account the potential for learning and growth that they may provide to patrons.
1526	4503	2	3	Libraries should be more careful about what they put out in their establishments, especially considering the diverse range of people, including children, who visit them regularly. It is essential for libraries to organize their materials effectively, keeping adult and potentially inappropriate content separate from children's sections. By implementing stricter guidelines and security measures, libraries can ensure that all visitors have access to age-appropriate and suitable material. Ultimately, prioritizing organization and monitoring the content available can help prevent children from accessing inappropriate material and promote a safer and more responsible library environment for all patrons.
1527	4504	2	3	Pornography, vulgar language, grotesque scenes, and other explicit content in books and movies often make them inappropriate for some audiences. In today's culture, censorship is not a primary focus, with media frequently depicting sensual elements and using coarse language. However, in a society that values freedom of choice, individuals have the right to read and view material of their choosing. While some may find certain content offensive, censorship in libraries should not be enforced.  Libraries contain a variety of materials that may contain objectionable content, but removing them would violate individuals' rights to access information. While some may argue for censorship to protect sensitive viewers, it is essential for libraries to maintain a diverse collection to cater to all preferences. In a market-driven economy, libraries must offer a range of materials to remain viable. If individuals find certain content offensive, they can choose not to engage with it rather than imposing their views on others.  Censorship is a subjective matter and should not be based on personal opinions. Libraries have a responsibility to uphold the principles of freedom of expression and provide access to a wide range of content. While parents should monitor their children's exposure to inappropriate material, adults have the autonomy to choose their reading and viewing preferences. Content with adult themes can also offer valuable insights into societal issues and behaviors.  In conclusion, censorship of books and movies in libraries should not be dictated by individual preferences. Libraries play a crucial role in upholding freedom of choice and providing diverse entertainment options. While it is important to be mindful of sensitive content, individuals have the right to access a range of materials and make their own informed decisions about what to read and watch.
1528	4505	2	3	Libraries are a valuable resource for people of all ages, offering a wide range of books and information. However, it is important to consider the content of the books available, especially when it comes to children. In some cases, there may be books in the library that are not suitable for young readers.   It is essential for libraries to have a separate section for books that are intended for adults only. This will ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content and can freely explore the library without encountering materials that are not suitable for their age group. By creating a designated section for adult books, libraries can maintain a safe and welcoming environment for all visitors.  In my own experience, I encountered a situation where my younger brother came across a book that was not meant for children. This was a concerning moment, and it made me realize the importance of ensuring that libraries have proper categorization of books to protect young readers from potentially harmful content.   In conclusion, I believe that libraries should have a separate section for adult books to safeguard children from exposure to inappropriate material. By implementing this measure, libraries can continue to be a valuable resource for people of all ages while also maintaining a safe and educational environment for all visitors.
1529	4506	2	3	Censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years. In many school libraries, certain books, music, movies, and magazines have been removed due to their content. This content often includes violence, sexual acts, drug use, and inappropriate language. Parents are concerned about what their children are being exposed to at school, as they do not want them to be influenced by such content at a young age.   In my view, it is appropriate to censor certain materials in school libraries, especially in elementary and middle schools. Young students should not be introduced to inappropriate or violent content. Instead, they should learn about topics such as drug use and sexual activity in a more educational setting, such as a health class. This way, they can learn accurate information in a controlled environment.   Many movies, songs, books, and magazines contain content that is not suitable for young children. Therefore, censorship in school libraries is necessary to protect students from exposure to harmful material. Public libraries, on the other hand, can cater to different age groups by dividing their collections accordingly. Overall, censorship in libraries is essential to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content that could negatively impact their development.
1530	4507	2	3	WE ALL DON'T THINK OF ANYTHING WHEN YOUR CHILDREN CHECK OUT BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARIES. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WE DO NOT WANT YOUR CHILDREN GETTING HOLD TO THE CENSORSHIP OF BAD BOOK, MOVIE, MUSIC OR MAGAZINES. PARENT DON'T WANT TO COME HOME AN THERE CHILD LEARN A NEW WORD FROM THE NEW BOOK OR MOVIE HE/SHE JUST CHECKED OUT FROM THE LIBARY, OR READING A MAGAZINE FROM THE LIBARY. IT MIGHT MAKES YOUR CHILDREN ATTITUDE CHANGE PUTTING BAD INFLEUNCE ON YOUR KID BECAUSE OF A TRIP TO THE LIBARY. SO THERE FOR THE CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE A SECTION WHERE THEY PICK OUT THERE BOOK AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CHECK OUT THE CENSORSHIP BOOK. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN BE MORE CONVINCED ABOUT THIS TOPIC.
1531	4508	2	3	I believe that censoring books in a library could be both good and bad. In elementary school libraries, it would be appropriate to censor books to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content. However, in high school libraries, where students are more mature, there should be less censorship to allow for a wider range of reading material. Public libraries could have sections based on age level to help guide readers to appropriate content. Ultimately, while some level of censorship may be necessary, books should not be removed from shelves simply for being offensive as they serve as outlets for education, entertainment, and personal enjoyment. It is important to find a balance between censorship and freedom of choice to cater to the needs of all library patrons.
1532	4509	2	3	I think that everyone has their own opinion on what they listen to, watch, and read. I believe that some content can have an impact on the world. Removing material that could influence individuals with weak minds to engage in harmful actions is necessary. By changing what we are exposed to, we have the power to change the world for the better. It is important to be mindful of the impact of media and content on society.
1533	4510	2	3	I think that censorship should be allowed in high school. For one, students who read books or watch the movies that are censorship can learn a lot from it. Also, I believe that if books are bad and not appropriate at school then why are they here? Movies that are not allowed because of its rating I think is lame because it might have pictures of naked people and bad language but we are high school students and we should be able to watch them because they are educational and we are mature enough to watch. Nevertheless, I believe that censorship is a good and bad thing but overall I think it should be allowed. Therefore, books or movies that are censored shouldn't be because I personally think that students learn better from recent rated R movies than some old movies that are in black and white. Kids pay more attention to good interesting movies and the old movies most students fall asleep or just don't pay attention at all. So after that, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools. If books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already. I think it's foolish for teachers or administrators to think that we are too immature to watch rated R movies like every kid at school watches them at home, I believe. Yeah, I know some movies show some scenes that aren't school related but who cares we will get over it. Overall, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools. Well then the last point is that all this helps us in a way if you really think about it. Get a classroom with computers and for a week let them listen to music while they work and for another week don't let them listen to anything than see which comes out better. Personally, listening to music makes me concentrate better and keeps me on course to get my work done. So therefore, I think that censorship should be allowed at high schools. So you got my opinion on censorship and I hope it helped you out to look at this situation better or clearer. I think rated R movies should be allowed at high schools and any music should too. I mean it's not like we are in prison, right? So there you have my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools.
1534	4511	2	3	There are differing views on whether there should be censorship in libraries. Some argue that certain books should be restricted to protect young readers, while others believe that people should have the freedom to choose what they read. While some may find cultural books and magazines offensive, others see them as informative and valuable. History books, too, can be controversial depending on one's perspective, especially when it comes to topics like religion and race. However, censorship in libraries may not be the answer. Instead, creating a separate section for potentially offensive material could be a compromise. Ultimately, the decision on censorship in libraries should consider the diverse perspectives and opinions of library patrons.
1535	4512	2	3	Today, millions of teens are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage, from movies to music to magazines. While some argue for censorship to protect young people, others believe that censoring materials limits knowledge and understanding.   Parents and teachers have a responsibility to prepare students for the real world, where they will inevitably encounter difficult or offensive topics. By censoring books in libraries, we are denying individuals the right to access information that could potentially enlighten and educate them.   What one person finds offensive, another may not, making the concept of censorship too abstract and subjective to regulate effectively. As author Katherine Paterson pointed out, if everyone censored materials based on their own preferences, we would be depriving ourselves of valuable resources.  Therefore, censorship in libraries should be condemned, as it ultimately hinders our ability to learn and grow. Limiting the knowledge available to us only serves to restrict our understanding of the world and prevent us from fully engaging with diverse perspectives and ideas.
1536	4513	2	3	In our great country, we have many freedoms, including the freedom to read, hear, and see what we want. This freedom allows us to have different views and preferences when it comes to books, movies, music, and other forms of entertainment. While we may not always agree with everything we come across, it is important to remember that our individual tastes should not infringe upon the rights and choices of others.  If we were to have the right to remove things we do not like, it would ultimately diminish the enjoyment and creativity that comes from having access to a diverse range of content. Authors, musicians, and directors have emphasized the significance of this freedom in shaping our experiences and fostering a rich cultural landscape.  Our libraries, schools, and stores are filled with a variety of materials that cater to different tastes and interests. By allowing individuals to make their own choices without imposing restrictions based on personal preferences, we uphold the value of diversity and individuality. Everyone should have the opportunity to explore and engage with content that aligns with their own beliefs and desires.  Just as we have the freedom to choose the books we read and the music we listen to, our ability to select the foods we eat reflects our unique preferences and tastes. Restricting access to certain foods based on individual opinions would disrupt our ability to enjoy a wide range of culinary experiences.  Ultimately, the freedom to make choices and embrace our individuality is at the core of the freedoms we cherish. While we may not always agree with everything we encounter, it is important to respect the diverse perspectives and preferences of others. By upholding these freedoms, we can continue to cultivate a society that celebrates differences and values personal autonomy.
1537	4514	2	3	Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive? Who would determine if something is offensive or not and to whom it offends? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and issues among many people. Would removing books from shelves limit our possibility to learn or see something from a different point of view?  First of all, who decides what is offensive and who it offends? It is possible for anything to offend anyone. Also removing a book from the shelves could be offensive to the writer and the followers of the writer. Bringing up removing a book from shelves could cause more problems than just letting the book remain on the shelves. If offending others is the issue then would it not be better to leave it alone overall, rather than making it an issue to please one group but in turn upsetting another?  Secondly, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view? If books that offended people would have always been removed for reasons of offending others we could not have much of the knowledge we have today. If we removed both types of books from the shelves for being offensive, we would not have religion or modern science. This example could be used for any topic or genre of book because people can take many different things as offensive.  As a solution, I believe it true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is pleased another is offended. If books could possibly be labeled as 'some might take offense' or 'material may be offensive' then people have a warning and they can choose if they want to read it or not. If they are offended they cannot put blame on the author or wherever they got the book because there was a warning. It would be just like the parental warnings on CDs. This may not fix the problem of people being offended, but it could very much reduce the amount of complaints about a book being offensive.  In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves regardless of people complaining about them being offensive. Books being taken off shelves could turn into all books being taken off shelves which means no education or learning. That is just not an option. Leaving books that offend certain people on the shelves may cause controversy with others but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures are performed, the issues should decrease greatly. Think about all this the next time you want a book to be removed from the shelves.
1538	4515	2	3	I agree with Katherine's statement, but to a certain extent. If a book or magazine has cursing or anything offensive in it, then a student should take it to the librarian and let him/her know they are offended by it. Especially if it's in a middle school or elementary school.  Of course there's going to be a book or movie or magazine that has something inappropriate in it. One day my friend and I were in the library looking for a book to read, and that's when I first discovered the @CAPS1 series. But as I got into the books, the more mature they got. In the last book, @ORGANIZATION1, it has a lot of profanity in it. But that doesn't mean I'm not mature enough to not know what it means. Same with any other high school student. But you can't protect your children from everything. Not even curse words.  So if you see a book at a local library that is absolutely filled with offensive things, and you decide you want it removed, just take it to your librarian and confront him/her. I'm sure they'll understand. Or maybe they won't, and they'll wait to see if anyone else will want it removed. My point is, you can't always protect your children from violent words or movies, or magazines. But you can always stand your ground and try to make a difference.
1539	4516	2	3	What impact does books that are for mature people have on kids? Recently people are trying to censorship libraries for what they seen what their kids are reading or have been acting lately. I disagree in censorshiping in libraries. Instead of censorshiping libraries maybe have a section for explict books or things for preventing little kids from reading them.   First of all instead of removing all the books maybe you should consider making a section for only for people of certain age. Make a section in at the back of the library and ask for @CAPS1 to confirm that there old enough. This would let the libarary keep all their books and would keep all their construmers happy and the most important keep the parents happy.   Another reason for not censorship libraries would be that the number of construmers would slowing drop. This would make the construmers unhappy and the library drop on its popularity for not having the books that people want to read.   I can also see why they are trying to censorship libraries because of the kids behaviors. With censorship in libraries this would keep the little kids from acting the way they do in a book. But @CAPS2 would be better just to not censorship libraries and keep the people who does read them happy.   At the end I disagree in censorshiping libraries because @CAPS2 would upset the people who read them and probably the library poplurity would drop which means people would stop visiting the library. So people that disagree should act now so libraries can stay how they are now.
1540	4517	2	3	The @CAPS1 on Books In the world today, everything is showed every place you look. Libraries are used by many people, people go there to research, study, and even just to find an interesting book to read. One of the problems that some people are having is the exposing of personal things. I believe that libraries should have a censorship. Why should libraries have one? Here are my reasons why.  One reason why censorships in libraries are a smart idea is younger children search for books there. Any parent would tell you that they would strongly dislike the idea of their child reading something very detailed and adult like. A library should be a place where children, young adults, and senior citizens can go to escape from reality not somewhere were they are worried about what book they might pull out from the shelf.  If libraries still want to keep certain books in stock, they should start an age limit on those books. Limiting the age on books will stop younger audiences from viewing them. Another thing they could do with the age limiting is parents could set the age limit with the library on when their child should be allowed to view certain books.  Also, another way that would help stop offensive viewing is parents looking at what their children are reading, watching, and listening to. Parents could help by keeping an eye on what their child is doing.  Censorships are a wonderful way of stopping the viewing of adult like issues. More public places should start a system of them. The world needs to understand that some audiences aren't ready for reality just yet.
1541	4518	2	3	Libraries around the world house a variety of books, some of which may contain content that offends certain individuals. The decision to ban books or remove them from library shelves often stems from concerns about racial slurs, religious themes, or sexual content. However, it should ultimately be up to the library to decide whether or not to carry a particular book. Instead of banning books altogether, libraries can categorize them based on content ratings to prevent children from accessing inappropriate material. While some may argue that books with offensive language or themes should be removed, it's important to consider that such content can add depth and realism to a story. Authors use these elements to evoke emotions and engage specific audiences. Removing such content could limit the reading experience for many individuals. Therefore, libraries should strive to provide a diverse range of books while implementing measures to ensure that young readers are not exposed to unsuitable material. By striking a balance between freedom of expression and responsible curation, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for communities.
1542	4519	2	3	A day without books in the school library is a bleak scenario. The empty corridors echo with the absence of knowledge and imagination, a stark reminder of the power of censorship. The librarian, once a guardian of books, now walks through a barren landscape, haunted by the memories of a time before censorship took hold.  Censorship, driven by individual sensibilities, threatens the freedom to explore diverse ideas and perspectives. One person's offense should not dictate what others can or cannot read. By succumbing to the demands of the easily offended, we risk a slippery slope where censorship becomes the norm, depriving students of valuable learning opportunities.  Authors like @PERSON1 face the brunt of censorship, their works banned and their voices silenced. Students, denied access to these books, are robbed of the chance to expand their minds and explore new worlds. The consequences of censorship ripple far beyond the confines of a school library.  As the librarian departs from the empty library, the loss of books is not just a physical absence but a void in the minds of the students. Reading should be a gateway to knowledge, not a battleground for censorship. Let us preserve the freedom to read, for in books lies the power to enlighten and inspire.
1543	4520	2	3	Censorship should be approached with caution, especially when it comes to removing materials that some may find offensive. It is important to consider factors such as maturity, intelligence, and age when determining access to certain materials. Instead of outright removal, restrictions or warnings can be put in place to guide individuals on what is deemed appropriate. Ultimately, the decision on what materials should be accessed lies with a collective group that includes parents, educators, and library staff. It is essential to respect differing opinions on what is acceptable, and to allow individuals the freedom to make their own choices regarding the materials they engage with.
1544	4521	2	3	If you found a movie that you really enjoyed at the library, would you get mad if the library just took it away and there was no other place to get it? If one person doesn't like something they see at the library doesn't mean it's not educational, and just get rid of it. Just because somebody doesn't like one thing doesn't mean another person will. I don't think they should get rid of movies, music, books, or magazines just because of one person. Here are some things that will make you think about getting rid of all these categories.  One thing about movies that I like is they are good for visual aids. Some people are better learners if they visualize something, they can get a better understanding of the purpose or the cause of the situation and they might learn faster. Another thing about movies in the library is because they show you things in the movie that you wouldn't be able to see if you were just reading a book. One thing that I like personally is that when people are in movies it's like you are actually talking to me like me and the actor are really having a conversation. When you look at a movie it gives you a visual picture of what's going on, even if the content isn't appropriate. That's all the reasons why I think that movies shouldn't be taken away because someone thinks that the movies are vulgar and not censored.  Music is another rule that they shouldn't get rid of. Music is almost the only thing you can calm you down so that you can focus again. Another thing that music does to you is it soothes the mind so that you can relax and you won't bother anybody else. When you listen to music, it blocks out other sounds that you might get distracted from. So those are the reasons why music shouldn't be rid of.  Magazines and books are the basics of a library. If you get rid of those, then it wouldn't be a library anymore. Books are the basic learning methods of education. People learn the most information out of a book or magazine. If you take those away it's like you're trying to hold people back from education and knowledge that they have in books. So if you get rid of magazines and books then it wouldn't even be a library anymore.  If you get rid of movies from the library then people won't be able to have a visual aid as their alternative way of learning. If you get rid of music from the library, you won't be able to concentrate as well on one thing if you're constantly getting disturbed by other noise around you. Last but not least if you get rid of books from the library then it wouldn't be a library anymore it will just be a place to go like any other place. The library wouldn't be anything anymore. Now would you want that? Thank you.
1545	4522	2	3	Im a strong believer in freedom of speech and expression. I firmly believe that individuals should have the right to publish whatever they want, regardless of how offensive or controversial it may be. Censorship only limits our ability to express ourselves and stifles creativity. People have the choice to engage with content or not, and no one should have the power to dictate what others can or cannot read. Our rights, including freedom of speech, are essential and should be protected at all costs. We should learn to accept things we may not agree with and not try to suppress them. Let's embrace our freedoms and respect the rights of others, even if we may not always agree with their views. Thank you for taking the time to consider these thoughts.
1546	4523	2	3	Libraries are filled with a wide range of materials, including books, magazines, music, and movies, covering various topics. However, some of this material can be offensive and unsuitable for certain viewers. Therefore, it is important to remove offensive materials from libraries.  One significant reason for removing offensive material is the potential for it to incite violence in teenagers. Exposure to violent content in books or movies may desensitize teenagers to violent behavior, leading them to believe it is an acceptable solution to problems. This was evident in a case where a student, influenced by a movie, threatened a teacher with a knife in a classroom. Such incidents highlight the dangerous consequences of exposure to offensive material.  Moreover, offensive material can also be inappropriate for younger children. Books or magazines with explicit content like sex or drugs can negatively influence impressionable minds, planting inappropriate ideas and behaviors. Children may come across such material in libraries, even if they do not intend to borrow it, potentially shaping their beliefs and actions in harmful ways.  In conclusion, the removal of offensive material from libraries is crucial to safeguarding individuals from the negative impacts of such content. Whether it be the promotion of violence among teenagers or the inappropriate influence on young children, ensuring that libraries provide safe and suitable materials is essential for fostering a healthy and responsible community.
1547	4524	2	3	Libraries have all kinds of books for everyone, catering to different tastes and interests. Removing books because some find them offensive or dislike them goes against the purpose of a library, which is to provide a wide range of literature for all to access. It is important for individuals to exercise personal choice by not checking out books they do not approve of, rather than censoring the library's collection. Children should be guided by parents on appropriate reading materials, ensuring they access content suitable for their age. Libraries have organized sections for different age groups, allowing for easy selection of books. It is essential to preserve the variety of books in libraries to maintain the diversity of literature available for readers. By upholding the principle of choice and responsibility, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for learning and exploration.
1548	4525	2	3	Libraries have books that are short, long, and everything in between. Their are good and bad books, but that all depends on the opinion of the reader. There is no reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library that it should be removed from the shelf. The books on a shelf in the library are there for everyone to read so if one is removed then someone else is missing the chance to have the experience of reading that very book. Would you have some food destroyed if it didn't taste any good to you? No, you wouldn't get it again. So why'd someone have the right to remove a book because they were offended it isn't right your views on something are only an opinion nothing more. Your views are not the same as @PERSON1's who lives down the street so by removing a book it is pushing your views on somone else. In conclusion, the books in question could be good or bad in the eyes of the next person to read it. Pushy people aren't normally liked by others. Books are meant to be read and interpreted by the reader. That is why no one person has the right to take it off the shelf.
1549	4526	2	3	Everyone in the world has an opinion, some people may find them offensive but there are also people who find it interesting and enjoy reading, listening, and watching the material. I personally have never had this kind of problem, I have only been to the library around five times. I generally rent movies. There are people who cannot deal with certain things like blood and guts or racism in books, movies, and music, but at the same time, there are people who absolutely love it; it's their thing.  I believe that it would be wrong to strip those of what they find interesting, what they enjoy to read or watch and listen to. Some people will say it's vulgar, while others will say that it's a masterpiece or that what they are into is dull and has no interesting moral. Libraries generally do not have things that are too gory or have too much sexual content; they might in books but not in movies or magazines. Now, music nowadays can be downright vulgar and disrespectful. It can also be very sexual and contain lots of gang-related violence which has become a large problem with our children.  Libraries generally have old-school music like Michael Jackson, The Beatles, slow jams like R. Kelly, old smooth positive rap, good old country music, and nice soothing jazz. The music our children listen to nowadays has all these depressing and violent morals that do not need to be shared with some of these young and impressionable minds. I believe that they should not pull it off the shelves, but I do believe that you should have to be a certain age to access these things.  In conclusion, while there are varied opinions and preferences when it comes to entertainment, it is essential to consider the impact it can have on different individuals, especially the youth. Providing a range of options in libraries while also regulating access to sensitive content based on age can help strike a balance between freedom of choice and responsible exposure.
1550	4527	2	3	Today it seems as if anything you could imagine is out in the world somewhere, somehow. Whether it is found in a magazine, a book, music, or movies is irrelevant. The fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too. This bad stuff is sitting around on the shelves of our libraries nationwide waiting for someone to open it up and indulge in their naughty, intense, or graphic ways.  As an @CAPS1, every man has the right to do or read what he wants. But what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact it is a child? This child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it. Should they be punished for accidentally coming across this material and reading it? Which raises the question; who is to blame, and, what is the solution? It is a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries but if someone wants to read something, they should be able to right? It is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles, and different perspectives.  The people that have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly on their views of censorship in libraries, as have I. On a dry, blistering @DATE1 day I wanted to find something to do indoors. So instead of staying home all day I walked down to the library. I had been there a lot that @DATE1 and I was pretty familiar with their selection so I was looking for something new. So I strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library. There were so many choices and options right at the tip of my fingers. I got tired of reading all the titles so I did what generally any other kid would do, and something parents have been telling their kids for centuries not to do; I judged the books by their covers. I found one that looked interesting, and long story short I just so happened to stumble upon a love story. But not the kind I was used to. It was an adult book and went into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple. Needless to say I was speechless. Reading that stuff as a child, scared me very much so.  Nevertheless it leads me to believe that it would be smart for censorship to be put into place in libraries. Of course, not every kid is going to have the same experience I did. In fact hardly any will. But I know that I was traumatized. So I can easily imagine how other people felt when the same thing or a relatively similar thing happened to them. But for all the other people that have not had things happen to them or that have not stumbled upon such material would probably think that it is unfair that things should be taken away from them just because other people could not handle it. But if you were like me, or any other innocent child that happened to find and experience certain things they just were not ready for would you not agree that censoring libraries is a beneficial thing to everyone? If you want things that are more intense or out there, then you can go to a bookstore, instead of a public library.  I am a teenager and I do not have children but I can only imagine how you mothers and fathers out there would feel if it was their kids who were emotionally scarred from experiences they could have been shielded from in the first place. Kids should be kids and not have to be worried about the bad things in this world, and the most efficient way to keep that the way it is, is to censor books, music, magazines and movies from the shelves of public libraries.
1551	4528	2	3	Everyday hundreds of people visit the local library, which offers a variety of media such as books, music, movies, magazines, and newspapers. However, the question arises about whether certain subjects should be limited or censored in libraries. While some individuals may find certain content offensive, it is important to consider the diverse interests and educational needs of library patrons.  Limiting or censoring content in libraries would greatly reduce the available resources for the public. It is impossible to please everyone, as different individuals have varying preferences and sensitivities. For example, anatomy books may be deemed inappropriate for young children by some parents, but they serve as valuable educational tools for students studying biology. To address this, libraries often have separate sections for different age groups to cater to their specific needs.  Furthermore, everyone has different tastes and interests. While some may find certain music or literature offensive, it is ultimately up to the individual to choose what they wish to engage with. Artists and authors have the freedom to express themselves, even if their work covers controversial topics such as sex, drugs, or violence, which are realities of everyday life.  In conclusion, removing offensive material from libraries would severely limit the range of media available to the public. It is essential to respect the diverse interests and educational needs of library patrons, while also acknowledging the freedom of expression for artists and authors. Ultimately, individuals have the autonomy to select the content that aligns with their preferences and beliefs.
1552	4529	2	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper @CAPS4,   I wanted to express my thoughts on the article you published last week regarding the removal of offensive materials from shelves. Initially, I was torn on this issue. On one hand, I believed that if something was offensive to some individuals, it should be taken down to prevent harm or discomfort. However, upon further reflection, I realized that everyone has the right to freedom of expression.   Our country was founded on the principles of equality and freedom of speech. People should have the liberty to express themselves through various mediums such as music, movies, and books. If an artist chooses to convey their thoughts and feelings in a certain way, it is their right to do so. While not everyone may agree with the content, censorship should not be the immediate solution.   Regardless of race, color, or beliefs, every individual deserves the freedom to express themselves. We must respect the diverse perspectives and ideas that exist in our society. Instead of attacking or ridiculing those we disagree with, it is important to engage in constructive dialogue.   I appreciate the thought-provoking nature of your article and how it has encouraged me to consider different viewpoints. Thank you for sparking this reflection on the importance of freedom of expression in our society.   Sincerely,  @PERSON1
1553	4530	2	3	I think that there are certain types of books, music, magazines, and movies that may offend some people, depending on their content. While some materials may be suitable for children, such as age-appropriate games, music, and educational content, there are others that should not be available in libraries. For instance, materials containing sexual harassment, drug references, violence, or explicit content can be harmful and offensive to both parents and children. It is important to consider the influence these materials may have on young minds and ensure that they are not exposed to inappropriate content. Artists and creators should be mindful of the impact their work may have on society and strive to promote positive values and behaviors. Ultimately, it is crucial to prioritize the well-being and development of future generations by providing them with safe and enriching materials to learn from.
1554	4531	2	3	Book censorship is a significant issue in libraries in the @LOCATION1. The debate over whether there should be an age limit on the materials that individuals can check out, particularly when it comes to children, is a common one. Parents often question whether certain content is appropriate for their child's age. In my view, implementing age limits on books is essential to ensure that children have access to materials suitable for their developmental stage. Younger children, under @NUM1 years old, should not be exposed to offensive language, racial slurs, or inappropriate behavior depicted in books, magazines, movies, or music.  Having age-appropriate sections in libraries can help guide children towards content that is suitable for them. For instance, a book containing references to underage drinking could send the wrong message to a child. By categorizing books based on age groups such as @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, and @NUM1-@CAPS6, parents can have peace of mind knowing that their children are accessing materials that align with their maturity level.  Overall, implementing age limits on books can alleviate concerns about children being exposed to inappropriate content and help them make informed choices about their reading material. By organizing books into different age groups, libraries can better cater to the needs of their young readers and promote a safe and enriching reading environment.
1555	4532	2	3	There are books up and down the shelves in the library that make people wonder why they are up there. People stand there and stare at a book and ask themselves, 'Why in the world is this book here?' What many people may not know is that every book is in the world for a reason. Books published are in the world to teach about history, manners, literature, or they could be made to take you on an adventure. Of course, you may come across a book that may be offensive to someone, maybe even yourself, but it is there for a reason.  I once read a book that I found in our school library that was about slavery. It was a first-person novel about a boy who was taken away from his family after being sold to a different plantation owner. Some people would have been very offended by this book because the characters were calling the boy all those names that he did not like to be called. But that book helps people realize how much pain slavery put on people.  People can go to any library, from one in an elementary school to a public library, and you will always find at least one book about the past. Just about everyone would get offended by one of these books because nobody liked or does like the past, but they have to be there because of history. People cannot just take the books out because it offends so many people. That would be like erasing the past from history, and that just cannot happen. If it happened, it happened, and people have to know.  Whether people admit it or not, they have run into at least one book that has offended them. That will happen; it is almost natural for it to happen. But it would also offend people if you took books off the shelf. Those people know that books teach us, and we need books to know what is possible, what happened, and what might happen. Books are here for a reason, and they need to stay.
1556	4533	2	3	I believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed if they are offensive to others because censorship and libraries have the right to choose what they want on their shelves. While some may argue that certain things are inappropriate for children, most libraries have designated children's sections to prevent exposure to such materials. It is important to respect the rights of individuals and institutions to make their own decisions regarding what they offer. If parents are concerned, they have the option to order books online or accompany their children to the library. Ultimately, it is crucial for adults to monitor children's access to materials and intervene if necessary. Everyone has the right to choose what they consume and where they place their belongings, and it is not up to others to dictate these decisions.
1557	4534	2	3	If somebody has a problem with the material in a book, magazine, or song, then don't read it or listen to it. Other people may like reading about that topic or enjoy that kind of music. It's important to remember that just because a person doesn't like a book or the topic it covers, it doesn't give them the right to take it off the shelf. Instead of removing books that offend certain individuals, there could be alternative solutions such as providing lists of books with their topics and suggested age groups, or creating different sections in libraries based on age groups. This way, people can choose books that align with their preferences and avoid ones that may be offensive to them. When it comes to songs, artists have the freedom to write about what they want, and listeners have the choice to avoid songs with content they find objectionable. Ultimately, it's important to respect individual preferences and allow people the freedom to choose what they want to read or listen to without imposing restrictions on content.
1558	4535	2	3	The books, magazines, music, and movies should not be removed from the shelves. They provide valuable information and entertainment that others may still want to access. Removing them would limit the resources available to those who need them, such as for research papers or personal enjoyment. If there are concerns about inappropriate content, measures can be taken to restrict access based on age. It is important to maintain a diverse range of materials on the shelves to cater to the varied needs and interests of library users. Ultimately, the products should remain available so that those who require or desire them can continue to benefit from their presence.
1559	4536	2	3	To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:          Censorship, does @CAPS2 deserve a place in our society?      There has been much controversy over this topic. Some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others, over the same topic, believe the complete opposite. They believe that the words of the artists and authors show feelings and have messages hidden within words of vulgarity, which is where I stand on the situation.     @CAPS2 seems as though every time we cross over this bridge, @CAPS2 comes right back in front of us. Many of those opposed to the freedom of writing and music are usually the ones that feel as if they must perform proper etiquette and have everyone act nothing less of the same, unfortunately for many, the people that are like this, usually, have much power in the say of what comes and what goes, not allowing many of us lower-graded people in society to get a chance to veto their poor outlook on things.      My opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too. However, I still believe that much of what is considered 'censored' material should not be censored at all. There is one, count that, one situation where I feel censorship is necessary. One is songs that go on for @NUM1 and a half minutes saying nothing but '*bleep* this, and *bleep that'.      All other material, whether @CAPS2 be @CAPS4 rapping or @PERSON1 writing, is acceptable. There's just many people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics/words, to get the full message before automatically assuming that there is a problem with @CAPS2. Great @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, he always has a message in his music, whether @CAPS2 be about family or just life in general, however many words he uses are considered unfit for our time, so you just hear '*bleep*' when @CAPS2 is on the radio. By just that '*bleep*', you can lose the message that's coming across.      Also, ever hear the phrase, 'equal rights'? Well, shouldn't music and literature be a right? @CAPS2's just like talking but with either pages or instruments. And that's how I will leave you on this debatable topic. I hope I might have changed some opinions of you today, if not then your loss. Thank you for your time.                                                                                                     A @CAPS6 to the @CAPS7,                                                     @LOCATION1
1560	4537	2	3	Everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly. Songs today hint at sexual activities. Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness. Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library?  Several people would agree, but I disagree.          Growing up, @PERSON1 was the wonder of my world. Her music was fun and unbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. Her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply. Even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying. Some @MONTH1 restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of there freedom.           You can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines. Some library's even have computers available to the public. Not all places will carry your favorite aritist, movies, or reading material tho because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in. Who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like? That's like taking away part of a person's originality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track.          Limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way. Restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time managment skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble. Library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though. Age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set.           Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public. Restrictions on renting that material could be set. It would solve all issues, in my opinion. In conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material alltogether. Therefore, making parent's happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop there own opinion's and liking's of the different types of media.
1561	4538	2	3	I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves from children if they are found offensive. I fully agree with adults not letting children watch that new scary movie or that action book their brother is reading. Children at young ages still have their innocence, and exposing them to inappropriate content can have long-lasting effects. It is important to hide such materials so that children cannot access them easily. Parents should be mindful of the media their children consume and take steps to protect their innocence. It is crucial to consider the potential impact of exposing children to offensive content, as it can have a detrimental effect on their mental and emotional well-being. Therefore, it is essential to be cautious and selective when it comes to the media children are exposed to. By being mindful of the content children consume, we can help ensure they have a safe and healthy upbringing.
1562	4539	2	3	Everyone is @CAPS1, @CAPS2 person is @CAPS1, this much we can agree on. So why then would people try to put censorship on books, movies, magazines, and etc.? We all have our own standards on what is offensive or acceptable, based on our individual perspectives and beliefs. When a book is removed from a library shelf, it reflects the values of those making that decision. However, what may be deemed offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. Each individual has their own unique views and sensitivities, making it impossible to cater to everyone's preferences.  The same principle applies to music, movies, and other forms of media. There will always be someone who finds something objectionable, no matter how carefully content is curated. For instance, the recitation of the pledge of allegiance in schools may be a routine practice for many, but it can be offensive to some individuals or groups. Despite this, most people choose to either accept it or simply ignore it, rather than demanding its removal.  In conclusion, attempting to impose censorship in libraries or other public spaces is a futile endeavor. Instead of trying to control what others read or consume, it is more effective to exercise personal discretion and choose to avoid content that may be offensive. By respecting individual differences and allowing for diverse perspectives, we can create a more inclusive and understanding society. Therefore, I believe that censorship in libraries is unnecessary and counterproductive.
1563	4540	2	3	Throughout the history of literature, many books have been banned from public libraries and shelves. They are all somehow offensive to certain people, but not to all. Even some books that include magic and fiction have been expelled from some societies, simply because of certain religions and cultural backgrounds. I believe that there should never be a piece of literature completely banned from public eye.   When a book is banned, a piece of history is removed from others' sight. A book that @MONTH1 have been banned in the @DATE1 could not have been read by my mother or father. My future children and I could also never be able to read it. Materials that are removed from the public are generally removed because of one specific group which complains about its content.   When I was about eight years old, I remember seeing on the news that people in @LOCATION1 and other @CAPS1 @CAPS2 countries were burning books from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series, only because it contained magic and ridiculous
1564	4541	2	3	"There are many works out in modern times which can be considered provacative or offensive. Some are even unfit for young eyes. There are many reasons that some will come up with for removing these books from their shelves, but I believe that no one, politician or artist alike, should have the right to put down someone else's work.      There are definitely books in libraries that wouldn't be dreamt of being checked out by the ordinary person, but these books should not be put down. I don't believe that a person's work, which is instilled with hope, money, beliefs, and elbow grease should be removed from public. No matter how offensive or wrong some may be, it is their work and their time, and their heart and soul which they put into a book. It is the truth that this has been done in the past to keep down rebellions and shifts in power, but nevertheless, I still disagree. For example, even today George Orwell's ""1984"" is illegal to even have in North Korea. This is for a specific reason, of course, and not a bad one at that, but I believe that this book should still be available so people can read and learn from the past.      As it has been for many centuries, the ability to publish a book means the ability to be remembered forever, and many people put their soul into the book they write. These books represent the ability to think freely, and if one is to remove books from society, then one is to remove free will and free thinking from society as well. This is accentuated especially in the dark psychological science fiction novel by Philip K. Dick, ""A Scanner Darkly."" This book is almost prophetic in the descriptions of future society from the perspective of a person from the 1970s, and almost totally accurate as to what would happen if one was to take books out of society, and was even censored itself for a long time. Of course, it conveys the extremist view of censorship, and probably won't happen in the near future, at least. It is, however, a dark omen of what is to come is censorship is freely given power.      There are many views that one can have on a single topic, book, or idea. That doesn't mean, however, that if it is viewed as wrong it should be put down. This applies to music, movies, magazines, websites, and books alike. If one removes these from society in any form, then at a raw standpoint, they are removing a piece of flavor and individuality from society. If censorship is given free reign, even if it is simply over the 'extremist' or 'radical' ideals, then people will never have the full ability to learn from their mistakes and know what to do about the future, which will simply be history that will be repeating itself. Of course, it is not my viewpoint that governments should simply let terrorists and radicals spread their ideals as they please. Once one is proven to be a threat or menace to the public, then they should most definitely be taken into custody and convicted of their wrongs. There is no doubt in my mind that the law should be upheld, but it should not overextend its boundaries.      Censorship, as a whole, is a helpful process for the benefit of the public, but all in all it removes the ability to see the raw, cold truths of life. This keeps some from ever learning how to be safe truly, and how to think and believe in their ideals. When politicians step into the boundary of art, music, literature, and even education to an extent, and try to keep it from flourishing as it naturally would, then something must be done. I'm not inciting a rebellion, but I truly do not believe that politics should rule over the artistic soul of the average man. That in itself is how society becomes self-destructive and loses its concern and connection with the world."
1565	4542	2	3	Many different people have views on what they want their children to be exposed to, whether it be in books, movies, music, or any other type of media. So should libraries be more strict and remove certain items that might come across as offensive or vulgar to parents or even students? I believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what.  I know that a certain case, specific to me, is that my mother did not like me reading a specific series because she thought that it was not an appropriate reading material for me. Because of that, that does not mean she marched down to the library and demand that they get rid of all the books written by that author. She respected the fact that others enjoyed reading the books and just asked me to steer clear of them and to find something more appropriate for me to read.  In many libraries, I know that they have certain areas for specific age groups of people like children, teenagers, and adults. Within those specific designated areas, they have kind of 'sub-area' where they separate educational from entertainment and so on. Let's say one parent gets offended by a specific section, such as a sex education section, should they ask the library to remove it completely? I do not think that will help anything because there are students who use that topic for areas they are studying and parents who use it as educational tools with their own children.  I do believe that libraries should put stamps or notices on their different types of media saying that only a certain age group is allowed to look at them and be able to check them out. An eight-year-old should not be able to go in and get an R-rated movie whenever they want to. There should be restrictions on areas like that, but for someone to come in and say to take out all the R-rated movies is a ridiculous thing to do because there are others who enjoy that type of entertainment.  Libraries should respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible. They will have children's videos separate from the adult videos and they even have a whole separate section of books for them to discover and journey into. The only thing that I believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos. A library is still a public, family area, after all, and no child should accidentally stumble upon any raunchy article.  So, should libraries completely remove areas of media? I do not think so. I think that they should distinguish adult's and children's materials. Katherine Paterson says, 'But if I have the right to remove books from the shelf . . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we continue to take books off of the shelves then eventually there will be nothing to read.
1566	4543	2	3	People have various reasons for wanting to remove certain materials from shelves, whether it be books, magazines, music, or other forms of media. Some may find the content offensive, while others may believe it is inappropriate for younger audiences. It is important to consider the impact of such materials on society and whether they have the potential to cause harm. While everyone has the right to freedom of expression, there are instances where the removal of offensive or inappropriate content may be necessary to prevent negative consequences. Ultimately, it is crucial to strike a balance between freedom of expression and the well-being of individuals and communities.
1567	4544	2	3	My opinion on this matter is that adult material should not be banned from libraries. Children will eventually come across such content, so it is better to have open discussions with them rather than trying to shield them from reality. Parents should take responsibility for safeguarding their personal belongings and having appropriate conversations with their children when necessary. It is not the library's duty to cater to individual preferences, as they serve a diverse community with varying needs. Ultimately, censorship is not the answer, and it is essential to approach these situations with understanding and communication.
1568	4545	2	3	The question was asked 'Do you believe certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive,' No! By taking away these things, such as books, music, magazines, or movies off the shelf, that seem 'offensive' you're taking away things that people enjoy. Not many people, including me, would agree with the passage of censorship on items like these. So should we do this, I don't believe that we should. There are many reasons that this should not be passed.  First, by using this censorship, you might lose more customers in that store selling these items. Once the store has lost customers, they lose money, then they might even lose their store. A lot of people like things that don't have any limits to them. They often find their joy in these things. I know that I, myself like reading books, listening to music that has no limits. So if you're taking them away or putting limits on it, are people really gonna want to have these things?  Secondly, if there is really an issue with books and etc, that are not suitable for kids, then put the books and etc, in categories. These categories would put the things not suitable for children, apart from the ones that children should be reading. Since there are no real solutions besides banning these items, this would be the best plan.  Finally, as Katherine Paterson stated 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' If this is really a problem, then the parents need to watch what their child is reading because it isn't right to have everything taken away from society just because the parents are concerned with what their child is reading.  So what do you think, should this be such a law? The choice is yours. Just remember though, if you agree with this, then just think of everything you are taking away from other people, do you really want to be that heartless?
1569	4546	2	3	Censorship is a contentious issue in society, with many believing it protects children from harmful content. However, censorship can also prevent children from gaining valuable knowledge and insights from literature. The challenge lies in determining what should be censored, as opinions on offensive material vary widely. While some content may be inappropriate for children, it is crucial to provide them with proper guidance and education on moral values. Ultimately, denying children access to certain books may deprive them of life-changing experiences and important life lessons. Instead of relying on censorship, promoting open communication and teaching children about morality and respect is a more effective approach. Let us not deprive our children of the opportunity to explore and learn from diverse perspectives, as it could greatly enrich their understanding of the world.
1570	4547	2	3	I do believe that materials are essential for our daily lives. Books are important for gaining knowledge and learning how to read. Music can be both beneficial and harmful, depending on the context. Magazines, on the other hand, can sometimes contain inappropriate content that may not be suitable for everyone. Overall, having access to a variety of materials can enrich our lives and provide us with valuable information and entertainment.
1571	4548	2	3	No,I dont think that certain books,music,movies,magazines should be taken off the shelves. If stuff like that gets taken off then there will be nothing good to read. The book now day are starting to get good, so if they take the good books away, no one will read. Most people think that rap music is bad, but that is the music that most people listen to nowadays and most people don't like country music. There are some bad movies out there, but they are fun to watch because they are either funny, gross, or sad.  If people made better magazines, they wouldn't make as much money and the business would go out of business. Since I have been alive, most of the good things like books, music, and magazines have changed because people don't like the stuff from a long time ago. If they do it again, then people will stop going to the movies and buying books.  Now there are a lot of good movies and music coming out, so if they brought back all the stuff they used to have, people would have more money. More people would go see the movies from back in the old days. Movies like from the '80s and '90s would make a lot of money.  That's why I think they should not take stuff off the shelves because that is how we are losing all our money. People are using the money that they would use for movies or books on drugs and other things that can get them sent to jail.
1572	4549	2	3	What I believe is that certain materials should be allowed on library shelves. Authors put a lot of time and effort into their work, and everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Libraries categorize materials by age group, ensuring that content is appropriate for the intended audience. While some may object to certain books, they can still provide valuable learning experiences. For instance, books can help children understand different perspectives and cope with real-life issues like bullying. It's important to consider the impact of censorship on both authors and readers. Instead of focusing on personal preferences, we should respect diverse viewpoints and the power of literature to educate and inspire. In the end, it's crucial to remember that everyone's beliefs and opinions deserve to be heard and respected, even if they differ from our own.
1573	4550	2	3	Alot of things can be found offensive now days, but that does not mean you take it away from others who enjoy it. Everyone has their own view, and opinon on things. For the things people find offensive I believe they should just simply stay away from it. No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the library shelves. Somethings people might find offensive others might enjoy. Its simple, if it comes to the point where people are causing problems then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries. Yes, there may be alot of things that people take offensive, but that dose not mean take away the things others may enjoy. I have been to many libraries in my life. I have not really seen anything offensive, but I have seen some books and movies for adults only. Honestly in my eyes its simple, if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it, because others may enjoy it. Its not up to me whether the materials should be removed from the library shelves. Although I do believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it. You have to take things into consideration before jumping straight into conclusions.
1574	4551	2	3	This essay is about censorship in libraries, arguing against it. The author believes that censorship should not be applied to libraries, as much of the content can be found on television channels like Comedy Central, MTV, and others. They also argue against censoring music, stating that it can ruin the beats, rhythm, and lyrics of songs. Instead, they suggest accessing uncensored music through websites like Spotify and Apple Music.  Furthermore, the author opposes censorship in movies, asserting that it should be the parents' responsibility to monitor what their children watch. They also argue against censoring books, emphasizing that adults should have the freedom to choose their reading material. Lastly, the author discusses how censorship in TV shows can detract from the viewing experience, as it can remove crucial parts of the content.  In conclusion, the author believes that censorship hinders entertainment and restricts the creative work of artists. They advocate for freedom of choice and access to uncensored content across various media platforms.
1575	4552	2	3	There is material out there that some people consider offensive and or have material in them that we don't want our youth to indulge in. Such items can include music, books, and movies, but I am just going to give you some of my thoughts on the issue.   On materials, like music and movies, there are ratings on the item saying what age is appropriate for the content that the music or movie have in them. Like movies there are ratings such as G which means that you should be 1 or older to view it, PG which is parental guidance or PG-13 and up. PG means you should have your parents with for the younger kids. And R which is for adults. If there is something offensive and or the language is bad in music the cover will have a label that says explicit content.   I agree with this. I don't think that they should take anything off of the shelf unless completely necessary. If someone doesn't like the content in that item they have the option to not listen, watch, or read it. There are people out there that might disagree with me and I can see where they are coming from too. Say if there is a book discriminating a race than I agree that it should be taken off the shelves.   There are also people out there who are more lenient and others that are more strict. Just like parents for example. A lot of parents want to raise their kids in an environment where there is no swearing and violence, while other parents let their kids watch and listen to items out of their age group. Like with me my parents let me watch, read, and listen to what I want and in my opinion I turned out just fine, while others might not think so. I have seen kids that had parents that weren't strict and let them indulge in these items and they turned out to be well-behaved adults. Then there are also people you had strict parents and they turned out to be not so good of a person, and vice versa.   That is about all I have to say on the topic. You have seen my views and what I believe. In a summary I guess I could say that everyone has their own opinions and views.
1576	4553	2	3	Have you ever had a book, movie, or magazine offend you? Have you ever wished that no one else will ever have to read it? Should those offensive materials be removed from libraries? I don't think they should. The books, movies, and other materials should be marked saying that they may be found offensive.   From my own experience, I know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie. Many times I have read a book that has completely contradicted my religion. Most times I will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie. Sometimes it is harder to ignore. I always try to forget and move forward with my life, as others should do.   Have you ever read the book The Catcher in the Rye? If you have, you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies. One example from the book would be when they kill some of the children. Most people, like myself, do not agree with this idea. They think that it is wrong. Again some people may try to get this book banned, but it is still a wonderful literature.   As you may have seen in the media lately, many people are trying to get the book Adventures of Huckleberry Finn removed from schools. Some people have found the book as offensive because it repeatedly refers to Native Americans by a more profound word. The law has not passed yet and has remained in schools. The law hasn't passed because it does not affect everyone. Some people may not find this offensive. Therefore it was not removed.   Removing offensive books from libraries is the exact same thing. Some people may find the books offensive while others may not. Removing the books from everyone's reach would be appalling. The book may only be offensive to one race or religion. Why not simply put a warning label for that race or religion? That would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands. Possibly it isn't that the books are offensive to a race or religion, maybe it is to an age group. If that is the problem then the librarians can put those books in the appropriate age section.   I have given reasons from my own experiences, other readings, and my observations in the media. I only hope that you consider my ideas. Do not remove the books from the shelf only because it is offensive to one person. Simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints. This would put the responsibility of being offended in their hands. Once again, I do not think that offensive materials should be removed from our libraries only censored to the people of whom it is offensive.
1577	4554	2	3	In @LOCATION1, the desire for censorship is strong among the diverse population to avoid being ostracized. While some censorship may be necessary, it can also be driven by a quest for attention. It becomes challenging to cater to the preferences of every group when multiple races seek censorship. This issue creates a cycle where one group's request for censorship may offend another, leading to a never-ending chain of demands.   However, when it comes to young children, censorship plays a crucial role in shaping their development. Exposing them to inappropriate content can influence their beliefs and values negatively, impacting their future. As individuals with varying perspectives, what one person perceives as wrong, another may view as acceptable. Criticizing someone's taste in movies or music ultimately questions their judgment, which is unfair.  In a world where interpretations vary widely, it is essential to acknowledge the diversity of opinions and exercise tolerance towards differing views. Without imposing excessive censorship, it is important to strike a balance that respects individual differences while safeguarding the well-being of the younger generation. Ultimately, fostering open-mindedness and understanding can help navigate the complexities surrounding censorship in a diverse society like @LOCATION1.
1578	4555	2	3	Books, music, movies, and magazines are all important sources of entertainment and education that should be accessible to everyone. While some people may find certain content offensive, it is not necessary to remove these materials from shelves or advertisements. Instead, there should be clear labeling or categorization to inform consumers about the content.  For example, radio stations play songs that touch on controversial topics like sex, drugs, and violence. While it may not be suitable for children, it is a reality that they will eventually come across these themes. Parents play a crucial role in monitoring and guiding their children's exposure to such content.  It is essential to recognize that everyone has different tastes and interests, and what may be offensive to one person may be enjoyable or thought-provoking to another. Therefore, censoring or removing materials based on individual sensitivities is not a practical solution.  In conclusion, rather than restricting access to certain forms of entertainment and study, it is more effective to provide appropriate information and guidance to help individuals make informed choices. This approach respects diversity of interests and opinions while also promoting responsible consumption of media.
1579	4556	2	3	I do not think libraries should have to censor the kinds of books, magazines, etc..., because people should have the right to read anything that they want. People do not necessarily like reading some things, but if it is important that they research something, or read a book for school then they need to have the resources available to them. Take the book, @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2, for example. In that book it describes kidnapping, and the rape of young girls. Certain classes would require you to read this book, even though no one would really want to read about that. Some people have different tastes in movies. Personally, I prefer horror movies (but not gory) because they get me thinking about what's going to happen next. Some people like the really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf, it would be harder for those people to find them. Certain people would find some things more offensive than other people. Who can say where it should stop? Movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion, but people from other religions would be unaffected by it. Just imagine watching @CAPS3 and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it. It would really offend people, while other people couldn't care less. Basically, I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something out there that you do not want to see, you just have to ignore it and leave it alone. It should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it.
1580	4557	2	3	Censorship in media has a long history, dating back to the early days of @ORGANIZATION1. While some may argue that censorship limits freedom of expression, there are valid reasons for censoring certain types of content in libraries.  When it comes to books, it is important to consider the audience. Books that contain extremely offensive material should not be readily available to children. Libraries should exercise caution when selecting books to ensure that they are appropriate for their patrons.  Similarly, music with explicit lyrics or themes should be separated from children's music sections in libraries. Parents may not want their children exposed to inappropriate language or content at a young age, so it is important to keep such material in a designated area.  Movies, like music, can have a strong visual impact on viewers. Libraries should consider placing movies with explicit content in the adult section, where they are less likely to be accessed by children. Censoring inappropriate language or gestures in movies can help to protect younger audiences.  Magazines pose a unique challenge when it comes to censorship. While it may be difficult to censor magazines entirely, libraries can take steps to remove or cover up offensive content. Librarians should be vigilant in monitoring the materials available to patrons and be willing to address any concerns that arise.  Overall, censorship in libraries is necessary to ensure that all patrons can access materials that are appropriate for their age and sensibilities. By taking steps to restrict access to offensive content, libraries can create a safe and welcoming environment for all visitors.
1581	4558	2	3	Yes, I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some people do not want to read about those things that they have less interest in. Materials like that can offend many people, so they should be removed from public shelves.  For example, someone may stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials by accident. They could take it home and begin reading it, only to realize that the material offends them. This can be concerning and may hurt the reputation of the library that held the book, potentially leading to a loss of customers.  Another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is the impact on children. If a young child were to come across a book or magazine with offensive content, it could have a negative influence on them. Parents would understandably be upset and would likely advocate for the removal of such materials to protect their children.  Religion is also a factor to consider when deciding what materials should be available. Some religions may prohibit the consumption of inappropriate content, and unknowingly encountering such materials could deeply offend individuals. This could deter people from reading certain books or visiting establishments where such materials are available.  In conclusion, the presence of offensive materials can lead to people feeling offended and upset. This is why it is important to remove such materials from public shelves to prevent harm and maintain a respectful environment for all individuals.
1582	4559	2	3	As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' As an author, she feels if she, and anyone else, has the right to take those uncensored books off the shelf, then there will be no books left. Depending on the person, some books may be offensive to some, but not all. I don't think that books should be able to be taken off the shelf by anyone because everyone's preference on books can be different. I believe that libraries should keep uncensored books in a certain section so children can easily be kept from seeing or reading inappropriate material at their age. And lastly, my own experience has led me to believe there should be a warning on certain books, saying not all the material could be appropriate.  People having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair for the people. The library is a quiet place, meant for people to come and read any type of book, do homework, study groups, and undergo research for practically any topic, and the number of books based on one person's opinion is unfair to everyone else who might enjoy that genre. Libraries and books were one of the main resources for researching before there was the internet and many people still prefer books to this day. I think the freedom of taking any book off the shelf would be endangering the process of learning and discovering.  To reduce the number of uncensored books being found by children or people who find them offensive, there should be a certain section in the library for just those books. That way, people who have an interest in those books can read them, but also they are kept away for those who don't want to read them. I think taking away any type of book is unfair to the people because everyone likes different genres of books, so having uncensored books in one section is fair to all. It would also be easier on parents knowing their children won't find books with material in them that they shouldn't be reading.  By disagreeing with the right to take any book off the shelf, I think each book with any uncensored material should be marked with some type of sticker on the binding, just as a warning. If one sees that sticker and knows they don't want books with that type of material, then they can easily return the book with no argument. I have had experience with trying to find a book for a school project, but later finding there was material in it that really wasn't appropriate for school. This made me have to find a new book for the project. I didn't want to completely take the book off the shelf and away from anyone else who wanted to read it, but a warning right then would have been easier in the situation.  In conclusion, I don't believe that certain materials should be taken off by just anyone. Taking away books would spark many disagreements because even though one person might find something offensive, doesn't mean every other person will. As mentioned before, putting the uncensored books in a different section and putting a sticker on the binding would give a clear warning to anyone not wanting to read uncensored books. I think every library needs to take into consideration the topics above to help people reduce the issue of people or children finding uncensored books in just any section.
1583	4560	2	3	I do not really read books. I think that offensive things should be taken off shelves because there could be a scene if they aren't. There are many people who will fight if they are truly offended, and it is not a pretty sight. Therefore, it is important for materials that may cause offense to be carefully considered and potentially removed from public consumption to avoid unnecessary conflicts.
1584	4561	2	3	I believe that as a library employee, it is important to ensure that the books available for young adults and children are appropriate and free from profanity, racism, and other inappropriate content. If a child were to bring home a book that was not suitable, it would be concerning and upsetting for parents. Therefore, I would conduct regular scans of all books in the library to ensure their appropriateness.  I also think that libraries should offer a wide range of inspiring books, cartoons, and baby books to cater to different age groups. It is essential to create a welcoming and safe environment for all library users, especially children. If a book is found to be inappropriate, I believe it should be removed from the shelves to protect young readers.  In addition, I suggest that libraries have dedicated rooms for different age groups, such as one for baby books and another for older children. This organization can make it easier for parents and children to find suitable reading materials. Overall, promoting a diverse and inspiring collection of books in libraries can encourage more people to read and enjoy the benefits of literature.
1585	4562	2	3	Censorship in libraries has always been a contentious issue, with individuals and governments having differing opinions on what should be deemed acceptable for public consumption. The power to censor materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines raises questions about who gets to decide what is deemed unacceptable. If one person has the right to censor something, then where does it end? Should the government have the authority to decide what we can and cannot read, listen to, or watch?  Literature and art are forms of expression that should not be censored, as they provide valuable insights into different perspectives and ideas. History has shown us that censorship can have negative effects on society and culture. For example, during the Nazi regime, many forms of artistic expression were banned, leading to a loss of creativity and innovation.  By allowing censorship, we run the risk of limiting our exposure to new and diverse ideas. It is important to protect our freedom to access a wide range of materials, as this is essential for intellectual growth and development. Ultimately, censorship stifles creativity and hinders progress. We must be vigilant in protecting our right to access information and ideas, as censorship can have far-reaching consequences for our society as a whole.
1586	4563	2	3	There has been a problem with censorship in libraries recently, with many items being removed due to being offensive. However, there are ways to handle offensive material without outright banning it. Warning labels can be used to alert parents and children to potentially offensive content, allowing parents to make informed decisions about what their children can access. Additionally, offensive material could be placed in a separate section of the library, where children would need parental supervision to access it. Ultimately, the decision of whether a child should be exposed to offensive material should be left to the parents, who can determine what is appropriate for their children. Censorship is not the solution; instead, providing information and restrictions can help manage potentially offensive material in libraries.
1587	4564	2	3	Everyone has their own opinions and arguments about books that may be offensive to some people. With a wide variety of genres available, it can be challenging to find the right book that interests us. Personally, I believe that books should not be removed from shelves, even if they offend someone.  Books cover a range of topics such as murders, romance, mysteries, and drugs, and they should be placed in separate sections within libraries. Removing books would infringe on individual freedom, as everyone has the right to access different types of literature.  While some may argue that certain books could negatively influence young children, it is the responsibility of adults to guide them and monitor their selections. Libraries offer a variety of materials, including movies and music, which should be organized into appropriate sections for different age groups.  It is important to recognize that people have diverse preferences, and what may offend one person may appeal to another. Restricting access to certain books due to individual sensitivities undermines the principles of freedom of choice and expression.  Libraries provide a tranquil environment that can have a positive impact on everyday life. Maintaining a wide selection of books without censorship allows individuals to explore various subjects and perspectives. Removing materials only restricts access for everyone.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries should be minimal to preserve individual freedoms. Rather than removing books, appropriate categorization and guidance for different age groups can ensure that everyone can access literature that interests them.
1588	4565	2	3	There are many arguments surrounding the censorship of offensive books and the impact they may have on children. Some believe that offensive material should be removed from shelves, while others argue that they should be available for those who wish to read them. Parents often blame offensive material for their children's inappropriate behavior, while others attribute it to poor parenting. It is evident that opinions on this topic vary greatly.  In my view, there are certain offensive materials that serve a purpose and should remain on shelves. These materials can educate children about the consequences of bad behavior and help them differentiate between right and wrong. On the other hand, materials that promote harmful behavior without justification should be removed as they can influence children negatively.  I believe that children should be exposed to offensive material that carries a meaningful message, such as raising awareness about past atrocities like slavery. These materials can help children develop empathy and a sense of social responsibility. However, materials that glorify violence or discrimination without a valid reason should not be accessible to children as they can lead to harmful consequences.  I have seen instances where individuals were influenced negatively by offensive material, leading them to engage in illegal activities. Conversely, there have been cases where individuals were positively impacted by books, prompting them to adopt better attitudes and behaviors. Personally, I have been influenced positively by reading materials that shed light on historical injustices, prompting me to treat others with kindness and respect.  In conclusion, the censorship of offensive materials should be approached with caution. While some materials can be educational and enlightening, others can have detrimental effects on individuals, especially children. It is important to discern between offensive materials that serve a purpose and those that are simply harmful, to ensure a positive impact on readers.
1589	4566	2	3	Removing books from the library because they are offensive is not a good idea. Instead of completely getting rid of these books, there should be age limits set for certain materials. By implementing age restrictions, we can protect children from inappropriate content while still preserving history and upholding freedom of speech. It is important to keep books accessible but ensure that they are only read by the appropriate audience. By doing so, we can maintain a balance between protecting young minds, preserving important historical accounts, and respecting the rights of authors to express themselves freely. Let's keep books available for those who can appreciate and understand their content, ensuring that valuable perspectives and stories are not lost.
1590	4567	2	3	Many people claim that certain books should be allowed on library shelves. They argue that these books, known as 'banned books,' can be offensive to some and should not be read. Librarians and public officials should not have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not.  In the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, the author uses offensive language that is essential to the setting of the novel. The novel provides a valuable insight into the history of the time period. Censoring such books would limit our understanding of the past.  Similarly, the novel, Catcher in the Rye, includes curse words and sexual references that are necessary to portray the characters and their development. Censoring these elements would dilute the authenticity of the story.  It is not just literature that faces censorship, but also music, movies, magazines, and video games. While some content may not be suitable for young children, it is the responsibility of parents to monitor what their children consume. Shielding patrons from real-life occurrences like violence and prejudice does not benefit anyone.  In conclusion, authors should not be restricted in their use of language or descriptions. Libraries should offer a diverse range of materials, leaving it up to individuals to choose what aligns with their personal boundaries. Censorship should not be imposed by librarians or public officials. Freedom of expression and access to information are essential in a democratic society.
1591	4568	2	3	Works of literature, regardless of their content, should be housed in library shelves. However, if certain material is considered offensive or crude, it can be placed in a restricted section where access requires permission. Literature holds persuasive power, so it is important to control who can access certain content. Authors write with various motives, such as profit or sharing viewpoints, and they desire their work to be read. Removing books entirely from libraries would hinder this goal. Even if a topic is considered crude, it may still be necessary for educational or research purposes. By restricting access to such material, libraries can cater to those who genuinely need it while preventing unnecessary exposure. Destroying literature due to offense or discomfort is futile. Instead, creating designated areas within libraries for controversial material ensures that those interested or in need can access it while respecting the sensibilities of others. It is crucial to preserve diverse literary works and provide access to them in a controlled manner to uphold the value and importance of literature in society.
1592	4569	2	3	Everyone has their own opinion about certain things in life. Maybe its politics; it could be a sports team. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. As for reading materials, the opinions could be endless and even painful to hear.   Opinions of some books and media type materials are biased. People could often be offended by the materials that can be accessed through a public library. For instance, let's say a grandmother and her grandchild are at the public library. The grandchild picks up a self-help book and starts to read. Later the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the grandchild was taught about life by herself and her parents. To the grandmother, @CAPS1 is offensive.   Through observation, I have noticed when a person picks up 'an offensive book' and reads a little of it, they tend to put it right back where they found it. It obviously isn't hard to do. So why should a book be taken out of a library when all you have to do is set it down and leave it? The same goes for music, movies, and magazines. If you don't like the music, don't listen to it. If you don't think it would be a 'nice' movie, don't go out and see it. If the magazine seems raunchy, don't buy it.   @PERSON1 said it well, that if we took all the offensive books off the shelf '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 statement is as true as any statement could be. What would be left? Everyone has an opinion and likely someone will always find it offensive. Therefore offensive books and media should be allowed to stay on the shelves.   Whether or not you find a book, movie, music, or magazine that is offensive, why fret over it? It's just easier to move on and forget it. Ignorance isn't all bad. Ultimately, it's important to remember that everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and it's best to simply let offensive materials be and move on if they don't align with your views.
1593	4570	2	3	Taking books off the shelves will not change anything children are just going to a different place to find the book, such as a bookstore or other libraries if they like it. If I see a book that I know I'm not supposed to read but find it interesting, I would still get it because children naturally explore. Books are meant to be read and looked at, so if there are restrictions, age verification should be required.  It's important to understand that children are naturally curious and should be encouraged to read and explore different types of literature. While some books may not be suitable for certain age groups, completely restricting access may not be the best solution. Children need to be exposed to the world around them, and books are a great way to do that.  Music, books, and magazines can all have a significant impact on children. Music, in particular, can resonate with them in ways that adults may not understand. It's important for parents to guide their children towards appropriate content, but also allow them to explore and learn on their own. Overly restricting children may only lead them to seek out forbidden material behind their parents' backs.  In conclusion, while it's important for parents to monitor their children's reading material and media consumption, it's also important to allow them some freedom to explore and learn on their own. Books, music, and magazines can all play a valuable role in a child's development, and it's important to strike a balance between protection and freedom.
1594	4571	2	3	When you go to the library, you have a lot of choices when it comes to reading books, watching movies, or listening to music. However, some of these materials may contain offensive words or abusive language that is not appropriate for children. Students should have the right to remove any offensive material from the library if they are offended or uncomfortable. This includes books, music, and movies that may contain inappropriate content.  Books are a common item found in libraries, and some of them may contain offensive language or themes. If a student finds something in a book that is offensive to them, they should have the right to have it removed from the library shelves. Similarly, music in the library should also be monitored for inappropriate content, and any songs containing offensive language or themes should be removed.  Movies in the library may also contain scenes that are not suitable for children, such as violence or abusive language. It is important to check the ratings of movies before watching them to ensure that they are appropriate for the audience. Any movies that contain content that is not suitable for students should not be available in the library.  In conclusion, libraries are valuable resources for learning and entertainment, but it is important to ensure that the materials available are appropriate for all users. Students should have the right to remove any books, music, or movies that contain offensive language or themes, as these materials may not be suitable for a school environment.
1595	4572	2	3	Alot of people are offeneded by things that are uncenored.  Some peopole think they should be censored and others think it should not.  Its all a matter of opinion.  I dont think anything should be censored because it takes away from the freedom of speech.     With censorship one can not fully express there self or opinion.  that is way nothing should be censored.  Censorship limits the ability of individuals to express themselves freely. It restricts the flow of information and hinders the exchange of ideas. Without censorship, people can openly discuss various topics without fear of reprisal. This allows for a more open and democratic society where diverse viewpoints can be shared and debated. Ultimately, the freedom of speech should be upheld to ensure that everyone has the right to express themselves without unnecessary restrictions.
1596	4573	2	3	I strongly disagree with the idea of removing any materials from public shelves. Books, magazines, and other materials are based on the author's and musician's experiences and observations. With a population of readers in society, the removal of books based on content would have a negative impact. Writers pour their observations and personal experiences into their work, so why take that away because of differing opinions on wording or content? Movies and music also face scrutiny, with some believing that certain genres or songs should not be exposed to children. However, artists have a right to their own opinions and connections with their audience. Removing materials based on minor issues diminishes the work of the artist and restricts the freedom of expression. It is important to respect the artistic process and allow individuals to make their own choices regarding the materials they consume. The diversity of perspectives and experiences in literature, film, and music enriches society and should not be censored.
1597	4574	2	3	Where it all boils down, censorship plays a vital role in shaping our society. From music to books to television, the need to filter out inappropriate content is crucial for the well-being of individuals, especially the younger generation. While some may argue that censorship limits freedom of expression, it is necessary to protect the values and morals of our society. By censoring out vulgar language, explicit content, and harmful messages, we can create a better environment for everyone. Let us strive to uphold censorship in a way that promotes positivity and respect, paving the way for a brighter tomorrow.
1598	4575	2	3	Censorship is a contentious issue with valid arguments on both sides. While some advocate for leaving all content untouched, others believe that offensive material should be restricted. However, determining what is too graphic for students can be subjective. Historical texts, even if deemed offensive, are crucial for learning from the past and preventing its repetition. Similarly, entertainment genres like horror should not be censored as they serve a purpose in stimulating creativity and imagination.  By censoring books, individuals are denied their right to freedom of speech, inhibiting expression and stifling potential ideas that could shape the world. Books are valuable sources of knowledge and insight, with the power to educate and inspire readers. Removing certain books from libraries could result in missed opportunities for learning and growth, as well as depriving future generations of valuable lessons from the past.  All books, regardless of content, should be kept accessible to readers. Students have the choice to engage with material that interests them, and each book has the potential to offer unique perspectives and lessons. The preservation of diverse literature ensures a rich tapestry of ideas and experiences for individuals to explore and learn from. Ultimately, books play a vital role in expanding knowledge and fostering critical thinking skills that are essential for personal and societal development.
1599	4576	2	3	Libraries contain a wealth of knowledge and entertainment in the form of books, magazines, and movies. Censoring these materials would deprive the public of valuable information and perspectives. The government may have various reasons for wanting to censor books, such as concerns about racism, radical ideas, or inappropriate content for children. However, censoring books would limit people's access to diverse ideas and stifle intellectual growth. Parents may want to shield their children from certain content, but censorship should not dictate what the public can or cannot read. Allowing censorship in libraries could hinder societal progress and innovation, as it limits the exchange of ideas and perspectives. In a society where everyone is meant to be equal, censorship could prevent individuals from reaching their full potential and hinder overall progress. Censorship should be avoided in libraries to ensure that people have the freedom to explore different viewpoints and expand their knowledge.
1600	4577	2	3	There are many things out in the 'material' world that people take offense to. No matter what, there are always those people who have to be against whatever it is, whether it be a book or a song or a movie. But they do not have any idea what they are doing when they bring up their 'rights'. If they get to say that they are offended by the certain media product, not only do they announce that they have the right to try to have it banned, but they are giving the people who do not find offense in the material to dish out the same. If they can pull something off the shelves that they 'find offense to', then everyone has a right to. Another thing is that they claim to find offense to the song or book or movie, but if it bothers them that bad, they should just not listen/read/watch what it is that they are feeling offends them. It would be that simple, just switch radio stations, or pick up another book, or watch a different movie. Another thing that the 'offended' people can try is having an open mind. It would make everything far less dramatic.  People that say that they have offense to whatever the material may be usually use the phrase 'it's offensive and i don't want my kid to stumble across it.' They say that they have a right to take whatever the 'offensive material' is off the shelf and keep it from the public. They couldn't be more right and stupid at the same time! If they have a right to take a certain thing off the shelf, then the writer of the song/book/movie can claim that he has been offended by some song/book/movie that the first person likes. Then it's just a free-for-all for everyone one to start taking everything off the shelves, one by one. Everyone has the same rights, and if the first offended person uses them to bring something down, then the creator has the right to do the exact same thing. So the government shouldn't let things be taken off of shelves, because if they take one down, they might as well take everything else down with it.  So, if someone finds offense to a song they hear on the radio, and they feel that strongly as to they want it removed from radios and anywhere that plays music, then they need help. When they find that song THAT offensive, then there is only one simple solution: turn the freaking radio to something else! Seriously, if someone finds the song offensive, then why are they going to sit there and listen to the entire song? Or if they find a book offensive. Would I sit and read an entire book if I don't like the content? Umm, no. If someone is that offended by whatever the material is, then they need to just do something else, because it's pretty ridiculous to waste more time attempting to ban the song or the book that to just change the radio or find a different book. So if you're going to complain about the song or book being out there, just take your attention to something else, because every song, book, or movie out there has a right to be sold.  On a light note, they could just have an open mind so that the song, or the book, or the movie can still be sold. They can try and read through the book to see if there is a reason that the author has written it this way. If they are conflicted by a movie, they should just watch it and test it to see if they really need to have it pulled off the shelf. Or if they are listening to the song, listen to it all the way through, or maybe even twice. The artist who sang the song might have been expressing themselves in a very deep way, and if someone pulls their song off the radio or where it is played, then someone could be offending them in return. Having an open mind will let the so-called 'offended person' see a whole other light being shown on why the 'offensive material' was even created. Then everything can stay ON the shelves!  People have opinions, and that is one hundred percent okay. But sometimes people think that their opinions are the only opinions that matter. If some people get offended (or think they get offended) by something, they would try to remove whatever it was from the nation's stores. But if they just sit back and think about it, then it would be okay. If they have a right to remove anything from the shelves, so does everyone. If that one song really, really offends they, they should just change the radio station and forget about it. And if they have open minds as to why the things are still 'out there', then all the songs, and all the books, and all the movies will still be on the shelves for people to buy. I do not approve of removing anything from stores just because one person feels like if they don't like it, then
1601	4578	2	3	"Controversy in the library arises when individuals are confronted with a vast array of books that may include some which are deemed offensive to certain readers. However, it is crucial for a public library to maintain a wide selection of books to cater to the diverse interests of its patrons. Removing books that offend a specific group of people would ultimately limit the choices available to others, as Katherine Paterson aptly pointed out, ""And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.""  Public libraries serve as a place for individuals to freely choose their reading materials. While some may find certain books offensive, it is essential to remember that everyone has different tastes and preferences. By preserving a variety of books, libraries can ensure that there is something for everyone. People have the autonomy to select books that align with their beliefs and values, and they are not compelled to read anything that they find objectionable.  In essence, libraries should strive to offer a broad spectrum of books to cater to the diverse needs of their readers. It is not feasible nor fair to eliminate books simply because they may offend a small segment of the population. The beauty of a library lies in its ability to provide a space where individuals can explore different perspectives and ideas through the written word. Ultimately, the presence of potentially offensive books should not deter people from utilizing the library as a valuable resource for learning and intellectual growth."
1602	4579	2	3	Personally, I believe that items that are found offensive should be left on the bookshelves. People who find them offensive can simply choose not to engage with them and move on with their lives. In educational settings like libraries, it is important to have a wide range of materials available for students to access for their projects and research. Removing offensive materials would limit students' access to important information they may need. Additionally, offensive materials can be found elsewhere, such as on the internet, so censoring libraries would not solve the issue. Libraries should have the freedom to choose the materials they provide, as long as they are properly categorized to ensure appropriate access for different age groups. Overall, if someone finds a book, movie, or any other material offensive, they can simply avoid it and choose not to engage with it. Offensiveness is subjective, and what may be offensive to one person may not be to another. It is important to respect diverse perspectives and allow individuals to make their own choices regarding the materials they engage with.
1603	4580	2	3	Yes, I do think it is important to have a variety of books available in bookstores, as everyone has different preferences and interests. People enjoy reading different genres and topics, so having a diverse selection can cater to a wider audience. While it may be important to consider the content of books in children's bookstores, for general bookstores, having a mix of materials can attract a larger customer base. Ultimately, the most crucial aspect is that people are reading and learning, regardless of the type of material they choose. The availability of movies, magazines, and music in bookstores can also add to the overall experience and appeal to a broader range of customers. In the end, what matters most is that people have access to a variety of reading materials and resources that spark their interest and curiosity.
1604	4581	2	3	@CAPS2, I agree that offensive content in books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves. It is important to consider the impact of media on individuals and how it can be hurtful or disrespectful. For example, portraying negative stereotypes about gender, sexual orientation, or disabilities can be very harmful and offensive to those who identify with these groups. Additionally, making fun of people who are less fortunate financially can also be hurtful and perpetuate harmful attitudes towards those in poverty. Overall, it is crucial to be mindful of the content we consume and ensure that it does not promote discrimination or hurt others. Removing offensive material from shelves is a step towards creating a more inclusive and respectful society.
1605	4582	2	3	Books, music, and movies are forms of art and entertainment that can help individuals understand the world around them. While some may argue that censoring these forms of media protects children from harmful content, it is essential to consider that exposure to different perspectives can help them navigate real-life situations better. By limiting access to these mediums, parents may unintentionally hinder their children's ability to develop critical thinking skills and empathy towards others. It is crucial to find a balance between protecting children and allowing them to explore different ideas and experiences through books, music, and movies. Ultimately, exposure to diverse forms of art can enhance a child's understanding of the world and prepare them for the challenges they may face in the future.
1606	4583	2	3	"Nobody should believe that we have the choice to take books off the shelves of a library. America is a free country, and we can write whatever we want. Everyone has the freedom of speech, whether expressed through music, books, or movies. If you come across a book that seems offensive, simply put it back on the shelf and move on.   Offensive content is prevalent in various forms of media, from jokes to literature. However, it is essential to remember that these are often meant for entertainment and not to be taken seriously. For instance, if a book like ""@CAPS1's your @CAPS2"" is not to your liking, simply set it aside and find something more suitable to read.   Allowing individuals to remove offensive material from libraries would ultimately limit the diversity of available literature. In contrast, movies have ratings to guide viewers on content suitability. There are designated sections for mature audiences, ensuring that inappropriate material is not easily accessible to young viewers.   In essence, censoring reading material sets a dangerous precedent. It is akin to suppressing diverse perspectives and limiting intellectual freedom. Instead of removing offensive content, individuals can exercise their freedom by choosing what to read or watch. By respecting differing viewpoints, we can uphold the principles of free speech and intellectual exploration."
1607	4584	2	3	"Censorship in libraries has become too strict, limiting access to important lessons about life for the next generation. Imagine going to a library as an adult and only being able to check out children's books, magazines, and music. This extreme scenario highlights the impact of censorship on knowledge and freedom. Without access to a wide range of materials, we risk losing valuable insights, creativity, and growth.  Censorship affects various forms of media, including music, magazines, and books. While some content may be deemed inappropriate for certain age groups, excessive censorship can hinder the exploration of diverse perspectives and ideas. For example, classic books like ""The Catcher in the Rye"" have been removed from libraries due to a few cuss words, depriving readers of important literary works.  In balancing the right to free speech with the need for censorship, it is crucial to consider age-appropriate restrictions. Adults should have access to uncensored materials, while teens may require some level of guidance on certain content. Children, on the other hand, may benefit from limited censorship to protect their innocence.  Ultimately, censorship should not restrict access to valuable information and artistic expression. By embracing a more open-minded approach to censorship in libraries, we can preserve knowledge, encourage critical thinking, and uphold our freedom of expression. Let us not let fear of controversial content overshadow the importance of intellectual freedom."
1608	4585	2	3	Yes, some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive. Yet they shouldn't be removed from shelves. Reason number one is: some people find offensive, others don't. Offensive material will always be out in the world. And finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. In following essay, I will explain thoroughly my reasons for an opinion as such. '@CAPS1 is one man's trash is another man's treasure.' This quote goes very well with the first reason: some people find offensive, others don't. People's views about everything could be significantly different. For example, a book about killing the could be offensive to someone with descent, meanwhile, a book filled with cursing could be offensive to a religious person. As you can see, 'offensive' is defined differently by different people. Offensive material will always be out in the world. Parents can't shelter their child from these things forever. At one point in their lives, children will learn offensive things and parents won't be able to do anything about that. Children have active minds that pick up on everything around them. If they learn from these offensive materials, then parents should teach them what is wrong and what is right. Finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. This reason ties in perfectly with the first. Parents can't decide what the parents of other children should do. They can only do something about what their children are doing. Therefore, my belief on censorship in libraries is non-existent for the following reasons: some people find offensive, others don't, offensive material will always be out in the world, and if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their own children from reading them and not the rest of the world. Thus, there should be no censorship in libraries.
1609	4586	2	3	Should we censor the materials in libraries? Some people believe that some of the books, magazines, and music in libraries are too vulgar and obscene. This could be a major problem if people are allowed to say what is too obscene to be put in a library. Katherine Paterson makes a great point by saying that if everyone was allowed to take books, magazines, and music that they find inappropriate off the shelves, there would be nothing left for us.  Books have been around for centuries. They are passed on, shared, and enjoyed by people all over the world. Books contain important information, stories, and tales of people's past times. Therefore, I do not believe that certain books should be banned from libraries. By taking away books in libraries, you are taking away the author's freedom of speech. Also, technology is rapidly advancing, and sometime in the future, I think libraries will become extinct. With all of the new devices we have today, people can just get their books online.  Magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world. Magazines are a great thing to read when you want to catch up on news, sports, or just other miscellaneous topics. With that said, magazines can also be bad for public libraries due to some of the explicit content. This is a reason on why some people would want to get rid of magazines from libraries, but I don't think they should be banned. By getting rid of magazines, you take away company's freedom of press, which is a major issue. Referring to the previous paragraph, technology is growing, and it is very easy to just go and look at news, sports, and other topics on the internet. That is why I do not think magazines should be taken out of libraries.  My final discussion is music. Music has also been around for many centuries and it has done many things. Music is something everyone can relate to. No matter who you are, you probably have some favorite band, music artist, or genre of music that you prefer. By saying this, I do not think music should be taken out of libraries either. Taking away music is like taking away humans natural culture. We all enjoy it, but have different versions that we enjoy. Therefore, I do not think it would be wise to take away music from libraries.  In conclusion, libraries are nothing without all the history, stories, news, and music that is inside of it. Censoring the libraries would not be a good idea and it would most likely upset many people. It is true that with technology that libraries may eventually become extinct. Until that happens, I hope they do not censor their materials.
1610	4587	2	3	Most people have been debating on whether or not to stop giving out books, movies, music, magazines, and so on, if they are disturbing other people's lives and offending them to the point of infuriation, thus disturbing the peace. However, it is important to consider that individuals have the right to choose what they read and listen to, and should not be punished for enjoying material that others may find disturbing. It is unfair to restrict access to certain content simply because it may not be to everyone's liking. Ultimately, people should be free to make their own choices and should not be judged or penalized for their preferences. In the end, what may be unsettling to some can be empowering to others, and diversity in content allows for personal growth and individual expression.
1611	4588	2	3	Most movies, magazines, music, and books are considered offensive to at least one person in this world. These materials often fall victim to censorship and are challenged daily to be banned, especially books. Mothers and fathers do have the right to prohibit such materials, but they do not have the right to ban them from all the world's children. Whatever the reasoning should be censorship is wrong. It restricts the freedom of the writer, the freedom of the reader, and, as Katherine Paterson well put it, would result in 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.'   In addition to the right of the writer to express themselves freely, every person over the age of eighteen has the right to read anything they wish. They are no longer under the commands of their legal guardians and in no way are under the command of other children's parents. Parents who prefer their own children not to see or listen to certain materials have the right to censor the materials away from their children, but they should not impose these restrictions on others.   Censorship limits the growth and learning experiences of both the audience and the writer. If every piece of offensive material were to be banned, the world would be devoid of diverse perspectives and creativity. It is crucial to uphold the freedom of speech and press to ensure a society where individuals can freely express themselves and engage with a variety of ideas. In conclusion, censorship is detrimental to intellectual freedom and should be avoided to preserve the richness of literature and art in society.
1612	4589	2	3	The library is a valuable resource, but there are certain materials that should not be openly accessible to the public. Censorship is necessary to protect individuals from harmful or offensive content that may be found in libraries. It is important to consider the potential impact of allowing unrestricted access to certain materials, especially when it comes to protecting vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. By implementing censorship measures, we can create a safer and more inclusive environment for all library patrons.
1613	4590	2	3	I say that they shouldn't take off books that are found offensive and here's why. The way a book is written should be respected, and if someone finds it offensive, they have the choice not to read it. Authors put effort into their work, and it's unfair to censor it based on one person's opinion. Additionally, a book might be valuable and engaging to many, despite being offensive to a few. Overall, removing books because of one person's offense limits freedom of expression and access to diverse perspectives.
1614	4591	2	3	All of the materials in a library should have to be checked out before anyone can take them out of the library. The librarian plays a crucial role in ensuring that materials are properly tracked and available for students. If materials are not checked out, it can cause confusion and inconvenience for both students and the librarian. Additionally, if materials are lost, the responsible party will have to pay for the item, and the availability of the material will be delayed for other students. Checking out materials from the library is essential for maintaining organization and accessibility for all library users.
1615	4592	2	3	If there was a book on a shelf that I found offensive, I would want it removed, but then again I wouldn't. Every one has there own opinions and there own view on things. Mine are different from every one elses'. I mean I @MONTH1 find it offensive, but how is everyone else going to see if it is or not, if you take it off the shelf? Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. What we do, believe in, or think is what makes us ourselves. Just because one person finds a book, music, or some movies offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will. Others might happen to like it even if you don't. Taking something away just because you think it is offensive, is like taking a little part of some one away. It's like the school making kids wear uniforms, it takes our individuality away. We all have to have some way to express ourselves and maybe the thing you find offensive, expresses some one else in some way. There is going to be a lot of things in life that people don't like, but can you really just get rid of it all? It does not work like that. You are not always going to have your way in life, but it's life and there is nothing you can do about it. Just because you don't like something or you find something offensive, doesn't mean you can just remove it or replace it. Life just goes as planned and there will be things that you don't like, but you can't change that. It is life and replacing or removing things won't make things easier. So if I found something offensive, I'd just ignore it and leave it there because is taking it off the shelve really going to help?
1616	4593	2	3	Yes, I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves of a library if they are deemed offensive. People should feel comfortable and safe when visiting a public library, and having potentially offensive material readily available can detract from that experience. This is especially important for children and seniors who may be more sensitive to such content. It is essential to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment in libraries by ensuring that the materials available are appropriate for all patrons. If someone finds a particular book or item offensive, they should have the ability to report it so that appropriate action can be taken. Ultimately, the goal is to create a welcoming and enriching space for all visitors to enjoy without encountering offensive or inappropriate material.
1617	4594	2	3	Books, Music, Movies, and Magazines have been censored to protect children, parents, and religious individuals from inappropriate content. Children's minds are impressionable and exposing them to violence, vulgar language, or inappropriate themes can have long-lasting effects. Parents have the right to control what their children are exposed to, whether it be in the car, at home, or in school. For individuals with strong religious beliefs, it is important to avoid content that goes against their values and beliefs. Censorship helps maintain a positive and respectful community environment, ensuring that individuals are not influenced in negative ways. It is crucial to promote a culture of respect and decency in all forms of media to shape a better future for society.
1618	4595	2	3	I believe that controversial books should be left on the shelves. People often take things too seriously, and what some find offensive, others may find interesting. It is important to remember that everyone has different perspectives and preferences. While some content may not be to everyone's liking, it is not fair to censor material based on individual sensitivities.   There have been instances where movies or books have been criticized for poking fun at certain groups or individuals. While this can be hurtful, it is important to recognize that everyone has the right to express themselves creatively, even if it may not resonate with everyone.   Magazines are another source of controversy, often judging people based on superficial factors like appearance or personal relationships. It is crucial for individuals to focus on themselves rather than constantly comparing themselves to others. By prioritizing self-care and self-improvement, we can reduce unnecessary conflicts and negativity in society. Ultimately, allowing diverse perspectives and opinions to exist can lead to a more inclusive and understanding community.
1619	4596	2	3	Different books are meant for different people, and while there may be restrictions on certain materials in public, it is essential to stay informed about global events. Understanding others requires looking beyond superficial appearances and getting to know their true character. Just as individuals have diverse preferences, creators develop content to cater to specific audiences, bringing joy and fulfillment to those who appreciate their work. In this ever-changing world, it is important to cherish what we have and find happiness in the present moment. Despite concerns about the end of the world, there is faith in the continuation of life beyond this realm. Embracing diversity and seeking understanding can lead to a more enriched and fulfilling existence.
1620	4597	2	3	Do you really want your kids to see bad images or read inappropriate content? It is important to teach them what is right and wrong, good or bad, to help them develop a clear conscience. You can follow simple actions like my aunt does by turning around magazines with inappropriate content at the checkout aisle. My parents also ensure that we are not exposed to inappropriate material on television by changing the channel or turning it off. They are cautious about the movies we watch and prefer books where we can imagine the content in our heads. It is essential to be mindful of what our children are exposed to and take steps to protect them from harmful influences.
1621	4598	2	3	To whom it may concern:  As time progresses in our ever-evolving world, the issue of censorship continues to be a topic of debate. Censorship often restricts content deemed 'offensive,' leading to limitations in what we can access. It appears that people nowadays are more easily offended, as media is now more censored than ever before. Personally, I am tired of having information withheld from me.  Most censorship in our country is governed by established programs, but I believe that individuals should have the right to choose what they want to see. Why should others dictate what is suitable for us to view? No one knows our preferences better than ourselves, so why shouldn't we have the freedom to decide?  If censorship does not govern our daily lives, why should it control the media we consume? People are bound to come across things they find unpleasant, but it ultimately depends on how they perceive it. Censorship infringes upon our rights as citizens to freely express ourselves. If something is not to our liking, we have the power to look away.  In conclusion, censorship in media should not be imposed on us without our consent. We should have the autonomy to choose what we want to see or hear, without external interference. Let us take control of our viewing experiences and exercise our right to free speech without unnecessary restrictions.
1622	4599	2	3	Should materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines be removed from the shelves if they are offensive? I don't think so, because it might not be offensive to everybody, it would be breaking the law, and it's not fair to the artists that created them. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, some may find certain content offensive while others do not. It is all subjective. Removing offensive materials would also violate the freedom of speech for artists. They should have the right to create whatever they want without censorship. Therefore, it is not fair to remove materials simply because they may be offensive to some individuals. Ultimately, everyone has the right to express themselves freely through their art without fear of censorship.
1623	4600	2	3	Censorship is a method used to limit inappropriate content, commonly seen in movies, video games, and television. In today's modern world, it is essential to consider implementing censorship in libraries as well. Just like how precautionary measures are taken on televisions, computers, and phones, libraries should also have a system in place to prevent children from accessing inappropriate materials.  A mandatory block should be in place in libraries, categorizing books by age group to restrict certain materials from reaching children who are not mature enough. It is important to acknowledge that some materials are not suitable for younger children, as they can heavily influence their thoughts and actions. By censoring what children read, view, or listen to in libraries, we can prevent them from being exposed to content that may not be age-appropriate.  In conclusion, implementing censorship in libraries is crucial to ensure that children have access to suitable materials for their age. By categorizing books and restricting certain content, we can create a safer environment for children to explore and enjoy reading without the risk of encountering inappropriate material.
1624	4601	2	3	Your beliefs are varied and complex, encompassing the idea that offensive media should not be removed from public consumption. You argue that the diverse beliefs and values held by individuals worldwide would result in a scarcity of available material if everything deemed offensive was eliminated. However, you also acknowledge the importance of protecting children from harmful content until they are old enough to make their own decisions. Parents play a crucial role in shaping their children's beliefs and values, guiding them on what is right and wrong based on their own moral compass. While some may find certain media content objectionable, others may not see any issue with it, leading to differing opinions on what should be censored. Ultimately, you emphasize the importance of personal responsibility in choosing what to engage with and respecting the beliefs of others, even if they differ from your own. In a world filled with diverse perspectives, it is essential to navigate these differences with understanding and tolerance.
1625	4602	2	3	How many of you out there absolutely love to read? Well, im going to be the first to confess that I do not prefer reading. Meanwhile, whether or not I prefer or differ readings of all types, I despise of any negative books. Censoring books is very important in today's lifestyle. One can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book. The cover oftens creates a vivid image and will usually promote a general idea. Let's look at some reasons why I feel that graphic or offensive books should be removed from book shelves.   What about the younger children who like to read? Although kids have a wild imaginaion, authors should't fill their heads with too many crazy ideas. First of all, kids now days either grab a book from the shelf and show interest very quickly, or automatically assume it's not for them. Furthermore, when a kid comes across a very offensive book it could hurt there feelings. Books are supposed to provide eductional information or be entertaining. They should not be dirty, nor discouraging towards certain people.   More importantly, how many different races are there here in @LOCATION1, or even all around the world? Many different races take interest in new books to learn new ways. When they come across books that are not teaching for all races or are actknowledging bad examples on thier kind, they feel discouraged. Whether it's a movie, magazine, books, or even a song, never should it be offensive towards anyone. When authors, publishers, song writers, or movie producers release these items, they do not think of the surroundings. Thier main concept is to entertain, but sometimes entertainment can be quite bashful.   Most importantly, if it contains sexual gestures it should be removed without debate. It's offensive to parents with young children who visit libraries. A public library which is open to all, should have sections for books, movies, cd's or magazines that are too vivid. There's a wide range of books laying around and one @MONTH1 come across one that is strongly offensive. I believe they should have a word in whether or not the book belongs on the shelf or not. I've not experienced it yet, but believe me it could happen anytime in our world today. If i was a parent I wouldn't encourage sexual magazines or books being shown at a public library.   Finally, during this debate older or more dirty minded people will counterargue this topic. Who says children should be allowed in the adult sections? Why are the discouraged people reading books that are setting bad examples? Those are some of the questions you will here for those who counter what I've written today. Adults should be allowed there own personal section for adultlike books, movies, or magazines. Kids under age should stick to searching for books in areas or fields that will provide interest for them.   In conclusion, those who counterargue could be on the winning side, however I still believe offensive books should be removed from shelves. Book lovers all around the world want enteratinment, but in good ways. The younger children of our time right now need to be influenced the proper way. Furthermore, there is no better way to help improve society than by removing offensive and noninfluential books from libraries. Lets make an inference and say, if we work to remove these offensive books, younger children will become more educated.
1626	4603	2	3	Reading our books and watching movies can have a strong impact on young minds, especially when it comes to scary and disturbing content. It is important for parents to monitor what their children are exposed to, ensuring that they consume age-appropriate material that teaches valuable lessons. Books and movies like those about historical figures like Hitler and stories like @CAPS1 can provide important lessons about the past and the consequences of mistreating others. By being mindful of the content our children are exposed to, we can help shape their understanding of important issues and promote empathy and respect towards others. Ultimately, as parents, it is our responsibility to guide our children towards consuming media that will educate and inspire them in a positive way.
1627	4604	2	3	What happened to everyone having the right to have freedom of knowledge? I do not believe that certain materials should be removed only for the reason that someone finds it 'offensive' or 'inappropriate'. Our youth have the right to access these materials. Kids should have that right because it allows more access to knowledge, it provides more realistic details about life, and keeps them from being shut out from the world around them. We cannot deprive children of that.   First of all, all children and students at schools all over should have access to more knowledge. If certain materials are censored and taken away, they cannot access that type of learning. What if a student wants to learn more about how government and politics work by reading an article. But then, the article is taken away because of one small comment in it. We cannot take away our aspiration to learn more about the world.  Secondly, it can give a more realistic image of a person, place, thing, or event. Explicit content can give children more details about how things really are in life. If that is taken away, they might have a different understanding of how things really are and have different expectations of things. This might have an emotional or psychological impact on them once they see the real world. They should be well informed of what life is like in further detail to avoid confusion once they get to that point.  Finally, they could be shut out from the world if everything is kept from them because of censorship. Being kept from that kind of knowledge can be an emotional strain. A friend of mine had parents that kept her from many things in the world around her, blinding her from what she should have known. As she got older, things became harder and harder for her. And now, she is afraid of many things out in the real world. This is all because her parents had used censorship to keep her from knowing what was important.  Our students should always have access to knowledge, details about life, and not be kept from knowing enough to have an understanding of things in our modern world. We cannot allow censorship to make such irrational decisions about what we do and do not have access to. And if it has such a negative impact on society and our youth, why isn't it censored?
1628	4605	2	3	Hello, I am Kristin, and I am here to discuss why certain magazines, music, and movies should be removed from public libraries. Magazines like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 often contain explicit content such as sex tips, which may not be suitable for young children. Parents should have the right to control what their children are exposed to, and topics like sex should be discussed at an appropriate age, such as during the teenage years.  Similarly, music with explicit lyrics, like rap songs containing profanity and sexual references, should not be readily available to young children in public libraries. Parents want their children to listen to music that promotes positive values and encourages wholesome activities.  When it comes to movies, parents should also be mindful of the content and ensure that it is age-appropriate for their children. Movies rated above a certain threshold should be monitored, and children should only watch them under parental supervision.  In conclusion, it is essential to consider the appropriateness of the materials available in public libraries for young audiences. Parents should have the ability to regulate what their children are exposed to in order to promote a safe and healthy environment for their development.
1629	4606	2	3	I believe that materials on the library shelf belong to everyone and should be returned to their rightful spot after use. When it comes to books, I take the time to observe them before borrowing, ensuring I am interested in the content. While not a fast reader, I enjoy following the story from beginning to end. Magazines, being expensive and hard to replace, I tend to avoid borrowing. Movies, if available, could potentially lead to ideas being taken, making them a risky choice for libraries. Music, however, is a passion for many, and I appreciate listening to different genres to potentially inspire my own musical pursuits. It is crucial to return items to the library, as failing to do so can lead to consequences and a loss of trust in the community.
1630	4607	2	3	limit access to certain information. It is important for individuals to have the freedom to choose what they want to read and educate themselves on. Libraries play a crucial role in providing access to a wide range of information and knowledge, and it is up to the individual to decide what they want to explore. Censorship can hinder intellectual freedom and limit the opportunity for individuals to learn and grow. Therefore, libraries should not take on the responsibility of censoring material, but rather provide a diverse range of resources for individuals to explore and learn from.
1631	4608	2	3	Librarys are filled with a variety of materials, including books on different subjects like history, science, and art. While some may find certain books offensive, they are there to educate rather than offend. Censorship should only be implemented for young audiences, as adults have the right to make their own choices about what they read, listen to, or watch. It is important to remember that everyone has different perspectives and opinions, so what may be offensive to one person may not be to another.  No individual should have the authority to remove materials from a library simply because they find them offensive. Diversity in viewpoints and access to information are essential for personal growth and understanding. While censorship may be necessary to some extent, it should not limit our ability to explore different ideas and perspectives. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide what they engage with and how they interpret it. We should embrace the opportunity to learn from a wide range of sources, both within and outside of traditional educational settings.
1632	4609	2	3	Libraries are essential places of learning, providing access to a wide range of materials for educational, cultural, and entertainment purposes. While some may argue for censorship of certain materials, it is important to recognize the value of diverse perspectives and information in a library setting. Censoring materials limits the opportunity for individuals to explore new ideas and gain knowledge on various topics. Libraries should strive to maintain an open access to information, ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to learn and grow. By embracing a wide range of materials, libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources for education and exploration.
1633	4610	2	3	Some people believe that certain materials in libraries should be removed due to their potentially offensive nature. However, it is important to consider that what one person finds offensive, another may not. Families have varying levels of tolerance for different forms of media, such as movies, music, and books. By removing items from library shelves, individuals may be limited in their ability to access materials that align with their preferences. This could ultimately result in a loss of service for the library as patrons seek out establishments that offer a wider range of content. Therefore, it is crucial to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and allow for diverse perspectives and preferences to be represented in library collections.
1634	4611	2	3	What if one day you took a trip to the library, and you came across a book that was offensive? Would you ask for it to be taken off the shelf or just ignore it? Every year tons of people visit libraries in search of a good book, through acts of observations and personal appeal. Everyone has different choices in the types of books they'd like to read, with that comes offensive and non-offensive material. Being a teen, I've had some experience visiting the library where things come across as offensive to me more easily than others but like many, I choose to ignore it. Reasons for ignoring it are rather simple; everyone has different takes on things in which they've gathered since birth as well as personal life experiences. Books have different tones whether it's on life, politics, or worldly issues that make different people feel different ways. If a book were to offend someone and it was taken out of a library due to just that, there would be no real need for a library.
1635	4612	2	3	In the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1', books are outlawed. In such a society, owning a book would result in receiving a punishment. Without books, @CAPS2 people turned to electronics for entertainment. The society as a whole had lost @CAPS2 human emotions and became submissive to the government. @CAPS4 led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition. Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out, @CAPS2 important works would be thrown away.  A recent debate has arisen over @PERSON1's 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 book is set in the @LOCATION3 during the time of slavery. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON4 befriends a black man, @PERSON6, and shares @CAPS2 experiences with him along the @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the @LOCATION3 during @CAPS4 time period. He was the first author to do @CAPS4. Because he wrote it in @CAPS4 way, the book contains the n-word multiple times. @CAPS4 word is not acceptable today, and therefore @CAPS2 people take offense to his work. However, @CAPS4 book plays a major role in the @CAPS5 cannon. @PERSON1's work was written in a new and breakthrough method. If someone were to remove @CAPS4 work off of the shelves of libraries, he would remove one of the most important pieces of @CAPS5 literature.  '@ORGANIZATION2' by @PERSON3 is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison. During his time at @LOCATION2, he discovers that he is a homosexual. He falls in love with a man named @PERSON5 and begins to have sexual relationships with @CAPS2 of the men in his cell. These relationships are described in detail. If one were to read the surface of the book, he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison. However, @CAPS4 is not the case. @PERSON3 struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life. He also had problems with his parents and brother. In '@PERSON2', he wrote about his own feelings through his characters. @CAPS4 story is not about sex, but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people. If @CAPS4 book were to be removed from libraries, @CAPS2 people would miss a story that they might connect with.  Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question. What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike? The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences. Media helps to enlighten, persuade, and educate people about important issues. While some works @MONTH1 have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning. A society that censors its media risks losing valuable insights and perspectives, hindering intellectual growth and understanding. It is essential to preserve diverse voices and narratives, even if they may be uncomfortable or controversial, in order to foster a richer and more informed society.
1636	4613	2	3	To the newspaper edits,Should books, music, movies, magazines, and other reading materials, be removed if the materials are view to be offensive? I do not think that is a good idea. Reasons why is that just like what @PERSON1 an Author (in the last sentence) said if we remove books from shelfs there will be 'no more books for any of us to read'. That is true because I am sure there are lots of books that @MONTH1 be offensive to people but maybe the readers who get offended do not understand the materials that they read. For example the topic of liking the same gender has become a problem, maybe the reader who gets offended about those types of topics just do not understand it or @MONTH1 not get it.  Another reason why could be because we are in America, and the last time I checked we have the free will to write and talk about what we want to talk or write about. It's fair to say that because well, it is true we as people of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 just have the 'right' to say what they want to say or what is on their mind. And just because the topic of the reading material offends them does not mean you can take away the writer's material. Doing that is like putting duct tape on the writer's mouth. If the reader has the right to say what in on your mind then what is the meaning of being free to write what you wish to write. If you can see where I am coming from it takes a lot not to talk to a teacher or someone in a higher position from the reader, about something you do not understand and they tell you 'you can not ask me that' or 'do not say a thing to me' it is the same if you remove the book from the writer.  Other reasons why to say no to removing the reading material could be because as humans we always are willing to learn something new, by @CAPS3. When a person reads they always learn something new. It could be a new event, a place unknown, grammar, the different styles of writing, or know more about the topic. @CAPS3 in books, music, movies, and magazines is a good way to learn new things it is fun and what is better than @CAPS3 something fun? can not think of anything? well it is because @CAPS3 has a big role in our lives.  Another reason why not to remove the reading materials is because it @MONTH1 make other reads feel like they are not alone. Like a true story about a break up, of a family or a relationship. Or it could be a story based on something that happening to the writer like about a death of a loved @CAPS5 and how to deal with it. Just picture it two @CAPS4 girls, @CAPS5 is mad at herself  and at the world and hates a tape about angles. While the other @CAPS4 girl just lost her grandmother and listening to the tape about angles makes her feel together or whole, knowing that her loved @CAPS5 is in a good place. Now think about it the second girl would start to be like the first girl sad, alone, or left out. When you take away a material like a small tape from the libraries' shelf you take away a feeling with it not only from the writer but from the readers too.  Finally the last reason why not to remove the materials from the shelves is because if you remove the material from the shelf it is likely that the topic is still there. It could be on the radio, on the internet, on the @ORGANIZATION1 and what can you do delete all of that? it is not reality. And if that could even happening which is unlikely that it would people can still talk. And there is nothing that can stop people from talking. 'you can lock a bird in a cage but it still wants to fly away' or 'you can tell a cat or a dog not to run away but when you turn away it is gone' this are examples of what I am trying to say, you can try to remove books, music, magazines, but the topic you don't like is still out there.  I understand that reading some materials @MONTH1 offend you but it's better to just turn your head around and move on. The reader @MONTH1 not like the topic but others would and that's always good to think about. And maybe the problem is that the reader does not get the topic then maybe you should read it to learn from it, and to give it a chance you @MONTH1 end up liking it or understanding it better. Books, music, movies, magazines there is a reason why they are out there and it could teach you something new so why not learn it.
1637	4614	2	3	Offensive articles and or movies and magazines etc should not be pulled from shelves. If individuals choose to read and/or watch the material that is their personal choice. There should be an age limit for the material. If individuals find the material offensive they should turn their back and not read or watch the programs. If the items are in a public library they should be kept in a separate area for those who wish to view them. They should not be kept in the open for small children or for people who do not wish to see them. Historic material such as diaries and accounts of events should be held at federal libraries. Having these documents in a public library could interest small children in reading things that are inappropriate for them. Certain items such as magazines, and newspapers and books, some of these items are held at a public level. Government affiliated documents should be held at a federal library such as parts of history and important documents. High profile documents such as the constitution should be held in high security areas. In conclusion, people who wish to view certain material should be able to do so as I had previously stated. They should not be out in the open for small children. It should be held in a separate area. If people do not wish to view this material they simply do not go in that area. Having an age limit in place for this material is key so that small children do not view it and get the wrong message. Having certain documents in public and certain documents in federal libraries is a factor. Certain historical documents and other items that are affiliated with the government should be held at a federal level as well as important documents related to the country. These documents should be high profile secure areas.
1638	4615	2	3	Communities have many different types of people that live in them. Certain groups of people find some things offensive while others find them totally normal. Some of these things cause conflict. A library, for example, is one place you may find some of these conflicts.  Most libraries are open to the public. Therefore, many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books, movies, magazines, and music. Having many different kinds of people sharing this material, the libraries must try to have material to please everyone. This is where the conflict begins. While trying to please everyone, some people may find some of the material offensive. Now for the big question: Should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves altogether?  The answer to this big question is no. Libraries must have many different kinds of materials in them to please everyone in the community. People are different and believe in different things. Just because one person finds some type of material offensive doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, things such as religion. Someone may find a book on a type of religion and find it very offensive, but others may strongly believe in that religion. Just because one person takes it offensively, doesn't mean those who don't should have it taken away from them.  Libraries are for all kinds of people. Just because one person finds the material offensive, doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else. If libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves, there would be no material left. People believe in different things. That is the way it always has been and more than likely, the way it will always be. In conclusion, libraries should strive to provide a diverse range of materials to cater to the varied preferences and beliefs of their community members, rather than censoring content based on the sensitivities of a few individuals.
1639	4616	2	3	I think the censorship in libraries is quite abominable. I believe there should be no censorship, as it should be up to the parents to decide what children can and cannot watch. If something is found offensive, then simply don't watch it. If you don't want your children to see anything offensive or inappropriate, then don't let them.   What I find offensive is when something is removed from shelves. I think older children, perhaps those aged 12 and up, should be able to watch and listen to what they want. What some people find offensive may not be offensive to others, so removing a particular movie or song from libraries is unfair.   Books, movies, or music that contain curse words are a part of life, as most adults curse. Removing these materials from libraries takes away access for both adults and children. It should be up to parents to decide when their children are exposed to such content. Additionally, using offensive language is a part of our history, reflecting the language of different time periods.   Banning books or censoring materials will not protect adolescents from hearing offensive language. They have the right to access this content if they choose, and parents have the right to monitor their children's exposure to it. Singling out specific books or songs for censorship only serves to pique curiosity and make them more appealing to young audiences.   In conclusion, we have the right to access and consume these materials. Restricting our access to them infringes upon our freedom and free will. Parents should take responsibility for monitoring what their children read and listen to, rather than imposing blanket censorship on certain materials.
1640	4617	2	3	Everyone has found something offensive throughout their life. However, many people find different things offensive than others. There are many different topics that people are offended of whether it is race, religion, gender, etc.   If there is a book that you find offensive in a public library I do not think it should be removed. It is like removing something just because one person does not like it. That would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library. It may be offensive to you but to another person it may not be. There are many reasons that book could be in the library. It could help someone write a paper, to learn about a subject, or do some research on a topic. If all the books, music, magazines, movies or any other item in a library was to be removed if one person found it offensive then there would hardly be any books at all left in the library.  I think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds it offensive. It could be offensive to them but not to someone else. If one person finds a book offensive and another person doesn't then it is not fair to the one that isn't offened to not be able to check it out.  If the concern is if children check it out what they might be learning from it then that would be the parents fault for not supervising what their children are checking out. The child may learn something new from the book.  Even if it is offensive you could still learn something from the book, movie, magazine, music, etc. If you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic. It may help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of.  One condition on why a book, movie, magazine, music, etc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it. If everyone that came to that library was offended by it then it may be in the library's best interest to get rid of that book.  The main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library. The author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it. If one person does not like it then they should simply not check the item out. If that was what happened every time someone found something offensive in a library there would be hardly anything to check out. Even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person.
1641	4618	2	3	To @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 and I am from @ORGANIZATION2. I agree with the idea of removing books, music, movies, and magazines that promote violence from shelves. Exposure to such content can contribute to aggressive behavior in children, teens, and adults. This negative influence can lead to conflicts, fights, and a general lack of peace in society. By replacing these harmful materials with educational and positive content, we can help reduce aggression and promote a more peaceful world. Encouraging individuals to engage with materials that teach valuable lessons and provide useful information can have a significant impact on their development. It is essential to prioritize learning and personal growth in order to guide young people towards a brighter and more constructive future. By focusing on educational resources and positive media, we can empower individuals to make better choices and contribute to a more harmonious society.
1642	4619	2	3	Materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. Libraries are meant to be welcoming spaces for all individuals, providing access to information and resources that enrich and educate. When patrons encounter materials that are offensive or harmful, it can create a negative experience and hinder their ability to fully utilize the library's offerings.  For parents with children, ensuring that libraries maintain a safe and appropriate environment is crucial. No parent wants their child exposed to inappropriate content, such as pornography or offensive material. By removing offensive materials from library shelves, we can create a more positive and supportive environment for all patrons, including children.  Ultimately, the goal of a library is to serve the community by providing access to a wide range of materials that are informative, engaging, and respectful. By removing offensive materials, we can ensure that the library remains a place where people feel comfortable, supported, and able to explore and learn without fear of encountering harmful or offensive content. Let's work together to create a library that is truly inclusive and beneficial for all.
1643	4620	2	3	I believe censorship is a good thing; to an extent. I think that censorship should be based on age groups and the permission of parents or guardians. Children aged twelve and under should have access to censored materials, while those aged thirteen and above should be able to access uncensored products.   Some people argue against censorship, stating that it detracts from the full experience of a particular piece of media. For example, censored song lyrics on a radio station may not convey the artist's intended message. However, there are instances where censorship is necessary, such as in graphic romance novels that contain explicit sexual content.   Magazines vary in their censorship practices depending on the content. Political magazines may withhold certain facts for strategic reasons, while hunting or fishing magazines may include detailed information on weapons and techniques without censorship.   Movies are also subject to censorship, with different channels and ratings dictating the level of censorship. Channels like @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS3 censor movies, while movie-specific channels like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS4 typically do not.   In conclusion, censorship should be tailored to the age group of the consumer. Younger children may require censored materials, while older teenagers and adults should have the freedom to access uncensored content with appropriate discretion. Ultimately, censorship serves a valuable purpose in regulating the type of content available to different age groups.
1644	4621	2	3	Books, music, and movies are essential for children, offering them a wide range of knowledge and entertainment. While some parents may be wary of uncensored materials, it is ultimately their responsibility to monitor and guide their children's choices. Libraries play a crucial role in providing access to diverse materials, and their censorship policies help maintain a safe environment for all users. It is impossible to eliminate all potentially offensive content, as people have different sensitivities and cultural backgrounds. Instead of banning materials, it is more effective to educate children on what is appropriate for them to read or watch. By staying vigilant and actively supervising their children's media consumption, parents can ensure that they are exposed to age-appropriate content. Libraries should continue to uphold their censorship standards while providing a wide selection of materials for all audiences. Through a combination of parental guidance and library regulations, children can enjoy the benefits of books, music, and movies while avoiding harmful or inappropriate content.
1645	4622	2	3	I think there should be censorship in libraries for those who don't like or are not comfortable with what is on the shelf. A public library is visited by children of all ages, sizes, and races. If I took my child or children to a public library, I don't want to worry about whether or not my child reads or views something they shouldn't or don't like. It is important for libraries to consider the diverse needs and preferences of their patrons, especially when it comes to materials that may be considered inappropriate or offensive. By implementing some form of censorship, libraries can create a more welcoming and safe environment for all visitors, ensuring that everyone can enjoy the resources and services offered without encountering material that may be unsuitable for their age or beliefs. Ultimately, censorship in libraries can help promote a positive and inclusive experience for all individuals who visit these public spaces.
1646	4623	2	3	In my lifetime, I have visited numerous libraries and come across a wide range of book categories such as comedy, fiction, non-fiction, drama, and more. While libraries offer a wealth of knowledge and entertainment, there are also some materials that may not be suitable for all audiences, especially minors.  Movies today often contain explicit content, including sexual scenes and false representations of reality. This can be concerning for parents who want to protect their children from inappropriate content. However, libraries also offer educational and informative films such as documentaries, historical films, and biographies that can provide valuable insights.  Magazines found in libraries can sometimes feature controversial or explicit content, which may not be suitable for all readers. While some magazines contain valuable information, others may not be appropriate for young audiences.  Similarly, music CDs available in libraries may contain explicit language or content that may not be suitable for all listeners. Despite this, there are also genres like gospel, jazz, and classical music that offer enjoyable and wholesome listening experiences.  In conclusion, while libraries offer a wide variety of materials for all audiences, there is a need for caution in selecting and curating content to ensure that it is appropriate for all users. Libraries should consider the age and sensitivity of their patrons when deciding which materials to make available, removing any potentially offensive or harmful content to create a safe and welcoming environment for all visitors.
1647	4624	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic with conflicting views. One side believes in censorship to remove offensive material, while the other side supports free speech and keeping all literary works in libraries. However, censorship in libraries should not be implemented due to the right to free speech, the importance of preserving true meanings and expressions, and the opportunity for interested readers to access the original work. The right to free speech is a fundamental right that should not be taken away, even if some find certain material offensive. Censorship can also dilute the true messages and expressions that authors intend to convey in their works. For example, censoring a novel like 'The Catcher in the Rye' would diminish the impact of the author's words. Additionally, censorship restricts access to literature for interested readers, depriving them of the chance to engage with the original work. It is clear that censorship in libraries is unjust and would have negative consequences. It is crucial to uphold free speech, preserve the integrity of literary works, and ensure that readers have the opportunity to explore a diverse range of materials. Ultimately, censorship in libraries should be avoided to protect the rights of authors and readers alike.
1648	4625	2	3	Dear newspaper editor,  Pulling materials from libraries due to perceived offensiveness or obscenity is a weak and cowardly move. The world is far from perfect, and only a small percentage of people truly accept this reality. If individuals are uncomfortable with certain content, they should simply avoid it and stick to what they find appropriate. Asking others to move if they were there first is a reasonable solution.  While the world has positives like the United Nations and NATO, the unrealistic pursuit of perfection leads to censorship and a homogenized society. I refuse to let this mindset take hold, and I urge others to do the same.  Yours sincerely, [Your Name]
1649	4626	2	3	Reading is a personal choice that should not be restricted by censorship in libraries. Everyone has the right to choose what they want to read, and if a book is offensive to some, they can simply choose not to read it. Removing books from libraries limits the options for all readers and goes against the principle of intellectual freedom. It is important to respect the diverse preferences of readers and allow them to make their own choices when it comes to selecting books. Let's embrace the variety of books available and promote a culture of inclusivity and open-mindedness in our libraries.
1650	4627	2	3	I do believe that certain books, music, movies, and other media should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found to be offensive. We do not need any more reasons for people to judge someone based on something they read. If the media is offensive, then someone's feelings will get hurt. I remember reading a book that had offensive content about homeless people, which made me feel bad for even reading it. It changed the way some people thought about them, leading to negative attitudes. Offensive music should also be restricted as it can hurt someone's feelings without them realizing it. Magazines should be carefully reviewed for inappropriate content to protect everyone. Libraries should consider only offering family-oriented movies to prevent harm to viewers, especially children. In conclusion, libraries must be cautious in their media choices to limit offensive content and prevent harm to their patrons.
1651	4628	2	3	Should there be censorship in libraries? Many people will answer this question differently. I feel there should be absolutely no censorship in libraries. Allowing censorship in libraries is an intrusion of our rights. It contradicts freedom of the press. If someone wants their opinion to be read, they should have that right. I also feel censorship in libraries goes against freedom of speech. What is writing, but written speech? If someone wants to say something, they should be able to say it. If a mute person wants to get a point out, they should be able to do so by writing. What some people may consider offensive, others may not. If someone finds it offensive, they should simply not read it. Freedom of expression is a fundamental right that should be protected in libraries, allowing individuals to access a wide range of information and ideas without restrictions. Libraries should serve as a place for open access to knowledge and diverse perspectives, promoting intellectual freedom and fostering critical thinking skills. Therefore, censorship in libraries should be strongly opposed to uphold these core values of democracy and individual liberty.
1652	4629	2	3	'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. This quote emphasizes the danger of allowing individuals to dictate what is offensive and what should be censored in libraries. Books serve various purposes, from entertainment to education, and different people have different interpretations of the content. It is unfair to restrict access to books based on the opinions of a few. While some may find certain books offensive, others may find them valuable and insightful. The diversity of opinions and perspectives in society makes it impossible to please everyone. Therefore, it is essential to maintain freedom of access to books in libraries without censorship. Ultimately, books are just books, and individuals should have the autonomy to choose what they want to read without interference.
1653	4630	2	3	Have you ever walked into a library and saw a book that you wouldn't want your child or any young one to pick up and read? There are several books in the library that young children should not read. I don't believe that a certain book should be removed from the library because it is offensive to some or not suitable for children, but there are a few things that can be done to keep those books away from your kids or any child.   One way to keep an offensive book out of your child's or any other child's hands is to move those books to a higher shelf. This will keep those books out of children's sight and reach, preventing them from reading them.   Another possibility to keep offensive books out of your child's or any child's hands is to designate a certain area for those books in the library. By creating a designated area, you can tell your child to stay out of that area and keep a watch on them to ensure they don't access those books.   The final option is to put an age limit on those books, preventing children from being able to check them out and read them. This age restriction would ensure that children have to reach a certain age before they can access those books.   These are a few possibilities that could be used to keep offensive books out of children's hands, preventing them from reading material that is deemed inappropriate.
1654	4631	2	3	Many people have different views on censorship. Some believe that certain media contain inappropriate subject matter and should be restricted, while others advocate for freedom of speech. It is essential to recognize that individuals have varying beliefs and interests, and what may be unsuitable for one person could be valuable to another. While some material may not serve a constructive purpose and should be removed, there is a fine line to consider. It is crucial to strike a balance between protecting individuals, especially children, from harmful content and respecting the diversity of perspectives and interests. In essence, censorship should be applied judiciously to ensure that media serve a purpose and contribute positively to society.
1655	4632	2	3	@CAPS1 has changed the way we view entertainment, with books, movies, and music now filled with questionable content. It is important for libraries to exercise caution in what they offer to children, ensuring that materials are appropriate for their age. Parents should also be mindful of what their children are exposed to, whether it be through books, movies, or music. While it is not necessary to remove certain materials from library shelves, individuals should be selective in their choices and use resources like the internet to research content before engaging with it. Enjoy entertainment, but do so responsibly.
1656	4633	2	3	Books, magazines, and music that contain offensive material should be removed from shelves to prevent negative influences on children and adults. These forms of media can shape individuals' imaginations and perceptions, leading them down harmful paths. Pornographic or inappropriate content in books, magazines, and music should not be readily available for consumption. Such materials can contribute to destructive behaviors and impact relationships with loved ones. It is essential to prioritize resources that support mental well-being and personal growth. Removing detrimental content from circulation can help individuals make healthier choices and avoid potential harm. In conclusion, eliminating unhelpful books, magazines, and music is crucial for promoting a positive and productive society.
1657	4634	2	3	I do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. People should be able to decide for themselves if they can or cannot access certain materials, as what is offensive can vary greatly from person to person. It is important to consider individual perspectives and the right to freedom of speech. Censorship would limit access to valuable knowledge and cultural expressions, ultimately impacting society as a whole. It is essential to respect differing opinions and allow for a diverse range of materials to be available for those who choose to engage with them. In conclusion, the shelves of libraries should remain full to uphold the principles of freedom of speech and intellectual freedom.
1658	4635	2	3	Censorship in libraries can be seen as a necessary measure in some cases. While it is important for people who enjoy reading to have access to a wide range of books, there are instances where certain content may be deemed offensive to some individuals. For example, books that depict historically sensitive topics like slavery or mistreatment of indigenous people can be upsetting to some readers.  In my personal experience, I once came across a book in a library that contained a racial slur, which I found offensive. It made me realize that what one person may find offensive, another may not. This highlights the subjective nature of censorship and how different individuals have varying sensitivities to certain content.  Ultimately, it is impossible to please everyone when it comes to what is considered offensive. If all potentially offensive material were to be removed, there would be a significant reduction in the variety of books, movies, and other forms of media available to the public. It is important to strike a balance between providing access to diverse content while also considering the potential impact on sensitive readers.
1659	4636	2	3	People should have the right to choose what they read, watch, and listen to without censorship. Banning offensive materials will not solve the issue of people being offensive towards others; it will only hide it. Everyone has different opinions on what is offensive, so trying to remove all offensive content would leave very little left in libraries. It is important to respect individuals' rights to make their own decisions about what they consume, even if others may find it offensive. Censorship limits freedom and does not address the root of the problem. Let people decide for themselves what is appropriate for them.
1660	4637	2	3	Censorship should not be used to remove certain books from shelves, as there are many offensive things in the world that children will eventually come across. Gangs, politics, race issues, and problems in schools are all prevalent in society and cannot be shielded from children forever. Inner cities have gang graffiti with offensive language, politics often involve negative campaigning, race tensions are ongoing, and schools have their own set of issues like swearing and bullying. It is important to prepare children for the realities of the world by allowing them to explore these topics through books rather than sheltering them completely. By educating children about these issues, they can better navigate and understand the world around them.
1661	4638	2	3	In the book Fahrenheit 451, all books are burned regardless of their content, leading to a society filled with sadness and depression. However, books are essential to our lives for learning, entertainment, and expanding our knowledge. While some censorship may be necessary to prevent harm or offense, excessive censorship can lead to the loss of valuable information and ideas.   Music, movies, and magazines also play important roles in our lives, providing us with different forms of expression and entertainment. Censorship should be used judiciously in libraries to protect individuals from harmful content without limiting their access to diverse perspectives.   As author Katherine Paterson points out, allowing individuals to remove books that offend them could eventually lead to the disappearance of all books. It is impossible to please everyone, and attempting to do so by censoring everything would only result in a world devoid of valuable literature and knowledge.   In conclusion, while some censorship may be necessary to protect individuals, it is important to strike a balance between safeguarding against harm and preserving the freedom of expression and access to diverse ideas. Let us strive to create a world where differing viewpoints can coexist without the fear of censorship erasing valuable contributions to literature and culture.
1662	4639	2	3	Censorship is often viewed as a way to shield people from offensive content, whether it be in books, movies, or other forms of media. However, it can also be seen as a way to hide the truth or avoid facing uncomfortable realities. While some may argue that censoring language or depictions of certain topics is necessary to protect sensitive individuals, others believe that censorship only serves to mask the issues that exist in society.  When it comes to language in books or movies, some may argue that the use of profanity or controversial words is unnecessary and should be censored. However, these words are often used to accurately portray the emotions or situations being depicted. Furthermore, censorship of language may not address the root cause of why these words are used in the first place.  Similarly, when it comes to depictions of race in media, some may argue that certain portrayals are offensive and should be censored. While it is important to consider the impact of these portrayals on marginalized communities, censoring them does not address the underlying issues of racism and discrimination that still exist in society.  Ultimately, censorship can be a complex issue, with arguments for both sides. However, it is important to consider the implications of censorship and whether it truly addresses the underlying problems at hand. Instead of covering up uncomfortable truths, it may be more effective to confront them head-on and work towards creating a more inclusive and understanding society.
1663	4640	2	3	Taking books off the shelves at libraries because someone finds them offensive is not a fair practice. What one person deems inappropriate may not be the same for others, and limiting access to certain materials restricts learning opportunities for individuals. Libraries serve as educational resources for students, and removing essential books can hinder their academic progress. While some may argue that controversial content should be restricted, it is important to remember that people have different perspectives and sensitivities. Instead of censoring materials, libraries could consider creating designated sections for adult content. By providing a diverse range of resources, libraries can continue to fulfill their role as valuable community hubs for learning and exploration. Ultimately, restricting access to books, music, magazines, and movies diminishes the essence of a library and limits the educational opportunities it can offer.
1664	4641	2	3	I think if it's offensive, it should not be available for kids until they are old enough to read, listen to it. They should be removed from shelves or put away to prevent any harm or exposure to inappropriate content. Magazines, music, movies, and internet content can be separated into their own sections to control access. It is fortunate that we have measures in place to prevent children from being exposed to offensive material. By removing or putting away these items, we can ensure that children are not exposed to harmful or inappropriate content.
1665	4642	2	3	Dear Newspaper,   I would like to start off by saying that while libraries are great places for kids to explore books, music, movies, and magazines, it is important to consider the content that is available to them.   In high schools, students are often exposed to inappropriate content in the hallways, but the library should be a safe space for them. However, some books in libraries may be promoting drugs, alcohol, and sex, which are not suitable for young minds.   Books that glorify the use of drugs or alcohol can send the wrong message to kids. Instead, they should be educated on the dangers and consequences of substance abuse. Similarly, advertisements that promote unhealthy habits should not be displayed prominently where children can easily see them.   It is crucial to provide kids with positive influences and encourage healthy activities like playing outside, participating in sports, or spending time with family. By removing inappropriate materials from libraries, we can help ensure that our children are not negatively influenced or pressured into engaging in harmful behaviors.   In conclusion, libraries should be a place where children can learn and grow in a safe and positive environment. By being mindful of the content available to them, we can help shape healthier and happier futures for our kids.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]
1666	4643	2	3	I am sending this letter to you regarding my views on censorship in libraries. Some individuals may find books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media offensive, but it is important to consider that what may be offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. It is crucial to acknowledge and respect diverse perspectives when it comes to the materials available in libraries.  I firmly believe that these items should not be removed from library shelves. People have varying interests and preferences, and it is essential to cater to this diversity. For example, while my mother enjoys vampire-themed books and movies, I prefer tragic stories. Each individual has their own unique taste, and it is important to provide a range of options to accommodate these differences.  Furthermore, if we start removing materials that some people find offensive, where do we draw the line? Should we also consider removing classic literature or historical texts that may contain content deemed offensive by certain individuals? If we were to eliminate all potentially offensive material, we would be left with very limited resources in libraries.  While I understand the concern of parents who may not want their children exposed to certain content, it is essential to recognize that exposure to diverse perspectives is a part of life. It is not feasible to remove everything that may be deemed offensive by one person, as it may disappoint or upset others who value those materials.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that censorship in libraries should be approached with caution. It is important to respect the diverse preferences and interests of individuals and provide a wide range of materials for patrons to choose from. Ultimately, the freedom to access a variety of content is crucial for fostering a vibrant and inclusive library environment.
1667	4644	2	3	Libraries are valuable community resources that provide a quiet and safe space for people to read, study, and access information. However, some individuals do not respect the peaceful atmosphere of the library and disrupt others. It is important to maintain the integrity of libraries as a place for learning and relaxation.  While some may question the necessity of libraries when books and other materials can be borrowed and enjoyed at home, libraries serve a crucial role in providing access to resources for those who may not have the means to purchase them. By implementing measures such as requiring personal information and credit card numbers for borrowing materials, libraries can ensure accountability and timely return of items.  Late fees and penalties for overdue items are common in libraries, but some individuals may disregard these consequences. By utilizing credit card numbers for borrowing, libraries can effectively collect fees and deter individuals from keeping items past their due dates.  Overall, libraries play a vital role in society by offering free access to information and resources. By implementing measures to uphold the integrity of libraries, we can ensure that they continue to serve as valuable community spaces for education and enrichment.
1668	4645	2	3	People find things offensive every day, and it is a natural part of life. While some people have the right to feel offended for various reasons, it is impossible to control what offends others. This has been a common occurrence for centuries, and people have learned to navigate through it. Therefore, I believe that books and other materials deemed offensive should not be removed simply because they offend someone, as doing so could potentially offend others. It should be left to the discretion of the library to decide whether to keep or remove certain materials since they have purchased them and have the right to provide access to them. However, libraries should strive to keep offensive material to a minimum, especially when it comes to topics like racism, which continues to be a significant issue in society. Ultimately, it is essential for individuals to move past the offensive nature of certain materials and focus on finding common ground, as we are all part of the same human race, albeit divided by appearances and cultural backgrounds. In conclusion, libraries should be allowed to maintain ownership of potentially offensive materials, as they can serve educational purposes and offer valuable insights into history and culture, rather than solely promoting offensive content. It is crucial for society to strive for understanding and unity, even in the face of differing opinions and viewpoints.
1669	4646	2	3	The library should be a safe and welcoming place for people of all ages. It is important to ensure that the materials available are appropriate for everyone, especially children. Inappropriate content can be harmful and disturbing for young minds. Therefore, libraries should only contain materials that are suitable for all age groups. By carefully selecting what is included in the library, we can create a positive and enriching environment for all visitors. Let's prioritize the well-being and development of our community by ensuring that libraries offer only appropriate and educational materials.
1670	4647	2	3	Should certain books, movies, and magazines be removed from library bookshelves if found offensive? I believe that libraries should remove materials that are offensive. Libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment to enormous groups of people who want to expand their knowledge. Throughout the @LOCATION1 and other countries there are libraries that hold offensive material. Now I strongly believe in throwing out these offensive items because little children could grab one in their hands, there could be people that can be influenced to do stupid activities that they have learned, and some people might steal these items for themselves. Libraries are important resources that tons of different groups of people come to enjoy, relax, and think. Now all over the countries libraries have offensive material that should be romoved from their shelves. Little children and their parents come to the library because a library is a great way to relieve stress and to let children learn. Say there are materials that are not suitable for children so they grab it and started reading. Next thing you know your children will have that type of knowlegde and you can't do a thing about it. Offensive material are around little kids and parent don't even know. They could gain offensive language or talk about it at school and that material could spread. Material like that at the library can harm children brains by brainwashing them. Teenagers are becoming of age to where they might do something regretable. Teen often go to the library to meet up with friends, or start on homework. Then a person who is inmature spots a book and begins to read. After that he or she thought that it was extremely funny and wants to try it at home, but then gets badly hurt. Teens can be influenced by anything and what's worse is that it can start at the library. Then there are people who just come into a library and steal the offensive material for themselves. People like that are inmature and could serve a real problem for the library. Once having that item in their grasp; they could post it on the internet and show the whole world what he or she found. Offensive material could be easily stoten from a library; if these certain items were not at the library then rebels wouldn't be stealing anything from the library. Libraries are for different people who want to learn and teach others about their newly obtained knowledge. Libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted. I don't want such a wonderful resource be tainted by these obsence materials. That is why I strongly believe that certain material such as books, magazines, movies, and music that are offensive should be removed from libraries.
1671	4648	2	3	Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. However, I do not believe they should be removed. People are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material. Most people check out books or movies that they have heard about, so for the most part they know what they are reading may be offensive. Instead of removing the offensive material, there should just be a warning to let readers know that what they are checking out is considered offensive.  These days, people are mature enough to read offensive material. We see many types of offensive material every day. Examples of this include when we watch the news, we often see numerous offensive pictures or videos. There are also many news stories that many people consider offensive. When a person checks out an offensive book, they are doing so because they want to. Libraries should not revoke a reader's right to read what he/she wants.  Before a person checks out a book or movie, they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting. This can prevent many problems. For example, say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting. If they don't read into it a little bit and just take it home, they may later find that it contains offensive material. However, if they read a little bit about it before they check it out, they will find out it contains offensive material, and can then make the decision on whether or not they still want to read it.  There are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it. They can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive. Libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material. Either of these ideas could be an effective way to ensure that only mature people are checking out anything that is considered to be offensive.  Libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that contain offensive material from the shelves. If a person wants to check out a book that is offensive, they should be allowed to check it out and read it. Also, people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out beforehand so they can be aware of the offensive material. However, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it.
1672	4649	2	3	Censorship in libraries today is not as prevalent as some may believe. While there are differing opinions on what constitutes offensive material, it is ultimately up to the individual using the resources to determine what is appropriate for them. Books and movies are valuable sources of information and entertainment for people of all ages, and restricting access to certain materials can sometimes have the opposite effect by piquing curiosity.  Books provide a unique experience by allowing readers to create mental images of the content, unlike movies which present a visual depiction. While movies are often rated based on age appropriateness, books are not always as easily categorized. It is important for individuals to exercise their own judgment when selecting reading material, taking into account their maturity level and personal preferences.  Music, like movies, is often rated based on content, with explicit material clearly labeled. This allows individuals to make informed decisions about the media they consume without the need for additional censorship. Some content may be disturbing or difficult to confront, but it is important to acknowledge and learn from the darker aspects of our history.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries should be approached with caution, as it can limit access to valuable information and creative expression. It is ultimately the responsibility of the individual to make informed decisions about the media they consume, taking into account their own sensibilities and preferences. By allowing for a wide range of materials to be available, libraries can continue to serve as important resources for education, entertainment, and personal growth.
1673	4650	2	3	My opinion on this subject is that it is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. On one hand, removing offensive content such as explicit music lyrics or tobacco products from public spaces can protect individuals, especially children, from harmful influences. On the other hand, censoring material that some find offensive can lead to conflicts and limit personal freedom. It is important for individuals to consider different perspectives and find a balance between respecting diverse opinions and maintaining a safe and inclusive environment. Ultimately, while it is essential to address offensive content, it is also crucial to recognize the importance of freedom of expression and individual preferences in a diverse society.
1674	4651	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed if they are found inappropriate. There are several things that explain why I think this. For one thing, some libraries don't have certain genres of books. For example, say one library may have action but not thriller while another library has thriller but not action. If some materials were removed from public libraries due to censorship, people would only be able to find it online or in certain stores. Secondly, kids should not be exposed to inappropriate content unless approved by parents. If these materials were still on shelves, there could be age restrictions or parental approval required. Lastly, some adults would be upset if certain books were removed. Removing books intended for adults would limit access and force them to seek alternative sources. In conclusion, censorship in libraries may lead to closure if it continues unchecked. Let's not let censorship take over our libraries and restrict access to valuable materials.
1675	4652	2	3	Censorship to most people means much more than the average @NUM1 syllable word. It means giving up the right to say and think however you want. To most, this idea is not a good one. When one is censored, they are essentially giving up the right of freedom of @CAPS3. In this essay I will discuss three cons of censorship in libraries.   One reason censorship should not be allowed in libraries is the lack of freedom of @CAPS3. Decades ago when it was set into place that anyone was allowed to practice their right to speak freely, the idea of censorship was not in the plan. As @CAPS1's, it is our right to speak and write however we want without repercussions, however offensive or non-offensive the material @MONTH1 be. As @CAPS1's all should realize that everyone is different and not everyone will agree with one another. Does that mean that just because one person finds something offensive, then an item should be taken off shelves? Absolutely not. Freedom of @CAPS3 is our birthright and we should be allowed to say or write anything without being censored.  '...But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson. Author Katherine Paterson simply states that if she has the right to take any book off the shelf that she doesn't like, then everyone else also has that same right. As previously stated in the paragraph above, it makes no sense to rid a book just because one person finds it offensive. If that was the case, I could find @NUM2 books in our library that I find offensive, and the next person could find @NUM3 books that are offensive and so on. Just as Katherine states, 'And then we have no books left on the shelves for any of us.'  And the last con of censorship in libraries is the lack of perspective and learning a book brings. As an avid book reader, I couldn't even begin to describe all of the vocabulary words and new things I learn from reading one book. Just recently I read the book @CAPS4 @CAPS5. As I was reading, I began to have a deep hatred of the main character. Later I found that the book was incredibly offensive. However, from reading it, the book provided much insight into @DATE1's life that I knew nothing about. It gave me a great deal of information that to this day, I use. The book made me reflect on myself and how @NUM4 plus years changes people, @CAPS1's more specifically.  In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not a good idea. When one is censored they give up their right of freedom of @CAPS3, other books in general, and loss of opportunity to learn new things. Hopefully with this essay, I have persuaded you or at least informed you on the cons of censorship in libraries.
1676	4653	2	3	Is there enough censorship in our libraries? Have you ever come across a vulgar or offensive book in your library and hoped that no children had ever read it? Well, that should never happen. If a book or any other material is offensive, then it should be put in a separate area of the library where only adults can access it. Other than that section, there should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see.   Almost every day, children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials that could have terrible effects on them. If they do not see these offensive materials when they are young, they will be less likely to engage in those activities later on. For example, reading about people doing drugs could influence teenagers to do the same. The influence might not be immediate, but it could have a significant impact in the future.   The youth will be running the country when we are old, so it is crucial to take offensive and vulgar materials out of their reach. I do not want my children to read some of the things that I read when I was young. This is why I believe there should be censorship in every library to protect our children and teenagers from harmful influences.
1677	4654	2	3	In conclusion, having every book, movie, and magazine available for people to access is essential for expanding knowledge and allowing individuals to explore a wide range of topics. While some content may be offensive to certain individuals, the freedom to choose what to read, watch, or learn is vital in promoting education and understanding. By ensuring that a diverse range of materials is accessible, people can continue to broaden their horizons and gain valuable insights into various subjects. Letting people have the opportunity to explore different forms of media can ultimately lead to a more informed and enlightened society.
1678	4655	2	3	I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed for being offensive. Everyone has different preferences and opinions, and it is important to respect that diversity. Libraries provide a wide range of information and resources that can be beneficial for learning and research. If someone finds a particular material offensive, they always have the choice to not engage with it and find something else that interests them. It is essential to focus on the positive aspects of the library's offerings and not dwell on the things that may not align with personal preferences. Ultimately, libraries serve as valuable resources for education, exploration, and knowledge, and it is important to embrace the variety of content available.
1679	4656	2	3	I think there should be no books taken off the shelves. Some things might be offensive to some people, but others might need those books for research, projects, etc. People need to read to understand why some people think that things are offensive to others. Every book should be on a bookshelf in a public library. Everybody has the freedom to choose for themselves; let them decide if it is offensive to them and others.  Maybe an author wrote a book about gangsters and their kids to give an inside look at somebody's life. We live in a very diverse world, and there will be different outlooks on the world. Reading that book should let you see how that child grew up and could even change the minds of parents in gangs about the effects on their children's lives.  The same goes for movies and magazines. Through reading magazines and watching movies, it could help you understand different perspectives and perhaps change your thoughts. Directors and writers may create these works to show the consequences of certain actions, like being in a gang.  Why should certain people get to choose if a book, movie, or magazine is offensive to some but not others? The only way to address this issue is to leave every book on public library shelves. Let the people who come to the library decide what is right or offensive for them to read. Nobody can decide right from wrong for somebody else; only you can do it for yourself.  In conclusion, I believe that censorship of books, movies, and magazines is not the solution. Allowing individuals to make their own choices about what they read and watch is essential for personal growth and understanding different perspectives. Letting people decide for themselves what is appropriate or offensive is the best way to approach this issue.
1680	4657	2	3	Some children take books off the shelf that some old people can't read nowadays. Some people take books off, break them, and even tear pages out of them. This kind of behavior not only disrespects the books themselves but also shows a lack of consideration for others who may have wanted to read them. It is important to treat books with care and respect, as they hold valuable knowledge and stories that should be preserved for future generations to enjoy. By damaging books, we are not only harming the physical object but also diminishing the opportunity for others to learn and be entertained. Let us remember to handle books with care and appreciation, so that they may continue to educate and inspire readers for years to come.
1681	4658	2	3	Hello @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to talk about censorship in libraries. In libraries they have tons of materials that have language and images that are offensive. i have a broad view on this subject. My view is just that if the censor stuff in a library, the should censor tv.     I have deaf parents, so we always have the captions on in our house. Everyday I see bad language thats inot censored. I also have seen images that are not censored. The youth of this time mostly watch tv than use the library. So why not censor tv. I see things on tv that i wont see in a library.     In my conclusion i would like to say i dont believe that libraries should censor their materials because the studdent will still find out. There are plenty of other places that are worse. Like crimes scenes, cime scens have blood and gore and a library would just have language. These are my views ancd yours could be differnt.  Expanding on the issue of censorship in libraries, it is essential to consider the prevalence of uncensored content on television, which is easily accessible to the youth. As someone with deaf parents who rely on captions, I am constantly exposed to uncensored language and images on TV. This raises the question of why libraries are singled out for censorship when other media platforms are equally if not more explicit.  The argument against censorship in libraries is further reinforced by the fact that students can easily access uncensored content in various other environments, such as crime scenes that depict graphic violence. Compared to such extreme scenarios, the content found in libraries, primarily consisting of language, seems relatively tame.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that libraries should not engage in censorship, as it ultimately proves to be futile when individuals can easily encounter uncensored content through other means. The focus should be on promoting critical thinking and responsible media consumption, rather than limiting access to information in libraries.
1682	4659	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, an author, once said. I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read. I agree with her on that statement.   I have once read a book with very mature content. It was very vulgar and not suitable for my age or maturity. There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society. They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as: war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other things.   If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives. There would be less teen pregnancies, drug usage, and multiple other factors that are affecting our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media. I think that we shouldn't get rid of these books though. We should just keep them out of the libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries.   A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media. But she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to. This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media. But for now if the content is too adult for you or does not agree with you, don't read or watch it. Children should be protected from harmful content, but adults should still have the freedom to choose what they want to read or watch. Let's work towards creating a safer and more appropriate environment for our children by regulating the access to mature content.
1683	4660	2	3	We have all been to a library at some point in our life. Have you ever been looking around and seen something that may have been offensive, or something you didn't agree with? What if you had the chance to have it taken off the shelves for good? Or, what if someone else had the choice to? Would you allow them to do so? In my opinion, I would say no. Someone does not have the right to take reading material off the shelves just because it may be offensive to them or their way of life. If you do not like it, do not look at it, it is as simple as that. For example, what if you were into rap or the hip hop culture, and someone finds that offensive? Would you give them the right to keep it from you? Or, would you really want to do that to someone else? Let's say you are a Christian, and an atheist finds the content offensive or untruthful, so they have it taken off the shelves. Does that sound fair to you? If someone does not like a certain topic or culture, or finds it offensive, all they would have to do is simply stay away from it. The point is, if we all were to take something off the shelves, there would eventually be nothing left. Respect what other cultures and ways of life do, and stay away from what offends you. Would you like someone to have what you like taken off the shelves? I would not, so you should not do that to other people.
1684	4661	2	3	It seems today we attempt to censor everything, but are we going too far? Could it be that we have crossed the line and are no longer protecting the children, but are instead holding back our society as a whole? In my opinion, censorship of literature has crossed the line. A library is, essentially, an invaluable resource to each generation. In some cases it still is, but when books are being withheld due to the fact that it may offend someone, we are holding people back from the knowledge they could gain from the work of literature itself. We attempt to placate everyone in today's society, therefore we censor several things that are not politically correct. If future generations are unable to learn what we have through these writings, then they will lack the insight we had gained. Another reason is, to be perfectly honest, history and society have not, and very well may never truly be, politically correct. People take umbrage to certain words and consequently some libraries will remove the book featuring said words from their shelves. After this is done, what have we really accomplished? Have we made the world a better place by attempting to hide a part of history? That is debatable, but by the same token, in school we must learn about the Holocaust despite the fact that it upsets many people. We must learn about this because it was an important part in history that needs to be remembered in hopes that nothing so terrible as that will ever happen again. So, if we learn about an entire subject which happened in another country but affected the entire world should we not learn about our own faults in history? The times we have oppressed people, the terms we used so commonly we attempt to hide now. Has it really helped us? No, for until people recognize a problem and furthermore are reminded of how wrong it was they will not understand it. Napoleon once said that history is a story written by the victor, but is victory so sweet after our history has been rewritten? If everything that offends people is censored or taken away we will have nothing left. For if one person is allowed to say what is and isn't acceptable then others will partake in this as well. It would become a new fad and people would find a problem with just about anything. So, essentially, by censoring works in libraries we are holding back the future generations from all that they could be. We are forcing them to be ignorant of society's problems. In the end we must ask ourselves, was it really worth it? I remind you, a library is an invaluable resource.
1685	4662	2	3	When people think of a library, they often envision a quiet place for studying and reading. However, libraries serve various purposes for teachers, including providing resources such as movies, books, and magazines for educational use. While some materials may be considered offensive, the decision to remove them should be based on the age group of the students and the specific content of the material.  Movies are commonly used in classrooms for educational purposes, but not all films may be appropriate for younger audiences. Teachers should screen movies before showing them to elementary school students to ensure they are age-appropriate. However, in high schools where students may have more exposure to mature content, a wider range of movies can be available in the library.  Books are valuable resources for learning about historical figures, events, and various topics. While some books may contain sensitive or explicit content, they can still be beneficial for educational purposes. Books with potentially offensive material can be kept behind the counter and made available upon request for specific classes or purposes.  Magazines are useful for projects and entertainment, offering visual aids and information on a wide range of topics. They can provide a welcome break from traditional reading materials and cater to different interests and learning styles.  In conclusion, libraries play a crucial role in providing educational resources for students and teachers. While offensive materials should be handled with care, the decision to remove them should be based on the age group and educational needs of the students. Balancing the availability of diverse resources with the sensitivity of certain content is essential in creating a conducive learning environment in libraries.
1686	4663	2	3	My view opposes the open distribution of certain newspaper articles. There are certain articles, radio shows, and other sources of media that vividly describe certain things that happen in the news that I find not to be appropriate for some people to hear such as younger children, or people that don't agree with having to listen to things such as: bias reactions, opinions, and interpretations of these things. Open distribution of newspaper articles and things containing disturbing images ought to be censored.  I recently seen photos of people who have been killed in the process of finding @LOCATION1. I find that these images @MONTH1 serve some importance to people interested, but for children who can look on their doorstep and look at the newspaper, can see horrifying images that some people @MONTH1 think they shouldn't be exposed to. Even as adults people don't necessarily agree with it. Adults @MONTH1 see what's in the news and @MONTH1 find it to be intriguing as it pertains to them or fairly disturbing, but as far as the protection and limited exposure their children @MONTH1 have, it @MONTH1 not be such a good thing for their kids to be hearing.  I was in the car heading back from school one day, and my dad had just picked me up from school, and I casually switch the raido from am to fm as I always do when I get in the car, but I didn't hear the sudden outbreak of a top one hundred song as I had expected, I heard a woman asserting her opinion about the death of @LOCATION1 to a talk radio show host. The show had previously been recorded, and so after the woman had lashed out for being so angry about the whole thing, there was a review of other calls that other people had made in mad frustration about the womans' comments. She had said earlier that it was wrong to have killed somebody, in which the talk radio show host responded with the argument that it was okay for @LOCATION1 to kill thousands, but we can't kill him argument. The reviews that the other callers had made sort of disturbed me. The things that the callers were saying were very offensive towards the woman who had expressed her feelings. The other callers were saying that she needed to get out of our country, and were cursing at her. News like the death of @LOCATION1 isn't just violent in itself, but creates reactions that are very violent as well.  Another instance when I was exposed to some information that @MONTH1 not have been well accepted by others was when we were having an assembly meeting at my school, and we watched a video about a protest that was against people of @CAPS1 belief. The whole problem with the protest was that the people of the @CAPS1 faith were born in @LOCATION3, and were meeting with representatives in order to help a poor community in @LOCATION2. Although they were making an effort to help the poor communities, and homeless people in @LOCATION2 there were people shouting at the im protest to leave, and to go back to where they came from. When people hear things about this in the news it can be very offensive, because although it @MONTH1 be happening on a complete opposite coast, it would be able to effect someone, it can easily effect someone who doesn't understand previous conflicts that would shape these peoples' opinions and @MONTH1 take that very offensively, because it is a very complex matter even though it is still very wrong.  I believe that the material that is being exposed to people of all ages should be censored, because the material that is being openly distributed now isn't necessarily suitable for everyone, and some people @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, and want to avoid the news that is going around about certain topics that they @MONTH1 not be comfortable with.
1687	4664	2	3	I think that if a book can be published then it should be able to be in a library. If a book is published then it means it's open to the public so I don't see why it can't be in the libraries. If a book has to be removed from a library then why did they buy it? I really don't see the need to take a book off the shelf in a library. If someone doesn't like it then they don't have to get it. I believe that only the owner of the library should be the only one to take a book off a shelf because it is their own store, but why would they waste the money in buying the book. The public shouldn't be able to remove books from libraries because not everyone likes the same kind of books. Everyone has different views also. If anyone could remove books from libraries then there wouldn't be any books in the library. A book is a book. Not a criminal so why remove books from libraries? If a book can be published then it can be put in libraries. There is no reason for a book to be taken off the shelf because it's been published so it's already open to the public.
1688	4665	2	3	I don't think a magazine should be taken off the shelves just because someone is offended. People get offended all the time but do you see them trying to get what ever it is that made them feel like that. I have been offended by cartoons before but you don't see me crying about it you just have to suck it up and go on with life. Cartman from the tv show South Park is one of the most offensive characters on that show. He uses every offensive language known to mankind. He makes fun of all races, saying he hates everyone equally. But still, you can't stop it; it's like trying to get a dog to be a cat, it just won't happen. It's also like trying to get rid of racism. That is what I think about finding something offensive.
1689	4666	2	3	When you walk into your local library, you are greeted with a vast array of books, magazines, and movies catering to various interests and genres. However, it is essential to consider the content available, especially when it comes to material that may not be suitable for young children. Inappropriate books, movies, and magazines that contain explicit content, violence, or other negative influences should not be readily accessible in public spaces like libraries.  Young children, in particular, should be shielded from materials that could potentially have a detrimental impact on their development. Exposure to inappropriate content at a young age can lead to misguided behavior and poor decision-making in the future. It is crucial to create a safe and positive environment for children to explore literature and media without being exposed to harmful influences.  In today's society, where negative themes like violence, sex, and substance abuse are prevalent in popular culture, it is more important than ever to protect young minds from such influences. By restricting access to inappropriate material in public spaces like libraries, we can help shape a more responsible and conscientious generation.  As individuals, we have a responsibility to uphold standards of decency and morality, especially when it comes to influencing the minds of young people. By advocating for the removal of inappropriate content from public spaces and promoting positive messages in literature, movies, and music, we can contribute to creating a more wholesome and enlightened society for future generations. Let us strive to prioritize the well-being and moral development of our youth by being mindful of the content we expose them to in public spaces.
1690	4667	2	3	Censorship in libraries can be both positive and negative, depending on the content being restricted. It can be beneficial to shield children from inappropriate material, but it may also limit access to valuable information. Age appropriateness plays a crucial role in determining what should be censored, as some content may not be suitable for young readers. Personal perspectives on what is offensive can vary widely, making it challenging to determine what should be censored. While some offensive content may be necessary for a complete story, censorship can prevent certain perspectives from being shared. Ultimately, censorship can be a contentious issue, with different viewpoints on its impact on society. It is essential to consider the balance between protecting individuals from harm and ensuring freedom of expression in libraries.
1691	4668	2	3	If offensive materials are found in libraries, they should be removed from shelves to prevent children from accessing them. Parents would likely be upset and may even take action against the schools or libraries that allowed such materials to be available. It is important to have age restrictions on these types of items to ensure that they are only accessible to mature audiences. Ultimately, steps should be taken to prevent offensive content from being easily accessible to children in places like libraries.
1692	4669	2	3	I do believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, or music, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. This is because exposure to offensive content can have negative impacts on individuals, especially children. Offensive material in books can lead to readers feeling uncomfortable or upset, while movies with violent or inappropriate scenes can negatively influence viewers, particularly young audiences. Additionally, magazines containing offensive or harmful content can be damaging, especially if accessed by children. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential impact of such materials and ensure that they are not readily available to the public. Removing offensive content from shelves can help create a more positive and respectful environment for everyone.
1693	4670	2	3	Yes, I do believe that certain books, movies, music, etc., should be removed or stored in a secure place to prevent children from accessing them. These materials can contain content that may influence children in a negative way, leading to undesirable behavior. It is essential to safeguard children by keeping such items out of their reach, whether by placing them in high areas, closets, attics, or personal safes. By doing so, we can protect children from harmful influences and ensure their well-being. It is crucial to be mindful of the content that children are exposed to and take necessary precautions to prevent any negative consequences.
1694	4671	2	3	I think that certain things in libraries should be taken off shelves if found offensive but not all. One of these things is anything that undermines or degrades one's religious beliefs. Another thing could be anything involving racial stereotypes or obvious racial comments. Having anything containing this could spark conflict within or outside of the library. Another thing that could be, but not entirely, removed from library material could be books that express violent or criminal acts. This type of material should only be given to an older audience.  I think that anything that contains slander or judgement on another person's religious beliefs should be removed from library shelves. As time goes on people are taking religion more and more serious. With that being said I don't think anyone would want to read a book or watch a movie in which the things they believe in being made fun of or rejected. It may not seem like harmful material at first glance, but your opinion may change when your customers come back angry and frustrated about what they read and saw. It would be a better choice to avoid this conflict with your customers and keep this material out of your library, unless you want to deal with complaints and constant arguments.  Another thing that needs to be removed is racial material. Racism has been one the worlds largest problems, it affects us all no matter who it's against. Picture a book in your library that calls all black teens a problem or a book that says all arabians dangerous, racist isn't it? Now imagine if your customers were of one of those two ethnicities, it's not a good picture at all. Keeping these stereotypes and harmful sayings off library shelves is a great business choice and will keep all customers happy. The last thing we want is for a customer to say 'those people are racist!'.  Lastly I think books that express violent and criminal acts should be censored from minors. Kids always follow what they hear or what they see. Since they're still in that stage where they rarely do things in their own way they may mimic or copy things they see. Another problem that surrounds this is peer pressure which will get more and more children committing these acts. If this is to happen many parents will become outraged and blame the libraries for releasing this material to children. So the best choice would be to keep this material away from minors, if it is contained within your library.

It is important to have a variety of books, including those that may be considered offensive, as everyone has different tastes and interests. It would be helpful to have labels on books to warn readers of potentially objectionable content. Libraries should have sections for different genres and age groups to cater to the diverse preferences of their patrons. Exploring books in the library can be a thrilling experience, as you never know what hidden gems you may discover. Having a well-stocked library with a wide range of materials ensures that there is something for everyone to enjoy.
1696	4673	2	3	I believe that censorship should not be implemented in libraries. Censorship would limit the variety of books, magazines, and movies available to the public, as people can be offended by different things. Some genres, like action, horror, and comedy, may contain elements like violence, cursing, or provocative content, which can enhance the storytelling. While certain materials may not be suitable for children, in a public library setting, it is important to have a diverse collection to cater to different tastes and interests. Without censorship, libraries can continue to offer a wide range of content for patrons to explore and enjoy.
1697	4674	2	3	Today, we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library. Some are children's books, while others are intended for a more mature reader. Many parents are scared that their child will read a book that may be inappropriate for their child. The thing is, if everyone removes the books that they don't find acceptable, there won't be any books left in the library for us to enjoy.   What makes a book unacceptable to read? Could it be language, graphic scenes, or parts that are just extremely scary? Many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read. Removing a book from a library would be done through one's opinion. This is not fair because we all have the right to free press, which means that anyone can publish anything they wish to and everyone has the right to read it. By removing books from a library, you are violating not only the author's right, but the reader's as well.   Unfortunately, there are some books that may cause a child to become scared. When a child reads a book, it's harder for them to realize that they are just reading a book. Many children take in every word of a story and turn it into a reality. Not only can this scare a child, but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read in the story is not true. As more and more of these books are released, the more likely it becomes that children will be reading these offensive stories.   I believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong. I understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem, but libraries are usually set up in sections. For instance, there is a children's section, a teen section, and an adult section. This helps kids remain in an area appropriate for their age. I think that if a parent is worried enough that their child will read an offensive book, then they should go with their child to the library when checking out books to read.   A public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers. There will always be certain books that some of us find offensive. Removing books from a library only decreases the number of books to choose from; and if that were to happen, there would eventually be no books left for anyone to enjoy.
1698	4675	2	3	No i do not figure that. I say that there is some material for adults, teens and children. The children aren't going to want to read the adult books and the adults aren't going to wanna read the childrerns books the teens aren't going to want to read the childrens books but they @MONTH1 want to read the adult books and thats ok. They will be adults soon they @MONTH1 be interested. there is nothing wrong with that. If the parents do not want there teens or children reading that kindf of material then they should go with them to the libary and make them  get you approvial befor checking out the books, magazines or wwhatever it is they wanna read at the time. Movies are the samje there are different materials for each age group some age groups @MONTH1 be interested in other age groups material and thats ok doesn't maen it's wrong just means thetre maturing more and are interested or couriouse let them explore they will figurt for them serlfs if the material is righrt for them or not.
1699	4676	2	3	OFFENSIVE BOOKS !!!   Did you ever think about why students read what they are ready now? They read books about sex , guns , and many more because they think its exciting well guess what its not! The author's who make them type of books want you to buy them because they want their money , but they never think about the kids. Kids would read anything now because of those kind of things.       I think that books like that should be removed because you dont want    your child to grow up reading those type of books then when they have kid  they wouldnt want the same. Many parents dont care what they chidren      read as long as they reading its fine with them , its not fine its very wrong and I wouldnt expect a great writer to use bad language also they think its okay to do that! Thats why kids act the way they do now is because of books , movies etc.      I think they should really stop making those books or have their own stores to where like adults can go buy those books or whatever books they want. I dont think kids would want to read those type of books anyway because they dont want to learn that stuff but some of them do and i dont think thats right at all. Thats why kids should read a very good book and dont judge a book by its cover !   It is important to consider the impact of the content that children are exposed to through books. Parents and educators should be mindful of the material that young readers are consuming, as it can shape their values and behaviors. Encouraging children to read wholesome and educational books can help foster a love for reading while also promoting positive growth and development. Let's prioritize quality literature that uplifts and inspires young minds.
1700	4677	2	3	Censorship in libraries could have negative effects on the library. Parents have different views on books, music, etc. One parent may not have a problem with a book that has a few curse words in it, while another parent might find it inappropriate for their children. If a book is censored and removed from the library, it could alienate patrons who enjoy that particular book. This could potentially lead to a decrease in library visitors and circulation. Different people have different opinions on what is appropriate, and censorship could lead to a lack of diverse reading materials available in libraries. It is important for parents to be aware of the content in the sections of the library that their children visit, and for libraries to provide clear signage to help patrons navigate the different sections. Overall, censorship may not be an effective solution and could have unintended consequences on the library and its visitors.
1701	4678	2	3	A lot of people have huge debates over what they think is appropriate for children and teens to be reading, watching, and listening to; in this topic there will be opinions discussed and logical explanations to what some people think is the proper things kids should be exposed to. First, kids should not be watching rated R movies or even PG-13 if it has vulgar content, sexual content, violence, and etc. Even though some parents allow this, these movies and magazines can still have a huge impact on the child and possibly on how they act in his or her future. Secondly, children still have a good number of movies for them to watch and learn from that can better themselves for their education, career, etc. Finally, teens and young adults exposed to this genre of movies, books, music, or any other media based entertainment are more likely to make destructive decisions than a teenager who doesn't. Although this is not always the case, it does increase the chances of wrong decisions and it does have an influence on the younger minds. In conclusion, young adults, teens, and children should not be able to watch media that contains vulgar content, sexual content, violence, etc, without parent supervision and permission.
1702	4679	2	3	In libraries, there should be control over the type of books, magazines, and movies that children have access to. It is important to consider the age appropriateness of the content, as exposing children to inappropriate material can have negative effects. Creating sections for children, teens, and adults can help guide children to age-appropriate material. While some may argue for removing offensive material altogether, it is important for children to be aware of different perspectives and issues in society. By providing access to a variety of content, children can learn and grow in a well-rounded manner. It is essential to strike a balance between protecting children and educating them about the world around them.
1703	4680	2	3	Censorship in Libraries  Have you ever come across something in the library that makes you say, '@CAPS1! That's inappropriate!' If so, I am sure you're not alone. Just the other day I was in the library. There were posters up all around featuring a new movie now available for rental. I remembered seeing ads for this particular movie on television that looked rather repulsive. How could they allow this kind of thing on display like this? How does this affect the minds of our country's youth?  My thought on this topic is clear, although I am sure I'd receive some opposition from others, considering everyone has their own opinions on this matter. I do realize the library has age limits on rentals, but what about all these posters everywhere? You don't necessarily have to rent the material to be corrupted by it. I believe there should be a separate section for this kind of material.  Another example of library rentals that can be harmful to developing minds are CDs. New music sometimes contains lewd or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library. Even the covers of some CDs should be removed for the good of the public. It's interesting how these things just slide by the library. I once saw a young boy renting a CD that had the words 'parental advisory' right on the cover! No one stopped him.  Books are the same way. Disturbing covers and titles are littered throughout the library. No one even cares to screen these books before they hit the shelves.  So, when do you think someone's going to do something about censorship in libraries? It is hard to say, but I strongly believe it's up to protesters like us to stop this. I hope you'll join me in this epic battle for censorship, to keep our youth safe.
1704	4681	2	3	I personally believe that books and other forms of literature should not be removed simply because they may contain offensive material. People have different preferences when it comes to reading, and what one person finds offensive, another may enjoy. It is important to respect individual choices and not impose personal beliefs on what others should or should not read. Additionally, historical books, even if they contain graphic details about war, serve an important educational purpose. Ultimately, it is essential to preserve the diversity of literature available in libraries and allow individuals the freedom to choose what they want to read. Let's embrace the variety of perspectives and genres that literature has to offer, rather than restricting access based on personal opinions.
1705	4682	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a significant issue in today's world, as authors increasingly use offensive language and themes in their works. While authors have the right to express themselves, there is a need to regulate where such materials are placed and who can access them.   Libraries that choose to carry offensive materials should ensure that they are kept out of the reach of children. By segregating such materials into a designated adult section, libraries can protect younger audiences from exposure to inappropriate content. A dedicated team should oversee the placement of offensive materials and address any concerns raised by library patrons.  While individuals may have varying opinions on what constitutes offensive content, it is important to treat all library users with respect and consideration. Upholding dignity and respecting the diverse backgrounds of library visitors is essential in creating a welcoming and inclusive environment. By promoting the availability of materials that are suitable for all audiences, libraries can uphold the principles of equality and fairness for everyone. Ultimately, it is crucial to prioritize the well-being and comfort of library patrons when deciding which materials to offer and how to make them accessible.
1706	4683	2	3	Public libraries are essential institutions that should cater to the diverse needs and interests of all individuals. It is crucial that libraries maintain a wide range of content, including books, music, and other materials, to ensure that everyone can find something that suits their preferences. By offering a variety of content, libraries can serve as a valuable resource for the community, promoting learning, exploration, and cultural enrichment.  Restricting certain materials based on individual preferences or beliefs would go against the fundamental principles of a public library. Every person is unique, with different backgrounds, beliefs, and interests. Therefore, it is important to provide a broad selection of content to accommodate the diverse needs of the community. By organizing materials into different sections, individuals can easily locate the resources they are seeking without being exposed to content that may offend them.  In a world where diversity is celebrated, it is crucial that public libraries remain inclusive and welcoming spaces for all individuals. By maintaining a wide range of content, libraries can continue to fulfill their role as a hub for knowledge, creativity, and exploration. Ultimately, by embracing diversity and offering a variety of materials, public libraries can continue to serve as valuable resources that enrich the lives of all members of the community.
1707	4684	2	3	People in this common era have different approaches to the idea of libraries. Some view the library as a place to go and learn and to express yourself and be free. Others believe it to be a place where there is danger for minors and can be very inappropriate. These two opinions can cause an intriguing argument.  People go to the library because they want to either get away, or just to be free and grab a nice book. There are many books to choose from, but you need to be careful while browsing. Some books, although good, can be inappropriate to some ages, and that's when controversy spills. Parents think the library is encouraging the check-out of inappropriate books, but this isn't all that true. It's all about the placement of books, and that's what most librarians will tell you. They didn't encourage the kid to check it out, but they have every right to. It is also unknown that what is offensive to one person, might bring joy to another person maybe of a different race or ethnic background.  I think that these so-called offensive books or magazines that parents complain about, should not be removed from libraries. There is a reason those books are there and they are not put up there to be offensive; so why take them down? I think a way we can monitor these kids to stay away from books their parents believe can be harmful to them is by making a rule stating that a child must be present with an adult in certain sections. This will not only stop the fact that kids checkout books much inappropriate for them, but it might also make the parents stop complaining and the controversy will end.  People need to stop looking at the library as a place that brings negativity, but as a place for giving children joy. Remember, it was built for those who enjoy reading and so people can have a place to do so. Why complain? Find the positives in what it brings instead of looking down on it. Bring back the feelings of what the library brought to you when you were a child. Let's embrace the diversity of literature and continue to provide a safe and enriching environment for all who visit the library.
1708	4685	2	3	Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticks on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each category is in today's society. Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for its content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read. Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kinds of movies 'legally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has existed for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay. And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The government has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'. So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't necessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for an adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should
1709	4686	2	3	"What do you want your children to be able to see in their public library? As we all know, there are things like books, pictures, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see. This is why parents are so careful with computers and what their children have access to. Every situation has its pros and cons, but in some cases, if you analyze the pros and cons, you can come to an accurate conclusion. When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children's section. Let's face it, children do not want to look at adult books. Once children learn to read, you might come across a bigger problem. As children get older, they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and looking at what they want on the computer.   I'm sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books, etc. This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want. The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine, that the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as opposed to borrowing it for free at the public library. It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library, what will stop him/her from looking at them at a bookstore? Another issue is banned books. Some of them are classics that past generations have read in school. Why would we decide to take these books away now? It makes it seem like the younger generations cannot handle it, or that past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time. Does it just end here and now? Why would we take the classics away? Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations, what is stopping them from being forgotten? Some banned books parents will look at and say, ""Why would this be banned? I do not remember anything bad in it."" Most of the time, the classic banned books were written sometime in the 19th century, early 20th century, or the mid-20th century. Society was different then. When you read a classic, it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written. Usually, the book will be banned because of bad language which people think should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point. That was how things were back then, so who are we to hide it?   Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided or put in a section away from younger children's eyes. Horror movies do not have to be taken out completely, just put in a different section. If parents are worried about monitoring their children on the internet, there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer. I think that there can be some censorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations, we can make our country a safe yet educational place to learn."
1710	4687	2	3	There are many different opinions on what should be allowed in public libraries, especially when it comes to potentially offensive or upsetting content. While some may argue for censoring certain materials, I believe that everything should be allowed in libraries, but separated by age groups to ensure that younger readers are not exposed to inappropriate content. This way, people can still have access to a wide range of materials while also maintaining a safe and appropriate environment for all library visitors. Remember that what one person finds offensive, another may find interesting, so it's important to consider the diverse perspectives of library patrons when making decisions about what should be available.
1711	4688	2	3	Yes, there are concerns about the content in books available at libraries, especially when it comes to graphic and sexual phrases that parents may not want their children exposed to. One suggestion to address this issue is to implement age limit signs in specific sections of the library, such as a kid section, a teen section, and an adult section. These sections could be further secured with doors that require proof of age to access, except for the kid section which would be open to all children. This measure could help alleviate parents' worries about what their children are reading. Additionally, it may be beneficial to remove music and movies from library collections to focus on books and other educational resources. Overall, implementing these measures could help create a more controlled and safe environment for library users of all ages.
1712	4689	2	3	Look it's a plane, it's a bird, it's a...harmful word. There have been instances where I have encountered harmful words while reading various materials such as magazine articles, books, or newspapers. While these words may not necessarily target me, they can have a negative impact on other readers. People have different interpretations and reactions to words, which can vary depending on their maturity level.  I believe that it's not the materials themselves that are the issue, but rather the maturity level of the readers. Harmful words can easily transform into hurtful names when individuals choose to use them inappropriately. For example, a derogatory term like 'wetback' may be present in a biography book about a particular group, but it's when readers misuse it and find humor in using it to label others that the problem arises.  Books can serve as valuable resources for academic purposes, but certain topics within them can inadvertently lead to harmful behavior. For instance, books discussing race can sometimes prompt individuals to use offensive language towards others. Similarly, books that touch on themes like sex can influence teenagers to engage in activities they may not be ready for, simply because they see characters in the book doing so.  Whether these problematic materials remain on shelves or are removed, the issue of name-calling and inappropriate behavior will persist. Addressing this problem will require more than just eliminating certain books; it demands a deeper examination of how individuals process and apply the content they encounter.  In conclusion, the presence of harmful words in reading materials can have lasting effects, particularly when readers choose to misuse them. It is essential for readers to approach such content with maturity and respect, understanding the potential impact of their words and actions on others.
1713	4690	2	3	"Censorship is a complex issue that involves determining what content is suitable for the public to consume. Some argue that certain books, music, and movies should be censored to protect individuals, especially children, from harmful or inappropriate material. However, others believe that people should have the freedom to choose what they want to read and watch.   There have been instances where books were banned due to controversial themes such as witchcraft or slavery, as authorities deemed them unsuitable for younger audiences. Similarly, some music and movies have come under fire for promoting violence, drug use, or other negative behaviors. For example, explicit lyrics in songs like ""WAP"" and graphic violence in movies like ""The Descent"" have raised concerns about the impact of such content on society.   While censorship may help shield individuals from harmful influences, it is also essential to consider the importance of freedom of expression. People should have the autonomy to decide what they want to read, listen to, or watch, as this allows for a diverse range of perspectives and ideas to be shared. Ultimately, the debate around censorship is complex, and there are no clear-cut answers. It is crucial for individuals to make informed choices about the media they consume and for society to strike a balance between protection and freedom of expression."
1714	4691	2	3	What race are you? What religion are you? What have you been taught? Almost anything like these could be considered offensive. So should these types of things be taken out of libraries? No, these types of things are everywhere. You just can't get away from them. Today you can find so many offensive television shows and commercials. For example the commercials for @CAPS1 gum with that @CAPS2 woman, some people might consider that offensive. You might ask, '@CAPS3', well there might be a person who has a disease who can't get that 'clean feeling' and always has bad breath. That person might take offense to these commercials. Another example might be television shows, like @ORGANIZATION1. Some @CAPS4 and just other races get offended by these types of things. Does that really mean we should get rid of them though? People everywhere are somehow offended by something, the world isn't perfect. Even if we did take out these types of offensive material in libraries, it could still be seen. So whats the point? If you tried to take it all out, like everywhere in the world everything would be crazy. There is no such thing as a perfect world, I believe if there was people would go crazy. For example in the movie '@CAPS5 @CAPS6,' the main character finds a town that is suppose to resemble 'The @CAPS7 @CAPS8' or a perfect society. In the town at first everything is nice, but then everyone is so perfect that he can't stand it and leaves. The best thing to do is let these materials stick around because there is nothing you can do to get them gone from everywhere else. Also they help kids learn, if you keep them locked up and not knowing anything, then how far are they going to get in life? So should these things go away or not? What do you think?
1715	4692	2	3	Censorship can have both positive and negative effects on society. While it may protect individuals from harmful or inappropriate content, it can also lead to a lack of transparency and control over information. People may feel restricted and frustrated when they are not allowed access to certain materials, leading to a sense of being kept in the dark by those in power. Ultimately, the decision to censor material should be carefully considered, weighing the potential benefits and drawbacks to ensure a balance between protection and freedom of information.
1716	4693	2	3	I somewhat agree with taking out books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material that could be offensive to someone, as it could contain racial content or inappropriate material for children. However, it ultimately depends on the individual's perspective and interests. While it may not be fair to remove certain books from libraries due to differing opinions on what is appropriate, caution should be exercised, especially when it comes to content that may be harmful to children. Parents and adults should review materials before allowing children access to them. In the end, it is up to individuals to decide what they find acceptable in the media they consume.
1717	4694	2	3	I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the shelf for any of us.' This quote from the author, Katherine Paterson, resonates with me. If everyone had the right to remove a book they disliked or found offensive, there would be limited choices for readers.   I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelves based on their personal preferences. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books, and having a diverse range of options is essential. People should have the opportunity to explore different genres, themes, and ideas, even if they may not align with their own beliefs. Removing books based on individual preferences would limit intellectual freedom and the exchange of diverse viewpoints. Therefore, it is important to uphold the principle of allowing a variety of books to remain accessible in public libraries for readers to choose from.
1718	4695	2	3	Offensive books, music, magazines, and movies should not be removed from library shelves. While some may find them inappropriate, they are essential for people who enjoy reading and entertainment. The internet poses a greater risk to corrupting minds than offensive material in libraries. People have different tastes, and offensive content can make books more interesting and engaging. It is important to preserve these materials for the enjoyment and enrichment of readers, despite the concerns of some individuals.
1719	4696	2	3	Books, movies, and magazines all offer unique forms of learning and entertainment. While some individuals may prefer one over the others, each has its own value in providing knowledge and insight. Books, with their in-depth exploration of topics, offer a detailed and thorough learning experience. Movies, on the other hand, present information in a visually stimulating way that can capture the viewer's attention and provide a different perspective. Magazines, with their concise articles, offer quick and easy access to information on a variety of subjects.  Music, though primarily seen as a form of entertainment, can also have educational value for some individuals. It can inspire, motivate, and evoke emotions that contribute to personal growth and development. While it may not provide the same level of detailed information as books or movies, music has the power to connect with people on an emotional level and enhance their overall well-being.  In conclusion, each form of media has its own unique benefits and can contribute to individual learning and personal growth in different ways. Rather than removing any form of media from shelves, it is important to recognize the value that each one brings and embrace the diverse ways in which they can enrich our lives.
1720	4697	2	3	I am a student from @CAPS1. I wanted to share that I have come across some interesting books in both my school's library and the public library. However, there have been complaints from friends and family members about the books available. Some have suggested removing books that are not to their liking, but I believe that taking books out would not be beneficial.  Firstly, my friends have expressed dissatisfaction with the selection of books in the school library. If books are removed based on individual preferences, it may discourage others from utilizing the library. Access to a variety of books is essential for students to excel in their studies and limiting this access could hinder their academic progress.  Additionally, a family member witnessed a young girl reading an inappropriate book at the public library. Rather than removing such books, they should be placed in a designated section not accessible to children. This way, the books can still be available for those who need them while ensuring that they are not accessed by the wrong audience.  Overall, books play a crucial role in education and should not be taken lightly. Instead of removing books, individuals can request the books they prefer to read. By keeping a diverse collection of books, more people will be encouraged to read and learn.  In conclusion, retaining books in libraries is essential as they hold valuable knowledge that can benefit readers of all ages. Books should be preserved and made accessible to those who seek information, and inappropriate materials should be stored appropriately. Removing books may limit opportunities for learning and exploration, so it is important to maintain a wide range of reading materials for everyone.
1721	4698	2	3	There are things in this world that are relative. Censorship is one of them. Relative means that one person has a different view than that of another. Censorship is when a person or organization in authority does not allow people to see things that they believe are inappropriate. One phrase that is very important to censorship is 'things that they believe.' What is inappropriate to one person could be deemed viewable to another. This should not be decided by one person or even one group that believes they know what is socially acceptable or politically correct. Censorship in libraries is not a good thing.  Imagine two individuals, Person 1 and Person 2, walking into a library. Person 1 believes in providing for his family and exercising his Second Amendment rights, while Person 2 is against killing animals and prefers not to know where her meat comes from. They come across a hunting magazine that depicts a successful hunt. Person 1 sees this as an opportunity to gain knowledge and improve his skills, while Person 2 finds it inappropriate. Should this magazine be censored because of Person 2's views? The choice should be left to the individual to decide what they want to read.  In another scenario, Person 1 is a science enthusiast while Person 2 prefers religious books. They encounter a book on evolution, with Person 1 finding it interesting and Person 2 dismissing it as untrue. Should this book be removed from the shelves because Person 2 disagrees with its content? No, the choice to read or ignore the book should be left to the individual.  Librarians, like everyone else, are entitled to their opinions. However, the materials in a library should not be chosen based on personal preferences but on the potential value they hold for the readers. Censorship restricts access to information that could be useful to someone.  In conclusion, censorship is a relative concept, and what one person finds inappropriate, another may find valuable. People should have the freedom to choose what they want to read or view without interference. Libraries should be places where all perspectives and ideas are available for those who seek them.
1722	4699	2	3	Certain materials found in libraries may not always be age-appropriate for young children. It is important to be mindful of the content that children are exposed to, as some books, music, movies, and magazines may contain themes that are not suitable for their age group. For example, music in today's society often includes explicit content related to sex, drugs, and violence, which can have a negative influence on young minds.  During a visit to a school library, I encountered a movie that I deemed inappropriate for students without parental verification. Exposure to content about sex and drugs at a young age can lead children to believe that such behaviors are acceptable, as they may emulate what they see or hear. It is crucial for libraries to ensure that materials on their shelves are suitable for all age groups, and librarians should take measures to monitor and restrict access to inappropriate content.  Books with covers depicting violence, guns, drugs, or sexual content can be enticing to children, making it challenging for them to resist reading such material. While school libraries typically maintain age-appropriate selections, public libraries cater to a broader audience, including adults, leading to a mix of content that may not be suitable for children. It is essential for libraries to exercise caution in curating their collections and implementing measures to prevent juveniles from accessing inappropriate materials.  In conclusion, libraries play a vital role in providing access to information and entertainment, but they must also prioritize the protection of young readers by monitoring the content available for their consumption. By implementing age restrictions and verifying parental consent for certain materials, libraries can create a safer and more conducive environment for children to explore and learn.
1723	4700	2	3	All things in the world are not strictly black and white. Every person is different, with varying ideas. So when some people are certain that a specific word or topic should be restricted, there will always be another person to say the exact opposite. Sometimes, what's found as 'vulgar' can only be introduced with the intent of education. Also, this ties in with something our country was founded on, which is freedom of speech, and the press. Magazines, music, books, and movies are mainly for entertainment. Everyone who reads or watches something will take it in differently, and it will have a varying effect. Let's say there is a 10-year-old girl who just had her first day of high school. While at lunch, she slipped and dropped her tray of food. Later that day while she's alone reading her favorite magazine, she's reading an article about embarrassing stories, where one girl accidentally walked into a boys' restroom. Some parents may deem this inappropriate, but it has made the young girl feel better about her situation. It's human to mess up and act crazy; we aren't perfect by nature. So when we see errors made into comedies and dramas by any form of media, it's human to realize that we aren't the only ones who undergo these events. To censor books and television would be like claiming nothing bad happens. Not to say that a novel written about brutal murder that contains sexual references should be given to a little kid, but it should not be pulled from the shelf altogether. The topic of censorship in schools is also a very sensitive one, especially with younger kids. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if every parent had the right to remove a book that they thought was not suitable, then eventually there would be nothing left. Many parents are uneasy with the thought of their child being taught things like sexual education, but on the other hand, there are also the parents who appreciate it. They do so not because it saves them time, but because certain explicit topics - to an extent - can help someone mature if it's done in a controlled environment. Years ago, it was not uncommon to see censorship in the media. It could range from saying 'intercourse' to replace 'sex' or it could be something like extreme propaganda. There's a reason that our constitution protects freedom of speech. No matter how appalling someone may find a topic, it usually has some type of informative purpose. Otherwise, it probably wouldn't have gotten issued. Choosing what is and isn't offensive is a matter of opinion. As previously stated, no two humans are exactly the same, and their opinions won't be either. So this means that if one person out of a group is allowed to dispose of or censor whatever they find necessary, it must be recognized that some portion of the remaining people will be unsatisfied. This is usually where people will claim that the law protects their freedom of speech. In the end, the media is largely for entertainment. It provides numerous shows and articles, with a huge array of topics. This goes to show that if one should find something offensive, it doesn't mean they have to rip it off the shelves and complain; it simply means they have the opportunity to look elsewhere. Ultimately, the diversity of opinions and the freedom to express them are essential aspects of a democratic society.
1724	4701	2	3	There are various perspectives on censorship in our country, reflecting the diverse opinions held by different groups such as the old, young, parents, and children. While some may find certain materials in libraries offensive, it is important to acknowledge the varied viewpoints that exist. It is crucial for individuals to approach the issue with maturity and understanding. Censorship, although sometimes contentious, plays a role in maintaining order and protecting individuals, especially children, from inappropriate content. By upholding censorship in libraries, we can ensure that knowledge is accessible while also being mindful of what is suitable for different age groups. Ultimately, parents should take responsibility for guiding their children's exposure to certain materials in libraries. In conclusion, the presence of censorship in libraries serves as a balance between providing information and safeguarding individuals, making it a necessary aspect of our society.
1725	4702	2	3	I do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library. If they have a problem with certain material in certain books, they should bring it to the attention of the library. The author who wrote that book has the freedom of speech, and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write. If somebody did not want their children looking at a book, or reading that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away from it, and if they raised their child properly, he or she should respect those boundaries that the parents have set.  However, I think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library. Some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational, such as National Geographic. On the other hand, I am not saying that we should be lining shelves with explicit magazines either. There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures, and those that educate them about sex and explicit material. It is the adult's job to protect their children from material such as that. But they can do it in another way, other than taking the book off the shelf.  Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands. The owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the customers. I think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or simply go to a different library. If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much, you could go to court and plead your case to the judge. But you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you.
1726	4703	2	3	When picking a book, music, movie, and magazines from the library, it's always a hard decision because you may want to read more than one book at a time. Books that are considered offensive can be more interesting than plain boring books. So why would anybody remove books from the shelves for being offensive?  When children choose books from the library, it is important to ensure they are age-appropriate and educational. Separating books into adult and children's sections can help prevent young readers from accessing inappropriate content. Having a wide variety of books available encourages people to visit the library. Removing books could deter people from using the library altogether.  For individuals who cannot afford to purchase books, libraries serve as a valuable resource for borrowing materials. Removing books would limit access to information and learning opportunities for those who rely on the library.  While it may be acceptable to remove offensive materials for the sake of children's safety, a public vote should be considered before making such decisions. Instead of completely removing offensive books, creating an adult section in the library could be a more effective solution. This way, individuals who are of a certain age can access these materials while ensuring that children are not exposed to inappropriate content. Keeping offensive books accessible in a designated section can make it easier for patrons to find the content they are interested in without restricting access to diverse perspectives.
1727	4704	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Katherine Paterson. Katherine Paterson is an author who, like the quote from her, believes that some books should never reach the hands of children. Does everyone believe the same way, no. I am one of those few people who believe that no one should have the right to remove a book simply because they find the book offensive.  Your an old fashion woman who believes in old fashion ideals such as no cursing or violence. You, as this woman, pick up a book and read the first page, on this page you see cursing and decide to remove all books with violence or cursing from the library. The library soon becomes half empty because of one woman and her beliefs. Beliefs are a wonderful thing outside of reading and can make you who you want to be. Books do not, in my opinion, have beliefs. This is true for some books but a book where someone runs from danger or flies into the sky, those are not beliefs those are dreams and no one can crush dreams offensive or not.  I compare books to dreams simply for the fact that they are dreams, the dreams of the authors who wrote them and wanted to share that dream with the world. Telling a person they cannot publish their book simply because another person finds it offensive is telling the author your dream is offensive. If you do not want your child to share this book of dreams then do not let your child pick up the book. You are the parent of the child who picks up this book then you can protect it from the offensive danger it holds like you protect it from the dangers of strangers in the real world.  Authors do not always write for the sake of everyone. Authors do not write for one woman, one man, one child, authors write for those who share a similar dream. If you do not share the same dream as the author that is fine, no one is forcing you to share in their sometimes dark and sometimes amazing dreams. Authors write because they wish to write, to express themselves in ways only words and stories can. Do not shun a book because one thing in it offends you, a book is someone's dream.  In short, you would never crush your child's dreams. If your child wants to grow up and be a fireman you do not tell them that it is offensive to people so they can't. Why would you do something to someone else's dream who you have never met. Be a bigger person and allow that person to live their dream through a story. No matter the level of offense you do not have to pick up the book and read it. The number one way to not be offended by a book that may offend you is to never read the book to start with.
1728	4705	2	3	Certain offensive materials that are created solely to offend others should be removed from shelves everywhere. It is morally wrong to intentionally hurt or belittle others, and such actions can have detrimental effects on the mental health of individuals. Continuous exposure to offensive content can lead to feelings of depression and worthlessness, as seen in personal experiences where individuals have been targeted and bullied. Furthermore, the novelty of offensive materials will eventually wear off, and people will lose interest in supporting content that aims to offend. Ultimately, there is no benefit in spreading negativity and causing harm to others. It is crucial to promote kindness and respect in all forms of media and eliminate offensive materials from circulation to create a more positive and inclusive society.
1729	4706	2	3	In my personal opinion, I believe that books that some people find offensive should not be removed. Just because a book is deemed offensive by one person does not mean that everyone will feel the same way. Libraries cater to various age groups and grade levels, ensuring that inappropriate content is not accessed by the wrong audience. It is important to consider the diverse preferences and perspectives of individuals when it comes to literature. Removing a book simply because one person finds it offensive may deprive others of the opportunity to enjoy it. Therefore, I believe that books should not be removed based solely on personal opinions of offensiveness.
1730	4707	2	3	There are both good and bad books out there, with different people finding different books offensive or enjoyable. While reading can improve literacy skills, some books may not be suitable for certain audiences. It is important for parents to monitor what their children are reading to prevent them from being exposed to inappropriate content. Libraries typically have sections for children and adults to help with this, but it is ultimately up to individuals to ensure that potentially harmful material is kept out of reach of children. By being mindful of what books are accessible to children, we can help them develop positive reading habits and avoid exposure to unsuitable content.
1731	4708	2	3	Banning books in libraries due to controversial content is a topic of debate in society. While some argue for censorship to protect certain groups, others believe in the freedom to choose what to read. It is important to consider that individuals have the right to decide what they want to read without restrictions. Restricting access to books may prevent people from accessing valuable information or well-written stories. Instead of outright banning books, libraries could consider segregating them into separate sections based on content. This way, readers can still access a wide range of materials while ensuring age-appropriate content. Authors should also have a say in the availability of their books, as they invest time and effort in creating their work. It is essential to balance the concerns of the community with the rights of authors to express themselves through their writing. Ultimately, the decision to ban a book should be carefully considered, taking into account the impact on readers and the value of the content.
1732	4709	2	3	In my opinion, everyone should have the right to access a wide variety of books, magazines, movies, and music at the library. The public library serves as a valuable resource for individuals who may not have access to these materials otherwise, such as those without a computer at home. It is important for libraries to cater to the diverse interests and preferences of their patrons by offering a comprehensive collection of reading and viewing materials.  While some individuals may not appreciate certain books, movies, or magazines, it is crucial to respect the freedom of others to explore and enjoy these materials. Just because a particular item may not appeal to one person does not mean it should be removed from the shelves for others who may find it valuable. Each individual has the right to choose what they want to read or watch, and the library should strive to provide a wide range of options to accommodate varying tastes and interests.  Overall, I believe that libraries should continue to offer a diverse selection of books, magazines, movies, and music to meet the needs and preferences of their community. By doing so, libraries can fulfill their role as a valuable resource for information, entertainment, and education for people of all backgrounds and interests.
1733	4710	2	3	I think that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People enjoy books with offensive language or content, people love to feel the energy or tone of the writer. I personally love offensive language; if everything was censored, it would feel like everything is dull and fake.   Instead of removing them, why not just move them to an adult section of the library? The adult section will warn kids and parents of what they are getting into. If parents do not want their children to be exposed to certain content, then they should not be in that area. Libraries are usually divided into sections, but if not, you can ask local libraries if they separate adult and children's books into different sections.   It is important to allow people the freedom to choose what they want to read or watch, even if it may be offensive to some. By segregating these materials into appropriate sections, individuals can still access them while also giving parents the ability to control what their children are exposed to. Censorship should not be the answer; instead, let people make their own choices while also providing guidance and warnings where necessary.
1734	4711	2	3	Censorship in the arts is a complex issue, as what may be offensive to some may not be to others. The line between artistic expression and censorship is often blurred, leading to controversy. In the music industry, there have been concerns about the impact of explicit content on teenagers, as they may glamorize harmful behaviors. However, in literature and art, censorship can stifle the expression of thoughts and emotions, limiting the freedom of artists to convey their message. While societal norms and perceptions change over time, the subjective nature of what is considered offensive remains a challenge. Despite efforts by parents to shield children from certain content, censorship alone cannot eradicate real-world problems. Ultimately, while censorship may seem like a quick fix, it merely masks underlying issues without addressing them effectively.
1735	4712	2	3	Although it is a new day and age where demand is high for electronic books, hardback and paperback books are not obsolete quite yet. Many people still enjoy the old tradition of visiting libraries and embarking on a quest for the perfect book. Additionally, with the current economic situation, opting for physical books is a more cost-effective choice. However, some individuals may not find everything they desire at their local library due to censorship.  It is true that many libraries censor materials that they deem inappropriate for children. While some adults and teens may seek more mature content, it should not be readily available for young audiences. Parents, who are loyal library customers along with their children, prefer to shield their young ones from explicit materials. If libraries were to lose young families as patrons, a significant portion of their clientele would be lost.  Therefore, when seeking material that may not be suitable for children, it is advisable to consider alternative options such as purchasing from a bookstore. This ensures that children can remain in a safe and innocent environment without being exposed to content that is not age-appropriate. By making conscious choices about the content available in libraries, we can uphold a positive and welcoming space for all patrons.
1736	4713	2	3	No, just because a book or song or magazine article or movie is offensive does not mean that we should have the right to take it off the shelves. Sure we have a right to remove that book but there are a lot things that are going to offend people. Just because someone comes across an offensive book at the library doesn't mean that they should have to go through so much work to get it removed off the shelf. Its not worth the trouble for just a book that you could just simply look past and look at other books. If it was possible for anyone to just take a book off a shelf because they thought it was offensive we would have a lot of empty book stores. Because face it people can and will be offended easily if something they believe, like religion, is being made fun of in a book that they had read about. We all get offended but just move on from it and find something different. We are not forced to read that book or listen to that song or look at the magazine. We have a choice and the choice can be to move on and read or look at something different, more positive, or go through the process to get it removed and taken off the shelf. You never know someone else might think that maybe that article in that magazine was beneficial or relating. So it should not be up to one person, but if a whole community has a problem with a book then I can see removing it can be an option.
1737	4714	2	3	"I think that some books in the library some people might take offensive. But some of those books have a meaning behind it.            I think theres one book out there that alot of people love to read, and that is ""Huckleberry Finn"". The book uses the 'N' word alot and many people take that offensive, but why? There was a big arguement about alot of book companies changing the word in the book to ""slave"" or ""person"".             From my perspective I think it should stay the same. Why change that now? Many english teachers use that book because it talks about a white boy named Huck saving Jim. Its not being used in a bad why at all just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days. The book is strong and shows readers a strong aspect in life.             Yes you shouldn't go around saying that word, but also not change it now, after its been out for along time to the public. The book would not bring the same meaning as it would if it is  being changed."
1738	4715	2	3	Katherine Paterson wrote about the true impact of censoring what is put in a library. In the quote she mentions how if what every single person finds offensive is removed, eventually nothing is left. The question of, 'Should library content be censored?' is a largely debated question. There is a simple answer to this question. It should not be censored. Views on what should be censored and why, vary based on type of person and their background. As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @PERSON2 made the observation that most people would not think far enough to realize. The most logical thing is to not censor what works are put into libraries. As was previously stated, once every person pulls what they deem should not be on shelves, the library will be but a building without books. To keep children from getting into certain types of literature, movies, and music, libraries could have a section set off within the adult section for these works. Many public libraries do not even have these types of items that would be so highly disputed for the simple fact that if the library does not even carry it, they do not have to worry about issues. These public institutions are working for the best of the visitors, and if there are works needing to be kept from the childrens' section, there is no doubt that this would be taken care of appropriately. The topic of censorship is a very touchy subject to start with. This goes back to the debate of what exactly should be censored. The problem with what is 'explicit,' is that there is no black and white line. Does a book become inappropriate because a teen girl becomes pregnant within the pages? In some eyes, the fact that a teenager got inpregnated within a book makes it inappropriate, but critics will argue that this is life and to shield the world from reality makes us all blind. Proper instillation of morals and values on the homefront will help young citizens make intelligent choices, but expecting the world to censor itself for each individual is something that would never be possible. Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject, but like Katherine Paterson said, if every person in the world removed what they thought inappropriate, there would be no books left. This truth being stated, censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone. As the world turns, life cannot be stopped because bad or inappropriate things exist. It can only be learned that yes, these things @MONTH1 exist, but by using better judgement the whole world can get along just fine without trying to remove everything 'bad.'
1739	4716	2	3	I agree that individuals should have the freedom to read, listen to, or view whatever material they choose without censorship. It is unfair for schools or any institution to dictate what we can or cannot access. In a country like America, where freedom of expression is a fundamental right, we should be able to make our own choices regarding the content we consume. If something is offensive to one person, it may not be to another, so individuals should have the autonomy to decide for themselves. Censoring material because of the preferences of a few is unjust and goes against the principles of freedom and diversity. We should stand together against censorship and advocate for the right to access a variety of viewpoints and ideas. Let us fight for our freedom to choose what we read, listen to, and view.
1740	4717	2	3	I believe that no books should be censored or taken away from public libraries. Everyone, regardless of age, should have the right to access information and content that interests them. If certain materials contain explicit content, it should be the responsibility of individuals, especially parents, to monitor what they or their children are exposed to. Libraries should have the freedom to curate their collections based on their own discretion, and if certain materials are deemed inappropriate, they can be restricted from certain age groups. Overall, censorship in libraries should be minimal to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to explore a wide range of ideas and perspectives.
1741	4718	2	3	If I found a book that I thought was inappropriate for others to read, I would ask the librarian to check into it to see what she thinks about the book(s). If she believed they were offensive, then she could remove the book(s) without any questions being asked. If she was unsure about a book, she could take a vote or tally on that book to decide if it needed to be removed. In my opinion, offensive content in a book could include inappropriate pictures or language, especially if it is racist or contains foul language.   When it comes to offensive movies, I would suggest that they be moved to a section where only mature adults or teenagers can access them. Movies with inappropriate content can have a negative influence on young viewers, leading them to mimic dangerous behaviors depicted in the film. Parents also play a crucial role in monitoring what their children watch to prevent them from being exposed to harmful content.   Music is another form of media that can contain offensive subjects, such as violence and explicit sexual content. Some songs glorify drug use and violence, which can have a detrimental impact on listeners, especially young people. Artists should be more mindful of the messages they convey in their music, considering the potential influence it may have on their audience.   Overall, while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, certain content should not be readily available for children and adolescents. It is important to consider the impact that media consumption can have on individuals, especially the younger generation. Efforts should be made to regulate offensive content in books, movies, and music to create a safer and more positive media environment for all.
1742	4719	2	3	'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly yhe same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' states Katherine Paterson. Books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content. I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelf, and that they are there for a genuine purpose. Explicit objects should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, children's parents have a right to exclude the material from the child's life, and some material can be useful in life and someone @MONTH1 learn from @CAPS3.      Children everywhere are being influenced by books, magazines, movies, and even songs. Some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act. I, however, believe that a child should have superb morals and values to know right from wrong. For example, if a child happens to see a pornography magazine lingering on a shelf of their local grocerey store, they should know that no matter how temping @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, that buying that pornography magazine would be wrong. From birth, parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong. They attempt to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol, and smoking will corrupt their health. @CAPS3 doesn't matter if a child sees someone doing drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk. They should not be influenced by this because by using their logic, they should infer that what is being read or listened to isn't always the right thing to do.     Everyday, children's parents have the right to exclude harmful material from a child's life. After all, they are a superior figure in the child's life, and the child will always look up to them to lead the way. At most local theaters now, you have to be seventeen to see a rated '@CAPS1' movie. A lot of theaters allow a child to view a rated '@CAPS1' movie, no matter what age, as long as they have a parent or a gardian present. Movie theaters feel that by having a child's parent there would help immensly because the parent is choosing for their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child viewing the movie without their permission. If a parent doesn't want their child to view a raunchy movie, they can simple say, 'NO!' @CAPS3's as simple as that. If a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch, then go ahead and let them watch that material. Parental agreement should always be a main factor in determined whether or not a child could view a particular movie or read a certain provacative book.      If all offensive books and movies were removed from the shelf, we would be living in a structured world where no one would learn any more than what they already knew. Life @MONTH1 possibly become rather boring. Although, some people @MONTH1 find books and songs to be offensive, others @MONTH1 contribute from these materials. A child @MONTH1 pick up a book, start reading, and discover some disturbing thoughts that they never would have encountered beyond picking up that book. They would never of learned such things. Reading information like this, creates a move advanced society. Adults and children are becoming smarter each day. Any parent would agree that they would love any opprotunity to arise for their children to become smarter and more wiser than they already were. Songs, movies, books, and magazines could provide that for their child. Reading is an escape from a jungle of wild monkies for some children. They @MONTH1 use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages. If more and more books are being censored and thrown out, that equates to less books a child could have an opprotunity to discover. I once read that even @CAPS4 classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read The @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 @CAPS7. The teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students. This is unfair for any student, because this novel is inspiring and life changing, so they are definitely missing out. Also, movies and songs are provided for one's pure entertainment, so @CAPS3 shouldn't always matter if its crude. A child or young adult @MONTH1 learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials.     In conclusion, books, magaizines, movies, and music are one's

It can also influence behavior, affecting the way people speak and act. However, it is essential to consider the impact of profanity on children. Young minds are impressionable, and exposure to profanity at a young age can have detrimental effects on their development. Therefore, it is important to restrict access to profanity for children, such as by ensuring age-appropriate content in books, movies, and music. While profanity can be a powerful tool in entertainment, it is crucial to be mindful of its potential consequences and make responsible choices regarding its consumption. By being aware of the effects of profanity and taking steps to limit its exposure to children, we can create a more positive and respectful environment for all.
1744	4721	2	3	All materials in a library are for the public, as public libraries exist to serve the community. Children are often accompanied by adults in libraries, seeking age-appropriate books and activities. If a library patron finds a book offensive, it is likely intentional, as library materials are available for anyone to access.   Children may be curious in libraries, knowing that adult content is also present. It is the responsibility of parents or guardians to monitor their children's library use and guide them to appropriate materials. While some may not mind their children encountering certain content, others may have different preferences.   Libraries organize materials in a way that segregates adult and inappropriate content from children's areas. It is up to individuals to choose what they want to read or view in a library setting. Offensive material can also extend to content that may be offensive to different races or cultures, emphasizing the need for awareness and respect.   In conclusion, libraries provide a range of materials for the public, and it is essential for individuals to be mindful of what they access. Parents should supervise their children in libraries to ensure they stay within appropriate areas. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of individuals to select materials that align with their preferences and values while respecting the diversity of content available in a library setting.
1745	4722	2	3	In our society, many people and places are quick to take offense to certain things. However, I believe that libraries and bookstores should not remove items from their shelves simply because they may be deemed offensive. Everyone has the right to choose what they read, watch, or listen to, and it is important to allow individuals to make their own decisions about what they find offensive. If a particular book or movie is causing such a strong negative reaction, then perhaps it should not have been created in the first place.   Music, in particular, is a form of expression, and I do not believe it should be censored when sold in stores. If the content is too explicit for certain individuals, they have the option to simply not listen to it. It is not necessary to censor material just because it may contain offensive language or themes. Ultimately, if something offends you, it is best to avoid it rather than demand its removal from public spaces. Everyone has different tastes and sensitivities, and it is important to respect individual autonomy in choosing what media to consume.
1746	4723	2	3	When it comes to my idea of having censorship in libraries around the world, I believe that there are cases when certain books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials should not be available to the public. Throughout my years in school, I have come across numerous instances where I felt that the content of certain materials was inappropriate for individuals of all ages.  I have encountered books that contain explicit content such as drugs, sex, and other mature themes that I believe should not be accessible to young children or teenagers. Additionally, I have seen offensive behavior portrayed in books that were marketed towards a younger audience, leading me to question the appropriateness of the content being offered in libraries.  Moreover, I have found that offensive and inappropriate material can also be present in magazines, movies, and music. While the instances of offensive music in libraries may be less common, I have witnessed cases where certain music was deemed offensive and inappropriate for listeners of all ages.  As teenagers grow older, I believe that they should be able to understand the importance of maturity and appropriate behavior. Exposure to offensive and inappropriate material can have a negative impact on their development and behavior, leading to undesirable outcomes. Therefore, it is crucial for parents, teachers, and librarians to carefully evaluate the materials they recommend to children and teenagers.  In conclusion, it is essential for libraries to reevaluate the types of materials they offer to the public to ensure that they are appropriate for all ages. By taking steps to limit the availability of offensive and inappropriate content, we can help shape the minds of the youth in a positive way and contribute to a more peaceful and respectful society.
1747	4724	2	3	I believe that everyone has the right to their own opinion. If a parent does not approve of something, they should communicate that to their child and guide them accordingly. This principle extends to various aspects of life, such as hunting or personal preferences in music, movies, and books. By expressing our opinions honestly, we can create a better understanding and avoid conflicts. For instance, my father taught me the importance of hunting for food, except for coyotes, which are considered pests in our area. Parents can influence their children by living according to the values they teach. If parents do not want their children exposed to certain content, such as rated movies, they can take measures to restrict access. Ultimately, open communication and consistency in behavior can help shape the values and choices of the younger generation.
1748	4725	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a contentious issue, especially when it comes to determining what is appropriate for children. Factors such as racism, cultural beliefs, and religious beliefs all play a role in this debate. Racist comments and materials have no place in a child's reading material, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and attitudes. Similarly, materials that disparage or disrespect certain cultural or religious beliefs should not be accessible to children. Children should be exposed to diverse perspectives and beliefs in a respectful and educational manner. Creating separate sections in libraries for materials that may be deemed inappropriate for children can help ensure that young readers are exposed to age-appropriate and enriching content. Ultimately, it is important for libraries to carefully consider the materials they make available to children, taking into account the potential impact on their developing minds and attitudes.
1749	4726	2	3	Every single person has their own beliefs and disbeliefs when it comes to books, music, or anything in life. What may be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion may not be bad in others' opinionated views. Everyone will have their own views about a book, music, movies, or magazines. That's why censorship is good in a public place like a library. Does that mean we're saying that you can't like what you want to like, listen to what you want to listen to, or watch what you want to watch in your own home? No, by censoring all that in public places like libraries or video stores, you're helping to prevent potential issues and concerns that could arise in the future.   On the other hand, censoring movies, music, books, and magazines in a library could also be a negative thing. Not everyone is going to like the same things or be interested in all the same movies or books. At the same time, we can't censor everything that someone doesn't like. Removing something because one parent has a complaint about their child watching or reading a book they found too 'vulgar' gives that right to any parent who complains about their child doing the same. It's not the library's responsibility to monitor every child or ensure they only watch or read what their parents approve of. Children will do what they want to do.   Censoring and removing items from library shelves doesn't prevent children from watching movies they shouldn't see or reading books they shouldn't read. Censoring libraries is similar to censoring words in movies; it doesn't stop children from hearing or learning vulgar language. Children today hear more vulgar words in school than they do in movies and television.   The concept of what is offensive varies from person to person. Everyone has their own opinion on what's offensive and what's not. We all have the freedom to look at what we want and listen to the music we choose. Taking items off library shelves because one person finds them offensive restricts the rights of other citizens. Censoring some things, like sex scenes in movies or vulgar language in music, is acceptable in my opinion. However, removing books because of personal preferences regarding the writing style, author, or language used is crossing a line. Books help children learn and imagine, and by restricting access to certain books, we may hinder a child's development.  Censorship has both positive and negative aspects. It can either hinder or aid a child's growth and development. While censoring some content is necessary, not everything with vulgar language or themes should be censored. Children need exposure to different perspectives in order to grow and navigate the complexities of the world. Ultimately, a balanced approach to censorship is essential to support both freedom of expression and responsible content consumption.
1750	4727	2	3	This is along the lines of personal thought. Some people can be happy with things, while others disagree. Unless it's racist or sexist, no one has any right at all to say something can't belong. If someone doesn't like a book, then walk away from it; don't ponder at why it's there, someone else may want it. So I don't like this topic personally, but I am okay with writing about it. It's not a choice just like it really shouldn't even be a choice for people to say what belongs where, unless it is rightfully owned by the individual. I know there are many things I don't like, but I don't try and get things moved and banned. It's there; people want to read it. Plus, the person who wrote or made the object would be shot down in sadness or rejection.   Along the lines of insulting a race and/or being sexist, if that is being done in the book it should be stopped and disposed of. People have the right to say they are not happy with that, but if they just don't like the topic but others do, then they need to move on and not make a big deal out of it. Now, if the title clearly states what the book is about, then walk away; don't pay attention to it. People may use it for research or something in the future. Now, some people may be self-centered and just want what they need so they cause a huge uproar or fight over stupid little things. That's the people that always got things handed to them, which I imagine is why this topic came up.   So, that is my thoughts and beliefs about the topic of Censorship. It doesn't matter where, in school or at a library; it is there because someone is/was interested in the item. I know this is my thoughts and beliefs; people may completely think what I wrote is stupid, some may think it's smart. It's just the culture you grew up in and the state of mind you are in at that current time and place.
1751	4728	2	3	I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. Some people may find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things. Take rap music for example. There are many people that think that the lyrics of those songs are just terrible and offensive. Other people think that rap music is amazing. I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go to the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the albums should not be sold in stores. The same thing could be said for these materials in the library. Some may find them offensive but others greatly appreciate it.  Some people may be interested in these topics. Just like some people may be interested in fantasy or comedy. It would not be fair for libraries to remove these materials from the library, and deny the people that do like them the right to rent these materials.  Another factor is the maturity of the reader. If the person who is reading a book or viewing movies that may be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then there is no problem with it. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there. It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library. The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else may find those materials offensive is no reason to take them off the shelf.  I can see why some parents may be upset that their kids may see some of the things in the library that may not be appropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have had a special area for kids' materials. If the parents were worried about their kids seeing some of the questionable materials they could bring the kid to that area.  I don't think that these materials that may seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries. Everyone is going to be offended by something and it is not fair to deprive others of those materials even if it is offensive to some.
1752	4729	2	3	Censorship in libraries should not be allowed as libraries are meant to provide a diverse range of books for people to explore and enjoy. The selection of books in a library is the responsibility of the owner, who aims to cater to various tastes and preferences. If a reader finds a book offensive, they should address their concerns with the library owner rather than simply discarding the book. Books are meant to be shared and discussed, allowing individuals to express their opinions and engage in dialogue with others. By allowing freedom of expression in libraries, we can foster a more vibrant and intellectually stimulating community where diverse viewpoints are respected and valued. In conclusion, censorship in libraries hinders the exchange of ideas and limits the opportunity for individuals to explore different perspectives, making it essential to uphold the principles of intellectual freedom in these institutions.
1753	4730	2	3	I changed the name of the organization in this story that I heard from my grandparents because I could not remember the real one. This is not really happening at the organization I think. To the people at the organization I would like to tell you and your readers that there is something wrong with the organization. Nothing really all too serious I guess. It seems the librarians there are censoring tons of books and other materials. One of which I really need for a homework assignment on the movie. They say that they are censoring what I need for the assignment because it is too bloody and scary for some of the other readers. There have also been some complaints from parents as well, saying that their kids had nightmares for weeks from the movie.  To that I said well can I still use the computers there to get information. They said that they have already blocked all the inappropriate sites as well. I do not have internet at home so you can see how well that is going to go at school. So then I tried to get the organization to uncensor all of the stuff they have already censored. So that way I could just make them censor all the weird adult-rated things at the organization. That way no kid will have nightmares anymore. I also threw in the idea of separating all the books and movies by age group like child, teen, older teen. To this they said alright but they were going to keep the classic books and movies.  The organization said they will try my idea and see if it works but I would have to volunteer at the organization and go through all the stuff that has been censored over the years. To this I said okay, but after I saw how big the censor list was, it was like a nightmare - over a hundred pages of books at least. I was too scared to see how long the other lists were. So seeing that it was too big for me to handle alone, I got most of the other volunteers to help me. Then put up posters at the school I go to, to see if anyone else would be willing to help me.  So far there has not been much progress in the lists so I would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article. I could sure use your help because these are some really long lists. I thank you all for reading this article, if you are not able to help then see if there is anyone else you know that would be willing to help too, thank you.
1754	4731	2	3	I think that if there are offensive books, music, magazines, etc then they should be put in a section of their own, or the librarians should have them kept up and if someone needs/wants them then they would have to go to the front dest in order to get them. I think also, if a young child or teenager can't see, read, or hear those types of things than they should not be in there period. This segregation can help protect individuals from being exposed to materials that they may find offensive or inappropriate, while still allowing access to those who choose to seek them out. By implementing these measures, libraries can cater to the diverse needs and preferences of their patrons in a responsible and considerate manner.
1755	4732	2	3	Censorship in Libraries and Schools  Have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate? Did you want to ban the book from the library you got it from? Well many people have experienced this and many of them have wanted to have more censorship in libraries but we cannot always do this. Maybe that book that you just put down, deeming it inappropriate for all to read it, is someone else's favorite book. You never know but maybe someone might think your favorite book is not appropriate. There are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions. So instead of banning them how about libraries and schools just censor them.  Censoring seems like a no-brainer but a lot of people do not think about it. We cannot just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them. Censoring them could be as simple as just putting a tag on them or making a different section for just those kinds of books. The tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book.  People do not have to get rid of some books completely but they need to recognize that young children could pick it up and start reading it without knowing that it is not very appropriate for them. Parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading. Although if you just get rid of the book completely, people are also getting rid of other people's freedom of speech. No one has the right to determine what books are not appropriate and what books are, so no one should have the right to just have certain books just removed from the shelves.  Instead of banning the books or complaining about them, people could try a rating system for books. When you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves. This is what we could do with books too and maybe there will not be as many problems with books. It sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it.  You may not be able to make everyone happy but at least people can be more informed about the books they are reading. If everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and school more censored than all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure.
1756	4733	2	3	Offensive materials in libraries can vary from books, music, movies, and magazines, but what may be offensive to some may not be offensive to others. It is important not to remove these materials from library shelves simply because a few individuals find them offensive, as there will always be someone who enjoys them. People have different preferences and what one person finds offensive, another may find enjoyable. Therefore, all materials should be available to the public in libraries, allowing individuals the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. Censorship in libraries restricts access to information and limits people's choices. It is essential to uphold the right to access a variety of materials, even if some may find them offensive. Everyone should have the opportunity to explore different perspectives and ideas through reading, watching, and listening to a wide range of content. Ultimately, individuals should have the freedom to decide for themselves what they find offensive and what they want to engage with, without others imposing their views on them.
1757	4734	2	3	Todays world is filled with racism and criticism. Anything we do is either right or wrong, no in-between. Offensive comments and images can be found everywhere, from restaurants to shopping centers. The media often amplifies events, making them appear worse than they actually are, which can be offensive to certain individuals.  When it comes to choosing books, movies, or music, everyone has different preferences. What one person finds offensive, another may not. It is important to remember that individuals have the freedom to express themselves through their art, whether it be writing, singing, or creating visuals.  In a society that values freedom of speech, it is crucial to respect the diverse range of opinions and perspectives. Libraries and stores should not remove items simply because they are deemed offensive by some. Instead, individuals have the autonomy to select what they consume based on their own values and beliefs.  While offensive content related to race, culture, appearance, or other sensitive topics may exist, it is ultimately up to each individual to choose what they engage with. It is essential to rise above negativity and focus on what brings us together rather than what tears us apart.  In conclusion, the presence of offensive material in books, music, and magazines should not warrant their removal from shelves. Everyone has the right to choose what they read, listen to, and view, and it is important to embrace this diversity of perspectives in a free and open society.
1758	4735	2	3	I think that if the books, music, magazines, or movies in a library are not offensive, then they have the right to be placed on the shelves. It is important to cater to a diverse range of interests and preferences, allowing individuals to access a variety of materials that suit their tastes. By offering a selection of different media, libraries can engage a wider audience and promote a love for learning and exploration. However, if any material is found to be offensive or inappropriate, it should be removed to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all users. Ultimately, the presence of non-offensive books, music, magazines, and movies in a library can enrich the experience for patrons and contribute to a more inclusive and welcoming space for everyone.
1759	4736	2	3	Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves just because they are deemed offensive or because children may have access to them and potentially repeat what they have encountered. These materials should remain available because they offer valuable lessons on what to do and what not to do, as well as insights into history, whether it be our own or that of another country. While it is true that some content in libraries may not be suitable for children, restricting access does not guarantee they will not seek it out. Some individuals are drawn to this so-called offensive material and can benefit from the knowledge it provides. Research has shown that some people are better equipped to navigate real-world challenges when exposed to the realities of violence rather than shielded from them. Without access to these resources, children may remain uninformed about the world around them, leaving them ill-prepared to handle dangerous situations or make informed decisions. Therefore, it is imperative that offensive content remains in libraries to ensure a well-rounded understanding of the world and its complexities.
1760	4737	2	3	I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor certain works but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf. The reason that just anyone can not take a work off the shelf is if the one person hates the work but everyone else likes it then imagine how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was destroyed.  Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being destroyed without any thought to others? I can and I feel horrible just thinking about it so I believe that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the decision if their work should be saved or destroyed.  With these reasons that I have shared with you please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything if it is a book, movie, song, or even a child's dreams think about how they would feel if anything of theirs was destroyed.
1761	4738	2	3	Dear reader,  Do you believe that certain books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive? This is a question that many people are grappling with today. Some parents argue for their removal, while others believe they should remain.   As a citizen, I understand the concerns of parents who want offensive materials removed from libraries. However, if we start removing everything that someone finds offensive, there may not be much left on the shelves. It's important to remember that what one person finds offensive, another may not.   If we start censoring materials based on individual opinions, we risk emptying out libraries altogether. As the quote by @PERSON1 highlights, if we start removing books we find offensive, then others have the same right to do so, and soon there may be nothing left for anyone to read.   In the end, we must learn to coexist with materials that we may find offensive and find ways to navigate around them. Trying to remove everything offensive will only lead to a loss of access to diverse perspectives and ideas. It's essential to respect differing opinions and find ways to make libraries inclusive for all.  Sincerely, @PERSON2
1762	4739	2	3	I believe that censorship in libraries can be a good thing, but can go too far. Removing movies and magazines that contain pointless offensive material from the shelves could be a good thing. If those are removed I do not think that people would care that much. Removing those small things, however, could grow into a bigger problem. It has to be decided how far is too far when removing objects from the shelves.   It all starts with a bad magazine that has a bad picture of a movie star doing something offensive with text surrounding it being pointlessly judgemental. A parent sees his or her kid reading this at the library and they do not believe it is appropriate so they complain and the magazine is taken off the shelf. Then a movie arises that is offensive and it is taken off the shelf. Pretty soon everyone is coming in with minor complaints about many different things and almost everything has someone who wants it banned.   Even if there was a set limit on what qualifies as able to be banned people would still complain until what they want happens. If the government has all these complaints they might just shut down the libraries to avoid looking over every 'offensive' piece of literature, film, or artwork. The original purpose being to block out offensive material ends with the realization that everything is offensive to somebody. Even what might be considered a great piece of work by most could be considered an abomination by some.   In the end a library should not be given the right to censor anything. The things that should be censored are a very small percentage and it is not worth the risk. Books that are offensive to some serve as inspiration to others. Libraries were made to give people the chance to be inspired. The library should not have the right to take inspiration away from the reader's hand.
1763	4740	2	3	What @CAPS1 You Do? A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive material to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive material should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be okay for 'offensive' material to be on the shelves of the libraries across the @ORGANIZATION1.  What is considered offensive? Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child @MONTH1 think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive material from the libraries, there @CAPS1 be nothing left. You @MONTH1 think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false, they @MONTH1 think that by having the @ORGANIZATION2 of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a different view on what is offensive, no one @CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. A group of people @CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.  There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people @MONTH1 not approve of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.  In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a @LOCATION1. We are not accountable for what other people do. It is not the libraries own responsibility to be a mother to all of its customers. Let the libraries be!
1764	4741	2	3	I believe that offensive books should be taken off the shelf. Some books are offensive and inappropriate, and the librarian could remove them to ensure that children do not have access to them. Movies rated 'R' and above should also be removed from libraries, as well as anything with an 'A' rating. Libraries are meant to be safe spaces for everyone, especially children, so it is crucial to keep inappropriate content away from them.   One way to handle this is by censoring offensive language and content with a black marker, as I have seen in an old library I used to frequent. This practice extended to movies, magazines, and music as well, ensuring that only appropriate material was available to the public. Libraries should adopt similar measures to protect the mental health of their patrons, especially children.  In conclusion, it is essential for libraries to prioritize the well-being of their visitors by removing offensive and inappropriate content from their shelves. Censoring such material can help maintain a safe and welcoming environment for everyone who uses the library.
1765	4742	2	3	Dear Newspaper,  As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I frequent libraries and have noticed some concerning issues regarding the presence of censored materials. The movies and books on display often contain content that is inappropriate for young individuals like myself. Censored movies and books should not be easily accessible to children and teenagers in public spaces such as libraries.  While I appreciate the variety of music available at libraries, it is essential to ensure that the music played is appropriate for all age groups. Explicit and violent songs should be avoided, especially when young children are present. The same goes for magazines, as censored content can negatively impact the minds of impressionable individuals.  I urge for a separate section in libraries dedicated to censored materials for adults only. This will help create a more suitable environment for children and teenagers to enjoy and explore without being exposed to inappropriate content. It is important to prioritize the well-being and development of young individuals by providing a safe and educational space in libraries.  Sincerely, A student advocating for change
1766	4743	2	3	Everyone has a preference in works of literature, such as books, magazines, movies or music. Different types of these works of literature are significant to each person. If everyone had the right to completely remove one piece of work that displeases them, then no works would remain. Therefore, I believe no materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from public libraries or other public places. Everyone has unique ideas, necesities and preferences.   A few years ago, I had a classmate who had different ideas from a myriad of people on religious persecution. He hated the idea of mixing people of different religions into one place. He wrote a paper containing all of his ideas on how the world should function in terms of religion. He tried to publish it, but did not succeed because his work was considered offensive. Even though I disagree with his ideas, I do not think his work should have been rejected. There could have been people in the world who did agree with his thoughts and would have been interested to read them. There could even have been ideas in his paper that could've helped countries solve various problems. I believe it is unfair that his paper was rejected.   People have different necesities based on what they have to accomplish. For example, I was reading a book last @DATE1 about a girl who was doing a project on racism. She went to the library to search for a book about apartheid in @LOCATION1 but couldn't find anything. She asked a librarian if there were any, but the librarian told her that books such as those were considered offensive in that local library and she would have to search elsewhere. I believe that it is unjust because the girl @MONTH1 not have had anywhere else to go to get the information about her project. She should've had the right to access the information that she needed for the project to prevent her from failing.   Another reason that no books should be removed is simply because everyone has unique preferences. In the world, there are books that certain people would enjoy more than others. Literature should be abled to be used for the purpose of entertainment and convenience. If I were to go to a library now, I would find many selections that correspond to my ideal novel or magazine. Every person should have that right. If people start removing materials that are offensive to them, then nothing on the shelves would remain and not one person would have the right to have access to the materials they desire.   In this world, diversity exists everywhere. People have and always will want, need and desire different things. Works of literature are just one of them. If people begin to eliminate offensive materials based on everyone's frustration or displeasures, then no books will remain on the public shelves. Therefore, materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should never be removed from public places. These things are necessities to the world.
1767	4744	2	3	I THINK THAT IF A BOOK IS FOUND OFFENSIVE THEN YOU SHOULDN'T READ IT. CAUSE WHAT IF SOMEONE ELSE LIKES THE BOOK, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO READ THAT BOOK. MAYBE IT'S AN INSPIRATION TO THEM, MAYBE IT WILL DRIVE THEM TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THEY WANT IN THEIR LIFE. WHEN SOMEONE WALKS INTO A LIBRARY NO ONE CAN TELL THEM WHAT TO GET THEY MAKE THAT DECISION THEMSELVES, SO WHEN A BOOK OFFENDS YOU MAYBE YOU SHOULD WRITE TO THE AUTHOR AND TALK TO HIM/HER. ABOUT THEIR BOOK. THINGS YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH BY WRITING THE AUTHOR IS A LETTER IN THE MAIL STATING THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR HURTING YOU WITH THEIR BOOK, ANOTHER IS MAYBE A VISIT FROM THE AUTHOR IN PERSON TO TELL YOU THAT HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR THE PAIN THAT HE OR SHE BOOK BROUGHT YOU. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. ALSO, NO, I DON'T THINK THAT THE BOOK/BOOKS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE SHELVES BECAUSE MAYBE JUST MAYBE IT WILL MOTIVATE SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM DOWN. THE END.
1768	4745	2	3	Some materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. This is important because such items can potentially offend individuals based on their race, religion, gender, or other personal characteristics. For example, rap music that focuses on controversial topics like race can be offensive to some listeners. Additionally, exposure to critical content in books or movies can negatively impact children's perceptions of others. Furthermore, content that ridicules individuals based on their sexual orientation or body image can be hurtful and should be removed. Overall, it is crucial to consider the potential harm that offensive materials can cause and take appropriate actions to remove them from circulation.
1769	4746	2	3	In conclusion, libraries should not have the right to take books and movies off the shelves if they find them offensive. People have different preferences and what may be offensive to one person may not be to another. It is important to respect individual choices and allow for a diverse range of materials to be available for all to enjoy. Let the readers and viewers decide for themselves what they want to engage with, rather than imposing restrictions based on the opinions of a few. Ultimately, a library should be a place for exploration, learning, and freedom of choice.
1770	4747	2	3	When you walk into the heavenly sanctuary that is our library, you have opened yourself up to a vast wealth of knowledge that is available to you at the click of a mouse, the push of a button, or the turn of a page. There are those of a select few, however, who are under the paradigm that not all of this information is for all eyes. They feel it should be locked away, as if it were some eyesore. Allow me to address this view with retaliation and distaste on a number of levels in the following document.   I am a musician. Music is my passion. My creative gears are forever turning. Often I look to other artists' works for inspiration, and the one place to get that music is, you guessed it, the library. How disappointed am I when I find that the music I want has been removed for being explicit. It was not the lyrics or foul message I sought, but the beautiful melodies and harmonies therein! It does not do well to isolate media without first seeing the good that lies in it and the strong feelings it has to convey.   We must not discard the world's greatest novel because of racial discrepancies or wizardry. We should not throw away a moving song because of its lyrics, nor trash a movie after only reading the title without giving it a chance. How fair is this? Even now, there may be those who refuse to read a newspaper because of disagreements with one individual editor. That is no fair judgement in my opinion.  I implore you, as a public, as people of sound mind and stout hearts, to reconsider the censorship of works that have a clear and true message and were created for the benefit of humankind. All things have a story to tell. We must absorb and interpret rather than reject or ignore what we find undesirable. By doing so, we gain new knowledge and understanding, whether it be of a new culture or a new perspective. Everything must be taken with a grain of salt.  Let us watch something we find immoral and then take the time to understand why it is immoral, for it is these things that define us. If we do not see what is or is not right, who is to say what is truly ethical? We need material of substance in our libraries for our exposure and for our fathoming of new knowledge in our modern world. Let us keep our minds open and embrace the diversity of ideas and perspectives that the world has to offer.
1771	4748	2	3	No, materials should not be removed from libraries. Books, movies, and music all serve as valuable ways to support different perspectives and ideas. Movies provide a visual way to understand concepts, music conveys messages that can be impactful, and books offer in-depth insights into various topics. Removing these materials would limit people's ability to learn, explore, and broaden their understanding of the world. It is important to give these materials a chance and not judge them too quickly, as they can provide valuable insights and perspectives that may not be easily accessible through other means. Ultimately, these materials play a crucial role in expanding knowledge and promoting understanding, and should be preserved in libraries for the benefit of all.
1772	4749	2	3	When you think of a book, you may consider happy kids' books or mysterious dark books, but what about offensive books? Many forms of media today are not always uplifting or intriguing. When choosing a movie, you want to be entertained, not disappointed halfway through. It can be frustrating to pick something that looks promising, only to find it unsuitable for your family. Offensive books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they do not bring joy or positivity. People deserve to feel good when engaging with media. If something is hurtful or offensive, it should not be readily available. It is important to speak up and take action to ensure that only content that uplifts and inspires is promoted. Let's strive for a world where we prioritize the well-being and happiness of all individuals.
1773	4750	2	3	There should not be censorship on the books in the library. Just think of how many great pieces of literature are out there that no one would be able to get their hands on because they didn't meet certain standards. People would miss out on reading some of their favorite books. Would you really want to take that away from the people? If my argument did not change your mind, you could at least consider putting censored books behind the counter. This way, people can still access them if they choose to. Let's ensure that everyone has the opportunity to explore a wide range of literature without restrictions.
1774	4751	2	3	I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves at a library if they could be found offensive. It is good to be unique, and no matter how inappropriate a subject might be, it is still factual and helpful in learning. If anything they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says something along the lines of 'adult content.' History repeats itself, and this quote reminds me of periods in history where we need to learn from our mistakes, no matter how bad the subjects are, such as the Holocaust, and the Civil Rights Movement in the deep south.  What about the Holocaust, when six million Jews were killed because they were Jewish. People may find these books offensive but that doesn't mean the Holocaust never happened. There are many offensive and controversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the Holocaust. Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our society to learn about what happened. Other categories need to be read because it can help individuals to understand right from wrong and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future.  The Civil Rights Movement started from the 1950s all the way until the late 1960s. The Civil Rights Movement took a toll on everyone in the United States, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others. In the south, most white Americans treated African Americans as dirt. They didn't let them in their schools, in their clubs or churches, they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them. There were a set of laws called the 'Jim Crow laws,' which pretty much was a list of rules to treat African Americans as unfairly as possible. If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them, they would remember it their whole life, and if that one picture truly bothered them, their whole life growing up, they would realize that what white Americans did to African Americans was unethical.  Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit, but we can't shelter our society their whole lives. Parents need to sit down with their children when they have questions and discuss the truth with them. What are parents going to do when their children go to school and hear other children talk about subjects such as sex? Children could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is. I am not saying to go let your three-year-old look at pictures of people having sex by any means, but when children get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies.  It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their children, or hovering over their shoulders like helicopters. If children don't learn the truth about the real world and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in the world, when they go to college they won't be able to stand for themselves. If children don't learn about history and what all has been done, it is kind of like we are treating the books like the Jews and the African Americans were treated. Just because these books are different than others we will just get rid of them, just like how we tried to kill off all the Jews and African Americans because they were different. And it is wrong and inhuman.
1775	4752	2	3	Censorship in libraries is when a librarian has the right to remove certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves of a library if the item is inappropriate. I believe that libraries should not have censorship. It should be up to the parents to ensure that their children have access to appropriate materials. In libraries where there is a mixture of adults and children, censorship would lead to conflicts and limit access to a variety of materials. Therefore, I believe that censorship is unnecessary in libraries.
1776	4753	2	3	"I know that some people find some books offensive, mean, cruel, or racist, but most of the time, people write because it's what they feel or what people want to read. Books are a privilege, and we should be able to use that privilege. People need to learn that it's okay that books are sometimes a little harsh. The world is not the most friendly place ever, and books can help convey that with less hurt than experiencing it firsthand.  I believe that all books should be left on the shelves because just because it's offensive to someone doesn't mean it should be taken off. For every book, someone will find something offensive because of something. If the cause is offense, then all books should be gone. If someone took the time to go out and write a book and make sure that everything about it is correct, then why should we stop them from letting people read it? They have a right to write, and we have a right to read, and no one should take that right away.  If someone wrote a book on the Holocaust, people are very offended by that, but they don't try to get rid of it. So why should any other book be different just because it's not about a big event like that? It just seems absurd that people go to such lengths to get rid of a book just because they are offended by it. They just need to suck it up and move on. If they don't like it, then don't read it. Someone who wants to can, so do not take that away from the people that want to read it.  I remember a time when someone wanted to read a book in our library, and they said, ""Oh, you can't read that because it was found to be too offensive."" It made me appalled that they would decide how someone else feels about a book. It makes me angry that they get to decide how someone else feels about a book. We do have books here that are kept behind the librarian's desk if they are too offensive, and I'm okay with that because at least they have it for people to read if they really wanted to.  Let's consider another aspect here—money. The book that you want so badly gone from a library was most likely paid for by you, the taxpayer. So you and many others paid for this book, and now you want to waste that money. It's insane that you would want to waste that money after it's been paid for. People need to realize the bigger picture, not just themselves but others. In them taking down a book because they were offended, it offends me. This offends me a lot because now you ruined something that did not need to be taken down.  This is how I feel about this subject. I am upset that people would go to such lengths to ban a book from a library. If you wrote a book and people did this to you, how would you feel? I know you would feel terrible that someone would do this to your hard work. People need to calm down and think before acting impulsively. Stand back, and think, ""will this really affect me if I get this book taken off the shelf?"" It also makes me mad that the library bought the book and now it's gone, so did the money just go to waste because the book is gone. This is how I feel about getting rid of books."
1777	4754	2	3	Censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer. Some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material. Others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please. Censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own. In society, there are no limits. The human imagination can create beautiful works of literary art and music, but it can also create material not suitable for every age group. Library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes. However, what may be unacceptable for children to view may be perfectly fine for a mature adult. Censorship is purely opinion. If a person is a strict believer that God created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution. If a parent does not want their child to watch certain content, they would rather their children not see it on the shelves. Writing is a form of self-expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. It is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past. But if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community? Parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship. Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the Nazi era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it. In conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion. Citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please. Granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unacceptable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning. Freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. As Katherine Paterson once said, '... And then we have no bookes left of the shelf for any of us.'
1778	4755	2	3	Why do we have books out there that are viewed as offensive? If they are inappropriate, why do we keep putting those books, magazines, movies, and music out there in the world? The reason is that people in our society have outgrown the more wholesome entertainment options of the past, such as cartoons like Tom and Jerry, Looney Tunes, and Scooby-Doo, which used to teach valuable lessons. Nowadays, the media landscape is filled with inappropriate content that focuses on violence, sex, and other negative themes without providing any educational value for children.  While we cannot completely eliminate offensive material from circulation, we can take steps to restrict access to it. By placing offensive books and magazines in restricted areas of libraries, implementing parental controls on television, and monitoring the music our children listen to, we can help shield them from harmful content. It is important for parents and caregivers to be vigilant and proactive in protecting children from inappropriate media influences.  In conclusion, while offensive material will always exist in our society, we can work towards minimizing its impact on our children by taking practical steps to restrict access and promote more positive forms of entertainment. By staying informed and engaged, we can create a safer and healthier media environment for the next generation.
1779	4756	2	3	Libraries are meant to be a place where people can relax and enjoy reading, but sometimes, the content available can be offensive and inappropriate for certain audiences. It is important for individuals to speak up and address any offensive material they come across in libraries. Books, movies, music, and magazines that contain explicit content should be censored or removed from shelves to protect children and sensitive individuals from exposure to inappropriate material. Censorship plays a crucial role in ensuring that libraries remain a safe and welcoming space for everyone. It is essential for people to take a stand against offensive content and advocate for a more respectful and considerate library environment. In a society where harmful and explicit material is readily available, it is crucial to prioritize the well-being and development of our youth by promoting appropriate and educational content in libraries.
1780	4757	2	3	I believe that if people find certain books, music, or magazines offensive in a library, they should simply choose to avoid those particular items rather than advocating for their removal. Libraries should have the freedom to curate their collections based on the diverse interests of their patrons. If individuals do not like what is available at one library, they can easily seek out another library that better aligns with their preferences. It is important to consider the varying tastes of library visitors and not impose personal views on what should or should not be available for others to enjoy. Ultimately, it is unnecessary to create conflict over the contents of a library when there are plenty of alternative options to explore. Everyone should have the opportunity to access the materials they enjoy without infringing on the choices of others.
1781	4758	2	3	I don't believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Instead, there should be age restrictions and parental consent in place to regulate what children can access. By implementing a rating system similar to movies and requiring parental approval for minors, we can help ensure that inappropriate content is not easily accessible to young individuals. This approach can potentially reduce negative behaviors and influences on children, leading to a safer and more responsible environment for all. Ultimately, maintaining these materials on shelves for mature audiences while controlling access for minors can help promote responsible consumption and protect young individuals from harmful content.
1782	4759	2	3	Today in the media, there are many things that can be found offensive, such as movies, books, songs, and magazines. However, it is important to remember that everything that is put into the media serves a purpose. Whether it is to convey a message, spark a discussion, or evoke emotions, there is intention behind the content that is created.  When individuals find something in the media offensive, the solution is simple: they can choose to avoid it. By not subjecting themselves to content that they find offensive, they can protect their own sensibilities without restricting others' access to that content. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it should be censored for everyone else.  Whether it is a controversial movie, a provocative book, or a polarizing song, each piece of media has the potential to resonate with different audiences in different ways. By allowing a diverse range of content to exist in the media, we create space for dialogue, reflection, and artistic expression. It is through this diversity that we can learn from each other, challenge our perspectives, and grow as a society.  In conclusion, the presence of offensive content in the media should not be cause for censorship. Instead, individuals have the power to choose what they consume and what they engage with. By respecting the diversity of perspectives and voices in the media, we can foster a more inclusive and enriching cultural landscape for all.
1783	4760	2	3	Certain books, magazines, music, and movies should not be displayed on the shelves of a library, as they may contain offensive or inappropriate content for children. Libraries must take steps to address this issue by implementing better supervision and control over certain sections. One way to do this is by ensuring that children do not wander off from their parents' side, allowing parents to monitor and regulate what their children are exposed to. Additionally, libraries can put up signs in prominent locations to warn visitors about potentially offensive material and the need for parental guidance beyond a certain point. By being more aware of the impact of their collections on the public, libraries can prevent incidents where individuals are offended by certain materials. It is crucial for libraries to consider the perspectives of various groups and take proactive measures to avoid exposing visitors to content that may be upsetting or objectionable. By implementing these strategies, libraries can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all patrons.
1784	4761	2	3	Offensive content in magazines should be removed from shelves for various reasons. Firstly, it may be offensive to important figures such as the president or the governor, which can cause unnecessary controversy. If individuals find the content offensive, they should speak up to address the issue and advocate for change. It is puzzling why offensive material is allowed in magazines, as it can easily be avoided to prevent offending readers. While movies may contain fictional content, offensive material in books may have a purpose that readers need to understand. For instance, questioning the birthplace of a president, like in the case of Barack Obama, should be based on facts rather than unfounded rumors. In such situations, it is important to address the issue and move on from unwarranted controversies.
1785	4762	2	3	What if someone found your favorite book offensive? Inappropriate materials do need to be kept from young minds of children. On the other hand, you cannot shield people from things they should know or already know. Everyone has different things that they think are offensive, so one person might think a book is so bad it should be recalled from the shelves but another person may see no problem with it. Children need to be protected from materials that may hurt them in some way. Children do what they see and hear, so they are liable to try and copy harmful things they read. Bad influences can even come from magazines with famous celebrities being caught breaking the law or doing bad things, and young minds see that as 'cool' and may try to follow that example. Children and young people see and hear a lot worse things at home, on television, and even at school than in some books. Children need to be protected, but you can't baby-proof life. They will be introduced to plenty of bad influences in their lifetime, but it should be the parent's job to teach their kids to say no and stay away from bad things. Kids can learn much worse things from something at the library by just sitting at home. Libraries are places for use by the public, and the public covers a wide range of different kinds of people, so someone will always find something bothersome with something or another. People have different views, beliefs, and religions, and books on these topics might be offensive to some but not to others. Like the quote by Katherine Paterson said, if we take off the shelves every book or material that someone finds offensive, there will be no books in the libraries at all. Yes, there are books that are not always very presentable to a certain group of people, but they should have the right to be read if there is someone who wants to read them. It is not the library's job to be prejudiced against certain books because someone doesn't agree with them. Books should have a wide variety like the people who are reading them. Additionally, children are protected from books if they have learned morals that allow them to make mature choices.
1786	4763	2	3	I believe that any book or movie in the library is there for a good reason. The world is full of things that can both hurt and uplift a person. While there may be content that is not suitable for children, it is important to understand that exposure to various aspects of life is inevitable as they grow older. Parents may have different comfort levels regarding what their children are exposed to, but it is essential to remember that books and movies are a reflection of real life. They provide valuable insights into the world and help children understand the complexities of life. It is crucial to strike a balance between protecting children from harmful content and allowing them to learn and grow through exposure to diverse perspectives. Ultimately, books and movies should not be removed from libraries just because they depict aspects of life that may be uncomfortable for some, as they play a vital role in shaping a child's understanding of the world.
1787	4764	2	3	Debates are a main part of our society today. Everyone has an opinion on how things should be in the world, and no one is necessarily right. Books that show how other cultures behave, that to the people being described in the book may seem offensive, are important because we as people need to absorb as much as we can about other cultures. Our businesses are in other countries, many people living in different locations speak multiple languages, and people have the right to read things that may in fact be offensive to a race of people.  Businesses thrive in other countries. A lot of our countries income is from our factories and companies in other countries. Japan is a place where much business happens for the technology industry. If we, as Americans, can't learn about the Japanese, how can we learn their business methods and way of life? To the Japanese, these books may be offensive, but to us they are learning tools describing Japanese culture.  Being bilingual is a trend that millions of people adhere to. High schools require that we learn some foreign language, even if it is only the basics. The schools do this so that we can go to other countries in the work force. Learning about their language and habits comes from books. The Mexican population might not like the way we depict them in our stories, but this is necessary to learn about them.  In the United States, there are all kinds of freedoms that we as Americans use freely. Freedom of speech says that we can say whatever we want when we live in the United States. Books are not excluded from this rule. I'm sure that other countries have offensive books about us. It's a common theme around the globe.  Businesses thrive in foreign countries, so we must be able to read some books about them, even if they seem offensive. Learning new things is something that every school teaches and there should be no limit to what we can learn. If a book has vulgar language and sexual scenes, it should be taken out of the children's section of the library, not banned completely. This is the same case with other populations of people. They cannot take offense to what we have to say, because worse has been said about them than what we can possibly put in a book. Learning is a necessary tool in our society and nothing should be restricted.
1788	4765	2	3	Books are essential to our society, holding a wealth of knowledge and playing a significant role in shaping our understanding of the world. While some may find certain content in books offensive, it is important to recognize the value of preserving diverse perspectives and ideas. Removing books that may be deemed offensive by some individuals would limit access to important information and stifle intellectual growth. It is crucial to maintain a wide range of books on shelves, allowing readers to explore different viewpoints and expand their understanding of the world. By keeping books accessible, we ensure that future generations have the opportunity to learn and grow from the knowledge and experiences shared within the pages of these valuable literary works.Books are a treasure trove of wisdom and insight, and it is imperative that we continue to embrace the diversity of perspectives they offer, even if some may find certain content challenging or controversial. Let us cherish the power of books to educate, inspire, and enlighten, and uphold the importance of preserving our literary heritage for generations to come.
1789	4766	2	3	In today's society, children are exposed to a plethora of inappropriate content through various mediums such as books, movies, music, and magazines. With the lack of parental guidance and supervision, it is crucial for libraries to take responsibility in filtering out inappropriate materials. One effective solution is to implement age limits on books, where librarians or national book associations can determine the suitability of content for certain age groups. Additionally, promoting the availability of educational and morally upright books can help steer children towards positive learning experiences.  When it comes to music and movies, it is essential for libraries to remove any content that is not suitable for children. By adhering to established ratings and guidelines, libraries can prevent children from being exposed to harmful language and scenes. Magazines also play a role in shaping young minds, and strict regulations should be in place to ensure that inappropriate content is not accessible to children.  As societal standards evolve, it is imperative to uphold strict restrictions on what children are exposed to in libraries. Parents may not always be fully aware or involved in monitoring their children's media consumption, making it crucial for libraries to take a proactive stance in curating appropriate materials. By setting clear boundaries and removing content that is not suitable for young audiences, libraries can contribute to the healthy development and well-being of children in today's world.
1790	4767	2	3	This is going to be an essay about if people finding something offensive in a library or in music that it should be censored. It is also about if you think it should be taken off the shelves because some people find it offensive. The way I look or my own opinion is that they should censor most things from libraries and music, but not get rid of it because one person finds it offensive. If you think about it, those uncensored material like books that some people find offensive might be a fit book for someone else to what they can relate to as they were growing up.  On the other hand, they should be more careful about it so when younger kids listen to the radio or are reading a book they don't get the wrong ideas. We should censor things but only with an extent and not go overboard with it. In the long run, it might help with a more clean and safe population because we are censoring things to where people don't hear bad and only hear the good in life. You never know you could make a big difference by doing that.   The reason I wouldn't go out and censor everything is because you can't stop everyone from doing it. You can always give it a try but that's one of the main reasons why I wouldn't try and get rid of it cause a certain person might find it offensive. I can understand if you took it off their shelf that someone found offensive but only move it to where no one will find it offensive.  I'm not saying it's wrong to do that but I think it could and probably would make a lot of people angry. But hey, what can I say what has the government done that we don't like or can't do anything about it. And that's all I have to say about that.
1791	4768	2	3	Books, movies, magazines, music, etc., make up a significant part of our entertainment system today, available in local libraries that offer a wide range of material. While some content may be deemed offensive or inappropriate for certain audiences, it is not necessary to ban such materials altogether. Instead, a more effective approach would be to create a separate section within the library for these specific materials. By doing so, individuals who wish to access this content can do so while ensuring that it is not readily available to those who may find it objectionable. This method allows for a balance between providing access to a variety of materials and respecting the preferences and sensitivities of library patrons. Ultimately, segregating offensive or inappropriate materials in their own section within the library is a practical solution that benefits all individuals seeking different types of entertainment resources.
1792	4769	2	3	I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves due to censorship. Different sections in the library should be offered to cater to different age groups - kids, teenagers, and adults. Each section should provide content suitable for that particular demographic, allowing individuals to make their own choices based on their preferences and level of maturity. Censorship should not be imposed as it limits the variety of materials available and hinders intellectual growth. The library is a place where people should have the freedom to explore different perspectives and ideas. By maintaining a diverse collection of books, movies, and music, the library can better serve the needs and interests of its patrons. In conclusion, censorship should not dictate the content available in libraries, and individuals should have the autonomy to select materials that align with their personal preferences and beliefs.
1793	4770	2	3	I personally believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves just because they are found offensive. The concept of offensiveness is subjective and can vary from person to person. What may be offensive to one individual may not be offensive to another. It is important to remember that we have the freedom of speech and press, and everyone has the right to express themselves through their work.  Censoring materials in libraries would limit people's access to information and entertainment. Libraries are meant to be places where individuals can explore a wide range of ideas and perspectives. By allowing a diverse selection of materials on the shelves, libraries can cater to the varied interests and preferences of their patrons.  It is crucial to respect the rights of individuals to choose what they want to read, listen to, or watch. Just because something may be offensive to some, does not mean it should be censored for everyone. People have the autonomy to decide for themselves what they find acceptable or objectionable.  In conclusion, censorship of materials in libraries would only restrict people's freedom and hinder their ability to explore different viewpoints. It is essential to uphold the principles of free speech and allow individuals to make their own choices regarding the content they engage with. Let us embrace diversity and inclusivity in libraries, rather than imposing restrictions based on subjective notions of offensiveness.
1794	4771	2	3	We all hope that one day our children will not pick up a book or a magazine they're not supposed to read. Children don't know any better, but should everything be censored just because there are children everywhere? I believe that we should be able to have uncensored books on the shelves. If everything was censored, we would have very limited options for reading and watching. Everyone should have the freedom to choose what they want to watch or read without censorship. Censorship in libraries is not necessary. While some materials may be offensive to some, it is a part of life, and individuals can choose not to engage with such content. Children today are exposed to more than they should know, such as cursing, and censoring materials in libraries will not prevent them from encountering such content elsewhere. Libraries should not have to censor materials based on isolated incidents. If I had the authority, I would uphold the right for libraries to have uncensored materials available. It is essential to preserve freedom of choice and access to diverse content in libraries.
1795	4772	2	3	Libraries offer a wide range of material for people to enjoy, from books to movies. While some believe in the need for censorship to protect certain individuals, such as children, from inappropriate content, it can also limit the freedom of others to explore diverse topics and perspectives. Everyone has different tastes and sensitivities, and what may be offensive to one person might be enlightening or thought-provoking to another. By allowing individuals to choose their own reading material, without censorship, everyone can find enjoyment in reading what truly interests them. This freedom of choice not only enhances the reading experience but also promotes a diverse and inclusive literary culture for all.
1796	4773	2	3	The author argues against the practice of removing books with inappropriate content from schools, believing that children can benefit from a variety of reading materials. While parents and educators may prefer educational books, children often gravitate towards books with pictures or interesting stories. By allowing children access to a range of books, they can develop a love for reading and expand their knowledge in different subjects. Ultimately, keeping a diverse selection of books available can help foster a love for reading and learning in children.
1797	4774	2	3	I do not think that materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People have different views and beliefs on certain topics, influenced by religion, culture, and sexuality. What may be offensive to one person could be informative and enlightening to another. Removing offensive materials sets a dangerous precedent, as everyone has their own perspectives and sensitivities. It is important to respect diverse opinions and allow individuals to make their own choices about what they consume. Censorship limits access to knowledge and stifles freedom of expression, which are fundamental principles in a democratic society. Instead of banning offensive materials, individuals can simply choose not to engage with them if they find them objectionable. Ultimately, the availability of a wide range of materials enriches our understanding of the world and encourages critical thinking. Letting people make their own decisions about what they read, watch, or listen to is essential for promoting intellectual freedom and fostering a culture of open dialogue and debate.
1798	4775	2	3	Yes, we should keep books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelves. Magazines and music serve important purposes, such as helping with concentration and providing valuable information for schoolwork. It is essential to have access to these resources in our daily lives. Taking away books or any other forms of media that contribute positively to our lives should not be a decision made by someone else. We must advocate for our right to access these materials that enrich our lives and help us learn and grow. Let's continue to fight for the preservation of books, music, movies, and magazines in our society.
1799	4776	2	3	I do believe that books, magazines, music, and movies should be taken off the shelf if a person wants to engage with them. These forms of entertainment are meant to be experienced, whether through reading, listening, or watching. Books and magazines offer knowledge, entertainment, and inspiration, while music and movies provide a way to relax, learn, and be inspired. By actively using these resources, we can expand our horizons, learn new things, and be entertained in different ways. Therefore, it is important to take these items off the shelf and make the most of what they have to offer. So, let's not just let them sit there but instead, pick them up, enjoy them, and discover the amazing things they have to offer.
1800	4777	2	3	People have different ideas of what can be offensive to them, whether it's books, movies, or music. It's important to respect others' opinions and not discriminate against them for their choices. Books can provide valuable insights and learning experiences, even if they touch on sensitive topics. Similarly, movies can help us understand different perspectives and historical events, even if they are difficult to watch. Music is a form of expression, and artists should be allowed to share their feelings, even if it includes controversial content. It's essential to keep an open mind and be willing to learn from various sources, even if they may be offensive to some. Respect for differing opinions and the freedom to explore different viewpoints are crucial in promoting understanding and growth.
