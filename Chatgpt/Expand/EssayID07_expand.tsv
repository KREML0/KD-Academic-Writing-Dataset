1	17834	7	3	Patience is a virtue that not everyone possesses. It is the ability to wait calmly and without frustration in situations where one is required to do so. In a world where everything seems to move at a fast pace, patience is often overlooked or disregarded. However, it is essential in maintaining order and courtesy in our interactions with others.  In the example provided, the individual demonstrated patience by waiting in line for lunch without cutting ahead of others. This simple act of patience may seem trivial, but it reflects a respect for others and a willingness to wait for one's turn. Without patience, chaos can ensue as people become frustrated and act impulsively, disregarding the feelings and rights of those around them.  When individuals lack patience, they may resort to cutting in line, yelling, or pushing others out of the way. These actions not only disrupt the peace but also hurt the feelings of those who are treated unfairly. Therefore, it is crucial for everyone to cultivate patience in their daily lives to promote harmony and respect among people.  In conclusion, patience is a valuable quality that everyone should strive to possess. It not only benefits individuals in maintaining peace and order but also contributes to a more compassionate and understanding society. By exercising patience in our interactions with others, we can create a more harmonious and respectful environment for everyone.

Finally, after several weeks of constant falling, I rode for a few minutes without falling and finally learned how to ride a bike.

The coach replied that we had to finish a double dribble down and back exercise first. Once we completed the task, we all hurried to the drinking fountain. I found myself at the end of a long line of girls eagerly waiting for a drink. As I waited my turn, one girl politely requested a drink and I was left stunned. Suddenly, a girl called out for everyone to move on, and I quickly took a second drink of water before rushing back to the coach. Now, I am the first one to get a drink, and my teammates jokingly refer to me as a fish for taking such long drinks.

Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the end of the line. So my mother said.î @CAPS1 get on another ride thenî. We already tried the other rides,î my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line until it was our turn, and said that was the last ride, soon there were people behind us complaining, their younger children was getting mad, and parents was hollering. We just stood there, and kept being patient. That didnít desterb us. since we were raised to be patient, and wait our turn at things. I feel being patient is very important, because if you act up in line, you might make people think theyíre holding you up, but itís the line moving slow. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, donít shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone, it only creates trouble. Just donít think about all of the people ahead of you, talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then youíll notice, the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We enjoyed the ride. We had a great time at the fair and learned the value of patience while waiting in line.

7	17841	7	3	My name is @CAPS2 and I have a very hyper and impatient horse named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is a chestnut quarter horse with a white star on his forehead who is always eager to go. When preparing for a horse ride, he fidgets and moves around impatiently at the post, making it challenging for me to tack him up. During the ride, he tends to gallop ahead, forcing me to halt him and wait for the rest of the group. However, @CAPS1 struggles to stand still and becomes restless, prompting me to turn him around and walk back to the group. Despite my attempts to train him to be patient, his innate impulsiveness seems to prevail. It seems that @CAPS1 always needs to be in motion, unable to wait calmly like other horses. Nevertheless, I cherish him for who he is, embracing his lively and spirited nature.
8	17842	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I preordered a video game called Halo Reach. I preordered it a month before it came out and I couldn't wait for it to come out. I mostly wanted it because Bungie is the company that makes it and this is the last game Bungie was making because some other company bought the Halo series from Bungie. When the game finally came out on September fourteenth, 2010, I bought it with my friends and the game is amazing. I would give it four out of five stars. I'm not obsessed with it though. I play it only about two hours a day which is all my parents let me play anyway. Halo Reach is my very favorite game.

24	17860	7	3	Being patient is challenging, especially for someone like me who struggles with bipolar disorder and anger issues. My experience with patience was tested when I lived with my foster family, who had different religious beliefs that clashed with my atheism. Despite feeling constantly annoyed and misunderstood, I had to practice patience and refrain from lashing out. Tolerating their grandkids, whom I found irritating, was another challenge I faced. Dealing with children and authority figures can be tough, but I had to learn to tolerate them in order to maintain peace in the household. Patience indeed requires practice and self-control, especially when faced with difficult situations and people.
25	17861	7	3	One time when I demonstrated patience was during a family trip to Mackinac City.

By the time I came back inside, they were almost done, so I took the opportunity to use the bathroom. When I emerged, they had completed the packing, and we were ready to embark on our journey. The drive took over four hours, but I remained patient throughout the long journey. Despite the wait, once we arrived, we had a fantastic time. This experience taught me the importance of patience and how it can lead to enjoyable outcomes in the end.
26	17862	7	3	Patients is very important. But I'm not very good with my patients. And when I am and I wait my turn I end up forgetting what I going to say. I guess I'm not very patient because my family is not very patient. My family is not very patient because we just want to say what we're gonna say before we forget it. Our family is also very forgetful. That is probably another reason why we aren't patient. Patients is important because it helps you be more calm and it helps you wait your turn. Being patient can lead to better communication and understanding with others.

28	17864	7	3	When I was patient, it was during a family trip down the river with my dad and two sisters. We would travel from north to south, a journey that took about two hours. Along the way, there was a train track bridge where we would stop to take a break and have lunch. This bridge was approximately one hour away from our starting point, so we would often make it a pit stop during our trips. Despite my impatience, I had no choice but to be patient during these river excursions, as the journey was a lengthy one. However, the scenic views and quality time spent with my family made the experience worthwhile. It was moments like these that taught me the value of patience and the importance of enjoying the journey, rather than just focusing on the destination.

That I haven't even seen yet until one day I was sitting on my porch when I asked my mom to take me to see and watch ""Inception"" that weekend when she said ""we'll see,"" I was really upset because I wanted to watch it really bad. I was being very patient at the time. I had called my friends, cousins, sister, and brother to accompany me, but they all said they were busy so I cried myself to sleep. The next few days, my parents were talking about going to the movies and out to dinner. I walked in screaming and yelling ""Why are we not going to watch and see a movie and have dinner as a family?"" I left the room. The very next day, my brother and his girlfriend went to watch ""Inception"" knowing I wanted to see it. They came home teasing me about how good the movie was. So that night, I went downstairs to demand to watch ""Inception,"" saying ""I have been very patient with you all about taking me to see and watch 'Inception' but you all are pushing my buttons so I demand to go tomorrow.""

But of course, I only have one birthday a year, so I have to wait. I would like to be a patient person. It's just not in the cards for me. My father on the other hand is more patient than anyone. I know he will tell me to clean the car by a certain date. I told him I didn't do it yet so he says he will give me more time. I couldn't be that patient with my kids. I would tell them to clean it now or they would be grounded. I wouldn't force them to or anything but I'm not gonna wait a whole month before I get my car cleaned! I guess I could try to be as patient with my father but that would be really hard. Although if I'm patient, I'm sure I will be able to do it!

32	17869	7	3	Patience is a valuable virtue that helps us navigate through various situations in life. It involves being understanding and tolerant, which can be crucial in maintaining relationships and handling challenging circumstances. I have personally experienced the importance of patience in different scenarios. For example, I demonstrate patience when waiting for my mom to finish her phone calls before engaging in a conversation with her. Additionally, before events like plays or movies, I exercise patience as I wait for the show to begin.   One area where I particularly showcase patience is during tests. Remaining calm and composed while tackling difficult questions requires a great deal of patience. Without this virtue, interactions with others could become strained, as impatience can be perceived as annoying and disruptive. By practicing patience, I am able to foster better relationships and avoid unnecessary conflicts. In essence, patience plays a crucial role in enhancing communication and understanding among individuals.

Sadly, his mother informed him that he would have to wait until he was twelve years old, as the sensei was still in training himself. So, @CAPS1 patiently waited for six long years.

35	17872	7	3	One time when I was patient was when me and my family went on a fishing trip to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1. Once we got on the boat, it took some time to navigate through the river. After setting up our fishing gear, we patiently trolled through the water, waiting for the fish to bite. The boat gently rocked side to side, creating a soothing rhythm. As we waited, the anticipation grew.   Finally, around midday, we got our first bite. My dad quickly grabbed the pole and began reeling in the fish. It was a tough fight, but he managed to bring in a @ORGANIZATION1 that weighed in at @MONEY1. The excitement was palpable as we celebrated the catch.   Not long after, another pole got a hit.

I knew I had to be patient, as I had learned my lesson from a previous trip where I complained and lost my phone privileges for a week. So, on this journey, I remained patient and didn't complain. Being patient not only made the trip more enjoyable for me but also made my mom happy. It's essential to practice patience, especially on long trips, to show others that you are a tolerant person.
37	17874	7	3	One time I went in the orthodontist office and I had to sit in the visiting room for about 15-20 minutes. I didnít really mind, since I had to go to school afterward. However, it was evident that the person assisting me was not pleased because the wait should have only been for 5 minutes. Eventually, I was called in and settled into the chair as they removed my rubber bands, making me wait for around 10 minutes. Despite the delay, I remained patient as I didnít want to miss school. I disliked arriving late to class because it attracted unwanted attention. The orthodontist eventually arrived to examine me and change my rubber bands. After ensuring my braces were in good condition, I was released from the office around noon. Relieved, I headed home happily.
38	17875	7	3	Their was a time when I was patient when I went to the barber shop and my family and I was going on a trip and I had to get my haircut the day before we left. I went to the barber shop was packed so the guy that cut my hair told me I was next in the chair. So then more and more people started coming in and he let those people jump in front of me so I just sat there and waited. After those people were done he never called me up so he got on his phone and went outside. Then he told me to wait until he came out the restroom then five more people came in so thatís when my mom called my phone and asked me if I was done because I had been up there from @NUM1 to @NUM2 and she said to go to someone else's chair because we were about to go somewhere. I still needed to pick my stuff because we would be leaving at @NUM3 a.m the next morning.
39	17876	7	3	One week a couple of years ago my grandparents were over. We went to my aunt's house and my aunt, along with my mom, were going to teach me how to tie my shoes because I was going into kindergarten and needed to learn. They said if I learned to tie my shoes, I would get to pick something out at the dollar store, which got me really excited! After lunch, they began teaching me a trick to remember the steps. After many tries, I started to get the hang of it. Back at home, my mom continued to help me until one afternoon, I finally got it. My mom was so happy and encouraging, which made me feel proud. Later, we went to the store and I got to pick out something special, all thanks to my mom's patience and support. Her patience really helped me learn faster and I'm grateful for her guidance.
40	17878	7	3	Patience is a virtue that not everyone possesses. It involves being able to take the time to explain things to others without getting frustrated. While some people, like the speaker's mother, are patient and willing to explain things repeatedly until they are understood, others, like the speaker's father, may struggle with impatience. Impatience can stem from various factors, such as personality traits or health issues like high blood pressure. Despite the challenges, patience is a valuable quality that can greatly benefit relationships and communication. It is essential to cultivate patience in order to foster understanding and harmony in interactions with others.
41	17879	7	3	I am patient every year waiting for one special day to come. My birthday was a special day for my mom and dad, the only boy my mom ever had, and the third boy my dad had. I am still waiting for my birthday to come again, eagerly anticipating the joy and love that surrounds that special day.
42	17880	7	3	Swimming is a lot of fun, especially when feeling the cool water all around. Patience plays a crucial role in swimming, whether it's waiting for practice to start, learning new strokes, or understanding safety rules. During the first day of swim team, the coaches went over important information about safety and the plans for the season. While some swimmers, like myself, were familiar with the material, it was still essential to practice patience and listen attentively. Overall, the team did a great job demonstrating the importance of patience in swimming.
43	17881	7	3	Patience is the ability to wait calmly in the face of adversity or delay. It is a virtue that can be challenging to maintain, but it is essential in various situations. For instance, when visiting a theme park, sometimes there are no lines for rides, while other times, you may have to wait for extended periods. In these instances, patience is key, especially for younger children who may struggle with standing still. Another example of patience is demonstrated by the miners trapped underground in a mine for several days. They had to wait patiently for rescue and remain calm during the ascent in the elevator. Additionally, when walking in a group, patience is necessary to listen to others' ideas and share responsibilities. These examples highlight the importance of patience in different scenarios and the benefits of remaining composed in challenging circumstances.
44	17882	7	3	The time I was patient was when we were going to Disneyland for the first time and I was very excited! We only had one week left to wait to go. But I couldnít wait that long. I thought I had waited long enough, and I wanted to go at that moment. Even though I had to wait, I still had a fantastic time at Disneyland. I just had to be patient!
45	17883	7	3	I will be writing about patience in my own mix up way even though you are adults. Once there was a little silk worm getting ready to change into a butterfly moth. But this silk worm had a problem - he was still too skinny to change, he had to be nice and fat like a fat prattle stick cut in half. He crawled from bush to bush, eating any green leaves he could find. But here's where another problem kicked in to play. It was becoming winter, so every leaf he found was brown and nasty. The grass was changing too. But he wanted to change into a moth so bad that he had no choice but to eat the dry leaves and grass. He was very patient about it. But then he got tired of eating dry leaves and grass, so he grew more and more impatient because he wanted to change so badly that he exploded. But he woke up and saw that he was in a white silk wrapping, so he ripped out of it. He realized he was a moth after all, but then he remembered he was eating nice green leaves before. He wrapped himself up and went to sleep. And that's how he had that strange dream.
46	17884	7	3	I have lived in a lot of different places through out my life. They are @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, @CAPS1, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 and @CAPS2. That's @CAPS3 different place. @CAPS6 was and still is land to about to @CAPS6 @CAPS4 somewhere along that long road in @LOCATION2 my parents got devased. My dad moved to @CAPS5 and eventually @PERSON2. We moved to @LOCATION1 with my mom (my sister and me). @CAPS6 was fun there because @CAPS6 hadn't seen my cousin, my aunt, my uncle, and my grandma for about six years. @CAPS4 I hadn't seen my dad in almost @NUM1 months. My grandma says to not to moving and till see him soon. By soon @CAPS6 didn't think like meant @NUM2 months. In those @NUM2 months we wanted a house neat to a patch of works and a fresh water @DATE1. My mom even got a boyfriend that she later broke up with. Then later she started and still is dating the guy we are renting awe house from. When my dad called and said that he was coming, @CAPS6 made me. So happy. @CAPS6 @CAPS7 didn't that @CAPS6 could make @CAPS6 @NUM4 months without seeing my dad.  @CAPS4 @CAPS6 did @CAPS6. Now that he's settled in a see him once a match for one weekend. With better than @NUM4 months or not at all. Now, the frequent visits with my dad have brought us closer together and I cherish the time we spend as a family.
47	17885	7	3	I was patient on the trip to @LOCATION1 as it took two days to get down there. I got hungry and had to go to the bathroom whenever I felt the need. I had to wait until the next gas stop to satisfy my hunger without complaining. I patiently waited until the gas tank was empty to refuel and have something to eat. Additionally, I had to be patient until we reached a rest area or a @CAPS1 on the right-hand side where I could find a vending machine and bathrooms. This was important because it allowed us to get off and back on the highway easily. Throughout the journey, I practiced patience and waited for the right moments to fulfill my needs.
48	17886	7	3	When I was patient, it happened a few times. Once, I remember waiting for what seemed like an eternity to use the phone because my mom was talking on it. I stayed patient for an hour and a half until I finally got my turn. Another instance was when I eagerly wanted to go to @ORGANIZATION1 to grab some pop. Even though I was excited, I patiently waited for my mom to get everyone ready before heading out. Being patient in these situations taught me the value of waiting calmly for my turn and understanding that sometimes, things take time to fall into place.
49	17887	7	3	It was my first camping trip! Well, we went camping when I was one but I donít remember a lot. I was super excited! So, Iím sorry if I couldnít help but wonder where are we going! My patience was not very good. While I was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck I sat there very bored. I kept saying when are you going to be done? Or, when are we leaving? Every time I got, just be patient honey. So, I tried it wasnít really working. We finally left, it was an hour drive and when you're seven that's a very long time. I had nothing to do, I was bored out of my mind! So, I said ìdaddy when are we gonna be there?î I got later, just be patient. So I followed demands and went along with his idea. Once we got there the first thing I wanted to do was swim. So as my mom was getting her swimsuit on. I was so impatient I looked like I had ants in my pants. I was going to go knock on the bathroom door but, I didn't I took what I had learned earlier and did it. I sat down and patiently waited for my mom. So throughout this, I learned a big lesson on patience. If you are patient things will happen much faster. I still use this lesson today. But everyone in a while everyone is a little impatient. Patience is a virtue that can make a big difference in how smoothly things go.
50	17888	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my siblings and I were eagerly waiting to see if our parents would allow us to get our first puppy. After a long hour of waiting, our parents finally called us down to the basement to deliver their decision. Initially, they said no, which left us feeling disheartened. However, my sister managed to persuade my dad with a heartfelt expression, leading him to ultimately say yes to getting the puppy. Despite the excitement, we had to wait to bring the puppy home as we were going out of town in two days. On the following day, my mom surprised my dad by bringing the puppy, named Shaggy, home. We all instantly fell in love with him, and he became our new beloved companion.
51	17889	7	3	You have to be patient when you are cooking some cookies. It takes a long time to cook cookies. You have to be patient when you are waiting to play a game. And you have to be patient in the waiting room until they call your name. You have to be patient when you get out in a game; you have to be patient to get back in. When you get a home run, you have to be patient when they try to get the ball. For example, in the game of Sorry, you have to be patient to draw card 1 or 2. If you draw a 1, you can get out of the house; if you draw a 2, you get out and get another turn. Being patient is key in various situations, whether it's waiting for cookies to bake, your turn in a game, or for your name to be called.
52	17890	7	3	My sister's patience in waiting for our progress reports taught my brothers and me a valuable lesson. While we were anxious and constantly asking about when they would arrive, she remained calm and occupied herself with other activities. When the reports finally came, we were all relieved to see that we had done well. My sister's ability to stay composed and wait patiently inspired us to do the same. Now, we have all learned the importance of patience thanks to her example.
53	17891	7	3	It had been about a year after I got my iPod touch and I really wanted to get this certain movie. The movie was I Am Legend. I had already seen it once from my cousin's iPod, but it was so cool, I had to watch it again. It had so much action in it. And zombies attack.
54	17892	7	3	I know I can I said to myself as I was getting ready to do a back walkover for the first time by myself. I bent backwards tried kicking over and feel! Errg! I stood back up and asked my coach, “Are my shoulders right?” “Push your shoulders over the kick,” my coach replied. “Got it,” I said. As I bent backwards again I slowly raised my left leg to kick over, then I pushed my shoulders forward and I did it! I finally did it by myself! Later that night I showed my mom I could do it. So I did the same exact thing I did at practice. I did it again! But this time at home. The look on my mom face could never be replaced, she was so proud of me. Then she ran over and gave me a high five, then a big bear hug! So I said “thank you for being so patient.” She replied, “Anything for you baby.”
55	17893	7	3	@NUM1 years ago on my birthday, all I wanted was an iPad touch. Despite receiving gifts, the desired item was missing from the presents. Disappointed, I found solace in a birthday card containing money. With patience, I waited for the guests to leave before purchasing the iPad touch. After enduring a few hours, I finally acquired the long-awaited gadget.
56	17894	7	3	A time I was patient is when my little brother kept messing with me. He kept doing dump stuff like pulling the curtains down or playing with the stove. I wanted to hit him. I didnít hit him because he was just being bad. I knew that hitting him wouldn't solve anything and would only make the situation worse. Instead, I stayed calm and tried to distract him with other activities. It took a lot of self-control, but eventually, he got bored and stopped bothering me. Being patient in that moment helped me avoid a potentially harmful situation and taught me the importance of staying calm in frustrating circumstances.
57	17896	7	3	I have been patient numerous times at the doctor's office. Myself, my sister, my brother, and my parents have all had to wait for the shots to be ready. It often takes a long time, sometimes up to two hours, for the medical staff to prepare the vaccinations.   On another occasion, my dad and I had to wait for me to sign up for football. We waited to get the right-sized helmet and pads, as well as for the necessary paperwork to be completed. Additionally, there was a delay when my mom bought my dad a new gun, and he had to register it under his name.  When signing up for basketball in Pleasantville, the process was time-consuming as well. Getting my number on the shirt, selecting the right size of basketball shorts, and completing all the registration requirements took a while. Similarly, when I played soccer for the community team, there was a long wait due to the high number of kids interested in participating.  At school, my friends and I often wait around twenty to thirty minutes to get our lunch or snacks. The line can be slow-moving, delaying our time to enjoy outdoor activities like football, soccer, volleyball, and kickball.  In various aspects of life, patience is required when waiting for things to be prepared or processed. Whether it's at the doctor's office, sports sign-ups, or school, delays are a common occurrence that teaches us the value of patience.
58	17897	7	3	I was patient when my mom was giving birth to my baby brother. We had to sit in the waiting room. My sister and I for 4 hours I slept a few times and a lot because my dad was hungry so he got us some food. The first hour I was excited and couldnít wait. The second hour I was coloring with the crayons and paper the nurse brought to us. The third hour I watched TV. The fourth hour I slept till about midnight, thatís what my sister said. My dad came out with a plastic-looking gown on with the matching head cover and slippers, and he said, ìthe next time he comes out, my sister and I were gonna be sisters to a baby boy.î My sister and I were so happy. An hour later, my dad came out and said, ìdo you want to see your baby brother?î My sister and I screamed, ìyes!î When we saw him, we were so happy to think he was all ours.
59	17898	7	3	If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patience or motivation? In this situation, I would ask for patience. I remember when I was about four or five years old, my two sisters and I boarded a plane to Florida. It seemed like we were sitting on the plane for hours before it actually took off. After about ten minutes, I asked if we would be there soon. My sister said no, and that we were only up in the air for about ten minutes. I watched all the people just sitting there, some were on laptops and listening to music players. I looked up at my sister and wondered how she could be so patient. After I asked if we were almost there for the second time, my sister did not answer me. I just sat there doing nothing. I had nothing to entertain myself with. I did not say a word for two hours then I eventually fell asleep. If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patience or motivation? I am still not very patient, but I am more patient than I was back then.
60	17899	7	3	ì@CAPS1! Look out!î @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deafening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. The eerie silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to what they considered safety. In no way was this to be considered safety, for this was the beginning of one living nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Hereís a picture of what I saw: cars, twisted, tangled, and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expanded slowly, but as it did, excruciating sounds radiated from him. Blood trickled out from his many cuts. It was unbearable to watch. Ambulancesí sirens wailed as they approached. My father I had yet to see. And thatís what scared me most.  I still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in some ways, Iíd lost my mother as well. Sheíd never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadnít made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, Iíd still have a father and little brother. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constantly, never listening to what the other has to say. Maybe itís just the life of a typical teen and her mother. I wouldn't know because in no way were we typical. When we arenít fighting about who-knows-what, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart-pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud!  My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. She starts, ìI know I havenít been patient with you lately, and for that Iím sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you one thing.î I give her a questioning gaze, so she continues, ìI would like you to tell me why you blame yourself?î She didn't have to explain any further. ì@CAPS6, I made my father turn around,î my voice caught in my throat, ìjust to get my stupid notebook.î A single tear weaved its way down my face. ì@CAPS7, honey!î my mother teared up as well. ìThat doesn't make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way!î I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. She was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. ì@CAPS8,î I said, regaining composure, ìthatís how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe over time I will, but right now, I just need my mother.î What shocked me most was the smile that formed on my motherís lips. ìI will wait then.î And then she hugged me. She hugged me as she had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a newfound relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definitely there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect.
61	17900	7	3	"There was one time I was patient when my little brother's PlayStation wasn't working. It took a while to figure out the issue, as some of his games were scratched up. Despite buying new games, the problem persisted. Eventually, after patiently troubleshooting, we were able to clear up the PlayStation and get it working again. We developed a little ritual of chanting ""work, work, work, work"" until the PlayStation finally turned on. From that day on, we still joke about our little chant whenever we encounter technical difficulties."
62	17901	7	3	Patience. I was patient when I had to babysit. I rocked him and played with him. I fed him, and walked him. He fell asleep. My mom still is not home from work. I am going to be late to the movies with my cousins. I played the game for a while. I looked out the window, walked outside, and sat on the steps. Mom still wasn't there. My cousins were outside. I asked them to stay a little longer. Finally, I saw my mom's car pulling into the driveway. I can go now. It was a test of patience, but I made it through.
63	17902	7	3	There are many times when I've been patient but here are just a few. It was a late afternoon, my family & I were supposed to go to a big function that day. Like always I didnít know what I was going to wear, about an hour later I found what I was going to wear. I went downstairs but no one was ready & we only had half an hour left. I was frustrated, told everyone to get ready, but nobody listened to me. However, I didn't make a big deal out of it and went up to take a shower. Just as I was about to go in, my mom came and told me I had to wait because she needed to take a shower. One by one, everyone took a shower except for me. I was losing my patience but still waited patiently. Finally, when it was my turn to shower, I did so quickly. We were all dressed & ready to go, but at the last minute, my sister forgot her bag & jacket, so we had to wait for her to get them. Despite the delays, we eventually made it to the party, not on time but at least we made it. In conclusion, examples of me showing patience include waiting for others to shower and waiting for my sister to retrieve her bag and jacket.
64	17903	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was waiting on my mom to have her baby. The reason why is because she was being difficult to deal with. She was moody and irritable, making it hard for me to stay calm. So, I kept reminding myself that she needed to have the baby soon so everything would go back to normal. This was when she was only a few months pregnant, so I knew I had to be patient with her until the nine months were over.
65	17904	7	3	One day @CAPS1 was at a baseball conference when she signed up for a speech on how to properly handle a baseball trophy. This sparked her interest in baseball even more. Meanwhile, her friend @CAPS2 left the room in frustration, missing the sign-up opportunity. Later, @CAPS2 had to wait in a long line to sign up for the baseball team after the conference, causing him to miss out on valuable playing time. However, once @CAPS2 started playing, he realized he lacked the patience needed for the sport. Frustrated at being at the bottom of the batting lineup and only playing in the outfield, @CAPS2 decided to quit after a ball was hit over his head, causing him to drop his mitt and walk off the field.
66	17905	7	3	I had to exercise patience when I wanted a specific item and had to wait until my birthday to receive it. Developing patience was essential when I desired a new phone, as I had to demonstrate good behavior at school to earn it. This was a challenge for me since I had a history of misbehaving. Despite my impulsive nature, I realized that practicing patience and displaying good conduct were necessary to attain what I desired. In the end, being patient and well-behaved proved to be rewarding as I eventually received the items I had been longing for.
67	17906	7	3	"""Patient!"" yelled as I was almost bouncing off the walls waiting for friend to get to house. ""I get I just can't wait! It's first time, what do you expect!"" I told. DING! The doorbell rang and I sprinted to the door. ""!"" exclaimed. ""you guys need to go wait in the garage for ."" said. ""!"" we said in harmony. We out the door and it was pitch dark. ""I can't see, hold me!"" I screamed in terror. All we saw was headlights and we knew it was . ""Are you guys ready? It's almost and we gotta leave or we won't make it to!"" was excited. Just hearing that word, going to the was the to getting there thing was great, but at , you gotta have a lot of ."
68	17908	7	3	One of the greatest ways for a person to have patience is when you are being hunted down in a game of paintball. I have had experience once, and I hope it never happens again. I was playing paintball with a lot of my friends, and if I was not patient, I would have ended up getting shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except for one.I started breathing harder, because he was right by the tree I was leaning against. I decided I would come close to sacrificing myself if I just stood there, so I climbed up the tree.I was lucky I had a camoflage shirt on, because if I didn't blend in, I would get shot. I was deep in the tree, but it wouldn't have mattered, because I was too heavy for any of the branches. I fell out of the tree, but as I was falling, I shot the enemy in the leg. I had won! That is how patience rewards you.
69	17909	7	3	I was patient a few years ago with my brother @PERSON1. It was almost his birthday, and he was very excited. He was excited because he wanted a flying toy helicopter he had seen while watching television, the helicopter was very expensive, and I did not know if he was getting it for his birth day or not .He wanted me to tell him if he was getting it so he kept bugging me. I wanted to yell at him or hit him, he was so annoying .I did not, because I knew if I did I would get in trouble. So I made up a game to play with him so he would forget about the helicopter and stop asking me. It didnít work, because he kept on asking me any way. I made up another game where you have to jump on the trampoline and spin your arms like a helicopter and not fall over. Finally he stopped asking me about the helicopter and after we ate cake, we actually had to remind him about it. When he opened his presents, he did get a helicopter. We spent the rest of the day trying to make it fly. At the end of the day, my brother was thrilled to have received the helicopter he had been longing for, and we had a great time trying to make it soar through the skies.
70	17910	7	3	One night when I got home from cheer, I was starving, and dinner wasn't even on the grill. We were having steak, brown rice, and mac and cheese. To pass the time, I went upstairs to take a shower. It took ten minutes, but the dinner still wasn't ready, so I decided to do some homework. I worked on math, reading, and studied for a test while waiting. The mac and cheese was finally ready, the steak was almost done, but the brown rice was still cooking.   Despite my hunger, I managed to keep my patience and distracted myself with gum. Finally, the steak was done, the mac and cheese was ready, but the brown rice was still not finished. My sister and I set the table, poured drinks, and eagerly waited for the rice. After a few more minutes, the food was all set, and we sat down to eat. I savored two pieces of steak, three scoops of rice, and a small portion of mac and cheese.   The dinner was absolutely delicious, and after satisfying my hunger, I headed straight to bed feeling content and full.
71	17911	7	3	"One time I was very patient. We were on a train going to @LOCATION1. I didn't have my game or music player. It felt like time would never end, but I didn't complain. I sat in the seat for what felt like forever. Then when we got off the train I said, ""Finally, I'm done."" Then there was the bus ride to the museum of science and history. Not as exciting as I thought to myself. Stop after stop we went, until finally we arrived. It was amazing, with tons of interesting things like an exhibit that made tops spin endlessly. My patience was tested again when we went to the history section. It was like the train ride all over again, with my dad wanting to see everything in detail. After that, we had to take the bus back to the train, and then the train ride again. This time I had a book that kept me occupied, but I still didn't complain. My dad acknowledged that it had been a long day and promised that next time, I could bring my own entertainment. That is my example of patience."
72	17912	7	3	"I want to say I found her, tex right away but I didínt. I learned something though yeah it took @ORGANIZATION1 and all the other @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 intelligence) for me to piece it together.

""Let's stay patient and see if the door eventually unlocks,"" Church suggested as they waited in anticipation for the mysterious door to reveal its secrets."
73	17913	7	3	One time my friend @PERSON1 was at my house and we were playing halo. We were having a very good time. We ate popcorn, drank a lot of pop, and ate a lot of candy. Then @PERSON1 had to go to the bathroom. He was there for a while, and suddenly I had to go to the bathroom. I waited and waited and had to go very bad. I was very polite and patient because I never yelled at him or knocked on the door telling him to hurry up. I did ask him once if he was okay and he said yes. After that, I just waited. Then he came out and @CAPS1 a very big relief.
74	17914	7	3	"Patience, what comes to mind when you hear that word? As a child, I believed it was an unattainable quality, but a personal injury changed my perspective. Being confined to a cast and crutches for four months taught me the value of patience. My mother often reminded me that ""patience is a virtue."" What does it truly mean to possess patience? It requires self-control, the ability to navigate challenging situations while maintaining composure, especially when faced with delays or irritating circumstances. Patience is about managing oneself in the face of adversity and remaining composed when things do not go as planned."
75	17915	7	3	At the doctor's office, there were a lot of people, so my family and I decided to stay and wait for our turn. My mom and dad accompanied me and my sister to the appointment. Despite our initial desire to go outside and play, our parents insisted that we stay inside. We passed the time watching TV, with my mom engrossed in a magazine and my dad reading the newspaper. Eventually, there were only a few patients left before it was our turn. When our names were called, my parents walked with us to the examination room to ensure my sister felt comfortable during her check-up. Once the appointments were completed, my dad settled the bill, and we headed back home, demonstrating patience throughout the entire process.
76	17916	7	3	One day I had to wait in a line for hours just to get on a roller coaster. It was hot and I wasn't very patient, so I just fell asleep while standing with my eyes open. My mom had to have patience when we were in traffic to get to the camping grounds. We had to wait hours just to get out of traffic but mom didn't freak out or anything. It was a test of our patience, but we managed to stay calm and eventually reach our destination.

This experience taught him that being patient and calm can lead to positive outcomes, even in situations that seem unfair or frustrating.
78	17918	7	3	"Patience is crucial when it comes to hunting. I remember a time last year when my dad and I went hunting for deer in the woods near our home. We carefully made our way to a blind that we had set up previously, and settled in to wait. The hours passed slowly as we sat quietly, scanning the area for any signs of movement.  As the sun started to set, we began to lose hope of seeing any deer that day. But just when we were about to give up, a deer appeared in the distance. My dad slowly raised his gun, taking careful aim. ""Cover your ears,"" he whispered to me. The shot rang out, but there was no sign of blood or any indication that he had hit the target.  Disappointed but not discouraged, we packed up our gear and headed home. Even though we didn't come back with a deer that day, the experience taught me the importance of patience in hunting. Sometimes, it's not just about the end result, but the journey and the lessons learned along the way. Patience is truly a virtue, especially when it comes to activities like hunting."
79	17919	7	3	"A time that I was patient is when I broke my foot. It was a day when I was at the park. I was climbing a pole to ring the bell when I slide. My little brother came running over and I told him to go and get help. He had no idea where to go so I lied on the ground with a broken foot for over an hour. When my brother returned he asked, ""where do I go?"" And I told him to go to the gas station across the street and ask to use the telephone. I was trying to be patient. When he got back, he had my mom. My mom said that I was really patient. She picked me up and we drove to the emergency room. When we got there it was packed. They got us in as soon as they could but it felt like a long time to me. When he called my name, my mom picked me up and we went toward the doctor. He asked, ""what brings you here?"" We told him the news and he took us into the room. The doctor moved my foot around. Ten minutes later, he came back in with the x-rays and announced to us that my foot was broken. He gave me a cast and crutches and then we left. I told my brother thank you and gave him a really big hug. The next day everyone at school said that I was brave and very patient, and I said thank you!"
80	17920	7	3	"One time I was patient when I was in Disneyland getting on a ride called ""It's a Small World."" There was a very long line and I'm usually saying ""Hurry up!"" or sometimes ""Let's go!"" However, I was being patient in the line. I was proud of myself and so was my mom. That was the time I was being patient and it felt good to show self-control in a busy and crowded place like Disneyland."
81	17921	7	3	Tic tak times ticking I was patient one time in the doctor's office. My appointment was at two, and I had to wait and wait and wait. Sitting there, listening to the sound of the clock ticking, was a challenge for me. I tried so hard to be patient, which is not easy for me because I can't sit still for long periods. Despite the difficulty, I managed to stay calm and composed until they finally called me in at @NUM1.  Even after being called in, I had to wait again. It was a test of my patience to sit there, listening to the ticking sound of the clock. It was a struggle to sit there and do nothing but wait, flipping through magazines and trying to distract myself.  Being patient can be tough, especially when you have to wait for extended periods. However, I learned that sometimes it's necessary to be patient and wait for things to unfold in their own time. Despite the challenges, I managed to stay patient and composed during my time at the doctor's office. It was a small victory, but it taught me the importance of patience in various situations.
82	17922	7	3	One time when I was patient was during a twenty-two-hour car ride to Florida with my family. The journey was long and tedious, with me, my cousin, my two sisters, and my parents all cramped in the car. Despite the uncomfortable conditions, I tried to stay patient. As the hours passed, my sister and I bickered over foot space, but I tried to remain calm and composed.  After driving for about five hours, we stopped for dinner before hitting the road again. As night fell, the roads became icy, forcing us to pull over and spend the night in the car. The next morning, we continued our journey, stopping at a Cracker Barrel for a delicious breakfast. Although the trip was arduous, the tasty meal made it a bit more bearable.  Eventually, we reached our destination in Florida, and I realized that my patience had paid off. Despite the challenges we faced during the long drive, the memories we made and the experiences we shared made it all worthwhile. It taught me the value of patience and perseverance in difficult situations.
83	17923	7	3	Some people say that if somebodyís trying to annoy you and you are patient then they will stop, but thats not always true. One day my brother was down loading new ringtones, which I thought was no big dig deal until he downloaded the mosquito tone.  The mosquito tone is a loud highpitched noise that only people under a certain age can hear. Itís really funny if you the one playing it but if your listening to it. it hurts your ears and gives you a headache. So one day my brother has this idea. the one only a jerk could have. he decides heís going to follow me around playing it as loud as it goes. It was terrible, it made my blood curtle. After thirty minutes I decided to call my but it didnít really help. Then I listened to music, so he turned it up. Then I had this amazing idea. I stole his battery. The next day I made a deal with him. If he would stop playing that ringtone I would give him back his battery. Of cource he said yes so I didnít have to the tone anymore. So now you know why patience doesnít always work.  However, sometimes taking action is necessary to deal with persistent annoyances. In this case, a simple negotiation and a bit of cunning led to a resolution that patience alone couldn't achieve. It's important to know when to be patient and when to take matters into your own hands to put an end to unwanted behavior.
84	17924	7	3	"I was patient for a whole month. Although, that was only because my mother had promised to purchase me a brand new video game system. This new video game system was the Wii. For it had just come out and had me interested the first time I saw it. It was completely different and had advanced graphics. I had informed my mother about this system immediately. ""Mom, I will buy it for you, considering your report card was exceptional,"" my mother had guaranteed me. ""Oh, thank you, mother,"" I had exclaimed excitedly. Now I was getting my hopes up and expecting the Wii within a few weeks. Although I had done that only to later on disappoint myself. My mother had informed us that I was to get the Wii in between the time period of one to two months. ""One to two months?"" I had shouted. ""Oh no, two months? I don't have enough time to think about that stuff, there are more important things to consider,"" my mother explained. So that is what started the longest period of patiently waiting in my entire life. After approximately one and a half months of waiting, my mother had finally said, ""We are going to the store today to buy your Wii."" At that very moment, I nearly exploded from happiness. ""Yes!"" I had started to do a dance that no one understood, not even me. When we pulled up to my favorite video game retail store, I was so excited I couldn't sit still. ""Calm down! Geez, it's just a video game system!"" I stopped immediately. ""That's what you think,"" I mumbled to myself. When we returned home, I kept playing until late at night. So that is when I learned that patience pays off when you are patient."

Dinner was a this seafood resteraunt wich was bad anyway because i hate seafood!while all this waiting was happening I kept my patience even when it took an hour to get our meals! Even worse was waiting for the disney busses to get back to your hotel. My mom and dad said they were very proud of me keeping my patients through all of the waiting. I learned all lot of things there. One disneyland is not a good place for people like me who are not very patient.

So,thats @NUM2 time I had to have a lot of patients, but i realized patients is a good thing to have.   Patience is a virtue that can be challenging to uphold, especially in situations like waiting in long lines at Disneyland. Despite the difficulties and frustrations that come with it, I managed to maintain my composure and patience throughout the ordeal.

86	17927	7	3	Tick and tock went the second of my watch as I observed people coming in and out of the airport with presents and boxes of gifts. The crowd was not overwhelming, just a few passengers here and there. I strolled through the airport terminal, listening to the hustle and bustle of travelers around me. It was a peaceful moment amidst the chaos of holiday travel.   As I waited for my flight at the gate, I reflected on the concept of patience. It's about staying calm and composed in the face of uncertainty and delays. Patience is a virtue that allows us to navigate through life's challenges with grace and resilience.   Finally, my boarding call came, and I made my way onto the plane. The flight was smooth, and before I knew it, I was back at the airport, ready to head home. In moments of waiting and uncertainty, patience truly is a valuable companion, guiding us through the ups and downs of life's journey.
87	17928	7	3	"One day I went to a concert at @ORGANIZATION1 and there was a very long line. While I was in the line there was this girl who had no patience because we had to wait in line for @NUM1 1/@NUM1 hours. When that time passed, we all went to get our spots and before we had done that, there was this long line again, even longer, but it was okay because I had patience. With all this patience, it reminded me of my mom when she went to the doctor's office for @NUM3 hours and I had to wait in the waiting room. Additionally, I remember a time when I was in the living room with my mom and she started talking on the phone. She told me to hold on, but my sister kept interrupting her. I reminded my sister to wait for mom to finish her call, but she ran upstairs and called me a ""stupid punk."" I simply replied, ""I don't care."" It's important to remain patient in various situations, just like I did at the concert and with my family."
88	17930	7	3	I remember the time I was patient with my parents. It started when I saw this game I wanted at the store. Kindly I asked my dad to get it for so he said he would get it for on the following weekend. So I had to be patient and wait for the weekend to come. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didnít keep my mouth shut so my mom didnít want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be @DATE1 he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. Thatís exactly what I did and I got my game. Later my dad gave her back her money and we were all happy. The point is that it took a lot patience to get my reward.
89	17931	7	3	Being patient as a kid is never really easy. I know being patient is like taking a baby's lollipop away from mom - it's just not pretty. But one time I really had to use my patience. Now it wasn't easy at all waiting in line at Kings Island for hours just to go on a ride. We waited about another 30 minutes, maybe 45 minutes and yes! It started working again. So many people had left us which was nice because the line shortened some, but it was still probably going to be a long wait. It was nice when we got in the building because it was nice and air-conditioned. We sat around waiting and debating on whether or not we wanted to stay or leave. We ended up staying and waiting for what seemed like forever! Until we stepped into the space shuttle. There was another room we had to go through to get to the ride. Finally, the wait was over! Using my patience and waiting in line forever really paid off in the end. It was a great ride.
90	17932	7	3	"@PERSON1, this is boring! I want to try my backflip! I whined. @CAPS1, you're not ready yet, just wait. If you wait and practice more, it will be easier,"" said @PERSON1, as she spotted one of the other gymnasts in their back-hard-spring. We had been working on our back-hard-springs for weeks and I was the best at them, in the class. We had to wait another two weeks until we started  on our back flips, but I really wanted to try it out. I rolled my eyes at @ORGANIZATION1's answer, and continued to practice my back-hard-springs. I was doing them down the wedge, and in the middle of each one, I'd do a little roll for fun. Someone called @PERSON1 so she walked out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my coach, didn't mean that she should tell me when I should, or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and @PERSON1 was out of the room, so it was my chance. I took a deep breath and lunged into my backflip. As I glided through the air, the thought that I never learned how to land my flip crossed my mind, and I landed on my ankle. ""@CAPS2!"" I yelled. I tried to stand up, but I couldn't; my ankle hurt so bad! @PERSON1 ran into the gym as I fell, after attempting to stand up. ""@CAPS3 happened?"" ""I tried my back flip.""  ""I told you not to! If you were patient, and waited till I showed you how to do one, this wouldn't have happened!""  ""@CAPS4‚Ä¶"" ""I'll go get an ice pack."" @CAPS5 since that day, I have had problems with my ankle. If I had been patient, I wouldn't have gotten hurt, and I would still be in gymnastics, @CAPS6 then on, I've known that being patient is the right thing to do."

It felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. Thatís my story about patience.
92	17935	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my mom took my sisters shopping. My dad was at work and my mom took me and my older sisters shopping. It was boring, as the stores we visited had separate sections for boys and girls, and some stores only carried girls' clothing which I didn't enjoy. Despite this, I remained patient and didn't complain. Eventually, my mom asked me where I wanted to go, and I suggested going to Best Buy. There, I was able to get a game called College Football OQ. This experience taught me that having patience can lead to positive outcomes. It's important to remain patient in all situations and it can eventually pay off.
93	17936	7	3	I am patient, always waiting for something or working to earn it. Whether it's waiting to go out with my parents or eagerly anticipating a visit to my aunt's house, patience is a constant in my life. However, the ultimate test of my patience comes when we venture up to @LOCATION1 for a camping trip. The waiting involved in preparing for the trip, setting up camp, and waiting for activities to start can be challenging, but the rewards of enjoying nature and spending time with loved ones make it all worth it in the end. Patience truly is a virtue, especially when it comes to the great outdoors.

It was the funest ride there, and I enjoyed every thrilling moment of it.

I tried my best to clear my head and be patient. But when I opened them, I was sitting on some bars in line for the roller coaster at Cedar Point. The voices of many people ran through my ears as laughter, happiness, and excitement filled the air. The line was estimated at a two-hour wait, but my friend and I were determined to ride the thrilling roller coaster.  As we inched closer to the front of the line, the hot sun beat down on us, making us sweat and test our patience. I couldn't help but wonder why it was taking so long. My friend suggested that next time we should visit during the week to avoid the crowds, but we were already there and committed to the wait.  To pass the time, I pulled out my music player and listened to my favorite songs, allowing the music to calm my impatience. The line slowly moved forward, and before I knew it, we were at the front of the line, ready to board the roller coaster. I was proud of myself for remaining patient and not giving in to frustration.  As we soared through twists and turns on the roller coaster, I realized that patience truly does pay off. I learned the value of being patient and how it can lead to great rewards in the end. Waiting in line for the roller coaster taught me an important lesson that I will carry with me in all aspects of my life.
97	17940	7	3	I am always patient when I hunt and fish. Setting up quietly in a chosen spot, whether in a tree stand or on the ground, I wait for the right moment to catch a glimpse of deer, turkey, or any other game. Sometimes, hours pass by without any sign of wildlife. However, the key to a successful hunt is to rise early and maintain patience. During deer season, I often spot several deer by simply waiting quietly in the wilderness. Patience is truly the virtue that leads to a successful hunt.
98	17941	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my fitted, mirror, league hats to come in the mail. They said it would only take a few days, so I eagerly anticipated their arrival. However, as days turned into weeks, my excitement waned.

Despite the delay, I remained patient and kept believing that they would eventually arrive. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the long-awaited package showed up at my doorstep. The joy and satisfaction of receiving the hats made all the waiting worthwhile, proving that sometimes, patience truly is a virtue.
99	17942	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my favorite time of the year comes, the summer break.

You could smell the tension in the air as everyone watched the clock spin on the last day of school. As the hours went by slowly, minutes, seconds, everyone grew restless, but I was patient; I sat, I waited, I listened, I read. But nothing compared to the hot final moment when the bell rang and the students cheered. A smile on everyone's faces as they left the door for the final time that year.

It was a long process, but in the end, my patience paid off, and I was able to get the phone I had worked so hard for.

105	17949	7	3	Patience is crucial when waiting in lines, whether it be for a new game or a ticket to a show. It is essential to remain calm and composed instead of becoming agitated and restless.

Being patient in various situations in life is important for maintaining a sense of peace and composure.
106	17950	7	3	Being patient can be challenging, but I distinctly recall a time when I exhibited great patience.

I remained calm and composed throughout the wait, maintaining my patience until the group was finally complete.
107	17951	7	3	"One time I was patient is when I was going skating. And I was waiting for my mother to come pick me up from the rink.

After I got picked up we went and picked my cousins up from school too! Then we went to there house got ready and we were off to a day we had all been waiting for. We arrived at @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1, and the excitement in the air was palpable. The lights, the sounds, the atmosphere - everything was just as I had imagined. I couldn't contain my joy as we explored all the attractions, tried different foods, and watched amazing performances. Time seemed to fly by, and before I knew it, it was time to head back home.

I learned that patience is key when it comes to getting things done, and it's worth the wait when the end result is something you really wanted."

115	17962	7	3	Hunting is one of my favorite hobbies. Hunting requires a lot of patience. When you are sitting in a tree blind, you may experience some of the most boring moments of your life, which definitely requires a lot of patience. However, as you settle in and embrace the quiet, the woods around you come alive. I have to admit, I am not the most patient person, but hunting demands a different kind of patience. Many may view hunting as simply sitting around doing nothing. Yet, if you remain patient and silent, you will be rewarded with the game you are pursuing. This unique form of patience required for hunting is both engaging and fulfilling. It challenges us to slow down, observe our surroundings, and appreciate the natural world. Patience in hunting teaches us the value of stillness and the thrill of anticipation. It is a reminder that sometimes, the most rewarding experiences come to those who wait. In a fast-paced world, hunting offers a valuable lesson in patience that we can all benefit from.

125	17973	7	3	Last weekend I went to Cedar Point. And we drove for hours! Oh my goodness, my back hurt! We got there and there were no parking spots, so we had to park in the back lot! But then I got excited as we walked towards the park. I saw the Wicked Twister and was thrilled when my friend asked me to pick the first ride. Of course, I chose the Wicked Twister. The line for the ride seemed endless, taking 30 minutes to finally get on. I was surprisingly patient that day, even when we turned the corner and saw even more people waiting. Despite the long lines, I managed to ride almost all the attractions in the park and indulged in a massive burger, fries, and shake. It was a day filled with fun, thrills, and a test of my patience!

My mom tells her she has to wait, but she insists, ""I don't want to wait."" I sit in silence, gazing out the window, feeling helpless. My sister starts to scream, ""I have to go to the bathroom."" I try to calm her down, handing her a candy which only keeps her quiet for a short while. After what feels like an eternity, my sister falls asleep in the backseat. Eventually, the traffic begins to inch forward, then stops again, before finally moving along. We finally reach our exit and my sister rushes into the dance studio just in time for her class. That day, I learned the value of patience in the face of unexpected delays."
127	17975	7	3	About three years ago, my family and I spent a weekend at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 sun dusky, @LOCATION1. It was a perfect weekend except driving four hours in car with older & younger siblings in the car. It was lould, there was crying, there was all of that annoying junk, but I was patient. When my family & I arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it was crowded! Like jam pack crowded. My mom took little sister & brother on the kiddy rides & my dad took my brother and I. My group went on all of the big scary rides. I went on about every single scary ride that day except for the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This ride was the biggest one of all time. I was dying to go on it. My group got in line & relize their line was about half a mile long & there park was going to clothes soon. Twenty minutes laterÖ I was being so patient in this line. We were in the quarter of a mile range in the line. My dad decided it wasnít worth it. So my group met up with the rest of my family & we sadly left @ORGANIZATION1. It was one of the most sadest ride  move ever. So maybe next time I should be more patient.  On our way home, I reflected on the day and realized that patience truly is a virtue. While I was disappointed that I didn't get to ride the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I knew that there would be other opportunities in the future. Sometimes things don't go as planned, but it's important to stay positive and make the most of the situation. As we drove back, I made a mental note to practice patience and optimism, no matter what challenges may come my way.
128	17976	7	3	Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are being patient. Patience isnít just waiting a long time, it's being respectful and not complaining about waiting. In order to be patient, you have to be respectful and quiet unless they ask you something. It takes hard work to be patient. If you're at school and need to go to the bathroom, wait until the teachers are done talking to someone, or if he/she is on powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when they're talking. People will like you a little more if you're patient. So remember, when you're waiting for someone or something, remember the word patience.

The memories we created that day will forever be cherished, a testament to the rewards of being patient and persevering through challenges.
131	17979	7	3	One day, as I was preparing to eat out, I found myself stuck in a long line. Frustrated, I called my friends @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 to pass the time. We started discussing the upcoming @CAPS1 test, and in the midst of our conversation, I couldn't help but express my impatience with the wait. They advised me to be patient and not complain, explaining that patience means understanding and tolerance. Taking their advice to heart, I decided to give it a try. Before I knew it, I was seated at a table in Red Lobster, enjoying my meal, all thanks to a little patience. Now, I've learned that in situations with long lines, a little patience goes a long way in making the experience more bearable.
132	17980	7	3	This is a story about when I was patient. My family was planning a camping trip to go up to a huge camp ground that was about three hours away. So I packed a magazine, some paper, my pencil, and decided to make the best of it. My sister and I played against each other in tic-tac-toe for about an hour, but my mind was constantly on the upcoming camping trip. Later, I found a magazine about camping and drew pictures for another half an hour, which was quite enjoyable. After taking a nap, I woke up eagerly anticipating our arrival at the campsite. Finally, my dad announced that we had arrived. We set up camp, played on the playground, went swimming, and had a bonfire. All the waiting was definitely worth it. The ride back home seemed much quicker, and I realized that being patient had its rewards.

Despite my growing frustration, I waited patiently for my turn. I tried my best to hold it in, but I knew I couldn't wait forever. Eventually, I had to bang on the door and insist on being let in. Finally, I was able to use the bathroom and relieve myself. This experience taught me the importance of patience in difficult situations.
136	17984	7	3	Patience is a virtue that is essential in life. Without it, we can become frustrated and restless. One instance where I practiced patience was when I decided to purchase an iPod touch after a certain date. With no physical stores open, I turned to online shopping through Amazon. Despite my excitement, I had to wait for about a week for the delivery. During this time, I found ways to keep myself occupied. When the iPod touch finally arrived, the joy and satisfaction were worth the wait. This experience taught me the value of patience and the importance of waiting for good things to come. It also helped me become more patient in various aspects of my life. Overall, being patient not only brings rewards but also helps us grow and develop as individuals.
137	17985	7	3	"Over the weekend, on the Saturday to be exact, me and my family decided to go see fireworks at a local park. It was a special time for me and my brother to catch up with all my friends, and we were both filled with excitement. It took us more than an hour to get there, but I remained patient throughout the journey, knowing that my mom would not appreciate any complaints. ""Are we there yet?"" my brother whined. ""Be patient, my dear brother, we just got in the car,"" I replied. Despite my brother's impatience making the ride feel longer, I stayed quiet and tried to enjoy the anticipation of the fireworks display."
138	17986	7	3	Patience is crucial in life, as it often leads to rewarding outcomes. I remember a time when my patience truly paid off. Two months before my birthday, I asked my mom for a phone. Despite my persistence, she insisted I was too young and needed to wait. As my birthday approached, I continued to hope for a phone of my own. Finally, on my birthday, I received the much-anticipated gift. I was overjoyed and immediately began using it to connect with my friends. This experience taught me the value of patience and how it can lead to fulfilling results. In the end, waiting for what we desire can bring us even greater joy and satisfaction.
139	17987	7	3	One day when I was home alone, I felt like nobody was with me. My parents had gone to visit my sick uncle, leaving me feeling scared and abandoned. I prayed for comfort, but all I heard was silence. Eventually, exhaustion overtook me, and I fell asleep. In my dreams, I heard a voice calling out to me. It was my guardian angel, a comforting presence in a field of grass. As he spoke to me, all my fears and loneliness melted away. He assured me that I was never truly alone, for he was always watching over me. With his words of reassurance, I found the patience to wait for the guidance of a higher power. The memory of my angelic encounter stayed with me, a reminder that even in moments of solitude, I am always under the watchful eye of my guardian angel.
140	17988	7	3	The time when I was patient was when Christmas came around. At first, I just wanted Christmas to get here. But my mom told me I had to wait and that it will come soon. So I waited because I really wanted a Wii console and The Sims 4. Finally, when Christmas arrived, I got what I wanted and more. I'm usually not that patient, but my mom's advice to be patient paid off. I learned that when you really want something, being patient can make the wait feel shorter. Patience truly is a virtue, especially when it comes to waiting for something you really desire.
141	17989	7	3	Every day on the bus, I have this kid who sits next to me. He can be annoying at times, but I still listen to him. Despite our occasional debates, we usually get along. He often tells me wild stories about @CAPS1 and snipers. While he may not be a close friend, I believe that being there to listen and talk to him is a valuable mission. It's clear that he doesn't have many friends, so having someone to chat with seems important to him. I see our interactions as a way to offer him some companionship and support, making our bus rides a bit more bearable for both of us.
142	17990	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I believe we should practice patience in our daily lives as it is a valuable trait to possess. Patience is crucial in various situations, such as waiting in line at the fair, queuing up for lunch, and teaching a dog tricks. When at the fair, it is important to be patient while waiting in line for rides or purchasing tickets. Similarly, in the lunch line, patience is necessary as everyone is waiting to eat. Teaching a dog tricks also requires patience as it is a gradual process. Whether at the fair, school, or home, exercising patience is essential for smooth interactions and successful outcomes. Overall, patience plays a significant role in our lives and should be cultivated for better experiences and relationships.
143	17991	7	3	Patience is something that people often lack, but it can lead to great rewards. I remember a time when my little brother was struggling to learn how to catch a football. Despite multiple failed attempts, I chose to be patient and keep encouraging him. Finally, after many tries, he successfully caught the ball and was ecstatic. This experience taught me the importance of patience and perseverance. It showed me that with determination and support, anyone can overcome challenges and achieve success.
144	17992	7	3	To me, when someone is being patient, they are in line or waiting for something and they are being very calm. They aren't rushed and are very quiet. Being patient means showing self-control and tolerance in difficult situations, without becoming agitated or upset. It involves waiting calmly for something to happen or for someone to do something. Patience is a valuable trait that can help us navigate through life's challenges with grace and composure. It allows us to approach situations with a level head and make thoughtful decisions. In a fast-paced world where instant gratification is often expected, patience is a virtue that should be cultivated and appreciated. So, next time you find yourself in a situation that requires patience, take a deep breath, remain calm, and remember that good things come to those who wait.
145	17993	7	3	"My brothers checkup was today, why did I come? All I did was sit patiently for hours, there was nothing I could do but wait. Waiting there in a dark room was hard, I picked up a car magazine and started flipping through it, the interesting thing was an article about a new car coming out. I read that in detail as I went to the bathroom, and quickly returned to the wasteland of darkness. I whipped out my phone and texted a couple of people, hoping for some distraction. Five minutes passed with no response, so I closed my eyes and laid my head back, trying to pass the time. Right when I was about to lose my mind with boredom, my brother entered the room and said, ""That's it."" And then, I received texts from two people, providing some relief from the monotony of waiting. It would have been better to receive those messages while I was bored out of my mind."
146	17996	7	3	The time I was patient was when I went snowmobiling with my family. My dad and I had to get the snowmobiles warmed up, off the trailer, and started. He would ride one sled to create a track for us, and I would ride behind him on the other sled. I made sure the snow gear was on, and once everything was set, we would head to my aunt's house in @LOCATION1. I have had the chance to explore many places on the sleds during our family adventures.
147	17997	7	3	This is the time when I was patient with my friend @PERSON1. We live in the same apartment building and spend a lot of time together. One day, I invited her to go to the carnival with me. I noticed that she was feeling scared, particularly of rollercoasters. However, I reassured her that we would only go on smaller rides, so she agreed to come along.   When we arrived at the carnival, she was still apprehensive about going on some of the rides. I suggested starting with the smallest ride to ease her into it. Gradually, she became less fearful and even expressed interest in trying bigger rides. I supported her decision and encouraged her to step out of her comfort zone.   As we continued to explore the carnival and go on different rides, she eventually overcame her fear and thanked me for being patient and understanding. It was a rewarding experience to see her conquer her fears, and I was glad to be there for her as a supportive friend.
148	17998	7	3	There have been times in my life where I had to be patient. My friends and I that day had decided to go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. I love roller coasters, but I hate the lines that come with. When we got there we had to wait a half an hour to get in. When we made the decision to go on the @CAPS2 ride first. Next, we had to wait another @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. Other rides we want on too had a long wait. So throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting. Even when we got food we had to wait with all this waiting it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the waiting and long lines. By the end of the day all of us had gotten used to using our patience. That trip to @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 taught me to be a more patient person. Throughout the day, we learned the importance of patience and how it can lead to a more enjoyable experience, even in the face of long waits and delays.
149	18000	7	3	The patience, the engines roared, the propellers spun, the plane moved forward, toward the runway. Everyone cheered. Then we heard a loud crack and the plane stopped. We sat there for over an hour. Finally, the pilot got on the intercom and told us to get our luggage, exit the plane, and go back to the airport terminal. At that time, I was about to lose my patience but I kept it. Why? Well, it all started at the airport terminal. I never really liked planes. However, when I heard we were going all the way to our destination from our starting point, I gladly took the plane rather than a long car ride. We boarded the plane at the airport through gate. The plane took off fast and we were flying. I was a little confused when we landed minutes later in a different city. I thought we were going to our final destination! It turns out we had a layover there. I had to sit and be patient for two hours. I was really excited to go to our final destination and I hate sitting and waiting. Two hours later, we found out that our flight was delayed an hour. We sat and waited until we finally boarded the plane. As we started moving forward, the plane's wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off. The flight attendants helped us unload the plane. I noticed all the grumpy faces of the people who wanted to get on with the flight. I agreed with them but I tried to be patient. After three hours of intense waiting, the plane was fixed and we were off. I knew if I had not been patient I would not have made it on the long journey to our final destination.
150	18001	7	3	One time I got sent to my room, and I had to sit on my bed without being able to do anything. When I asked to be let out, my request was denied, and more time was added to my punishment. I ended up spending about an hour and a half in my room, feeling extremely bored. Eventually, I even took a nap for about twenty minutes out of sheer boredom. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I was allowed to leave my room.

153	18005	7	3	Patient; When arriving at Cedar Point, there was one ride I couldn't wait to go on, the @CAPS1. The only problem was the @NUM1-hour wait under the blazing hot sun for two days. Doubts crept in, but the sight of the mesmerizing shades of green from the truck up ahead reassured me. After what felt like an eternity, my brother and I passed the time playing @NUM4 @CAPS4 until we finally boarded. Strapped into the front row seat, we were in for a thrilling ride. The roller coaster slowly ascended, then plunged down at @NUM5 miles per hour, twisting and turning in every direction for three minutes. As we pulled back into the station, exhilarated and breathless, we embarked on the long car ride home, already planning our next adventure and another round of @NUM4 @CAPS5.
154	18006	7	3	When I was ten years old, my mom promised me a phone, but I had to wait until my birthday next month. I was excited because the phone was a touchscreen with a keyboard. Despite my impatience, I tried my best to be patient. The commercials for the phone kept tempting me, and seeing my friends with phones made it even harder. As the days passed, I longed for my birthday to arrive quickly. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the day before my birthday came. I woke up the next morning to find a brand new phone as my present. My heart was filled with joy, and I thanked my mom for the wonderful gift. Waiting patiently had indeed paid off, and I was overjoyed with my new phone.
155	18008	7	3	When I was in fourth grade, I went to a concert with my friends. We had to wait in a long line to get in, which required a lot of patience. As we stood in line, we entertained ourselves by playing games and chatting. Despite the slow progress, I tried to stay calm and not rush my mom. Eventually, we reached the front of the line, and our excitement grew. It was a rewarding experience because my patience paid off. If I had been impatient and annoyed my mom, it could have ruined the fun. Once inside the concert, I had a great time and enjoyed the event to the fullest. This taught me the importance of patience in achieving a positive outcome.
156	18011	7	3	Patience is crucial in various situations, such as checking out at a store or dealing with a large group of students at school. At times, people can become impatient and rude, especially when faced with long lines or challenging circumstances. In these instances, it is important to exercise patience and maintain a calm demeanor. For example, in a school setting like Kinchat School, where there are numerous students and various needs to attend to, patience is essential. During lunchtime, for instance, the cafeteria may be bustling with activity, and some students may need assistance due to injuries or other issues. By practicing patience in such situations, one can navigate through the challenges effectively and ensure a positive outcome for all involved. Thus, in both personal and professional environments, patience plays a vital role in promoting understanding, cooperation, and overall success.
157	18012	7	3	"A time I was patient is when I took my karate black belt test. It took two days to complete the test, which was on November 15th and 16th, from 9 am to about 5 pm. I passed my black belt test! I then had to wait patiently until December 3rd, the day I received my black belt. That is my greatest accomplishment in my whole life so far, and it wasn't easy. I started training when I was five, and I am now twelve. I had to perform 30 katas I knew at the time, and about 50 stances, blocks, kicks, and strikes, and spar for 5 minutes, also known as kumite. I also needed to make a poster, get a parent recommendation, teacher recommendation, write a 10-page report, and a written test. I had to perform a kata and show self-defense application, do a weapon skit, practical self-defense skit, and send in a progress report. In conclusion, I had to ""earn"" my black belt. No animals or persons were harmed in the making of this incredible martial artist's life story."
158	18013	7	3	One time I went to Cedar Point and I was riding in the car with my sister and parents. We were about an hour away from the amusement park and I fell asleep during the journey. When we arrived, I was filled with excitement and couldn't wait to go on the roller coasters. As we walked through the park, the sound of people screaming on the rides filled the air. We decided to get in line for a roller coaster, and I was at the back of the line feeling impatient. Despite my initial hesitation, I eventually rode the roller coaster in a matter of seconds. This experience taught me the importance of patience, even in moments of excitement and anticipation.
159	18014	7	3	Patience is a virtue I have always wanted. Sometimes I lose my patience when something takes too long. In @ORGANIZATION1, there was an event called @CAPS1. It was raining, and many people wanted to see if @CAPS2 would close down. The rain miraculously stopped, but I had to wait until @TIME1. It was only six forty! So in other words, my family and I had to stand and wait for two hours and thirty minutes. The two hours seemed to take forever. It was an unbelievable torture! My brother kept annoying us with his squeaky noises. He had to be reprimanded three times before he stopped! Finally, they let us in at @TIME2, and we got some pop and hotdogs. We found our seats and began to watch. Man, Iím glad I was patient enough. The show was worth the wait. The performers were amazing, and the energy in the stadium was electric. I realized that sometimes, being patient can lead to great rewards. The experience taught me the importance of perseverance and how it can pay off in the end. Next time, I will try to remember this lesson and practice patience, no matter how difficult it may seem.
160	18015	7	3	"One day when I was going to @LOCATION1, we drove for @NUM1 whole day because we went in the wrong direction, and my mom got mad. At night, we were trying to find a hotel at about @NUM1:30 am. I was the only one awake because my three brothers @PERSON1, @LOCATION2, and Caman were sleeping in the back of the van. My sister @CAPS1 and I were in the front, and I got really angry because a guy took the last room they had. But I was patient and eventually, we got a room. The next day, we went to @ORGANIZATION1 to stay and were excited to go to the water park/amusement park. There was a new ride called ""The Scoping Tail,"" but we had to wait for @NUM1 hour to go on it. Although I was patient, my mom was getting tired and frustrated with the long wait. The following day, it rained, and we couldn't go to the indoor pool at our hotel due to the crowds. After waiting for almost half an hour, we finally got to go swimming. The next day, it took almost two days to get back home, and we arrived at @TIME1. I helped my parents unpack all our stuff when we got home, and finally, we could go to bed. I was so happy to be back home after a long and eventful trip."
161	18016	7	3	@CAPS1 kids. Today @CAPS10 are going to look into our microscopes. I will pick your partners.î @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @PERSON1 picked @CAPS2 to be my partner. I think she is really smart. @CAPS10 were assigned to microscope. The teacher told us @CAPS10 had to draw everything @CAPS10 see in our notebooks. @CAPS2 looked into the microscope, and saw blue lines scattered everywhere. ì@CAPS3, can I see?î I asked. ì@CAPS4 I have to draw it in my notebook.î @CAPS5 @CAPS2. ì@CAPS1, @CAPS17 hurry up.î I @CAPS5, not noticing I was being impatient. ì@CAPS8, who can accept @PERSON3 in their group? He needs a partner.î @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @CAPS2 looked up from the microscope and raised her hand. ì@CAPS10 can!î @CAPS5 @CAPS2. ì@CAPS12! Really @CAPS2?î I complained. ì@PERSON2, donít be rude. You know he is new to our @CAPS8.î @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @PERSON3 walked over, got a chair and sat down right in front of me. He was patiently waiting for @CAPS2 to draw what she saw in her notebook. ì@CAPS2, can you go any slower?î I shouted. ì@CAPS17, can you yell any louder?î she shouted back. Finally it was @PERSON3ís turn. He looked at the microscope and started drawing. I tried to peek at @CAPS2ís paper. She noticed, and I quickly glanced back. ì@PERSON2, you really need to @CAPS4 your turn and be patient. @CAPS10 will all get a chance to look through it.î @CAPS2 @CAPS5 to me. ìYouíre right. Thanks @CAPS2. Iím sorry I was acting like that.î I @CAPS5. ìitís alright, I act like that too, @CAPS3, maybe @CAPS10 should all sit together at lunch.î @CAPS5 @CAPS2. ìThat would be cool.î @CAPS5 @PERSON3. We all smiled, realizing that patience and understanding were key to a successful teamwork.
162	18017	7	3	Being patient can be a challenge at times, but there are moments when it doesn't bother me. I recall a particular instance when I had to wait for an hour at dance class. My mom dropped me off early, so I patiently waited for the class to start. Initially, I only had to wait for five minutes, which wasn't too bad. However, as time passed, I began to feel restless and bored. I even ventured to the playset to pass the time. When my mom arrived early to pick me up, I had to explain that the class actually started later than she thought. Despite the long wait, I managed to stay calm and composed. This experience taught me the value of patience, even in challenging situations.
163	18018	7	3	I was patient when I had to watch my sister's little girls at her house. My sister invited me to spend the day, but then her godchildren came over. She suddenly remembered she had to go somewhere and left me with the kids for several hours. I had to wait patiently for her to return. Eventually, she did come back, and I was relieved that the long wait was over.
164	18019	7	3	One day I had to wait about @NUM1 hours which seemed like a year, but I didnít complain. I sat in the doctors office waiting to get called, I sat there and waited with my mom. I sat and read a magazine while my mom terted her freind. About three people got called in fourty-five minutes. But I sat and looked at the magazine. They called a kid whoís name was @PERSON1, and I thought it was me because my names @PERSON2. I finished my magazine and went on to the next one. I thought I would like it because it had war on the front of the cover, but its just a cover nothing cool inside except a floating tranlula trick. About one hour passed and only five people were called. I finnally finished all the magazines and I was bored. I watched people get called and called finnally there were only my mom and I and another group, and of course they got called before us. It was about three hours till we were called, and when we did we had to wait even longer because they had technical difficulties with there machines. When we did get in we had to wait a half and hour for the doctor. But we got in, he made my knee twitch and then made me hop on one foot, why I donít know. But he did the regular put the thing that goes in my ear and the thermometer that goes on my tongue. But we finnally got out and went home. My mom asked me how could I be that patient, and I said, ìI have not a clueî. My patience was truly tested that day, but I managed to stay calm and composed throughout the long wait at the doctor's office. Despite the delays and technical difficulties, I kept myself occupied with magazines and remained patient until we were finally seen by the doctor. It was a challenging experience, but I learned the importance of patience and staying positive in difficult situations.
165	18020	7	3	When I went to the doctor because I injured my knee while riding my scooter, I had to be patient and wait for my turn. After waiting for an hour, I finally got to see the doctor who checked my knee and provided me with crutches. Walking up the stairs to my house with the crutches was challenging, but I managed to make it home safely.
166	18021	7	3	I was patient when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my @CAPS1. I was patient because I didnít want to get really excited about @CAPS2. When I get excited about things we have a change in plans, and we would have to ëcancel. So I stayed calm and we were in the car in a little over an hour. Then my brother forgot something and we had to go back and get @CAPS2. I was patient about the delay, and we were quiet the whole way there. Patience paid off in the end, as we finally arrived at @LOCATION1 without any further interruptions.
167	18022	7	3	Has your parents or you ever sent an application for a job? Well my uncle did and was very patient about it. He wanted that job more than a kid wanted ice cream. One day my uncle typed up an application for the job he wanted. When he was done he copied and paste it for an email. When he pressed send he hurried and grabbed his phone hoping for the job. He looked at his phone right when he got up making sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the call, still nothing. It was one week and he was thinking about calling the place, he didnít. Then he got a phone call that afternoon so he quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone. I was just my mom asking if he got the job, all he said was no with a sigh. I felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing yet until one day. The next morning he got a call and he picked it up screaming, ìWhat do you want!î not knowing it was the boss for the job. So he apologized and also got the job. He was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job he really loved how he got it and now knew you always knew to be patient and everything will work out great. So now knowing always be patient no matter the deal is. My uncle may not be an expert, but he should be now. Again remember to always be patient and good things will come your way.

169	18025	7	3	When are they gonna be here! When are they gonna be here! I was in @CAPS1 visiting my family and my cousins were going to be coming in from @LOCATION1. I was so excited and very impatient I couldnít wait until they pulled up in their black car and I could give them a hug that would knock the daylights out of them. It was around lunchtime and I was watching out the window while eating cold pizza. I kept on counting down from ten saying they are going to be here in @NUM1 but they were never there. Soon I realized it was about @NUM2 p.m and knew I wouldn't see them until tomorrow, so I decided to be patient and not waste the whole day thinking about it.  After a good night's rest, I got up, had breakfast, and then watched some @CAPS2. Suddenly, I heard a familiar honk. @PERSON1! @PERSON1! Honk! Honk! Could it really be? No, it couldn't be. But then I saw Uncle @CAPS3 on his big motorcycle. A few hours later, I heard @PERSON1 again, and this time, I jumped up excitedly because it was my cousins, @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS5. I flew out of the chair and totally gave them a hug that knocked the daylights out of them. I guess patience really is the key to enjoying special moments with loved ones.
170	18026	7	3	"A time that someone has been patient with me is when I was younger and my sister taught me how to braid. It took a long time and my small hands didnít always get things right. But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it correctly. That's when she told me these words: ""practice makes perfect."" She let me choose from her best string selection and slowly went over how to do it. Before I knew it, I was braiding just as well as her. I am grateful that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me throughout the process. This experience taught me the value of persistence and the importance of having someone who believes in you."
171	18028	7	3	One time it was hard to wait, but I was patient and in the end it was worth it. One time my family and I were going to Disney World. The morning I woke up, I was so excited because I really wanted to get to the airport and go to Disney World. We packed the car and drove to the airport. In the car, my brother and I were talking about how excited we were. Once we arrived at the airport, we were super excited! However, we were informed that the plane to Orlando was going to be around one hour late. Despite our eagerness to get to Disney World as soon as possible, we had to wait. We walked around the airport, grabbed a bite to eat, and then realized that we only had to wait twenty more minutes. My family and I sat down, chatted, and before we knew it, we were boarding the plane. Being patient truly paid off in the end.
172	18029	7	3	On my birthday, I turned one year older and I was ecstatic! While my sisters prepared for my party, my mom was at work. We had everything ready - drinks, snacks, and even ice cream, but the cake was missing. My mom was supposed to pick it up after work. Despite the cake mishap, I stayed calm and didn't throw a tantrum like my sister did. When my mom finally arrived with the cake, I savored every bite and thought it was definitely worth the wait. I was just grateful to be celebrating another year of life, happy and content at the age of one.
173	18030	7	3	I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby sat @DATE1. I was babysitting with older cousin @PERSON2. We were babysitting twin four-months old baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when ìher baby,î @PERSON3, spit up on her too. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still very fun: and you can see that @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 were lots of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1, through it.   The experience of babysitting twin babies for eight hours required immense patience. Whether it was calming them down when they cried, putting them to sleep, or feeding them, patience was the key to getting through the day. Despite the challenges, the experience was ultimately rewarding and enjoyable.
174	18031	7	3	Patience is indeed a virtue that can lead to great rewards. Whether it's waiting for a computer to start up or standing in line for a roller coaster, the outcome of our patience is often worth the time spent waiting. While some may struggle with being patient, it is a skill that can be developed over time, allowing individuals to become as patient as monks. In essence, embracing patience can lead to a more fulfilling and peaceful life.
175	18032	7	3	One time when I was little we were going to the dentist in Anaheim and there was a lot of traffic. My siblings and I were in the car, and we ended up waiting for two hours. I was really unhappy, so my mom told me to be patient. I didn't know what it meant at the time, but now I understand that it means to wait and be calm. When we finally arrived at the dentist's office and I sat down, I found out that we were late, so we had to go back home and reschedule the appointment for the next day. It was a lesson in patience that I will always remember.
176	18033	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when I went to Cedar Point. We drove from one location to another and it was a long ride. When we got there, it was a long line to get in. My mom said, ""All right guys, time to be patient."" Once we got in, we went to the first ride we saw. It also had a long line. Mom said, ""We are going to have to be patient all day if we want to ride all the rides."" As we waited in line, I reminded myself to stay calm and enjoy the experience. Being patient paid off as we got to enjoy all the thrilling rides and attractions Cedar Point had to offer. In the end, it was worth the wait and taught me the importance of patience in making the most out of any situation."
177	18034	7	3	I had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. This happened at his friend's house on a hot summer day. My mom was concerned and wanted to take him to the doctor. I tried to avoid going with them, but my mom insisted. The wait at the doctor's office felt like an eternity, with time dragging on slowly. The doctor's visit was tedious, with long explanations and medical jargon that made me lose interest. Finally, after what seemed like forever, we were able to leave the doctor's office. Despite the boredom and frustration, being patient had its rewards as we finally got to go home.
178	18035	7	3	One time at the archery store, I was waiting to purchase some arrows, but there was nobody available to ring up my items.

It was a moment where my patience paid off, and I was able to leave the store satisfied.
179	18036	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was waiting in line for lunch.

By staying patient, I was able to eventually get my lunch and move on with my day without feeling frustrated or agitated. This experience taught me the value of patience in everyday situations.

Finally I realized I needed to relax and be patient before. I know if the time was five and my dad and I went back at the store in no time and there was the perfect gift right there in front of me.

So it took us about an hour to get up there so I had to be very patient or else my dad would've gone crazy, so that's my story about patience. As we slowly made our way through the line, I had to remind myself to stay calm and composed. The anticipation of finally getting inside the stadium kept me going, despite the long wait. When we finally reached the front of the line and entered the stadium, the feeling of relief and excitement washed over me.

184	18041	7	3	"There was only 5 minutes of class left and I had work to do. So I watched the clock tick down ever so slowly. 5 minutes left, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute. At that point, the teacher asked, ""What are you doing?"" I replied, ""Work. I have work to do."" ""Why don't you put your head down?"" the teacher suggested. I felt my patience wearing thin, but I managed to keep my cool. I followed the teacher's advice and put my head down. Before I knew it, it was time to go. I had successfully maintained my patience and avoided getting into trouble."
185	18042	7	3	"Did you know that patients are one of the key to happiness? For example, I was walking and this guy walked up to me and started talking about his family. I wasn't very patient at the time, and he kept going on and on until I snapped and told him to shut up. He ran home, crying. When I got home, I felt sorry for him and apologized. Surprisingly, he said, ""Got you."" I was mad but also happy when it was over. This experience taught me a valuable lesson: always be patient because you never know who is watching."
186	18043	7	3	I am always patient with my family. My mom and dad do a lot for me, and I am always patient when they take me somewhere. Sometimes, they take me to hockey games. My dad usually takes me, but on weekends my mom takes me and I am patient. When it comes to homework, I am always patient. If I go to my friend's house or to Golfland with my mom, she said she will take me, and I am always patient in those situations as well. Patience is key when it comes to being with family and I strive to always demonstrate that virtue.

So that @CAPS3 at school @CAPS1 remembered her moms words and was very patient all @CAPS3. She didnít whine with her friends about the bus being so slow to get to school, she didnít cut her friends in the lunch line to get her food faster. At gym, she didnít grab the volleyball when someone had it the their shoe so she wouldnít be boared instead she stood there. During the end of the @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 friends started acting like her too. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hand instead of blabbing out the answer. At the end of that class period they all got some candy. The other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in @LOCATION1 next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason. Every one learned to raise their hands and not push when they  left the classroom. Prity soon every one started getting candy and the teachers were so happy! When I got home that @CAPS3 I huged my @CAPS4 so hard then I told her what happened at school. I then learned to be patient from then on. From that day forward, patience became a virtue that @CAPS1 and her friends practiced, leading to a more harmonious and rewarding school experience for everyone involved.
189	18046	7	3	The day I stood in line for some free bags of Lays chips was quite eventful. When I was at the store, they were giving out free bags of chips. I was number one in line, and it was my third time trying to get to the front. My friend was number two in line. They were having a giveaway day, and we ended up with just one bag of chips each. Despite waiting for four hours and five minutes, we only got one chip each and left. We were very tired as we stood in line, waiting patiently. It was the worst experience of waiting that I have ever had. We were heading to our destination when we finally got our chips, feeling exhausted from the long wait.
190	18047	7	3	@CAPS1 was a beautiful morning, sky was blue, birds were singing, and my sister was going skydiving. Her and her boyfriend zone, were playing to go skydiving so me, my friend, and my parents tagged along to watch. We had a couple people in front of them so we had to wait for an hour or so. Then another hour passes. Still not even close to being their turn. We were starting to get hungry so we went into town and ordered some breakfast, we got our drinks and were about to get our food when we got a call that they were going soon. We had to cancel our meal and hurry back to the place. We got there, still not their turn. I don't really know how but something happened to widen we had to sit and wait in the middle of the field for almost four more hours! Finally their turn, they got in the plane and flew up. They circled the field for a while and then @CAPS1 looked like a little dot fell out of the plane, then another followed. They sailed down to a success. @CAPS1 turns out that we sat there for eight hours before they jumped. Not including the hour and a half drive there. I think that I was pretty patient that day.
191	18048	7	3	"ìLeft! Right! High kick left, roundhouse sight! The boy's arms are moving so fast you can barely see them. His legs striking the bag with tremendous power! ""Go!"" the old man yells, proud of his student's progress. ""You are lacking patience,"" @CAPS2 comments, noting a crucial flaw in the boy's technique. To remedy this, the old man, known as @ORGANIZATION1, decides to challenge the boy, @CAPS3, by blindfolding him and having sandbags hurled at him. The first bag hits his head, disorienting him momentarily. However, with newfound focus and determination, the boy anticipates the next bag and executes a powerful kick, shattering it. As the training session continues, @CAPS2 steps in, utilizing a sandbag to teach the importance of patience and strategic thinking in combat. Through this intense exercise, the boy learns to wait for his opponent's move, gaining a valuable lesson in self-control and discipline. The boy's skills are honed, his mind sharpened, and his spirit fortified, all under the guidance of his wise mentor. This challenging training not only improves the boy's physical abilities but also cultivates his mental fortitude, preparing him for any battle that may come his way. With each strike and each block, the boy grows stronger, embodying the true essence of a martial artist. As the session concludes, a sense of accomplishment fills the air, signaling a significant step forward in the boy's martial arts journey. The old man nods approvingly, a silent acknowledgment of the progress made and the potential that lies ahead for his dedicated student. In the world of martial arts, patience is indeed a virtue, one that can make all the difference between victory and defeat."
192	18049	7	3	One time I was patient when @PERSON1 @CAPS1 would not work every body sat down and was quiet. It took up the whole hour, with a couple of brief conversations here and there, but mostly everyone remained silent as a couple of students helped @PERSON1. We were supposed to watch a movie about @NUM1 themes of @CAPS2, but when she tried to play it, the video wouldn't show - you could hear it but not see it. Then, towards the end of the hour, the visuals appeared, but the sound was absent. @PERSON1 mentioned that it had worked fine for all the other classes.   The next day, @PERSON1 rewarded us with fruit snacks for our patience, and miraculously, she managed to get the movie to work. Initially in black and white, a slight adjustment made it appear in color. This event marked the second time I had shown patience with a teacher, and it made both her and me proud. On another occasion, she allowed us to relax in our chairs and chat with friends while she fixed @CAPS1. However, the following day, there were no treats as our reward was simply enjoying the downtime with our peers. That experience was another instance where my classmates and I demonstrated patience with our teacher.
193	18050	7	3	When I was patient, we had to wait in a line for a roller coaster. I was scared because some kids in line were impatient and wanted to get on the ride quickly. However, I remained patient and waited until it was our turn to board. Once on the roller coaster, I was very scared but also excited. As the ride ended, I stepped off with a smile on my face. I was glad that I had been patient and waited for my turn, as the thrill of the ride was worth it in the end.
194	18051	7	3	"You being patient is important. People should always be patient & not rush anything. All you have to do is take your time & wait. People need to understand that it you are not patient then particular things want happen to you. If you ever wanted something, then you have to be patient. One day at @ORGANIZATION1, my cousin, Shayna was not being patient because she wanted on get on the dance box. But, she couldn't because a little girl named @ORGANIZATION2 was on the dance box & Shayna was not happy. Shayna got mad & started to cry & roll her eyes at @ORGANIZATION2. I said, ""Shayna, you have to be patient & wait your turn because she was on it first & that would be rude and unfair to make her get off."" Shayna apologized & they both took turns on the dance box. In the end, Shayna was happy & she learned her lesson."
195	18052	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my mom broke her hip. When my mom broke her hip, she moved slower than my grandpa. I had to follow her everywhere she went. If I wasnít patient, I think my mother would be in worse condition than what she was in. It took her almost fifteen minutes to walk to her bedroom. Normally Iím not a patient person at all, but when this happened I had to be patient. Iím glad that I was patient because now I am more patient than I was before. My mom is proud of my behavior because I actually grew up for a few days to help her out when she needed me. Being patient is a good thing; you look at life differently. Now I can imagine me being patient. I mean Iím not glad my mom got hurt, but Iím glad of my consequence of the problem. After the big accident happened, I have learned that everyone needs a little bit of patience like me. That is one example of how I thought of being patient, without my mom.
196	18053	7	3	I know a girl, sheís my friend, and her name is @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very good person. She eats all her veggies, does all her homework, and has straight Aís. @PERSON1 only has one problem. She is not patient. One day @PERSON1 and I went to the movie theater. We went on a Saturday night so it was quite busy. There was a long line to get the tickets. @PERSON1 looked at me and groaned. I told her, ì@CAPS1 patient @PERSON1, it will only take like ten minutes.î @PERSON1 groaned again and crossed her arms. ì@CAPS2 over it you potato sack,î I told her. After about two minutes we were only five people behind the ticket counter. @PERSON1 was pacing around like she was in the worst case scenario. She started pulling her hair as I stared blankly at her. She ran to me and said, ì@PERSON2, we gotta get to that counter before I explode!î I looked at her with my, why donít you just shut-up, eyes. Then she nodded. I stayed patient with @PERSON1 throughout the night making sure she didnít go crazy. I made sure that I kept my cool so I could make sure we didnít get kicked out. You should always be patient or things may turn out bad. Remember, staying calm and composed in challenging situations can make a big difference in how things unfold.
197	18054	7	3	Today, I am talking about patents. Patents refer to the act of handling something calmly and with composure. For instance, I recently encountered a situation at an ATM where I needed cash, but the machine only gave me a receipt. Instead of getting frustrated, I contacted the company and was able to resolve the issue promptly.  Similarly, during a shopping trip to the mall, I found a pair of shoes on sale for a hundred dollars, but the cashier insisted on charging me a higher price. Despite the cashier's attitude, I remained patient and tried to explain the situation calmly. Unfortunately, the cashier was uncooperative, so I decided to leave the store without making a purchase.  In both instances, staying patient and composed helped me handle the situations effectively. Patience is indeed a valuable trait that can help in resolving conflicts and finding solutions in various circumstances.
198	18055	7	3	A time I was patient when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 of @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 grandma @CAPS1, grandpa @PERSON1, and @CAPS4 brother @ORGANIZATION2. We were all just walking around and we saw a guy drawing cartoon pictures of people. I said ìgrandma @CAPS1 canít we do that please.î @CAPS3 said ìyes.î @CAPS4 brother got to go first. I was just waiting for his to be done. Then his picture was done we looked at it and we all laughed. I was next. I sat on the seat, the sun was right on me. I got very hot and I did not just want to sit there but I was patient. I didnít say a word, just sat there and smiled. The picture took about @NUM1 to draw felt like a half hour. Then I was done. I looked at the picture, laughed, and smiled. I liked it. I was patient and I got what I wanted. A time I was patient at @ORGANIZATION1.
199	18056	7	3	"I patience is a privilege I generally don't have, @CAPS1, I made an exception, though. @CAPS3 brother, @PERSON1 ran out to the car running from the pouring rain that described the mood @CAPS6 that day. @CAPS14 opened the car door, and the first thing out of his mouth was,"" @CAPS2 need to talk."" @CAPS3 @CAPS5 responded."" @CAPS4 about at @NUM1?"" I knew @CAPS5 didn't want to talk about what happened to @PERSON1, @CAPS4 @CAPS14 got an in-school suspension, around me. If @CAPS3 brother hadn't of cared about me hearing, I don't think I would've put up a fight. This was not the time. @PERSON1 divulged into his story causing tension in the air. ""@CAPS6, some guys who I realized aren't really very friend poured water purposely on @CAPS3 sweatshirt, @CAPS12 I went to tell the principle, @CAPS3 @LOCATION1""  ""@CAPS8. That's what you're supposed to do,"" @CAPS3 @CAPS15 interrupted. "" @CAPS9. @CAPS12 the person, who did it, @PERSON2, got in trouble and went into timeout. When @CAPS14 came out, @CAPS14 started to follow me, and I felt threatened.""  I held @CAPS3 breath, looking straight ahead of me. Tension was what I was breathing, not @CAPS10. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS5 filled in the next part, ""@CAPS12 you. Started punching him?"" ""@CAPS13, yes."" @CAPS14 admitted miserably. ""@PERSON1, you need to find constructive ways to release your anger. There are going to be a lot of jerks out there. You can't start punching them,""@CAPS15 scolded. ""I know, I know now. I 'm sorry,"" @CAPS3 brother shuttered in his very annoying fashion. I timidly asked @PERSON1, ""would you like a hot dog when @CAPS2 get home?"" ""@CAPS16""I bit back any rude response to the mean tone @CAPS14 was using. I understood that @CAPS14 had a bad day. @CAPS1, I realized that being patient and understanding with @CAPS3 brother was the best thing I could do. I think I gained a little more patience that day.  I learned that sometimes, showing patience and understanding towards others, even when it's hard, can lead to better outcomes and stronger relationships."
200	18057	7	3	The place I was patient was at my mom's doctor appointment. It was a little healthcare place on a street corner, small and uneventful. I waited in the lobby, initially bored but then found some entertainment by watching Channel 1 news. I eventually got a blue pen and paper from the front counter and started drawing. My drawing ended up looking like a sleek car in the distance. As time passed, I found a car magazine and marveled at the different types of cars featured within - low riders, exotics, customs, and more. Finally, when my mom was finished, we left for home, having practiced patience throughout the appointment.
201	18058	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was standing in a line at the petting zoo. The animal I was waiting in line to see, was a donkey. It was a hot @DATE1 day around three in the afternoon of course a donkey was the crowds favorite animal. There only a couple people observing the other animals. In the donkey line, there were hundreds. I was around the middle of the line. I was getting tired but I had see to this donkey! I was being very patient waiting and waiting and waiting. Finally only a couple people were in front of me! I could get a slight view of the donkey. A couple minutes passed old I was petting the donkey: @CAPS1 was that patience worth it or what? I thought to myself. I left the petting zoo, happy. I had never been that patient in my life! I gave myself a bat on the back. It was a rewarding experience to practice patience and be able to enjoy the moment with the donkey.
202	18060	7	3	One time, I was in the doctor's office with my dad, and it was crowded with a lot of people. My dad suggested we leave because of the long wait, but I insisted on being patient. We waited for hours until our name was finally called. I received my five vaccine shots, and then we headed home. For dinner, we enjoyed a delicious taco salad together. It was a tiring day, but being patient paid off in the end.
203	18061	7	3	Iím really not a patient person but one day last year, at the end of the school year, my older sister was having a baby. And I wanted to go because that was my first nephew. So I went along with my grandma, mom, my other sister, and my sister's boyfriend. There were lots of people there and not all of us could go in at the same time. I was too young to witness the birth, but I didn't mind waiting. My sister got frustrated and left, but I decided to stay. It was a long wait, taking 10 hours for the baby to be born. We arrived at nine in the morning, and the baby was finally born around seven in the evening. I went home to rest at midnight and returned at two o'clock in the morning. We finally got to see the baby at five, and his name was Lucas. He was so cute, and I felt blessed to be his aunt. Now, at six months old, I cherish every moment I spend with him. When he grows up, he will know that I was there, eagerly waiting for him to enter the world. Love, [Your Name].
204	18062	7	3	"A time where someone I know was impatient was in my science class during a lab project. It was actually to me, a very funny way of impatience. My classmates and I were divided into groups at different areas of the lab. We were doing a project on plant classification, identifying the different characteristics. So everyone was trying to quickly finish up their projects by taping their plants on their poster. After fighting for the tape from another group hogging it, our group finally had the tape. So our group was just done, and two people from another group came to get tape. One of them tried to take some pieces, and I guess to the other one, he was taking too long. So the one waiting says, ""Come on, hurry up!"" as a sign of impatience. It was hilarious!"
205	18064	7	3	When I was patient, I was @NUM1 yrs old when I got a as. I ordered it online and waited. @NUM2 days went by and still nothing, a week went by and a ups truck stopped at our house dropped off the package and left. I was so happy that I didnít even noticed that it was for ma mom. I opened it to find pampered chef stuff in it. I was really angry! @NUM3 weeks went by andÖ nothing I was upset that I didnít really didnít know it I was gonna get about it. But a ups truck came and didnít see it and guess what in the package was my as! I didnít even realize it till @DATE1 I was so happy that I got it. That I forgot to order a game with it. And that was the time I was patient see ya. Finally, after weeks of waiting, my patience paid off when the UPS truck delivered my eagerly awaited package. It was a lesson in patience and perseverance that I will always remember.
206	18065	7	3	Being patient means waiting, when one of my brothers was patience. We were there for six hours just to bail out my brother, we had to go to four different prisons to take my brother out. I was scared but I knew ther if I was patient everything would come out good. So we were waiting we had to bail him at before 1 oíclock. We were there since 2 in the morning. My mom was very nervous. I told her many times to calm down everything was going to be alright. So he and my cousin went in we asked if we could bail my brother out. They told us they weren't bailing out at that time that maybe around 3. So we went to get something to eat. We went again and they told us we had to sign a paper. So we did. Then it was 4 o'clock. They gave us something we had to cook. We went to 1 different stores and they said we couldn't cash it. So we went to the chase bank and we cashed it and we took out my brother.
207	18066	7	3	One day it was a cool new game that came out. It was a kid that had volume @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, and @DATE1, but they said this is the hot volume. The kid asked his mom for @PERCENT1 @CAPS2 said ìwhat for?î @CAPS1 said ìso I can buy this cool new game.î @CAPS2 said ì@CAPS3 your father and I have to pay bills and buy food. @CAPS1 said ì@CAPS4 I understand,î in a dissaponting voice. @CAPS8, when the boys hard working father walked through the door. The boy said ì@CAPS5, could I please get @NUM4 ???, so I can buy this game. The father said ì@CAPS6, I know how much you want this game, but Iím sorry I need to help your mother pay bills. The @CAPS6 said ì@CAPS4 I understand.î @CAPS8 the boyís grandmother called and said I need someone to cut my law for @NUM5î. The boy grinned and said ì Iíll be right over there.î @CAPS1 mowed the lawn with excitement. When @CAPS1 got the @NUM5??? @CAPS1 went right to the game store and when @CAPS1 arrived the line was @DATE1 blocks long. His grandmother said ìwell you gatto have patience. ì@CAPS10 as the boy was next in the line. To be continued...  The boy waited patiently in line at the game store, filled with excitement and anticipation. Finally, his turn came, and he was able to purchase the cool new game he had been dreaming of. As he walked out of the store with the game in hand, he felt a sense of accomplishment and pride in earning the money himself. This experience taught him the value of hard work and patience, making the game even more special to him.
208	18067	7	3	One day we went to the mall, me, Sharae, and Reynal. Me and Reynal wanted to go to the shoe store, but Sharae wanted to go to Pac Sun. We patiently waited for her to shop at Pac Sun. Then, when it was our turn to choose a store, Sharae wanted to go to a different store again. We were patient and let her shop there too. Finally, when we wanted to go to the electronics store, Sharae wanted to go to a different store once more. That's when we had enough and told her it was time to stick with our original plan. She agreed, but not before trying to ask for one more detour. In the end, we all headed towards the electronics store, with Sharae finally agreeing to stay on track after her last-minute bathroom request.
209	18068	7	3	"Patience is indeed a valuable trait that can help us navigate through various situations in life. Whether it's waiting calmly for an appointment or dealing with a challenging task, having patience can make a significant difference. In a recent visit to the doctor's office for a vaccine, I found myself practicing patience both as a patient and by being patient. Despite feeling nervous and bored while waiting, my ability to stay calm and composed ultimately helped me through the process. I learned that being a ""patient patient"" can not only ease our own discomfort but also contribute to a smoother experience overall. This experience served as a reminder of the importance of patience in our daily lives, highlighting how this virtue can lead to positive outcomes in various situations."
210	18070	7	3	This story is about chicken hound the fox and a time he had to be patient. Let me set the scene, clung the scourge sends chicken hound and his mother, @PERSON1, to be boiled. They were both supposed to be killed and thrown in the ditch. But chicken hound had only blanched out. When he awoke he realized his situation and knew that he would have to wait until dark to get to @CAPS1 wall and waited although insects had snowed on him. Finally when the cover of night came he rolled in the mud to prevent any further blood loss and began his journey. That is when chicken hound had to be patient. As he crept through the darkness, the sound of every rustle and snap of twigs made his heart race. But he forced himself to stay calm and move with caution, knowing that any sudden movements could give him away. With each step, he could feel the weight of his mother's life depending on his patience. And as he reached the safety of @CAPS1 wall, he knew that his patience had paid off. Chicken hound had proven that sometimes, the key to survival is not in rushing, but in waiting for the right moment to make your move.
211	18071	7	3	I have used patience many times. I use my patience when waiting for the bus, at home, and at school. The first time I used patience was when I was fishing. I had my fishing pole in one hand and a bag of salt and vinegar chips in the other. While waiting for a fish, I met a baby goose named Bubbles. I fed him some bait, and he enjoyed it. I ended up giving him all my bait, and as soon as I grabbed my chips, I got a bite. It was a small sunfish. Bubbles and I have been friends ever since, and I see him once a year by my favorite fishing spot. This year, he brought along two duck friends named Quack and Sarah. They enjoy skittles and cheese, and we all enjoy relaxing in the grass together. Patience has allowed me to form a unique friendship with these animals, and I look forward to our yearly meetings.
212	18072	7	3	My family and I were going to @LOCATION1 for @DATE1 break one year I was really excited to get there, but we had to take two long flights until we finally arrived. My family and I got up super early to drive to the airport. It was about @NUM1 hours until we got there. Then we checked our bags, went through security, and went to find our plane. Unfortunately, we found out that our plane had gotten delayed. We waited for a few hours until the plane arrived. Once we boarded and landed at our connecting airport, we discovered that our next flight was also delayed. Another few hours passed before we could finally board that plane. The journey was certainly testing our patience, but we kept our spirits up knowing that our destination awaited. Despite the delays and long flights, we finally made it to @LOCATION1 and were ready to enjoy our well-deserved break.
213	18073	7	3	@PERSON2's patience was truly put to the test on the way to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Despite waiting his whole life to go there, he graciously allowed his cousins and friends to join the trip, even though it meant multiple stops and delays. His patience was stretched thin when his dad called, but he remained calm and understanding throughout the journey. In the end, @PERSON2's patience paid off as he finally arrived at his destination, proving that good things come to those who wait.
214	18074	7	3	"Hi my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I am currently in school conducting meat testing. While working on this task, I recall a time when I had to exercise great patience. It was when I was eagerly anticipating the release of the movie ""Eclipse"" from the Twilight Saga. My friends and I had secured tickets a month in advance, and the days seemed to pass by incredibly slowly as I anxiously waited for the screening.  To distract myself from the anticipation, I decided to spend time at a friend's house who was also looking forward to watching the movie. As the days went by, the excitement only grew, and the night before the screening, my friend called me unable to sleep due to her excitement. I, too, stayed awake all night, unable to stop thinking about what might unfold in the movie, driving myself to the point of restlessness.  Eventually, exhaustion took over, and I fell asleep. When I woke up, the day had finally arrived, and I was filled with anticipation as we headed to the theater. The moment had come, and as I settled into my seat to watch ""Eclipse,"" the experience was worth the wait despite the challenges of being patient.  That memory serves as a reminder of the value of patience, as sometimes the anticipation and build-up to an event can be just as rewarding as the event itself."
215	18075	7	3	"@PERSON2 and her twin brother, @PERSON1 waited excitedly in line for a concert. @PERSON1 hated going places with his sister, she was a bit weird. ""Hey,"" @PERSON1 whined, ""can you please take an earbud out of your car?"" ""Why did I have to come?"" @PERSON1 asked impatiently. ""Maybe you could learn how to be patient, smart one,"" @PERSON2 said, glancing to see how many people were in line now. She put her earbud back in her car and blasted 'Dance Forever' by Allstar Weekend. Allstar Weekend was the awesome band they were going to see in concert. @PERSON2 had always been the patient twin, in fact, that's what everyone called her. @PERSON1 was the complete opposite, the impatient twin. @PERSON2 almost enjoyed waiting; it made her more excited for things. When the time finally came to see the concert, @PERSON2 was glad she was patient; she was ten times more excited than anyone else there."
216	18076	7	3	There was a time when I was patience and I was waiting for a long time me my cousin, @PERSON1 was walking around town and we was looking for silly bans ok first we went to the @DATE1 store but when we got there they was closed so we started walking again and then we saw my brother and my other cousin @CAPS1 they was on bikes and we walk so then @CAPS1 said itís a @PERSON2 store down there so walk down there. Then @CAPS1 and my brother told us to get on the bike and they walk. So we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and see how much they casy and they coats @MONEY1 and some of them coat @MONEY2 so we went to @PERSON2 tree and they was a @MONEY3 but we didnít get them because @PERSON1 didnít like the ones they had so we went all over the when we found them she didnít want them. So we went to my grandma house and she asked me where we was all day and I said we was out looking for some dom silly bans. And my grandma said donít go where @PERSON1 want to go. If your mama tell you to come over here come over here and I was trying to be patience by not trying to yell at @LOCATION1.   As we continued our search for the perfect silly bans, facing closed stores and changing preferences, we learned valuable lessons about patience and listening to advice. Despite the challenges, the journey was filled with moments of laughter and togetherness with family. In the end, it's not just about finding the right item, but about the shared experiences and memories created along the way.
217	18077	7	3	Time my friend was patient! one day it was @DATE1@NUM1.and that day was when report cards came out. My grades were good I had @NUM2. But my friend @PERSON1, was failing. maths, she had an @CAPS1, and she knew if her mom see,s it she would get in trouble. @PERSON1 tryed to cross it out and put an good grade but she knew her mom will find out. so she told her mom ìreport cards didnít come out yetî. And her mom believed her. So then she tried re printing it. She called me and tried to get my opinion and ìI told her my honest thought and I said @CAPS2î. but ìif you dant wanna get in trouble then yeahî And she said. When her mom asked her ìdid the report cards come outî. She said ìyeahî then her mom found out its not a real report card. So her mom called the teachers and  it was a fake grade. Then she got introuble and she was patient about it and she said the truth. Her mom went to the  office and got the real grades and my friend @PERSON1 was patient while she said the truth. Thatís a time were my friend @PERSON1 was patient about her grades. Even though she lied and tried to change her grade.She still was honest, and patient about it. I know that it was wrong for me two tell her yeah, but she begged me so she wont get in trouble. My friend learned a valuable lesson about honesty and the importance of facing the consequences of her actions. It was a challenging experience, but it ultimately led to personal growth and a stronger sense of integrity for her.
218	18078	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I have and I have to say it was rewarding. I was sitting in the waiting room at the @ORGANIZATION1ís @CAPS1 @CAPS2.  I planned to got my @CAPS1 washed, deep-conditioned, and flat-ironed. The lady at the front desk called me up. ìIím sorry but @PERSON1 wonít be here today.  @CAPS3 there anyone else that youíd like to do your @CAPS1?í A perplexed expression spread across my face. ì@CAPS3 @CAPS4 here?î I asked. ìyes, but she has a client right now. She can take you tomorrow at three oíclock. ìshe suggested. ìthatís fine.î  I said.  My feelings  were  kind of  upset, but that  all  changed  when I  walked outside.  It was raining. So I guess it was a good thing that I didnít get my @CAPS1 done. It was a good thing that I was patient. Being patient has itís advantages. The rain would have ruined my hair, and I would have been disappointed with the results. It's a good reminder that sometimes things happen for a reason and being patient can lead to better outcomes in the end.
219	18079	7	3	"A time when I was patient was at the largest indoor water park. I was waiting to go on the turbo twin racers. ""Estimated time one hour,"" our GPS said in a robotic voice. It meant I had to be in the car for another two hours, almost three. ""That's not fair,"" I thought to myself, but I knew if I wanted to make it to the water park, I had to be patient and wait it out.  ""I have to go to the bathroom,"" I said in a moaning voice. ""Well, can't you hold it?"" my mother asked. I was about to explode, and she was asking me if I could hold it. ""Okay, pull over here, but it's gonna add to our travel time,"" she said. ""I don't care!"" I yelled back as I ran out of the car.  When I got back in the car, I heard our robotic GPS say, ""Estimated time three hours."" ""Oh man, that means no more bathroom breaks. I'm gonna have to hold it if I have to go again.""  A few hours passed, and I heard the GPS say, ""Arrive at destination on the left."" ""Yes!"" I screeched out, rushing to the main entrance of the water park. But to my disappointment, the sign read, ""Water park closed."" My dad comforted me, saying, ""Sorry, sport, maybe it will be open tomorrow.""  The next day, the park remained closed for maintenance. I had to be patient for the whole day, but I couldn't; we were leaving the next day. The following day, the park was still closed until 5 PM, but we were expected to check out at noon. ""I guess we can stay for the rest of the day and spend another night,"" my dad suggested. ""Yes!"" I exclaimed. Finally, I got to go into the park, and that was the time I learned the value of patience."
220	18080	7	3	I think patience means when you're calm and you don't care what somebody else is doing. A good sign of patience is when your mom is shopping for a long time and you want to go to the video game store, but you stay there without complaining. On the other hand, a bad sign of patience is when you throw a fit in the store. Another good sign of patience is when you're at an amusement park and there's a long line, but you don't complain and wait patiently. However, a bad sign of patience in that situation is when you complain the whole time. Patience is also shown when you wait for your big sister to get out of the bathroom without rushing her. Conversely, a bad sign of patience is when you break down the door out of impatience. Overall, patience is about staying calm and composed in different situations, even when things don't go your way.
221	18081	7	3	I was patient when I saw a huge bass jump out from at my cottage. I waited and ate breakfast and then went fishing. My little brother wanted to go fishing too. So I was patient enough to wait for him to get a new bait tie it and come out. So we get out front and he catches a small bass so I unhooked it and brought him over to show mum and dad what he had caught but little did I realize that a huge 10-pound bass was roaming around out there. So as soon as I got out there first cast, a huge bass took my bait. At first I thought I caught a carp, but when I saw that 10-pound bass jump with my bait in its mouth, I was shaking with excitement! When I showed that fish to my dad, he about fainted, and the same with me, my mom, and my little brother Cody. And right now, that fish is at the taxidermy.
222	18082	7	3	One day on my way to school, I went to pick up my friend who excitedly told me about his new game, Call of Duty: World at War. Throughout the day, he couldn't stop talking about the game and his online adventures. In our last class, he eagerly mentioned how he couldn't wait to go home and play. Despite his impatience, I reminded him to be patient and enjoy the anticipation. After school, we headed to his house to play the game together. As we engaged in the virtual battlefield, I reiterated the importance of patience, emphasizing that good things come to those who wait. It was a fun and memorable day spent enjoying a new game and valuable lesson learned about the virtue of patience.
223	18083	7	3	The one time I was patient was when I was waiting for the new game Killzone. I had to come up with $60 for the game and $10 to put it on hold for me. I got it the minute the store had it on the shelves. The manager was stocking them out, so I grabbed one and bought it. I went home, plugged in my PS5, and started playing online. I now have $1,190. The game is really hard, especially on day one, and there were store managers there monitoring. I do not suggest the game for those under 16 years old.
224	18084	7	3	"One day my family and me were going to @PERSON1 to see Jimmy because he was out on a job in @LOCATION2 fixing a belt line. After my brother and I got home from school, we left to go to @LOCATION2. As we were traveling, we saw a lot of things like the city of @LOCATION4 and all the buildings there. Then we saw a sign that said, ""You are now leaving @LOCATION3,"" and another sign that said, ""You are now entering @LOCATION1,"" and that's when it happened - the traffic jam. We were going through @LOCATION5 at @NUM1.m, not very smart, but the worst part was the waiting. It lasted for hours just sitting there, but we found ways to amuse ourselves. We watched the sea @PERSON2's waves and looked at the buildings there. That's my example of patience."
225	18086	7	3	Time when I was patient was at the doctor appointment I was standing there, calm quiet. When the doctor called, me I wasnít nervous. So when the doctor gave me @NUM1 which, @CAPS1 didnít have at. Then, me and my mom went home happy. Got some hwigese  and watch @CAPS2. Then , we had some spaghetti and went to had early for school. Then, I had a good day in school in the @NUM2 grade when I was in land.  Then, I went home, do my homework, clean up the house, watch. @CAPS2, eat dinner, then went to led has a early start. After a long and patient day, I felt satisfied with how everything turned out, and I was ready to rest and prepare for another day ahead.
226	18087	7	3	"A time when I had to be patient was on my birthday, about a week before my birthday, me and my dad ordered me an American Girl doll. I was super excited because it was my first doll. The shipping was a problem, though. The week of my birthday, I kept waiting for the UPS truck to come. I was disappointed because they shipped it from California and it doesn't take that long to get here. Another week passed and still not here. I had to be extra patient. I could track it online, but I still wasn't happy. The reason why it took so long to get here was because when it was already here, they kept it in the post office. Then finally my mom went ahead to ask when they're going to send it and the lady said, ""it's on the way."" A couple of minutes later, the doorbell rang. I screamed when I opened her up. It was worth the wait."
227	18088	7	3	Patience is not one of my strong suits. I prefer things to move quickly and efficiently, and I get frustrated when things don't go as fast as I'd like. Whether it's waiting in line at the grocery store or working on a project with others, I find it challenging to remain patient. Slow progress can be particularly frustrating for me, as I prefer to see results sooner rather than later. While I understand the importance of taking the time to do things right, I struggle with the waiting game. In a world where everything seems to move at lightning speed, patience is a virtue that I often find myself lacking.
228	18089	7	3	"Patience is not a natural thing, it's something you have to learn. Taking a three-hour car ride is a perfect example of patience. Exactly like what I experienced. As we packed our suitcases for a city trip, I couldn't contain myself. I was already packed up, but my parents were still getting things together. ""Can you please finish packing so we can go!"" I exclaimed. ""You'll just have to wait a minute,"" they replied. But I couldn't wait, so I grabbed my things, threw them in the trunk of our car, and went to the kitchen to read a book while they finished packing. After they were done, my dad thanked me for being patient and mentioned a surprise for me. He walked over to a white plastic bag and pulled out a rectangular box - it was the new video game I had been wanting. I was so grateful and thanked them for the thoughtful gift. This just shows that patience really does pay off, as long as you don't complain."
229	18090	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was a young child. My mom had scheduled a dentist appointment for me, and even though I was initially resistant and scared, I eventually found the courage to go through with it. Despite my fear of the unknown and the thought of potential pain, I managed to stay calm and composed during the entire process. In the end, I was rewarded with some stickers, which made the experience all the more worthwhile. It was a day where I learned the value of patience and facing my fears head-on, ultimately coming out stronger on the other side.
230	18091	7	3	One day I had to be patient. It all started when I raked some leaves and was expecting to get paid for my work. I was supposed to receive the payment that very day, and I wanted it immediately. However, I had to practice patience.
231	18092	7	3	One time at my uncle's house, I really wanted to play with a toy that all the other kids were playing with. When I asked my uncle if I could join in, he told me I needed to be patient. So, I waited quietly for what felt like hours, without complaining or asking again. Finally, after a long time, my uncle let me join the game. It taught me the importance of being patient and waiting for my turn.
232	18093	7	3	I was at the hospital when I was about to have an allergy test. I sat and waited for two hours. I had played my favorite game, Minecraft, for an hour, then watched TV. I got bored, so I started pacing around, but my parents had to stop me from leaving multiple times. Eventually, it was time for me to go down to the allergy room. It was a struggle because I wanted to walk, but they insisted on me being transported. After the allergy test, I had to lay flat for two hours before I was allowed to go home.
233	18094	7	3	Years ago, our immigration limit had run out, and we needed green cards to become legal residents. We headed to an immigration center in Detroit, where we were greeted by a busy front desk. The lady instructed us to wait in the crowded waiting area, which was filled with about a dozen people. I knew we were in for a long wait from that moment on.   As we settled in, I realized there were strict rules in place - no gaming or musical devices allowed, and all phones had to be turned off. It was challenging to pass the time without any form of entertainment. After what felt like an eternity, our names were finally called.   We went through the necessary procedures, including fingerprinting, and finally left the office. My mom commended me for my behavior during our time at the immigration center. It was a relief to have everything sorted out, and we drove home feeling grateful for the progress we had made that day.
234	18095	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient. I use to be able to wait for anything.one time I was so patient I asked my mom for a game and she said, tomorrow and she got the game the day I asked her. At one time I thought I was the most patient person In my whole family. I am so patient I can wait a month just before I go to cedar point. You have to be burn with patient. Some of my friends are patient but they canít wait as long as I can. Some of them even ask me to teach them how to be patient. I say the same thing to them what I say to everybody who asked me about being patient. You have to be born with patient. Its not something you learn over the years. I could want three week without getting paid from my dad. As some people get older there grow lesser. That doesnít work on everybody. But sometime soon I know my patient will be like everyone else when I get older. Who knows maybe somebody might be more patient than me I the world.  I can only hope that my patience remains a part of me as I grow older, as it has been a valuable trait that has served me well in various situations. While some may struggle to wait for things, I have always found comfort in the ability to be patient and trust that things will come in their own time. Perhaps in the future, I will encounter someone even more patient than myself, but for now, I am content with the patience that I possess.
235	18096	7	3	I have used patience a lot of times but I think the most patience Iíve had was hunting. You just have to sit there not talk and stay still. I was hunting out behind my house with my uncle @PERSON1 and we got out there at six-o-clock am and the waited there until nine oíclock at night. The dear finally started to come in and one dear got close enough for me to shoot. I drew my bow and shot at it but it was so dark I could hardly see and I missed it. My uncle didnít even see it until the last second and when I pulled the trigger of the release I knew straight away that it was going to miss. All you could hear was the dear running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves. So later that nigh we went home really hungry.  Despite our hunger, we had to accept that sometimes in hunting, patience doesn't always guarantee success. It was a valuable lesson learned through hours of waiting and anticipation in the wilderness. The experience taught me to appreciate the process and the journey, not just the end result. In the end, even though we returned home empty-handed, the memories and the bond shared with my uncle during that long day of hunting will always be cherished.
236	18097	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I ordered a @CAPS1 in the mail. It was a cool @DATE1 @TIME1, and I was ordering a @CAPS1 online. When I got to the shipping, I paid it, and went to the check-out screen. I saw the time of how long it would take to get to my house. It said @NUM1 weeks.î@CAPS3?!îI exclaimed.îThatís a long time.î@CAPS4 it was decided. I had to make through @NUM1 weeks. I was ready. @CAPS4 I waited. And waited. And waited some more. Until one @DATE2 I saw a @CAPS1. The address said ì@CAPS6 @CAPS7î! I was @CAPS4 happy! This incident taught me to always be patient, because chances are, youíll get @CAPS3 yar wanting in the end. It is important to trust the process and have faith that things will work out in due time.
237	18098	7	3	That warm tear running down my cheek, the hot wind blowing my blond hair out of my face. The only thing I could think about was why god had to take her so soon. Lets go back a week ago. We had just got the news my grandmother was going up to heven with the angels very soon. As soon as the next day we were on a plane heading to Florida. This was my dads mother; he was calm at the time but we all had to be patient with him because he was the closest with her out of the four children. When we finaly took off we were in turbulence the whole three hour flight. Which ment we couldnít get up, no food, no drinks and also the queezy feeling in your stomach. It was the worst Flying experience Iíve ever had. I flew all the time, just this time it was horrible! We had to take two stops till we got to the airport. Then another ten minutes till our bags came in. I was so happy to get out of that death trap! When we got to the house, I had my last time with my grandmother. Itís a : memory I will never forget. The stuborn little smerk on her face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I will never forget was my nickname from her ìchicken little.î The memories of that last visit will forever hold a special place in my heart.
238	18099	7	3	"""I wanna go first!"" exclaimed Person2. Back in my cheerleading days, there was always this girl, Person2, who insisted on being the first to do everything. I'm Person3, always patient and ready to support my team. As we got ready for a routine, Person2 was eager to take the lead once again. ""Set! 5, 6, 7, 8,"" the bases and backspots counted. They lifted Person2 up into the air, executing a perfect stunt. ""Great job,"" the coach praised. It was my turn next, and as I prepared to be lifted, I felt a sense of determination. ""We can do this,"" reassured one of our bases, Person1. With a steady hand on my shoulders, I was propelled into the air flawlessly. The routine went off without a hitch, and I couldn't contain my excitement. Patience truly paid off, and I learned the value of waiting for the right moment. Since that day, I've embraced patience as a virtue that guides me through challenges. It allows me to assess my strengths and weaknesses, helping me improve and excel. Patience is indeed a valuable trait that can lead to success in any endeavor."
239	18100	7	3	Sometimes I am patient, but there are times when I struggle with it. One particular instance where I surprised myself with my patience was when I accompanied my mom to school so she could take a test. While she was busy, I was left waiting at the mall to meet up with my friends. Despite feeling hungry and tempted to rush my mom, I resisted the urge and chose to support her instead. Eventually, after her test, we enjoyed a meal together and spent quality time bonding. Reflecting on that experience, I realized the value of patience and the positive outcomes it can bring, even in moments of discomfort. It was a lesson learned that I will carry with me in future situations that test my patience.
240	18102	7	3	As I patiently sat in my seat, I observed my science teacher calling out names one by one to line up by the door. I waited calmly for my turn, knowing that it would come eventually. The anticipation built up as each student was called, but I remained composed, understanding that my teacher was following a specific order. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my name was called, and I joined my classmates by the door. My patience had paid off, and I was ready to move on to my next class.
241	18103	7	3	"Patient @PERSON2.Hay, when is our food going to be here? (said @PERSON1) ""You have to be patient,"" said @PERSON2, ""it will be here soon, @CAPS1."" ""Well, you will have to wait, okay?"" @CAPS2. ""Here's your food,"" said @PERSON1. ""Yes!"" @PERSON1 shouts. ""Patience is always the key!"" ""I'm done eating, let's go,"" said @PERSON1. ""Hold on, I have to finish my food. Hurry up!"" ""Patience, my friend, patience,"" @PERSON2 said. ""Fine, I'm done."" ""Wow, that was fast,"" @PERSON1 said. ""Patience is indeed a virtue."" ""Are you ready?"" asked @PERSON2. ""Yup, off we go,"" @PERSON1 said. ""Success!"" ""Lala- wait, did you post it?"" ""Alright, let's begin, and @CAPS3, hurry up."" ""Patience,"" @CAPS3 said. ""Fine, I'll just go slower,"" @PERSON2 said. ""@CAPS4, I'll have patience."" ""We're here, only @NUM1 minutes."" ""This is good news. That was a good call, right?"" ""Yes, @CAPS3, right. I'm glad you had patience,"" @PERSON1 said. ""Now, let's go and see, thanks."" ""Hey, @PERSON2, look at that dump truck blocking our way."" ""Where?"" @PERSON2 replied. ""The @NUM2-story building. Watch out,"" said @PERSON2. ""Patience,"" @PERSON1 said. ""You don't need patience."" ""Yes, I do. Just wait-"" ""Splat!"" @CAPS3. ""If only I wasn't so patient."""
242	18105	7	3	Have you ever had to wait in a long line for hours? This is what happened to me and my friend at Cedar Point while waiting to ride the Top Thrill Dragster. Despite the three-hour wait, we decided to go for it. The first hour felt like an eternity, but I tried to stay patient. By the second hour, I was hungry and tired, but I persevered. Finally, after three hours, it was our turn to ride. As I got off the Dragster, I realized that the wait was worth it. This experience taught me the importance of patience in various aspects of life.
243	18106	7	3	"""Don't you wish everyone in the world could be patient? If you don't, I do. Luckily for me, one time I was not being a good girl and I did something I was not supposed to do. But, since I have such great parents, they were trying their best to be patient with me. Like all parents, they had to give me a lecture about what I did, but they did not let me off the hook that easily. As I walked down the hallway to the office, I wondered what I had done wrong. When I arrived, I was asked if I knew why I was there. I replied with a nervous ""no."" The person in the office explained that there had been complaints from some girls about me. I quickly defended myself, explaining that I had only been mean to them because they were being mean and spreading lies about me to my friends. The person agreed to talk to the girls and called them down to the office. As they approached, I braced myself for the conversation, not wanting to engage with them any more than necessary."""
244	18107	7	3	One thing I am not very patient with is the MEAP. The reason I am not patient with the MEAP is that it is very boring, you cannot talk, and it is dull. I hate the MEAP because it is very difficult, and you do not see teenagers or adults doing the MEAP. The MEAP expects you to do too much work, and it is one of the reasons I dislike Michigan. The MEAP asks you questions with words you have never seen or heard before. In my opinion, if we have to do the MEAP, I would prefer them to ask questions with words that we know. Another thing I do not like about it is that they grade our writing based on their opinion of it. To me, the MEAP is stupid, and if I had a choice, I would choose not to do it. However, since the MEAP is important, I do it for my grade. These are the reasons why I am very impatient with the MEAP.
245	18108	7	3	"When I was little, I was patient. I would always sit and wait for direction. My mom always appreciated that about me. Now that I am older, she thinks I am impatient. However, I believe I am still patient. I get along well and I am not anxious. I am not the type to constantly ask, ""When are we going?"" I guess when I was learning how to speak, I was patient because my mom and dad were having a serious conversation that I did not want to interrupt with my childish questions. That's just how it goes."
246	18109	7	3	My mom is always patient with me because I tend to use her phone a lot for texting my girlfriend and calling friends. She kindly lets me know when there's a message or call for her, even if she needs to use the phone herself.
247	18110	7	3	A time when I was patient was waiting for a special gift from my mom. She had promised to get me a @ORGANIZATION1, which I was really excited about. However, when the day came to open my presents, there was no @ORGANIZATION1. My mom explained that she would buy it when taxes came, which meant I had to wait for @NUM2 months. It felt like the longest wait ever, with each day dragging on. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the day arrived, but I had to wait until the end of the month to actually receive my gift. It was worth the wait though, as I enjoyed playing with all the games and apps on the @ORGANIZATION1. I made sure to keep it safe and away from my siblings, who had a tendency to lose things. Being patient paid off in the end, and I learned the importance of taking care of expensive gifts.
248	18112	7	3	"The first time I babysat was with my friend's little girls. A toddler named Lily and a baby named Emma. After their parents left, everything was fine. That is, Emma started crying like crazy. At first, I thought she was saying, ""Mom, Mom!"" but then I realized she was saying, ""Blanket, Blanket!"" Her blanket is a comfort to her, and when I handed it to her, she stopped immediately! Now I realize how patient I was with her. I'm glad I figured out what she wanted. Hopefully, next time I'll be just as patient and attentive to their needs."
249	18114	7	3	When I had to @CAPS1 patient one of my most memorable times was when I ordered my first electric guitar. I ordered it from a reputable guitar website recommended by my guitar teacher. I eagerly awaited its arrival, but when I opened the package, I was disappointed to find that the guitar was chipped. Despite my frustration, we sent it back for a replacement. Unfortunately, the second guitar I received was also damaged, adding to my disappointment. We tried once more, hoping for a successful delivery this time. Finally, after a long wait, on my birthday, I received the correct guitar in perfect condition. I was overjoyed and grateful that the ordeal was finally over.
250	18115	7	3	Patience is a valuable skill that not everyone possesses naturally. As a child, I struggled with patience, and even now, it remains a challenge for me. However, I have a friend who exemplifies patience in a way that I admire. She would wait for me without complaint, whether I was taking my time or getting distracted. I remember a time when she waited for hours just to learn more about history, a subject she was passionate about. Her patience paid off when she aced her homework, showing me that patience is indeed a priority. While I may not have fully mastered patience yet, I know that with time and practice, I can develop this important skill. Watching my friend's example has shown me the value of patience, and I hope to cultivate it in myself as well.
251	18116	7	3	It was a bright sunny day and there was a long line outside the airport. People were waiting for their flight to @LOCATION1. It has been three hours and everyone was getting impatient, but there was a young little boy in the group that didnít seem to complain, he was very patient. Now it has to be five hours, their flight has been delayed, the sun went down, and there was a riot going on, but still the little young boy was still waiting patiently. It has now been twelve hours, people began to leave, it was midnight, and yet the boy was still waiting there and has not yet move. Now there was only fifteen people left, it was dusk, and yet the boy waited there patiently. There flight has arrived and only there was three people there. They went in the plane. The other people that left saw the plane ready to take off and ran towards it. But they were too late and the only people who made it to @LOCATION1 was the two girls and the patient boy. Finally, after a long and arduous wait, they boarded the plane and headed off to their destination.
252	18117	7	3	Patience is difficult to practice, whether it's waiting in line or waiting for a letter to arrive in the mail. I had to exercise patience when I decided to submit a poem to a book that was accepting entries. After working diligently on my poem for a couple of days, I submitted it and eagerly awaited a response. The website mentioned that it would take anywhere from two to three business days to hear back. As the days turned into weeks, I kept checking the mail for a response. Finally, after two months had passed, I received an apology letter for the delay. It was then that I realized the importance of patience in such situations.
253	18118	7	3	This was one day when I had to do something that I didnít want to do and if I didnít do it I couldnít go no were or go to the movies. When I was at my aunt house an I had to clean up her house an I didnít want to do it so she had told me that her house should be clean when she come back home an I was the only one there. When I went to @CAPS1 point everybody went on this scary high in the sky ride an you have  to take your shoes of than we got something to eat. The next day when everybody wolk up we heat from the hotel and went home an ate breakfast an than I didnít wonít to ride my uncle four wheeler down the hill but he had started it up an push it but I had on knee pads and elbow pads and gloves. When I got to my grandma house. I didnít know that every body was help but I dint want to but my mum made me help so nobody went outside to play football it was a good game cause I look out the window the whole game I didnít patient cause I wasnít in it. Wow a was watching the football game out the window the other childs run out the door an I was not done with the wall.  As I reflect on that day, I realize that sometimes we have to do things we don't want to do in order to help others or be a part of the team. While it may not always be enjoyable in the moment, the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that comes from lending a hand or participating fully can be rewarding in the end. It's important to push past our initial reluctance and embrace the opportunity to contribute and be a part of something greater than ourselves.
254	18119	7	3	The time that I was patient was today when everyone was taking the @CAPS1.E.A.P. When we all got into the classroom, nobody wanted to take the @CAPS1.E.A.P. Our teacher told us that we had to write on five pages and finish part two of the writing session by @DATE1. Nobody was excited about it. We had to fill in our answers on a packet and write our names on it before we could take a break. After the break, we had to get a free reading book and listen to the directions before starting. Some people finished early and got bored, so they started talking and making paper basketballs to shoot into the hoop. The teacher had to step out for a moment, and when she came back, she had to remind us to focus on the last writing session before lunch. Everyone was anxious about finishing before lunchtime. So, that was the time I had to be patient amidst the chaos in the classroom.
255	18120	7	3	One time when I had to be patient was when I went to my first NASCAR race. I had to be patient because there were a lot of people there, and I didn't want to get lost in the crowd. I had to wait for the people in front of me to get to their seats before I could find mine. Once I finally settled into my seat, I found myself sitting next to someone who made me feel uncomfortable. Despite this, as the race began, with the roar of the engines and the jets flying overhead, I couldn't help but feel excited. My favorite racer, @PERSON1, was in the lead, and I was on the edge of my seat watching the cars speed around the track. It was a thrilling experience, and I had to stay focused, listen to the announcements, and be patient as the race unfolded. Overall, despite the challenges, it was a memorable and exciting day at the NASCAR race.
256	18121	7	3	I am never patient, but when I am, it is only once in a while. Sitting down and not doing anything drives me to be insane. When I'm doing nothing and it is really quiet, I get really bad headaches. In school, for example, when I'm waiting, I get restless - tapping my foot, tapping my pencil on my desk, tapping everything. I must do something or I go insane. Waiting in a doctor's office or flying on a plane for a while can get really boring. When I wait too long, I feel lazy and tired because I'm not moving at all. I get antsy when I'm patient and waiting for something. It is usually no longer than half an hour before I get really agitated. I can't be patient for very long, or I get restless. One way I help myself is by playing sports and keeping myself constantly active.
257	18123	7	3	Patience is when a being shows the ability to wait and make good decisions. For me, patience is the ability to stay calm and rational in difficult situations. It is crucial because it allows me to handle circumstances wisely and avoid getting into trouble. However, maintaining patience during times of stress can be challenging as people may provoke you. Without patience, individuals tend to make poor decisions that can lead to unfavorable outcomes. By exercising patience, one can effectively address problems and move forward. Engaging in impulsive actions like the mentioned @CAPS2í@CAPS3 can have detrimental consequences. Therefore, practicing patience is essential for navigating through challenging situations and making sound choices.
258	18124	7	3	It was the night before Christmas Eve and I couldnít hardly wait. In our family on Christmas Eve, we go to our grandparents' house. When we are there, we talk, eat, and my favorite part - open presents. As my mom, dad, and I drove up to my grandparents' house, I couldnít open the car door fast enough. I sprinted up to the front door and rang the doorbell a hundred times.   ìWell, hello there,î my grandpa said. ìCan we eat fast so I can open my presents?î   After we were done eating, I sprinted down the stairs as fast as I could. I couldn't wait. As I waited patiently until all of my old relatives opened their presents, it was finally my turn. I ripped off the wrapping paper and saw that it was a game. Since it was the first present, I had to open it fast, but from then on, I waited patiently until it was my turn.  The joy of Christmas Eve with my family, the excitement of opening presents, and the love that fills the air make this night truly special. I cherish these moments with my loved ones, creating memories that will last a lifetime.

We were playing against the @CAPS2 for the championship, and I wasn't initially in the game due to being seen as the hardest player on my team.

With @NUM3 seconds remaining and us trailing by @NUM2, I was given the opportunity to take a technical shot. Remembering the importance of patience, I focused and made the shot, helping us secure a victory. Thanks to my patience and perseverance, we were able to win the game and claim the championship trophy.
261	18128	7	3	My mom has very little patience, but that all changed the day my grandma passed away. I was surprised to see her so sad yet so composed, taking her time with every action as if it had to be perfect. Despite the overwhelming grief, she remained calm and collected, showing us all the strength and grace we needed in that moment of despair. When I arrived, she greeted me with a warm hug, comforting us in our time of need. It was a day filled with sorrow, but my mom's unexpected patience and kindness made it a little easier to bear.
262	18129	7	3	A time that I was patient was during my twelfth birthday party. Most of my friends wanted to keep playing instead of stopping for dinner and presents, so I decided to go along with their wishes. We ended up taking the dogs for a walk, having dinner, and then finally opening my gifts. Despite my excitement, I waited until everyone was ready before opening them. In the end, I was rewarded with some fantastic presents, and I realized that being patient and putting my friends first was truly worth it. Overall, we all had a wonderful time, and I was glad that I chose to be patient on my special day.

When they got to the house @PERSON1 was screaming and crying they all got in the car and drove to the doctors. The nurse said that she had to wait an hour to see the doctor. @PERSON1 wasn't patient until her and her friend were talking. When the doctor was ready to see her she had forgot all about why she was there, @PERSON1 found out that she broke her arm. Later that day she thanked her mom and then called her friend and thanked her for helping her be patient.
264	18131	7	3	I thought that when I got hurt during football and was on a stretcher, everyone was patient. They understood that I could only go a cartair spare and waited for me in the hallways and carried my stud from room to room. An example of someone showing this patience was @CAPS1 @PERSON2 had to hurry to go to the bathroom but walked with me slowly so I wouldn't be alone. Another example of someone being patient with me is @PERSON1. Lauren was patient with me when I asked her to help adjust my position on the stretcher for comfort. Her understanding and willingness to assist made a difficult situation more bearable, and I truly appreciated her kindness during that challenging time.
265	18132	7	3	I was patient. One day my mom and I went to the eye doctor. It was my first time going there. We went to this lady and waited for the doctor to call us. After sitting for a few minutes, we heard my name being called. We entered the doctor's room, and I sat down as he performed his examination. Later, he informed us that we needed to see another doctor. We sat down again and waited. When my name was called once more, we went to see the next doctor. I noticed a medicine on the table and felt scared. The lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide. I hesitated as she administered the medicine, which stung a little. I was tempted to run away, but I stayed put. After she finished with both eyes, she instructed me to keep my eyes closed until she returned. When she came back, she assured me that we were done. I realized that the experience wasn't as bad as I had feared.

Ultimately, patience is a valuable quality that enhances personal growth and well-being.
268	18135	7	3	Patient, that's all I am when I go fishing. If there is a spot where you cast, it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite. Then you have to wait for it to swallow it; sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because sometimes you have to count in the water color, amount of weeds, and what the fish eat. Then you have to have patience on the spot you aren't too because after the motor runs, you have to wait for the fish to come back. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing. Additionally, once you have hooked a fish, reeling it in can also require a great deal of patience, as some fish may put up a strong fight and require careful maneuvering to bring them in. Patience is truly a virtue when it comes to fishing, from selecting the right gear to waiting for the perfect moment to reel in your catch. It is a test of patience that rewards those who are willing to wait for the thrill of the catch.
269	18136	7	3	Anna sat there waiting patiently, come on come on come on! She thought to herself, meets, and was very excited to perform her now improved beam routine. Anna was one of the last gymnasts to go, only making her situation more difficult. She took a deep breath and sat down patiently, waiting for her chance to shine to the judges. As the moment drew nearer, her heart raced with anticipation. Finally, the announcer called her name, and Anna gracefully approached the beam, ready to showcase all her hard work and dedication. The audience fell silent as she began her routine, each movement executed with precision and elegance. With a flawless dismount, Anna landed gracefully on the mat, a smile of satisfaction spreading across her face. The judges were impressed, and a sense of pride washed over her. All the hours of practice had paid off, and Anna couldn't be happier with her performance. She walked off the mat with a newfound confidence, knowing that she had given her all and left everything out on the floor.
270	18137	7	3	"It was the @DATE1 when I went to see the creed concert with my cousins. There must have been @NUM1 or @NUM2 people in front of us. Then I heard and saw people shouting and pushing to get in. About @NUM3 to @NUM1 minutes later, my legs started aching but I held on. I kept telling myself, ""the pain is worth the wait!"" Finally, we got to the security guards, and they had to do a metal detector on us. When we walked into the concert, I said, ""that was a wait worth waiting for."" The energy in the air was electric, and the performance was unforgettable. The excitement and thrill of the concert made all the waiting and discomfort worth it. I left feeling fulfilled and grateful for the experience."
271	18138	7	3	Two weeks ago, my friend's sister was supposed to visit, but she didn't show up. Despite my impatience, I was reminded to be patient by my friend's mother. I struggled with waiting but eventually, she arrived, and my persistence paid off. My patience was rewarded with a joyful reunion, proving that sometimes, good things come to those who wait.
272	18140	7	3	Two years ago, when the first @CAPS1 came out my step dad paid eight hundred dollars for one. He was so happy all he did was brag to his family and friends about it. During this time my mom had broke her phone and my step dad did not want to let her use his phone. So she was phoneless for at least three months. She was kind of mad but it was worth being patient for. As the newer and improved one came out in stores my mom was able to buy it. She was so glad, she had more apps than the first @CAPS1 and a webcom. I think that my mom did a good job at being patient because if it was someone else they wouldn't be able to wait that long. My mom's patience paid off in the end as she finally got her hands on the newer and better @CAPS1.
273	18141	7	3	When I was about 7 years old, all I wanted in the world was a toy rex. This toy dinosaur was the biggest and meanest dinosaur around. Every time I went to the store, I would gaze at it longingly, promising that it would be mine one day. I decided to work hard by cleaning up more, walking the dog, and doing better in school to hopefully get it sooner than Christmas.  However, when Christmas finally arrived, I opened all my gifts but did not see the rex. I felt disappointed, but my mom surprised me with a big box containing lots of baby dolls. Just when I thought I didn't get what I wanted, my mom told me to go downstairs, where the rex was waiting for me, looking happy to see me. It was the best Christmas gift ever, and I couldn't have been happier.
274	18142	7	3	"ì@NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @NUM7, @NUM8!î my poms coach @PERSON1 says as we practice the dance over and over again. I love poms but at times it gets very tiring. We have practice @DATE1, and @DATE3. We also have six girls including me. My coach loves to make us do the dance one time by ourselves .On our first game we had practice right before we left for our very first performance. All of us were so excited we all just wanted to go and perform all day. But the game was at @NUM5:45 pm and they didnít even start until @NUM6:00 pm which was way later than expected. So all my poms team, our coach, and all of our family had to wait patiently on the bleachers for over @NUM11 until we actually, finally got to perform. Finally it was the @DATE2 and the clock bit three, which meant we all went on the track to stretch. We were all so happy but still a little sad that we didnít get to perform earlier. We had a minute on the clock so we walked to the other side. Getting in our formation the clock quickly started to drop from fifty seconds to @NUM12 then quickly we only had @NUM13 seconds until we went on. I couldnít believe it, only @NUM13 seconds until our very first performance. The thrill rushed through my head as the man announced ""Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the talented @CAPS1 performing @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pom pon team"" then our names over the speakers. The crowd roared as we entered the field. We quickly all reminded ourselves to smile. Then the music came on and we all danced our hearts out, honoring and thanking our coach and our parents. After we finished, we were automatically surrounded by friends and family. And waiting and being patient wasn't so bad anymore. It was all worth the wait. The excitement and joy of that moment will forever be etched in our memories."
275	18143	7	3	When dealing with toddlers or the elderly, patience is crucial. This virtue is essential when interacting with individuals of any age, but it becomes even more critical when dealing with very young children and the elderly. The elderly may experience confusion, hearing difficulties, or slower responses, requiring extra patience and respect. Likewise, toddlers may get upset and resist following instructions if they sense impatience or hostility. It is important to remember that mentally or physically challenged individuals also need patience and understanding. They may struggle to comprehend or complete tasks, similar to toddlers or the elderly. By exercising patience, we demonstrate respect for others, regardless of their age or abilities. Fear should never be mistaken for respect; true respect is shown through patience and empathy.
276	18144	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was babysitting and the kids I was babysitting were acting up. It hard for me to get them to calm down. But, I noticed that if I was patient then they will too. So, I just sat down and told them to calm down and they wouldn't. So I told them that again and this time they were a bit quieter I noticed that if I ignore them or be patient then they will settle down and stop because they were trying to get my attention. If I was being patient then I knew they would be too. It worked they settle down and were being a lot when I was babysitting them the next time too.

Wrong! @CAPS6 was not nice or sweet and didnt listen at all! ì@CAPS8 walk him around a couple of times along the perimeter.î @PERSON1 said. ì@CAPS4 fine.î I replied. @CAPS8 as I was halfway around the ring, @PERSON3 stopped. Then @CAPS6 turned to his right, walked up to the window and started licking the water that beaded up on it. ì@PERSON2! What is @CAPS6 doing!î @PERSON1 yelled ìI think @CAPS6 is licking the water off the windows.î I said ì@CAPS10 get him away from there, @CAPS6 could get sick!î @CAPS4, as I said earlier, @CAPS3 horse has terrible listening skills! Now I was getting in trouble because of him! ì@CAPS8 be patient @PERSON2.î I guess I did need to calm down, so I relaxed a little and continued riding with no problems. I guess I @CAPS8 needed patience and to relax. Even if so, I am still never getting on that horse @CAPS13 again. Despite the challenges, I learned the importance of patience and staying calm in difficult situations with horses like @PERSON3.
278	18147	7	3	On my way to @LOCATION1 to visit my dad. While in the car there is food and I brought along my @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 to keep me busy, I brought my @CAPS1 along because it would be annoying if I ask are we there yet?î very @NUM1 minutes, and I knew that a @NUM2 hr drive would need some entertainment. Most of the time I would be playing games so time goes by fast, if I donít play games then I eat a snack, play with my baby cousins, @PERSON1, and sleep. After a while of that I sit back and relax. The whole trip is @NUM2 hrs but by doing all that it seems to be more like @NUM4 or @NUM5 hrs.  During the journey, I also enjoy looking out the window at the passing scenery, listening to music, and engaging in conversations with my family members. These activities help make the time fly by and before I know it, we have arrived at our destination. The trip is not only about reaching the destination but also about enjoying the journey and the time spent with loved ones.
279	18148	7	3	"Patience is waiting and tolerating. Every year, on the first of May, my family becomes seasonal at a campsite. There, we play, have fun, and make lifelong friends. Every weekend, we take out our speedboat, ""The Glass Fin,"" put it into the lake, and dock it. Then, we go fishing on different parts of the lake and sit there for hours. This is where patience comes in - we have to sit and watch our bobbers float on the smooth lake, enjoying the peacefulness and quality time with my parents. In school, I have to wait throughout the year and be patient for it to be over. We sit there until we hear the sudden noise of one of our bobbers sinking into the water. There's yelling and excitement as we try to reel in the catch, whether it's a large bass or a small trout. All of this requires patience and adds to the enjoyment of the experience."
280	18149	7	3	My dog Teddy Bear is very impatient because when he comes in from outside, he gets a treat, but he has to wait for the other dogs to come in as well. Teddy Bear can often be seen pacing back and forth, eagerly anticipating his reward. His tail wags frantically as he looks back at the door, waiting for his canine companions to hurry up. Despite his impatience, Teddy Bear knows that good things come to those who wait, so he tries his best to contain his excitement until all the dogs are safely inside. Once everyone is accounted for, Teddy Bear finally gets his treat, and his impatience transforms into pure delight as he happily munches away on his well-deserved snack.
281	18150	7	3	One @DATE1 @TIME1 I was very patient when I was waiting for my sister-in-law to tell my brother to inform us that we could come into the hospital room to see their newborn baby @CAPS1. My father, mother, sister, brother, and I were all waiting in the lobby for about an hour and a half. Despite feeling shaky, nervous, and jumpy, I managed to stay patient. Every ten to fifteen minutes, I would take a short walk around the waiting area to calm my nerves. However, my jittery state may have been exacerbated by the three cans of Pepsi I consumed right before rushing to the hospital. Overall, although the wait was long and my nerves were on edge, I was able to maintain my composure and patience until we were finally able to meet the newest addition to our family.
282	18151	7	3	Patience is a valuable trait that can lead to unexpected rewards. I have personally experienced the benefits of patience while waiting in a long line at a store. Despite the seemingly endless queue, I remained calm and waited my turn. As closing time approached, I finally reached the checkout counter and made my purchases just minutes before the store was due to close. To my surprise, the owner generously offered me some items for free as a token of appreciation for my patience. This experience taught me that practicing patience can result in unexpected blessings and rewards. Therefore, it is essential to cultivate patience in our daily lives and leave impatience behind to unlock the hidden treasures that await us.
283	18152	7	3	Well, patience is key in various aspects of life, whether it be waiting for a fish to bite while fishing or for your meal to be served at a restaurant. It's essential to practice patience not only in these situations but also in interactions with others. Being patient with those around you can lead to smoother communication and stronger relationships. So, remember to take a deep breath and practice patience in all aspects of your life for a more peaceful and fulfilling experience.
284	18153	7	3	Just as I finished eating my hamburger I noticed an old, crude excuse for a bus parked outside of the restaurant window. ì@CAPS1ís that?î I asked through my sgueky seven-year-old voice. My @CAPS3 responded, ìThat bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1ís playing.î ì@CAPS2ít it be cool if we @CAPS4 go?î I questioned. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car and we drove across street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was huge! All I wanted to do was enter the marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later the two pepsis I had drinken earlier made it through my system ì@CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroomî, I said over and over again. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. ì@CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms?î my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold ìroî and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of line, we passed through the metal detector and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom.
285	18154	7	3	After waiting patiently, we finally arrived at @LOCATION1. The excitement built as we approached the entrance, and my friend @PERSON1 and I were ready to enjoy the experience. Being patient paid off, as the anticipation only made the moment more special. It just goes to show that good things come to those who wait.
286	18156	7	3	Once upon a time, in a place called unpaciente land, there lived a little girl named @ORGANIZATION1. She was known for her exceptional patience, unlike the rest of the inhabitants on grumpy lane. One day, @ORGANIZATION1 decided to visit the local salon, mtso fast saloon, for a haircut. Upon arrival, she was met with chaos as everyone was shouting at the hair cutter. @ORGANIZATION1 bravely stood up and calmed the room, reminding everyone to sit quietly if they wanted a good haircut. Miraculously, everyone followed her lead, and @ORGANIZATION1 left the salon with a stunning haircut, just like everyone else.  Her act of patience and kindness did not go unnoticed, and @ORGANIZATION1 was soon appointed as the mayor of unpaciente land. In honor of her remarkable influence, the town was renamed @CAPS2 land, symbolizing the newfound patience and harmony that prevailed among its residents. From that day onward, the atmosphere in @CAPS2 land was filled with tranquility and understanding, all thanks to the patience and leadership of @ORGANIZATION1.
287	18159	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctor with my step mom & brother. He was getting his knee looked at; we were in that waiting room for like two or three hours! Jody (my step mom) was getting really irritated I told her that the doctor will be out soon. I was very patient, and my brother was playing with his phone. That kind of made him relax because usually Iím not very patient usually everyone tells me that Iím really impatient. For some reason when Iím really excited Iím fairly patient. I was exulted to see if he could get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, he was so happy that two hours was worth it! This was a time when I was patient.
288	18160	7	3	One time I was patient. It was December 24th eve. I was so excited that Christmas. On Christmas eve morning I slept till late, eager for the day to come. I was patient, so I played video games to pass the time. When I went to the store, I saw all the Christmas things and felt like I couldn't wait any longer. That night after dinner, I found myself torn between wanting to stay up and going to sleep early to make Christmas come faster. A little part of me wanted to go to sleep, but the anticipation was too much. I made some more food and eventually went to sleep. When morning came, I woke up excitedly and ran into the living room to find the presents. I resisted the urge to open them early and decided to wait until everyone was awake. At noon, I finally got to open my presents with my family, feeling like a lion feasting on a gazelle. I was overjoyed that I had waited patiently.
289	18161	7	3	"When I was patient I had no fears, no arguments, but I had a good deal. I had a job that was so good my sister said, ""Can I get some?"" I replied, ""Of course, you can."" It was a miracle. I was driving her car to the gas station when I ran into my cousin. I asked, ""How have you been?"" She replied, ""Just saw you two days ago."" I was amazed. My sister called me urgently because it was my dad's weekend, so I rushed to get there. It was a chaotic but memorable day."
290	18162	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was on the drive to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 took a few hours so here is @CAPS2 story. We were leaving the house when I realized I forgot something. I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2 dog Penny. @CAPS2 dog bounded out the door, and I put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2 grandparents' house to rest before hitting the road. As we traveled through various roads and finally reached the highway, I knew it was going to be a long journey ahead. Despite passing and being passed by many cars, we managed to stay on track with our grandparents' vehicle. After four hours, we arrived in @LOCATION3, but we still had one more state to pass through before reaching @LOCATION1. We decided to take a break in @LOCATION2 and spent the night in a hotel. The next morning, we resumed our journey with a two-hour drive left. It felt like the longest five hours, but I remained patient throughout. Finally, we made it to @LOCATION1, and with the help of GPS, we found our cabins. This experience taught me the importance of patience during long travels.
291	18163	7	3	There was a time when my patience was truly tested with my little sister. She was relentlessly pestering me to turn on the music, and despite my refusal, she threw a tantrum. Instead of reacting with anger or violence, I calmly lifted her up and warned her to stop before things escalated. My gentle approach worked, and she quieted down, allowing me to redirect her attention to watching TV peacefully. This incident highlighted my ability to remain patient and composed even in challenging situations, demonstrating that I can handle difficult moments without losing my cool.
292	18164	7	3	Patience, to me, is demonstrated when I take the time to assist others with their problems. I have a natural inclination towards patience, as I find fulfillment in offering support to those in need. One particular instance stands out in my memory from my time at my previous school. There was a girl, let's call her @PERSON1, who was visibly distressed one day. Upon inquiring, she confided in me about the challenges she was facing at home. She expressed her frustrations about being confined to her house, responsible for looking after her younger siblings while her mother imposed strict restrictions on her social life. I spent the entire day by her side, lending her a listening ear and offering comfort. By the end of our conversation, she appeared relieved and grateful for having someone to confide in. This experience reinforced my belief in the power of patience and empathy. Since that day, I have made it a priority to provide a listening ear to those in need, allowing them to share their burdens and find solace in knowing they are not alone.
293	18165	7	3	There was a time when I was patient for a whole day! It was Christmas Eve, and the excitement was building as I went through my morning routine without pestering my mom to open a present. After a fun day of playing games and hanging out with friends, I finally got to open my presents on Christmas morning. The joy and excitement of that moment made the patience all worth it. It was a day I'll always remember for my newfound patience and the joy of Christmas morning.

296	18168	7	3	We had been patient enough on the plane ride to @ORGANIZATION1. We had been patient checking in. now was time for a true test of patience. We sat down at a table in a restaurant of the hotel. Our waitress came over, ordered our drinks and food, then dissappered. We got our drinks and waited for our meal @NUM1 min, @NUM2 min. @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5 min. after an hour we called her over and asked for bread. Lo and behold, she brings bread! We ask her where is our food. She promises to bring it out right away. We wait until weíve been waiting for @NUM6 hours. We call the manager over to complain, and he brings out the food a minute later. After @NUM6 hours of patience, we finally got our food. The frustration of waiting for so long tested our patience, but in the end, our persistence paid off as we were able to enjoy our meal.

298	18170	7	3	It was @DATE1 when my family and I went to Cedar Point. The trip was about three to six hours long, and I was thrilled when we finally arrived. As we pulled into Burger King, I quickly ordered a kids meal and enjoyed every bite. After our quick pit stop, we continued our journey to the amusement park.   Upon arriving, I was mesmerized by the water parks and hotels surrounding Cedar Point. The sight of a tall roller coaster caught my eye, and I couldn't wait to experience the thrill. Despite the long lines, I patiently waited for my turn. When I finally received my stamp, I eagerly rushed to the indoor roller coaster.   After enduring another hour-long wait in line, I boarded the ride and felt a mix of excitement and fear as we plunged into darkness. The disorienting experience left me dizzy but only fueled my desire for more adrenaline. I pushed through my fatigue and hopped on a ride that rocked side to side, testing my patience once again.   Overall, my trip to Cedar Point was filled with excitement, thrills, and moments of patience. It was a memorable experience that I will cherish forever.
299	18171	7	3	"Waiting in line at @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I complained, "" @CAPS2! When are we going into the park?"" My mother hissed back, "" @CAPS3 patient."" ""Being patient is boring!"" I whined. ""Yeah, I'm so bored!"" echoed my sister. ""It's not fair and it hurts,"" I added, feeling impatient. ""Shh!"" scolded my mother. ""We're almost there!"" Finally, after what felt like hours, we reached the ticket booth. ""Finally!"" I exclaimed with relief. As we entered the park, I asked, ""What should we go on first?"" My sister pointed excitedly to a ride and yelled, ""That one!"" She dashed towards it, and we hurried to catch up. ""Come on, let's ride @CAPS12. It looks fun,"" suggested my dad as we joined the line. ""More waiting!"" I groaned. ""This is going to take forever!"" Despite my impatience, I knew the wait would be worth it for the thrill of the ride."
300	18172	7	3	I showed patience before. I am about to tell you and that time. Two years ago.  I worked at my @CAPS1ís home to get ???. Working there is tough because he makes you do so much work. I got all of the ??? grass cut at his harn, cut wood and a lot m???. After around seven hours of hard work, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could have my money. He ???  he when I asked why he told me. He gave a bunch of money to my uncle for vacation. My heart sunk. I asked him when I was going to get it. He shook his head like he had no idea. Rage filled in he to at me. One week ??? I went back to ??? house to ask ??? because I really wanted to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind said patience but my body said no patience. I listened to my mind. Waiting really at unk but I knew patience was the right thing to do. Patience bring the an opportunity. Three weeks later. He still hasnt gotten me my money. I heard someone knock in my door. I moved over to it. It was my @CAPS1. He came made with a huge grin on his face. Suddenly he open my hand and gave me twenty dollars! ì@CAPS1 thatís more than double,î I said, my heart throbbing. ìI know but you deserve it.î I was shocked to hear my @CAPS1 say that. That day I showed patience. It really did to me good to have patience cause I made so much money. Think about my story the next time you donít wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off.
301	18173	7	3	When I was about nine years old, I took my homework home with me and showed it to one of my older brothers. He kindly offered to help me with it, taking the time to explain and demonstrate how to tackle the questions I found difficult. As he had his own work to complete, he encouraged me to try solving the challenging question on my own. Despite feeling unsure, I persisted and eventually managed to figure it out by myself. This experience taught me the importance of perseverance and the satisfaction that comes from overcoming obstacles independently. It was a valuable lesson that stayed with me throughout my academic journey.
302	18174	7	3	Middleton middle school, Iím one of their students. My name is @CAPS1, Iím new here, but you @MONTH1 think that Iím a boy. Well if you do you better listen and listen hard @CAPS16 Iím not going to say this twice; patience is a virtue. On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1ís class I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. ì@CAPS2.î @CAPS3 said. ìmy nameís @CAPS4.î @CAPS3 said in a perky voice. ì@CAPS2.î I said back. ìIím @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1.î ì@CAPS8, uh @CAPS1.î @CAPS4 replied. ì@CAPS11 let me show you around.î ì@CAPS12!î I answered back. @CAPS4 and I became fast friends, but when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends they all made fun of me for having a boyís name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @CAPS13 was @CAPS17. @CAPS4 just wouldn't let @CAPS13 go. Finally I said to her, ì@CAPS13ís @CAPS17 @CAPS4! Just let me handle this.î ì@CAPS15?î @CAPS3 asked crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way @CAPS3 did when @CAPS3 couldn't do the same thing. ì@CAPS16 you just donít have any patience!î I said, getting a little angry @CAPS3 couldn't understand. ì@CAPS17 be that way @CAPS1!î @CAPS3 said storming out of the room. ì@CAPS4 wait!î I cried, but I had to run after her. ì@CAPS20, please you don't get @CAPS13. You canít keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know you're trying to protect me, but it's @CAPS17. Have you ever heard of patience before?î I asked, ready to run if @CAPS3 ran from me. ì@CAPS21.î @CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about @CAPS13, and we never had a problem again.
303	18175	7	3	I was on my way to Tennessee with my friends, family, and grandparents, who I affectionately call Nana and Papa. We were in two separate cars, with me and my friends in a white Mercedes driven by my friend @CAPS1. My younger brother and my grandparents were in Nana's gold minivan. As we were driving, we noticed a burning rubber smell coming from our car, so we pulled over to check it out.  It turned out that our car was leaking transmission fluid, so we had to find a nearby auto shop to get it fixed. The mechanic at the shop couldn't figure out the problem right away, so we had to wait for hours while they tried to diagnose the issue. It was frustrating to sit and wait, especially since we were all looking forward to our trip to Tennessee.  After spending hours at the shop, we realized that we would have to call AAA to tow our car back home. It was a disappointing end to our journey, but things took a turn for the worse when I tripped and sprained my wrist on the way out of the restaurant. We had to make a quick stop at Walmart to get a bandage for my wrist, and I picked up a book to read on the way home.  Despite the setbacks, we made the best of the situation by reading our new books in the car on the way back. It wasn't the trip to Tennessee that we had planned, but we still managed to find some enjoyment in the unexpected turn of events.
304	18177	7	3	When I went deer hunting with my dad, I was patient throughout the day. As we waited for a deer to appear, I had to remain quiet and still. It was challenging to control my movements and not make any noise, but I knew that patience was key in hunting. Despite not catching a deer that day, I learned the importance of being patient and composed in such situations. Being able to wait for the right moment is crucial in hunting, and I was able to demonstrate these qualities during our trip.
305	18178	7	3	Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be new to me, Iíll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I may not get the services I want, but at least Iíll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so Iím not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, Iím going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am dedicated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in September, sheís transferred everything, Iíve proved Iím dedicated, Iíve kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, Iíve been watching the neighborís pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and Iím working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, Iíve been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that Iím responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mom still isnít sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until Christmas, she will finally give me her old cell phone. Iíll probably have to clean up the mess after Christmas too though. When I get a cell phone, Iíll have to continue everything Iím doing now. So, I wonít be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long ways to go but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!
306	18179	7	3	Patience is a crucial virtue to possess in life. It plays a significant role in determining how far one can progress. Without patience, it is challenging to gain the respect and admiration of others. Additionally, having patience is essential for problem-solving and achieving goals effectively. Therefore, cultivating patience is key to success in both personal and professional endeavors.
307	18180	7	3	@CAPS2 story is about the time @CAPS2 mom ran out of gas. @CAPS2 mom was driving down @LOCATION1 @NUM1 driving home. Soon we started running out of gas. The bad thing is, it was raining. Then we ran out of gas. First she had to get someone to pullover and ask if they had a cell phone. Someone finally did. She asked if they could get gas. Every one said ‚Äú@CAPS1!‚Äù @CAPS2 mom then decided to call @CAPS2 dad and ask him to get gas. He then shows up an hour later with a couple gallons of gas. That was just enough to get @LOCATION1 home. If @CAPS2 mom had @CAPS1 patience she would have gone crazy. As they drove home, they were grateful for @CAPS2 dad's timely help and learned the importance of being prepared for unexpected situations on the road.
308	18181	7	3	One day when I was out camping with my friend @PERSON1 I asked him if we could climb the dunes and he said we would do it later. So I waited hours and hours and hours and hours then he said acler our lunch. Then I asked him after lunch and he said yes. But when is saw the dunes I knew it was a bad idea for me to climb it but I did. After I got to the top. I fell and @CAPS1 stayed there like, a dead animal. After five minute I was good and climbing to the top dune off because after I got up I ran down the dune and when my friend told me to stop I stop I stoped. But I got seed in my coat pocket. Then I hit a rock and did a front flip. Then I fell, when my friend carte down we both lauphed and @CAPS2 back to our campsite. As we walked back, we reminisced about the adventure and the funny moments we shared on the dunes, grateful for the unforgettable experience we had together in the great outdoors.
309	18182	7	3	My name is @CAPS1 and Iím writing about a time I had to be patient. It was a nice @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE2, the eighteenth, and we were going to drive down to @LOCATION1 for a vacation to @CAPS2 land. Everybody was up in the household, packing everything into a camper that we rented for the trip so everyone would fit into the car. We had packed all our things into the car, and my mom made us a delicious breakfast of sausage, pancakes, bacon, and scrambled eggs.  After breakfast, we got into the car and hit the highway. I fell asleep an hour into the drive, waking up around ten o'clock at night. My sister and brother were arguing, which escalated into a heated argument between my sister and me. Our mom intervened, telling us to be quiet, but tensions were still high. I had to muster all my patience for the next two days as we continued our journey.  Despite the challenges, we finally arrived at our destination, and I was relieved to be there. The trip had its ups and downs, but in the end, it was a memorable experience that taught me the importance of patience in difficult situations.
310	18183	7	3	I was on the farm waiting for my dad to get home so I could ride my four-wheeler. Then later that night he called me saying he will be later than I was expecting. He came home three hours later. That meant I had to ride my four-wheeler tomorrow because nobody was home except for my grandma, my dad doesn't want me to ride my four-wheeler when my dad or my uncle @PERSON1 is not there. At that point, I was impatient. The next day my dad called me saying he had to work late again so I could not ride again. I was even more impatient, but then my uncle @PERSON1 showed up and I asked him if I could ride my four-wheeler. He told me I could if my dad said it was okay. So I called my dad and he said it was fine if my uncle @PERSON1 approved. Then I could ride my four-wheeler, and I was no longer impatient.
311	18184	7	3	Hunting requires patience because deer do not come to you; you have to wait and watch for them. They are wary of people and can smell humans, so impatience will not lead to success in hunting. It is essential to be patient and wait for the right moment to have a successful hunt.
312	18185	7	3	Last year, I had to sell my cow due to her illness. I waited anxiously for eight months to get a new calf, unsure of where to find one. Thankfully, my uncle, who raises small cow breeds, offered me a deal on a cow for a reasonable price. It took me a while to locate her, but when I finally brought her home, I felt relieved and happy. However, my concern for her safety grew at night, especially with the presence of a cougar roaming the countryside. Despite my worries, I am grateful for finding the cow and look forward to taking care of her.
313	18186	7	3	Do you ever like waiting in the line at the store? Well, I donít also ??? Well I am going to tell you about a time when I was inpatient and patient. Every morning I have to take the bus to school. I usually get in the bus stop @NUM1 min early, so I can talk with my mother ??? Try I got up to early. I made it to the bus stop early. ??? @NUM2 min later I decided to go back home. By the time I got home I was going to be late. I hurried at the door, but I was too late, the bus was gone. I should have more patient. On day I was going to burger ??? was to get a hamburger with bacon cheese and toaster. When I got their, their where about @NUM3 peace in their, so I decided to wait my turn in line like I had later. I was there people payed from cash regester. I was finally their I ordered my burger when I was done it was worth the wait. In conclusion you have to be patient in everything you do. Sports, school or home and even in public, I hope my story made you relise how important it is to be patient. And remember, good things come to those who wait.
314	18187	7	3	"A time I was patient was in June at the music festival. I was about 12 years old in the afternoon when we claimed our seats right in front of the stage. We waited about 30 minutes till the first band came on stage, the name of their band was Neon Shadows. Their appearance was strange as they looked like a rock band. But they were just a regular band that played normal music. They played songs I've never heard of ever but now I hear them more frequently. The second band was another one I never heard of. I can't remember their names, but they weren't my taste of music. The next band was one I knew lots about; their name is the Moonlight Serenade, they were great. Their lead singer had a long beard and an afro, it was very funny. They seemed to go the quickest because I enjoyed them so much. Next was another singer I have heard of, his name was Alex Rivers, he was also great. He even made up a song at the top of his head about the music festival and never stopped for like four minutes. Then he was done and the time was about 10:30 at night by now. And I was getting tired. But right there I saw the Midnight Boys getting ready I was really excited, they opened up with a song named ""Electric Dreams."" And there were strobe lights and regular lights everywhere. The stage that was holding the drum even moved. It did spins, and a somersault. It went 20 feet in the air and did flips and everything you can imagine. Their lead singer Jack and their drummer even had a drum off, that was cool. That went till about midnight, it was amazing. I will probably never witness something like that ever again!"
315	18189	7	3	Being patient can be challenging at times, but it can also be rewarding. For instance, on Christmas morning, my brother and I always wake up early and eagerly wait to open our presents. We excitedly gaze at the gifts under the tree, trying to guess what might be inside. Despite being told to go back to bed, we cannot contain our excitement. As the morning progresses, we try to distract ourselves by engaging in various activities, but our anticipation only grows. Eventually, we make coffee for our parents, who insist on having their morning pick-me-up before the gift-opening festivities can begin. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, we are allowed to unwrap our presents. The wait may have been long, but the joy of finally discovering what we have received makes it all worthwhile.
316	18190	7	3	I was patient in the car while waiting for my mom to finish her errand at the store. Instead of complaining or asking when we would go home, I went with the flow and embraced the moment. Although it felt like a long hour, I didn't mind because I had chosen to accompany her. In the end, my patience paid off as my mom rewarded me with a chocolate bar. This experience taught me that being patient can lead to pleasant surprises and rewards.
317	18191	7	3	When I was very patient was the time I had to get my teeth pulled. It took two hours, with breaks every half an hour for about 10 minutes each. I received many shots in my mouth and they even had to rip open my gum to extract the teeth. Despite the discomfort, I remained patient throughout the procedure. The dentist commended me for being one of their best patients, considering the extensive work and time it took to remove four teeth. This experience taught me the value of patience in challenging situations, and I emerged from it with a sense of resilience and strength.
318	18192	7	3	"""When can I drive?"" I whined. ""When the time comes you have to be patient, otherwise you won't,"" yelled my father over the loud, heartwarming sound of the engine starting up for the umpteenth time that year. I loved that sound. It's my second favorite sound. The vibrations rattling my legs as it races away with my father driving. I could wait for my turn. After a few rides and some minutes, my father said the words I thought he'd never say, ""Alright, it's your turn."" I looked at him, then at the truck. Wow, does he look small next to that truck. I ran as fast as I could down to the pit. I climbed onto the tire's rim, then to the top of the tire, and into the cab. ""Vroom, vroom, let's go!"" Oh yeah! This felt right. I couldn't go fast, but I almost tipped it over. So that's a good thing. So all in all, patience goes a long way."
319	18193	7	3	I donít have much patience, but Iíll tell you a story about a time that I did. It was a sunny day outside and it was after school and I had no homework. So I invited my friends over and we were going to landslide skate park. We were all at my home but @CAPS1 wasnít. My mom said, ì@CAPS2 he's not here in two minutes we have to go without him.î So I was mad, I was writing a note to put on the door that reads, ì@CAPS1, we had to go without you because you were late! Sorry, be on time next time. -@CAPS4î. But when I was signing the note, he pulled up. That was the story when I had patience.
320	18194	7	3	One time in May, I was taking a test called the SAT. Me and my friends arrived early to the testing center, so we had to be patient. We had limited choices of what to do while waiting, but we tried to stay calm. Being patient can be challenging, as time seems to pass slowly even though only a few minutes have gone by. I remember a time when my dad and I were heading to work in the city. The bus was delayed by 15 minutes, but it felt like an eternity. Patience can have both positive and negative outcomes. It can be rewarding, like when a sports team finally scores a goal after the audience patiently waits. On the other hand, it can be frustrating, such as when you're stuck in traffic or waiting for public transportation. Finding ways to distract yourself while being patient, like chatting with a friend or playing a game, can help pass the time. Overall, patience requires mental peace and can lead to both positive and negative experiences.
321	18195	7	3	When I was around the age of 11, I went to California with my grandpa, grandma, mom, and dad for a family reunion. We made numerous stops along the way, which made me feel impatient because I just wanted to reach our destination and see everything. Despite the excitement, I was also a bit sad because we had to leave our dog at home for the week. The long car ride was tiring, and I couldn't wait to get to the hotel to rest. The journey took us hours, and I grew restless sitting in the car. I tried to entertain myself with my gadgets, but eventually, I just wanted to get to the hotel and sleep. Meeting relatives I hardly knew and listening to their conversations only added to my impatience. However, the trip was still enjoyable as I got to see new places on the way there. In the end, although I lacked patience during the journey, it was all worth it for the memorable time spent with family.
322	18196	7	3	"I was patient this one time while waiting to get on the computers and I told my mom to wake me if she gets over the computer. After an hour, I fell asleep, and when I woke up, my brother had been on for three hours reading manga we already have. Just when I thought it was finally my turn, my dad kicked me off to check his email, promising he would be off soon. However, he ended up spending the rest of the day, and a bit of the next day, watching ""Indiana Jones"" for six hours. This was surprising considering he already spends eight hours connected to the internet for work. Adding another six hours of personal internet use daily, his total time online amounted to a significant portion of each day."
323	18197	7	3	There was this guy that I liked a lot that I finally had the courage to ask out after years and weeks. He said yes to go to the dance with me but no to going out. So a little while later like a week later I asked him again. He told me give him till the end of the week. So I waited and waited and on and on it seemed like forever. Then my friend just couldn't take it she asked him on a date and he said yes! A million yes, joy came from his mouth. Then after getting to know me better he broke up with me. We have been fighting ever since, but were still besties!
324	18198	7	3	Being patient is hard, but it is an important quality to have in various situations. Whether waiting in line or dealing with people, patience is key. I learned the value of patience at a young age when I had to wait for my turn at an amusement park. Despite feeling sad and antsy, I listened to my mom's advice to be patient. In the end, my patience paid off as I was rewarded with a delicious smoothie for my good behavior. Patience may be challenging, but the rewards of staying calm and composed are worth it in the end.
325	18200	7	3	Last year, during a routine check-up, the doctor found that the glands in my neck were swollen. This led to further tests to check for thyroid issues, which would require lifelong medication. After getting my blood checked, the anxious wait for the results was nerve-wracking. Finally, the call came and it was a huge relief to hear that everything was normal. The experience taught me the importance of patience and trust in the face of uncertainty.
326	18201	7	3	"""When do we get the Xbox?"" I asked @CAPS1. ""@CAPS2 hours,"" he replied. ""Great!"" I exclaimed. ""Yes,"" he confirmed. Two hours seemed like an eternity. I decided to pass the time by using the computer, but after ten minutes, I grew bored and abandoned the screen. I checked the TV guide for something to watch, but nothing caught my eye. Fatigue started to set in, and I realized I must have overexerted myself earlier. I drifted off to sleep, only to wake up with four hours remaining. I tried the TV again, flipping through channels until a show caught my attention. The black and white crime drama was surprisingly engaging. As I watched, time seemed to fly by. Suddenly, I heard the front door open, signaling @CAPS1's return with the long-awaited Xbox. ""We got it!"" he announced excitedly. Overwhelmed with happiness, I managed to mumble a grateful ""Thank you"" before drifting off to sleep once more. ""@CAPS15, wake him up,"" @CAPS1 whispered, ensuring I could fully enjoy our new gaming console."
327	18202	7	3	One time my brother @PERSON1 was patient. Patience is being understanding and lisksent through difficultis without complaining. Our family lived in @LOCATION1 and were going to cedar point on vacation. We had fun all day end at @NUM1 we went on @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 went on the blue @ORGANIZATION1 while the rest of the family went on the red. The blue keeps you up at the top for @NUM2 and drops you while the red one shoots you up to @NUM3 feet. The line for the red @ORGANIZATION1 was shorter than the blue one so we got to go on first. Once the ride was over @PERSON1 was already at the top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1. We heard a loud sound that ment the blue @ORGANIZATION1 cast was coming down. But the blue cast wasnít coming down. @PERSON1 was stuck at the top, @NUM4 feet in the air. @PERSON1 got a birdís eye  of the park. I would have been scared if I were @PERSON1. At @NUM5 the ride lights came on and the cast plummed down. Finally,, he got a ride. Each ride got free season passes to cedar point. This is a time when @PERSON1 needed to show patience.  After a nerve-wracking experience, @PERSON1 exhibited remarkable patience while being stuck at the top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1. His calm demeanor and understanding nature eventually led to a positive outcome, earning him and the family free season passes to cedar point. It's a lesson in patience and perseverance, showing that staying composed during challenging times can lead to unexpected rewards.
328	18203	7	3	On @DATE1 we went to the doller tree I want to go to the game stop. But I was patient then we went to the game stop. After patiently waiting, we finally made our way to Game Stop to explore the exciting range of games and accessories they had to offer.
329	18205	7	3	"In the beginning, I woke up from sleeping and felt real sick. I took a shower and put on my clothes. I told my dad, ""Can I go to the doctor because I feel sick?"" he said, ""We will leave at 9 am,"" and it was 8 am. Then, I had to wait on the couch while my brothers, my dad, and my mom were taking showers. After that, I wanted to yell and complain because they were going too slow and trying to look beautiful. I didn't. When they finished, they had to look for the keys until they found it. It was 9 am, and my dad's favorite music was on so we stayed and watched the whole movie. In the middle, it was 10 am, and then we went to the doctor and had to wait for everyone to take their turn until it was 11, which was our turn. We actually made an appointment. They checked what was bothering me, and it was nothing. I left and still waited until my brothers finished. In the end, I was pissed off because I had to wait for them to get in the car. My dad said, ""Are you happy? You said that you feel sick, and there is nothing wrong with you."" We went home thinking that I had been patient for the whole day. I was saying to myself, ""I learned my lesson, and it is if you are patient, the day can go fast."""
330	18206	7	3	Over the weekend I went to New York City, New York to visit my aunt Sarah. She got up early and drove to JFK Airport. It was the first time I was going to go on a plane. My dad said I better have patience or else the ride was going to be boring. My sister and I got on the plane and flew to Miami, Florida, and it took 2 hours, which was easy. But then we got on another plane and went directly to Los Angeles, California, and that took 5 hours. It was a very long ride but I had patience. However, my sister didn't have any patience at all; the whole ride she was asking when we were going to get there. And that was the time I had patience.
331	18207	7	3	We finally arrived at the campsite after a long car ride. While waiting for everyone to get organized, I tried to relax and entertain myself with a quick game on my phone. The journey had been tiring, but I knew that patience was key. As we set up camp, I faced more challenges like running out of gas and unexpected delays. Despite feeling exhausted, I stayed calm and focused on the tasks at hand. When the kids wanted to explore the park, I mustered up the energy to accompany them, even though I was tired. In the end, being patient and staying positive helped us overcome the obstacles and enjoy a well-deserved rest at the campsite.
332	18208	7	3	"I was patient when I was going to Cedar Point. We took a bus and it took seven hours. So my friend decided to watch movies on the way. We watched ""Street Dreams"" and ""The Incredibles."" We were still a long way from Cedar Point. We decided to call my mom for a prank call. It was hilarious, so we did it again. Then we took turns napping and watching the big open road. Eventually, we both fell asleep. When we woke up, we were there. This is the time I waited patiently. Because I waited patiently then, I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting. Now I can wait longer. This helped in my future."
333	18209	7	3	I was patient during the meap. I was patient because I was done early and a lot of people were not done yet. When I get done early I like to draw or do some of my work but I didnt have any work so I new then when every one got done we waited for @NUM1 min then we start the meap again when I got done with that noone else was done so I waited for @NUM2 or @NUM3 min then every one was done then we stretched walked around for @NUM4 min then we sit back down and start the part @NUM5 when we are done we get to do work I am usually the first one done. Then when I get done with the test I get up and walk around so I can get @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 on my tests like meap test because it is so important to get good grades and when you are patient you will find out to get good grades like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. After finishing early and waiting for others to complete the test, I make sure to utilize my time wisely by focusing on getting good grades and maintaining a positive attitude towards my work. Patience and perseverance are key in achieving success in academics.
334	18210	7	3	On my last trip to @CAPS1, I made a horrible mistake by waiting in line for @NUM1 hours to ride the mantis. It was a true test of patience, especially with the technical difficulties the mist fans were experiencing on that scorching @NUM2-degree day. Despite the challenging conditions, I found solace in the shade that provided some relief from the intense heat. Reminding myself that I would eventually reach the ride helped me stay calm, but time seemed to drag on as half an hour felt like @NUM4 hours in the sweltering weather.  However, as the mist fans started working again after @NUM5 hours of waiting, my patience paid off. It was a reminder that patience can bring about good luck. The remaining time in line passed quicker than I had anticipated, and before I knew it, I was boarding the ride. The sense of relief and satisfaction I felt after completing the ride made me realize that patience truly is the key to success, even in the most challenging situations.
335	18211	7	3	One day a man named @PERSON1 had a doctorís appointment and overslept; when @PERSON1 got out of bed he saw that he was late for his doctorís appointment. As @PERSON1 got out of bed, he rushed to the bathroom to take a quick shower. Unfortunately, he realized it was getting late, so he didn't have time to wash up or brush his teeth. In a hurry, he grabbed a piece of gum on the way out the door.   @PERSON1 finally arrived at the doctor's office and was surprised to see a crowded waiting room. He checked in and sat down, feeling frustrated at the long wait. However, he reminded himself to be patient and tried to pass the time by playing with his phone and various apps he had downloaded. Hours went by, and @PERSON1 was the last person waiting.  When his name was finally called, @PERSON1 entered the examination room with a few pieces of gum in his mouth. After his appointment, he rushed back home, quickly showered, and brushed his teeth before finally getting into bed and falling asleep. It had been a long and tiring day, but @PERSON1 was relieved to have finally completed his doctor's visit and could rest easy.
336	18212	7	3	Patience continues to elude me, presenting a constant challenge in various aspects of my life. The struggle to wait for things to unfold is a constant battle, especially evident during school hours. The minutes seem to drag on endlessly as I find myself constantly checking the clock, eagerly anticipating the end of class. This impatience often leads me to rush through tasks, perhaps missing out on the process itself. Despite my desire to cultivate patience, my curiosity about what lies beyond the waiting period always seems to get the best of me. As much as I aspire to improve in this area, the journey towards patience appears to be a long and arduous one, with no immediate resolution in sight.
337	18213	7	3	Patience is very important at my house. My mother always says you have to be able to patient to succeed in anything. One time I was at home on the computer. I was surfing the web and enjoying it. My mom yelled across the house for me to come see her. I got out of my chair. Walked through the kitchen, through the hallway and into her bedroom. She said that she had to go to the grocery store to get some groceries. She was wondering if I wanted to go with her. I said no and asked her if she would make me a sandwich. She replied yes and left. While she was gone I cleared my room, folded laundry, and watched television. It was about noon and she still wasnít home. I was very hungry and beginning to become worried about her. I was tempted to call her but then I remembered what she always says, be patient to succeed. About a half an hour later she got home. She had bought me some lunch meat so I could make a sandwich. While I was eating, she told me she was proud of me on how patient I was while she was gone. I think patience is very important. I also think everyone could use a little more of it. In conclusion, practicing patience not only helps us succeed but also shows our loved ones that we value their time and efforts.
338	18215	7	3	Patients, in my own words, refer to individuals who are willing to wait patiently when necessary. This quality is particularly valuable in situations like enduring traffic jams or long queues. It is the ability to remain calm and composed while waiting for one's turn or for a desired item to become available. Patience is about being able to tolerate delays and setbacks without becoming agitated. It is an essential trait that allows individuals to navigate through various challenges and uncertainties with grace and resilience. Ultimately, practicing patience can lead to a more peaceful and fulfilling life.
339	18217	7	3	I am going to tell you about a time I was impatient. I had been working everyday in the @DATE1. I was trying to do the best I could to make make money. I was saving up to by a three hundred dollar bow, a firty dollar target, forty dollar broadbands, and other hunting accessories. I was finding myself to get more impatient everyday. Slowly I was getting tired of working, bored of saving money, and tempted to spend it. Finally I saved up enough money. I bought my stuff. I practiced all day long. Soon I became more accurate. I was ready to go hunting. The first night I was out I passed up a doe at eight yards. I havenít had anything close enough to shoot since then.   After saving up for so long and diligently practicing with my new equipment, I was eager to go hunting. However, despite my efforts, I have not had a good opportunity to take a shot since passing up a doe at eight yards. This experience has taught me the importance of patience and perseverance in hunting, and I am now working on honing my skills further to make the most of any future opportunities that come my way.
340	18218	7	3	One time when I was patient was when the flu shot clinic was happening. I had to go to a specific location to receive the flu shot. Upon arrival, I noticed that the line was extremely long. Despite the wait, I remained patient as I knew it was necessary to protect my health. To make the wait more bearable, we brought chairs, hot cocoa, and other items to keep us comfortable. The line seemed never-ending, especially since most of it was outside in the cold evening. Finally, when we entered the building, I felt relieved. After waiting for about three hours, we reached the front of the line. I was grateful that I wouldn't have to endure such a long wait for a flu shot again.
341	18219	7	3	I was patient with my game even though it took too long, but I finally got my big truck. It made me mad at first, but then my mom came up with a solution. She hinted that I could earn money by doing chores, so she bought me the truck for my house. She took the time to explain it in her own way, and I became more patient. I was excited to go to lunch, and I got a good lunch. I went to my friend's house for lunch, and I didn't have to wait long. After a few hours, we finally had lunch, and I was happy. I was patient while waiting for the test, and when it was finally time for lunch, I was relieved. We went to lunch together, and the food was great. I was so happy that I couldn't have asked for a better meal. I enjoyed every bit of it and even drank my milk. I was grateful for my mom's patience and for making everything so enjoyable.
342	18220	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was at basketball practice. It didnít happen until the end. no one knew that this was going to happen. It just happened out of nowhere. I hit the wall. I had an accident. We were running suicides. I was running to fast and I couldnít stop. I went head-first into the wall. It was a brick wall too. I didnít panic because I knew I had to be patient. I had to wait on a lot of things. I had to wait on an ambulance, which took a long time. I had to wait on a doctor to give me stitches which didnít take long. Lastly I had to wait on the doctor to give me the discharge papers. It happened here at @ORGANIZATION1 . We were in the gym for basketball practice. It was in the @DATE1 but I cant remember the exact date. I was also in the sixth grade. It happened because I couldnít stop in time. When I hit my head it didnít hurt. When I got my stitches some parts hurted. When they took them out it didnít hurt. But I had massive headache. I was glad when everything was over. I was grateful for the medical help I received and for the support of my teammates during that challenging time.
343	18221	7	3	I am a very patient person. An example are games. For some games you have to wait weeks, or months. For others you might have to wait years. I have done this before.  In the gaming world, patience is truly a virtue. Whether it's eagerly anticipating the release of a highly-anticipated game, waiting for a new update or expansion pack, or simply grinding through difficult levels to progress in the game, patience plays a crucial role in the gaming experience.  Waiting weeks, months, or even years for a game to be released can be a test of patience. The excitement and anticipation build up over time, but the eventual satisfaction of finally being able to play the game makes the wait worthwhile. I have found myself counting down the days until a game's release, eagerly devouring every piece of information and gameplay footage available to tide me over until I can finally get my hands on it.  Even after a game is released, patience continues to be a valuable quality. Some games require players to invest significant time and effort to progress, whether it's mastering difficult gameplay mechanics, completing challenging quests, or waiting for resources to accumulate. It can be frustrating at times, but the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when overcoming these obstacles is incredibly rewarding.  Overall, being patient in the world of gaming has taught me the value of perseverance, determination, and delayed gratification. It has allowed me to fully appreciate the gaming experience, savoring every moment and enjoying the journey as much as the destination. Patience truly is a virtue, both in games and in life.
344	18222	7	3	"I have had to be patient many times in my life. One that I can remember was waiting in a long line for the opening of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 for this @DATE1. The line must have had at least @NUM1 people. This is one of the largest apple orchards in the area I lived in. It was my first time going, but my sister had gone before, countless times. She said that it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to. She brought a friend with her also. Her name is @PERSON1. The opening was going to be at @TIME1, and it was only @NUM2, the line still growing behind us. My heart was pumping faster and faster. I glanced at my watch almost every @NUM3 seconds. Time seemed to forget to keep ticking. Finally, it was @NUM4. That was when we heard an announcement. Beep! ""Ladies and gentlemen! I am sad to announce that we will be opening up @CAPS3 @CAPS6 in @NUM3 more minutes. I'm sorry. Thanks for your cooperation."" I heard everyone in the line groan. A lot of people just left to come back tomorrow. Andrew, @PERSON1, and I just sat down to wait it out. Then finally, we heard one last announcement. Beep! ""Once again! Are you ready for some @CAPS3? Then come on in! It's time for @CAPS3 @CAPS9!"" That was my story of being patient. And it was definitely worth the wait."
345	18223	7	3	Waiting for my child was the longest 9 hours of my life. I had been in the waiting room for nearly the whole time. The nurses kept giving me updates, to calm me, to no avail. So I lit up a smoke to ease my nerves. I didnít know if my wife, or our baby would live. Would it live happy? I just took a puff of smoke, and waited for hours I sat, shutting out the rest of the world to shield my own thoughts. Would it be picked on? I sat, ignoring the nurses pleading, trying to reassure me. Would it shut life out? I sat, waiting for my newborn child. My silence was broken, by a baby crying. I rushed over to my wifeís room, to find her holding a beautiful baby girl. ìTook you long enoughî.
346	18225	7	3	I remember a time when my family went to an amusement park and we were in line to go on the biggest coaster, Shiver Me Timbers. As we waited in line, a kid cut in front of my friend and me. I calmly pointed out the line to the kid, who then went to the back of the line that had just gotten longer. The kids around us were getting impatient and started screaming. Eventually, after waiting for an hour, the ride was fixed, and we were able to get on. The ride was thrilling as we went up the hills and zoomed down at high speeds. Despite the long wait and unexpected delays, I managed to stay patient throughout the entire experience.
347	18226	7	3	We were driving to my uncle's new house in @LOCATION1, which was over a ten-hour drive. Excitement filled me despite the long journey ahead. Waking up early at six thirty a.m., I felt groggy as we hurried to pack our essentials for the trip. Despite the delay, we eventually hit the road around seven thirty a.m.  An hour into the drive, I dozed off in the back seat, only to wake up at a stop an hour later. Watching a movie with my brother on our portable DVD player helped pass the time as we continued our journey. Patience was key as I napped intermittently, knowing we had a long way to go.  Arriving at my uncle's house on @DATE1, nestled in the mountains, was a delight. Exploring the town with my family, we visited local stores and enjoyed quality time with my uncle and aunt. The trip, although tiring, was rewarding, and my patience paid off as I cherished the moments spent with loved ones in a new and exciting place.
348	18227	7	3	A time I was patient was when my family went to @CAPS1.I. adventures and we all wanted to go on the leaver water slide, the biggest water slide there. It had the longest line, which made a swirl, and my family was at the end of the swirl. It was early morning when we finally got in line for the slide. Half an hour passed when my mom left, followed by my older brother. Then, after another half an hour, the ride was shut down for two hours due to an accident. When it reopened, only my dad and I were left in line. Just as we were next in line, my dad got scared and left, leaving me to ride with an old man. Despite the long wait, I was thrilled to finally get on the slide. It was a test of patience, but in the end, it was worth it for the exhilarating experience.
349	18228	7	3	Patience is a crucial skill that can lead to success in various aspects of life. In school, patience is essential as some tasks require time and effort to complete. In strategic games like chess or checkers, being patient allows one to carefully plan their moves while waiting for the opponent to make a move. Patience is also about waiting for the right moment, whether it's eagerly anticipating Christmas morning or patiently waiting to open birthday presents. Overall, cultivating patience can greatly benefit individuals in navigating through challenges and achieving their goals.
350	18229	7	3	"""Come on, let's get going to Fun Point!"" exclaimed the excited family. They quickly packed their bags and loaded up the car for their long-awaited vacation. As they hit the road, the kids couldn't contain their excitement, but the long drive ahead tested their patience.  ""How long until we get there?"" asked the older sister after a few hours on the road. ""About six more hours,"" replied their parent. Despite the initial enthusiasm, the hours dragged on, and the constant questioning of ""Are we there yet?"" from the younger sister started to wear on everyone's nerves.  After enduring hours of waiting in line for their favorite ride at Fun Point, the younger sister reached her breaking point and declared she was done with the wait. Disappointed but understanding, the family decided to head back to the car and continue their adventure elsewhere.  Reflecting on the day's events, the parent reminded the younger sister that a little patience can lead to great fun. As they drove off to explore other attractions, the family knew that with a little patience, they could make the most of their vacation together."
351	18230	7	3	"One day @PERSON1's mom, ""@CAPS1"" decided to go shopping and @PERSON1 desperately wanted to go. But his mom kept saying @CAPS2. So @PERSON1 begged and begged until his mom finally said, ""Fine, but you can't complain."" So @PERSON1 went shopping with his mom. When they arrived at the store, @PERSON1 quickly grew bored and started asking to leave. His mom reminded him of their agreement and told him to be patient. @PERSON1 continued to complain, but his mom made a deal with him - if he could be good for 10 more minutes, they would go to the ice cream place.  For the next 10 minutes, @PERSON1 tested his mom's patience by constantly asking to leave. Finally, they left the store and got into the car. As they drove past the ice cream place, @PERSON1 realized they were not stopping. When he questioned his mom, she reminded him that he had broken their deal by complaining and not being patient. @PERSON1 learned an important lesson that day - patience is a virtue that he needed to learn."
352	18231	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I took the CAPS test in 6th grade. In my class, there were only 12 6th graders while the rest were 7th graders, so we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take a writing part, which was hard and time-consuming. Some people rushed to finish as quickly as possible, but I took my time to plan out what I wanted to write about. I utilized the ample time we were given to ensure that my writing was well-thought-out and polished. After completing the writing section, I carefully reviewed my work to check for any mistakes. With plenty of time remaining, I patiently waited for everyone else to finish by reading a book. This experience taught me the importance of being patient with myself and taking the time to thoroughly review my work.
353	18232	7	3	Patients is everything, ever hear these words! When you waiting in line for a test food restaurant, or when you stuck in a traffic. Youíre annoyed and angry, but then those words come to your mind. ìpatient is everything,î one time I was waiting in the longer line ever waiting to see the ordering counter! I was in a rush, I had a class I had to get to in five minutes. When I could we the counter I saw the empeloyees rushing around trying tralicly to get all the orders. Then I saw the reason of the holdap. There was an old man at the front of the line trying to despreately order. I didnít blame him, wich all those choices, he didnít know what to pick, the lost of the line wasnít as patient, ìharry up.î One said ìcome on.î @CAPS1 another I just waited patiently thinking, the line wasnít really being fair. I suggested a choice for him and he ordered. Sure, I way @NUM1 minutes late for my class but I was patient and understanding towards the old man, what comes around goes around they say, rest of the day I felt good about my good deed. It's essential to remember that being patient and kind can make a significant impact on someone else's day, even if it means inconveniencing yourself momentarily.
354	18233	7	3	Are you always or even sometimes patient? If not, you're not alone. But everyone should strive to be patient, as it can make things easier in the long run. For example, if your brother is using the bathroom when you need it, being patient and waiting for him to finish can prevent arguments. It may not always be easy, but we should all make an effort to practice patience in our daily lives.

356	18235	7	3	Im not a very patient person so im going to be wrighting about what patience @CAPS6. Patience @CAPS6 when you donít complain when your board or waiting for somthing. For example (for your convenance I @CAPS1 be wrighting a story about patience, please take to note that this story @CAPS6 completely untrue) @CAPS1 was walking home and saw an elderly woman, she was having trouble with her grocerys. @CAPS1 wanted to help her but all he was thinking about was his cousin @CAPS2 that @CAPS4 be arriving at his house any moment now. @CAPS1 walked up to the woman and asked if she needed help and she replied ìif you could I live over @CAPS3î she pointed to a large tan house. @CAPS1 carried her things to the door. ì@CAPS3 you go,î he said. ì@CAPS4 you mind helping me put them awayî the woman asked. @CAPS1 thought about how his mother never wanted him to go into a strangers house, but @CAPS1 sort of knew her, so he said that he @CAPS4 help the woman smile. @CAPS1 then picked up the bags and said, ì@CAPS6 your home unlockedî ì@CAPS7 its notî she replied, where are your keysî @CAPS1 asked, ìI beleve there lost somwere in the lawn. @CAPS1 searched for about a half hour, then he found them under a bush.

This was my example of patience, if this ever happens to you make sure your patient and know the person.  Expanding on the story, it is evident that patience can lead to positive outcomes in various situations. By being patient and assisting the elderly woman with her groceries, @CAPS1 not only helped her but also felt a sense of fulfillment and kindness. Patience allowed him to stay calm and focused, ultimately resulting in a rewarding experience. Therefore, it is important to practice patience in our daily interactions, as it can lead to meaningful connections and acts of kindness.
357	18236	7	3	One day, when we were coming home from a movie, our train was unexpectedly stopped. It seemed like there was only one train on the track, but then a very large obstacle appeared. We sat in the car for at least 15 minutes, waiting for the train to move, but there were no signs of it ending. Suddenly, the train came to a halt, completely stopping in its tracks. We thought about turning around, but the cars behind us were blocking any escape route. After about 20 minutes, the train slowly started moving again, and within 30 minutes, it had finally ended. Once the barriers went up, we started driving, only to encounter another oncoming train. My dad quickly maneuvered the car out of harm's way, and after a patient wait of almost an hour, we were finally able to continue on our journey. Despite the delay, we remained patient, knowing that eventually, the situation would come to an end.
358	18237	7	3	When we drive to our destination, I have to be patient. The long hours spent in the car can be challenging, but I find ways to entertain myself. I make sure to pack a car bag with items like a book, pen and paper, my dad's laptop, and my iPod to pass the time. The journey may be tiring, and my legs may get restless, but the end result is always worth it. Being patient and finding ways to stay occupied help make the trip more enjoyable. In the end, the destination makes all the waiting worthwhile.
359	18238	7	3	One day at my school, during lunchtime, I found myself feeling incredibly hungry. As I stood in line with my classmates, the noise of chatter and laughter filled the cafeteria. My stomach growled loudly, reminding me of my empty belly. Despite the temptation to cut the line and satisfy my hunger sooner, I chose to wait patiently like everyone else. Time seemed to drag on, and every minute felt like an eternity as I waited for my turn to get food.   After what felt like an hour, I noticed that the line was moving faster. My anticipation grew as I inched closer to the front. Finally, I reached the serving counter and received my food. I hurriedly made my way to a table and began to eat, savoring each bite despite the limited time I had for recess afterward. Although my break was short, I was grateful for the opportunity to satisfy my hunger and recharge for the rest of the school day. Waiting patiently had paid off, and I was able to enjoy my meal before returning to my studies.
360	18239	7	3	I know someone that was patient. The person was at the doctors she was savifly six and she still waited. They can fix that problem by asking nicely can I go ahead of you plezz. That will solve every thing in a kind and respetful way. That is what I think respectful way. Sometimes, a simple and polite request can make a big difference in resolving situations where patience is required.
361	18240	7	3	I remember a time when I was six, waiting in the walk-in clinic for almost two hours. I asked them to change the channel to my favorite show, and after it was over, I fell asleep on the couch. It felt like forever before they called my name, but my mom said I was really patient. The nurse even gave me a lollipop for being so patient. After that, I went home and went straight to bed. That was the day I learned the importance of being patient for two hours at the clinic.
362	18241	7	3	Someone else I know who is incredibly patient is my mom. She exhibited remarkable patience one particular day when my siblings and I were being particularly difficult. On our way to church, my brother and I started arguing for no reason, while my younger brother and sister were incessantly bickering and shouting at each other over trivial matters. Once we arrived at church, my three-year-old brother began running around and causing a ruckus, while my older brother continued to taunt my sister, and I was preoccupied chatting with friends. Despite the chaos, my mom remained calm and composed throughout. After church, she simply reminded us to behave, and we realized the error of our ways and decided to listen to her. My mom's unwavering patience in the face of our unruly behavior truly left an impression on me, as I doubt I could have shown the same level of composure in her shoes.
363	18242	7	3	One day at the fair, I was patient as I waited in line for the bumper cars. With a few people ahead of me, I knew it would take some time. Finally, after waiting for my turn, I decided to join my friends and let a few others go ahead. After a short wait, we hopped into our chosen cars and had a blast. This experience taught me the value of patience and how it can lead to enjoyable moments.
364	18243	7	3	During the @DATE1, my mom broke her wrist while we were riding our bikes down a trail. At the end of the trail mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handle bars. I didnít know her had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me I froze, no one has ever had a broken bone in my family before so I didnít know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car mom didnít say anything like how much pain she was in or anything. When we got to the car I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now to those who donít know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in a backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in alot of pain, and the bikes wonít go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since Iím not to yet she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didnít once complain or whine about the pain she was in. she didnít yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car. While I was pretty much about to hyper ventalate right there and then. She was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldnít have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I wouldíve been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me. Iím amazed at my momís understanding and tolerance. I hope I can achieve that too.  In times of crisis, my mom's strength and composure shone through, guiding me through a difficult situation with grace and fortitude. Her ability to remain calm and collected, even in the face of pain and uncertainty, inspired me to strive for the same level of resilience and understanding. I am truly grateful for her unwavering support and guidance, and I hope to one day embody her remarkable qualities in my own life.

My mom brought me to the doctors so I could get my flue shots like every other year when we got in the car to go I kept saying ëído we really have to goíí of  course my mom said yes. Once we got there we had to wait a little bit my mom had to get the papers so I just standed there and watched the fish swim around then my mom said ëílets go in the waiting roomíí. After that she said I had been very patient for waiting except for in the car when I was whinning. So I said thanks and when are we going to get in there. Then when we finally get in there I had to be weighed and be asked all these questions the the nurse came in and gave me these shots in my left arm she said you are like almost the only one of are kid patients that has it been patient. And that is the story of when I was patient.
366	18245	7	3	Some people are patient. Others are not. Some have short attention spans. Patience is a person who is understanding and tolerant. They experience difficulties without complaining. Some people have problems sitting still or waiting for something. They are not patient. There is a saying that goes, patience is a virtue. Many have heard of that. Patience is waiting for hours in line to see a movie and not having to move around. Patience isn't pacing back and forth. Being patient in problems is fine. It is important to cultivate patience in our daily lives to navigate challenges with grace and composure.

367	18246	7	3	On that day, my family and I took a trip to the airport for our flight to our destination. However, we faced a long wait due to a delay caused by a thunderstorm. Time seemed to drag on as we waited for updates on our flight status. Despite my hunger, my request for money to buy breakfast was denied by my mom. Frustrations grew as the delay continued, and even my attempt to use my phone was thwarted by a dead battery. Eventually, after an agonizing hour, the storm cleared, and we were finally able to board the plane. This experience made me realize that patience is not one of my strong suits.
368	18247	7	3	This is a story about patience. One day, my friend mentioned the importance of being patient, which made me realize that I had never really been patient in my life. As we were discussing a new game coming out, I found myself interrupting him and not listening properly. This behavior led to arguments and misunderstandings between us. However, another friend intervened and expressed their frustration with our constant bickering. They urged us to stop fighting and try to listen to each other more attentively. The following day, I decided to change my approach and genuinely listen to what my friend had to say. By doing so, I understood the value of patience in communication and how it can strengthen friendships. I learned that by being patient and truly listening, we can elevate our relationships to a deeper level of understanding and respect.

So, while the importance of patience may be debated, its undeniable benefits make it a valuable trait to cultivate in our daily lives.
370	18249	7	3	When I think of being patient, I think about the time I went to Southrend for hockey. We were on the road for hours, but I didn't complain or ask how much longer. I was on a bus with my hockey friends, watching a hockey movie. Patience means waiting without constantly questioning when something will be done. It's something I struggle with, like when I want to use the computer or ride the four-wheeler. As we grow older, we learn to wait without getting stressed. Patience is essential in many aspects of life, even during tests. It's a skill that develops with time and experience.
371	18250	7	3	It all started on a cold and snowy day, there were only two days until Christmas! Christmas is my favorite time of year because you see all the lights that are the colors of the rainbow. Also, people are very happy around this time of year. I always become impatient waiting for Christmas to arrive. This year I was going to be patient.  I started being patient by going with my mom to buy a new light Christmas tree and to buy presents for my family. While we were shopping, there were all kinds of people in the store. When we got to the checkout line, there were a lot of people waiting. My mom told me to be patient, and so I did. When we finally got out of the store, we rushed home to start decorating. I put up the blow-up Santa Claus, which was taking a very long time, but I had to be patient.  Finally, it came to making the cookies, which was the best part. We cut the dough and put them into the oven. It was taking a long time for them to cook. My mom said to be as patient as I can. I was patient, and the cookies were eventually all frosted with sprinkles on them. With everything made and put up, we were ready for Christmas.  On Christmas day, everyone came over and had dinner with us, and got the presents I bought them. As everyone left, I walked to my room not remembering that it was Christmas night. When I woke up late and everyone was waiting for me, I got excited. I was patient, and it paid off. Christmas was a wonderful day filled with joy and happiness.
372	18251	7	3	Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. I was patient when I went to the DMV. When I went to the DMV, I had to wait in line. I didn't have to wait for that long, but I had to wait. I didn't like it, but I was patient. It was worth the wait. I also had to wait in line for food, as there were a lot of people in line. That was worth the wait too because the food was good. Practicing patience is a valuable life skill that can lead to positive outcomes in various situations.
373	18252	7	3	One time, my cousin was in a rush because she was going to the movies and then to a party. With a house full of kids, she had to quickly clean up before her mom came home. Despite trying to call her other family members for help, no one answered. In a hurry, she managed to clean up before her boyfriend arrived. After quickly taking a bath and getting the kids cleaned up, she left us to go get some food. While she was gone, we continued cleaning. When she returned with food, the house was spotless. However, her mom insisted she clean the bathroom before going out. Frustrated after a long day of being patient, she eventually cleaned the bathroom and was finally able to leave for the movie and party with her boyfriend.
374	18253	7	3	Patience is when someone is understanding and tolerant. Well Iím going to tell you about someone who is patience. My friend @PERSON1 is very patience person. @PERSON1 is understanding because when someone asks her wait she listens and waits. When her parents were talking, and when she was trying to tell them something they told her to wait because it is rude when you interrupt adults when there talking. @PERSON1 is a very patience person. She also shows tolerance when dealing with her younger siblings. When they make mistakes or take longer to understand something, she doesn't get frustrated but instead calmly helps them until they grasp the concept. Her ability to remain patient in challenging situations makes her a reliable and supportive friend to those around her.
375	18254	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my birthday was coming. I wanted my party to come sooner. But my parents kept saying no. When the party came I got all my presents except the ones from my parents. They said once everyone left they would give them to me. But no one left until ten. So I fell asleep. When I woke up, no one was up. So I still had to wait. My mum got up, and I asked if I could open my presents. She said to wait until your father gets up. Finally, when my dad got up, I was able to open my presents. It was worth the wait.
376	18255	7	3	I awoke at the sound of the alarm clock on a sort Monday morning. It was 7:00 AM and my mom was on time to get us ready for our errands. I was in a hurry to get going. Today was the day that the x-box Series X came out, and I was determined to get my hands on it. My mom had made a deal with me. If I was patient the whole time while we were running errands, I could get it.   An hour later, we arrived at the grocery store. I darted inside and grabbed a cart, eager to get through our shopping quickly. My mom reminded me once again that I needed to be patient. So, for the rest of the time, I followed my mom obediently and didn't show any signs of impatience.   After what seemed like hours, we were finally done with our grocery shopping and headed to the library. I knew I couldn't do anything there without getting in trouble, so I reluctantly sat on a bench and waited. It was already dark by the time we left the library and made our way to Best Buy to purchase the x-box Series X.   I was bursting with excitement as we got the x-box, and my mom praised me for being so patient throughout the day. I felt proud of myself for keeping my end of the deal. The x-box Series X was finally mine, and it was all thanks to my patience.

378	18257	7	3	Patients for me is hard but this is a time that I was patient. It was the first day of school, and it was the end of the day. At the end of the day there were volleyball tryouts. I wanted to try out but I didnít have my physical. So while everyone was playing volleyball me and two other people were sitting and watching for what felt like forever. I wasnít very patient then but at the end of the tryouts my mom came to pick me up and we went straight from there to the sports center doctors office. So me and my mom went in and she had to sign and fill out paperwork because she didnít make me an appointment. So that took about 10 minutes. Then we waited, and waited, and waited until an hour and 30 minutes had passed. I was patient but my mom definitely wasnít. So finally they called me in and they took my height and weight. Then they took me to the room my mom was in and we waited for another 10 minutes. Finally, they gave us the physical, and then we left. Practice ended at 6 pm and we didnít get home until 8 pm. That is a time I was patient.
379	18258	7	3	Once I was patient, I want to go they football with my dad but didnít want to. So when he was puting shoe on when I would ask him to come play football he would take his shone off. Then I had to wait two and a half hours just for him to get one shoe on. When he was putting the second shoe on, I didnít say anything so. We finally went and played football.

380	18259	7	3	A time when someone showed patience was my mom when I wrote on the wall. She was very mad at me, but then my sister confessed that she did it too. My mom listened to what we had to say with patience. She then told us that we were in a lot of trouble because we should have known better. Despite her anger, she remained patient with us. We had to clean everything for a week as punishment. My mom's patience in that situation showed us how someone can handle a difficult situation with grace and understanding.
381	18260	7	3	Patience is a sense of tolerance. Having patience means that you can wait, knowing that things will come to you in due time. It's like when you hurriedly consume your food fearing it will be taken away, when in reality, you could have left it there and it would still be waiting for you. Patience is about understanding that everything will be alright and that you have the time needed. It involves taking your time to do something, going at your own pace, and believing that you will eventually reach your goal. Patience also refers to how long you can wait to achieve something or endure a situation. For instance, dealing with a bully who constantly taunts you. It's about how much patience you can muster before reaching your breaking point and no longer being able to tolerate the situation. Patience is essential in various aspects of life, from waiting for opportunities to dealing with challenges, showcasing resilience and strength in the face of adversity.

383	18262	7	3	The time when I showed patience was when I was going down a waterslide. It all began when I was at a water park called Splashy Waves. I decided to go down a thrilling slide that could fit ten people at once. As I made my way up the stairs to the slide, a crowd of people rushed past me to go down the more popular slides. Despite the temptation to join the crowd, I patiently waited for my turn. After a few minutes, I finally got the chance to go on the fun slide. Even though I had to wait longer than expected, I remained calm and composed. This experience taught me the importance of being patient and waiting for the right moment.

Patience truly is a virtue that can bring about positive outcomes in various aspects of life."
386	18265	7	3	"@DATE1 one day, I was at the store with my sister and my mom, and there were people everywhere, bumping into each other and shouting ""get out of my way."" It was chaotic, and I could feel the frustration building in the air. As Christmas was approaching, the stress levels seemed to be heightened for everyone. Despite the chaos and noise, I realized the importance of remaining patient. We all just wanted to mind our own business and get what we needed, so there was no point in adding to the tension. Eventually, we managed to finish our shopping and head back home. This experience taught me the value of patience in such crowded and stressful situations. It's essential to stay calm and composed, even when others around you are not."
387	18266	7	3	One day me and my brother went hunting at @CAPS1 oaks. It was about a one and a half mile walk. When we got set up the hunt began. We waited but we didnít see anything but we werenít going to give up. So after an hour we saw a flok of turkeys wandering around like penguins. Their feathers started to lose their color. And as they walked closer the males beards were were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @NUM1 minurts they probably caught our sent and ran away. After that we knew the deer would not come out but we were wrong, about @NUM2 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shoting range. I was looking other places and I told my brother that their were deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw it to and only one of them were a deer. So we watched them as they came closer like  a storm getting closer and closer. So my brother drew back his bow. He held his bow back for over @NUM3 minutes he almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for it to turn around because his head was faceing the other way and right when it was in perfect view he shot. The arrow shot out like a bulet coming out of a gun. The arrow didnít hit him it went about @NUM4 foot away from the deer. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didnít see any so my brother and I cleaned up our blind. And we luged everything back to the car. When we got home everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didnít get one. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie.   Despite not catching any prey during the hunting trip, the experience of being out in nature and spending quality time with family made the day memorable.
388	18267	7	3	Patience is a valuable quality that can greatly benefit us in various situations in life. It can be the key to maintaining our composure and sanity, especially when faced with challenges or uncertainties. For instance, when a beloved pet like my dog goes missing, patience becomes essential as we wait for their return. In moments like these, there may be no other option but to wait patiently for a resolution. By practicing patience, we can navigate through difficult times with a sense of calm and resilience. So, when faced with circumstances beyond our control, remember that patience can be a powerful ally in helping us stay grounded and hopeful until things eventually fall into place.
389	18268	7	3	Building a house or completing a puzzle both require time, dedication, hard work, and patience. Puzzles, in particular, demand a significant amount of time and effort to finish. Without patience, it can be challenging to see a puzzle through to completion. Similarly, constructing a house is a labor-intensive process that necessitates perseverance and determination. When one lacks patience, the task at hand can become tedious and overwhelming. In both cases, having the patience to see the project through to the end is essential for success.
390	18269	7	3	My dad is a very patient person. Heís known to be patient. Here is an example, his camera. He waited a whole @NUM1 years just to get one lense for it. Because he was patient. My mom is very patient. My mom is patient too. She waited a whole month just for a pair of slippers, because she was patient. Iím proud to have such patient parent. Which means that I know they are very responsible and that is what I think patient is. Having patient parents has taught me the value of perseverance and responsibility in achieving goals.
391	18271	7	3	When my brother, my dad, and my two cousins got out of the car after the long drive from our home, we were filled with excitement knowing we were about to have a fantastic time. The view of roller coasters at Cedar Point amusement park was breathtaking. During the drive, we eagerly discussed all the thrilling rides we were looking forward to experiencing - the Maverick, Millennium Force, Top Thrill Dragster, Magnum XL-200, and the Mantis.   Upon entering the park, we were immediately drawn to the Top Thrill Dragster, but the line was dauntingly long, so we decided to come back to it later. Throughout the day, we managed to ride almost all of the roller coasters, each one more exhilarating than the last. When we reached the Magnum XL-200, we were disheartened to see a massive line with at least 3 hours of wait time, dashing our hopes of riding the tallest coaster in the park.  As we made our way to the Top Thrill Dragster once again, the line seemed even longer than before. After contemplating for a while, we decided to brave the wait. While standing in line, we struck up a conversation with a young man wearing a t-shirt featuring a tropical fish. Curious, my cousin asked him about the design, leading to a delightful conversation about his travels to a tropical destination.  Despite the long wait, the ride on the Top Thrill Dragster was absolutely worth it. This experience taught me the value of patience and how it can often lead to rewarding outcomes. By being patient and enduring the wait, we were able to enjoy an incredible ride that left us with unforgettable memories.
392	18272	7	3	One time I was patient was when I went to Florida with my young cousin. I had to babysit him while his parents packed up for their return trip to New York. My cousin can be quite a handful and always wants things his way. Despite this, I remained patient and waited until the trip was underway before expressing any complaints to my mother. Throughout our vacation, my cousin and I got into many arguments, but I still care for him deeply. I had to exercise a great deal of patience with him and sometimes give in to his demands, knowing that his mother would be proud of how I handled the situation. I recall one instance when we went for a walk to see alligators in a pond, but my cousin suddenly wanted to go to the park instead. Recognizing his young age and immaturity, I decided to go with the flow and took him to the park. This experience taught me the importance of patience and flexibility in dealing with difficult situations.
393	18273	7	3	The next day went by and I could not wait until Christmas morning. I waited patiently as the hours slowly passed. Finally, the moment arrived, and I rushed downstairs to find the door to the basement open. As I entered, I was greeted by the sight of my parents setting up the gifts, their faces filled with joy and excitement. I smiled, realizing that the giggling I had heard the day before was them preparing a surprise for us. In that moment, I understood the power of patience and how it can lead to wonderful moments of happiness and love. Patience truly is a gift that brings joy and fulfillment to both the giver and the receiver.
394	18275	7	3	@PERSON1 and her @CAPS1 went to the animal shelter and found the perfect dog for their family.

Max brought joy and companionship to their lives, showing @PERSON1 that good things come to those who wait and work for them. With Max by her side, @PERSON1 felt grateful for the lessons learned and the special bond they shared.
395	18276	7	3	The time I was patient was when my sister dropped my phone in kool-aid. I was going to get a new one, but it was depending on my behavior. That means I had to be extra good and patient. Everyday for the rest of that week I was good. I still didnít get a new phone so I asked my sister when she was going to buy it. Well since it was her fault, she offered to buy me a new one. She told me that it was coming and I had to be patient. Another week went by, and I was starting to become impatient, but I didnít. The next day my sister took me into the metro pcs store to pick out a new phone. See by being patient I finally got a new phone, and thatís the time I was patient.
396	18277	7	3	A time I had to be patient was when I went to a @ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient especially when it is all sold out. For example when I was waiting in line for a shirt the line was really long so I had to be patient. This took a lot of patience because the @ORGANIZATION1 was all sold out and there were only three booths with @CAPS1- shirts so I had to wait. At the @ORGANIZATION1 there were many ways we had to be patient like parking and getting to our seats. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 min break I went to get a pop and all the lines were long. I was waiting in line for about @NUM2 min waiting to get my pop and my cousin fries and a pop for my sister. I finally got everything and forgot my pop but luckily she gave me a new one just in case that wasn't mine. I went back, drank my pop, and watched the show. Everything takes patience and when you wait you get everything you need. This is a time I had to be patient. Additionally, I had to wait for the restroom during the intermission, and the line seemed never-ending, but I remained patient and eventually got my turn. Being patient in these situations is crucial for a smooth and enjoyable experience at @ORGANIZATION1.
397	18278	7	3	Being patient is like a jungle cat hunting its prey. It has to stay perfectly still to get its prey. The cat has to be patient too. Then after it gets into the right position, it pounces. The cat achieves its goal by being patient. Just like the jungle cat, patience is essential for success in many aspects of life. Whether it's waiting for the right opportunity to come along or persevering through challenges, patience is a valuable trait that can lead to great rewards. By maintaining composure and waiting for the right moment to act, we can increase our chances of reaching our goals and achieving success. So, remember, patience is not just a virtue; it is a powerful tool that can help us navigate through life's challenges and seize opportunities when they arise.
398	18279	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was at my dance audition. Every year at @ORGANIZATION1 grove college I audition to help pay for my classes. I was ready and pumped to go dance, there were about @NUM1 people in the dance room. I worked very hard when I left the audition. My teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money I got. Every day I waited at the mail box hoping my letter would come. A month had passed and I still didnít get anything. I started to get worried and I thought I wouldnít get anything. One day when I gave up all hope a letter came in the mail for me and said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1 and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started and my teacher told me that there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy and so was I. My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but donít give up because it will turn out alright in the end. I also learned that patience is good to learn at an early age, because when I get older a lot of things will get in my way, and I have to be patient so I can overcome all of them.
399	18280	7	3	One time I went to the doctors. The doctor said to wait in this room with my brother, sister, and mom. She said another doctor will come in. We waited three hours in that room. My mom was mad, they forgot about us. The doctor that was supposed to come in went in the wrong room. The worst part was I had to get three shots and I hate shots. In conclusion, I learned my mom is not that patient and I got ice cream after the doctors so patience always has a reward. After the ordeal, my mom took us for ice cream to cheer us up. I chose my favorite flavor, chocolate, and it made the whole experience a little better. It taught me that sometimes being patient pays off in unexpected ways.
400	18281	7	3	"There goes another 15 minutes wasted! I knew I should have gotten here earlier! Ugh! So many people and so little time! Have you ever had to wait forever for food? Three days ago, I thought that I should stop at my locker before going to lunch - big mistake! I slammed my grey coated locker and ran for the cafeteria. I sped past a sea of seventh graders eager to get to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my hamburger patty, ""what's the hold up?"" I thought. I finally reached my destination, the food area! I reached out and - wait, where's the food? The food trays were empty! The aroma of pizza enticed my senses and made my poor little stomach growl with anger! I angrily paced, ""where is the food?"" Finally, a lunch lady announced that she would have to make a new burger on a sub bun. I switched to the other line. I grabbed some chips and cheese with disappointment and put them on my plate. At least I had something to eat! I sat down at my table and another lunch lady came up to me and handed me a soft, squishy, warm chocolate chip cookie as a reward for my patience. ""I got a cookie! A warm, delicious treat,"" I thought. Sometimes waiting can be frustrating, but sometimes you get rewarded!"
401	18282	7	3	A time where I had to be patient was when I had to wait in the waiting room before I got my broken foot treated. My mom and I waited for about an hour and a half, which felt like a long time. Despite the boredom and the wait, we stayed put and waited for our turn. Finally, when the nurse called my name, I went in to see the doctor. However, even then, we had to wait for the doctor to arrive, which took another twenty minutes. The doctor asked me how I broke my foot, and after that, we had to wait for the nurse to come back and put a cast on my foot. The process of putting on the cast involved multiple layers of cloth and waiting for them to dry. Although it tested my patience, I realized that being patient is necessary in such situations. Eventually, the entire process was completed, and I was able to get the treatment I needed. Patience truly pays off in the end.
402	18283	7	3	One day not very long ago, my brother had homework troubles. And yes, it is a story about patience. My brother comes home with homework every night, mostly math. One day, he needed help and complained that the math homework was just too long for him to do. Despite it only being fifteen problems, my brother, who is in fifth grade, was struggling. I urged him to just do the homework, but he kept asking for help. Eventually, I decided to assist him, displaying a great deal of patience as he took an hour to complete the assignment. While he was occupied, I took the opportunity to copy down the problems, solve them, and hide the answer sheet. When he finished and only got two answers right, he was upset. However, I revealed the correct answers and helped him understand where he went wrong. In the end, my patience paid off, as he ended up receiving an A during student-led conferences. It goes to show that sometimes, a little patience can make all the difference in helping someone succeed.

404	18285	7	3	Patience is a very important value. To succeed, you need patience. I have used patience in my life when I got my first horse. I needed patience with her because she was stubborn, self-centered, and poorly trained. I had to teach her moves at a slow pace so she could remember how she was supposed to do it. I also needed patience for her because she had just moved to the present home and didn't recognize the surroundings. These though, are only some of the ways patience has appeared in my life.  When working with my horse, I had to stay calm and composed, even when she was being difficult. It took time and effort to build trust and understanding between us. I had to be patient with her progress, celebrating small victories along the way. It was a slow process, but eventually, my horse started to respond to my cues and became more cooperative.  Through this experience, I learned the true value of patience. It taught me the importance of perseverance and resilience in the face of challenges. Patience is not just about waiting; it's about having the strength and determination to keep going, even when things get tough.

At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all new to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be old enough to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Many good things can come out of just being patient.

I spent almost ten hours in a waiting room, seated on a very uncomfortable wooden chair with nothing to entertain me. Every two hours, my mom, grandma, grandpa, and I would step outside to the car to stretch our legs. Despite feeling incredibly tired after about four hours, I couldn't manage to fall asleep. The passage of time seemed distorted, as what felt like two hours turned out to be nine and a half. This experience marked the longest duration I had ever spent in one place. Initially, it was hard to grasp the fact that so much time had passed, but as the hours dragged on, the reality sunk in.

430	18312	7	3	Being patient means understanding and being tolerant. I have always tried to be patient, even when it came to fishing. Despite never having caught a fish before, I would sit by the water, watching as others around me reeled in their catches. I never complained or grew envious, even though it was disheartening to see everyone else succeeding while I struggled.  As the years passed, my patience was tested time and time again. Every time someone else caught a fish, I felt a pang of disappointment. But I persevered, believing in my father's words that my time would come. Finally, at the age of nine, I had my moment of triumph.  Attending a party at a friend's lakeside home, I found myself without a fishing rod of my own. Borrowing one from a kind boy, I cast my line into the water. Suddenly, a powerful tug nearly pulled me into the lake. With determination, I reeled in the line slowly, ensuring it wouldn't snap. And then, there it was - a fish, held high above my head in a victorious pose.  After years of patience and perseverance, I had finally reaped the rewards. It was a moment of pure joy and satisfaction, proving that sometimes, good things come to those who wait.

434	18319	7	3	"""Itís where?"" The woman asked for the third time. ""At the hall, to the left of the bathrooms,"" I replied, feeling like a broken record. Working for my dad's gift-shop company meant dealing with all kinds of people, and patience was key.  As I stood in the hallway directing people to the showroom, a middle-aged man approached me. He seemed surprised to see someone so young working for the company. I answered his questions politely, trying to keep my patience intact.

""Honey, get your bathing suit on, and some shorts, and get into the car,"" my mom shouted out the window. ""OK mom,"" I questioned. ""It's a surprise,"" she answered. So I did what she told me while wondering where we were going.   When we got there, I knew exactly where we were. Six Flags. I got out of the car with a huge grin on my face. ""We're going to go on the roller coaster, want to come?"" I asked my mom. ""Sure, sounds like fun,"" she replied.   When we got to the heart-throbbing roller coaster, I looked and saw that the line was all the way to the end of the sidewalk. ""Mom, I don't want to wait, it's too long of a line,"" I complained. ""Just be patient, sweety, we'll be on the coaster in no time,"" she replied.   One hour later, I was still waiting in line. ""Mom, it's taking forever,"" I whimpered. ""We are the next ones in line,"" she replied, still smiling.   Finally, when the gates opened, I was so excited and nervous. I couldn't believe that I waited an hour to get on one ride. ""You were very patient,"" my mom said with her hair sticking straight up. ""Yes, and I'm proud of that,"" I said to myself."
439	18325	7	3	One of the most patient times I have ever had was in downtown at one of the greatest places around, Poupules! As my dad, friend, and I waited at our table, we were very hungry. It had been 15 minutes since we ordered, but I stayed patient even though I was getting mad and hungry. Finally, our food came, and I was satisfied.
440	18326	7	3	"Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things. I got it all from my dad. Usually. I will get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out to her car. Sometimes we are leaving for dance, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone is making random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs so much I just want to scream ""stop talking"". Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen. It's just a lecture that gets repeated and I already know everything they are saying, so I don't have much patience for that. I can get very impatient sometimes, but I still have some in me, so if you stay on my good side, it won't wear them.  I know that impatience is something that I struggle with, but I am working on managing it better in my daily life. It's important to remember that everyone has their own struggles, and it's important to be patient and understanding with others as well. By being aware of my impatience and taking steps to improve it, I can create more positive and peaceful interactions with those around me."
441	18327	7	3	I am writing a story about a time that I was patient. One day on my birthday @DATE1 I was over my dads house. My dad asked me were do I want to go for my birthday. I didnít know at first but it came to my head. I told him I wanted to go paint hall shooting. And he said ok. But before we go he said can you cut the grass for me. I said ok. So I cut the grass which took me about @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes so I told him Iím done and he said ok, so I took a shower because I smelt like wet grass. And when I got done takns my shower I called my friends and cousins to see if they would to come and they said sure. So I asked my dad when are we going to leave to go pointball shooting. He told me it is going to be at a different day. So I called all of my friends and cousins back to tell them it wasnít going to be today. They were ok with it. And my dad said we were going to go before @DATE2 stars and we have went. And now until this day I am still being patient.  I have learned that sometimes patience is necessary, even when things don't go as planned. It's important to remain calm and understanding, as things may not always happen when we expect them to. Being patient can lead to positive outcomes and a sense of peace within oneself.
442	18329	7	3	There are many times in a person's life when someone was being patient. Patience is a very important trait that could lead to its own rewards. I am a dancer at a School of Dance. There is a very wide range in age in each dance class. Sometimes we have trouble learning something as hard as a switch leap or something as easy as a pirouette. Everyone in the class is so patient when these events happen. It may take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting so patiently. Patience also occurs while training a dog. Obviously, dogs don't speak English, so they are going to have trouble learning. Yelling at the dog is a sign of not being patient, which will not help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or correcting him gently, it is a sign of being under control and patient. Eventually, by taking up all that time to teach him the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because you were patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and comfortability to others. Not to mention, it is what is respectful. Like I said, being patient is a very important lesson to learn, and one should never forget it.
443	18330	7	3	@PERSON1 is waiting patiently while the class is talking. If the noise level gets too high, she will clap three times to get their attention. Once the class quiets down, she resumes teaching. It is important for us to be patient and attentive when @PERSON1 is speaking to us. This is how she instills the value of patience in us.
444	18331	7	3	One time I had to be very patient over at Barrymores because we went into a line to go on go-karts that you had to be at least 10 years old or older to go. I also had to be patient on my birthday this year because I knew I was getting cool stuff but I never imagined it would be this cool. My patience paid off in the end, and I had an amazing time riding the go-karts and receiving fantastic gifts on my birthday. It taught me that sometimes being patient can lead to great rewards.
445	18332	7	3	"I remember a time when my sister used to go on and on about ice cream sundaes. My mom had to drive me around all day because my dad was sick, so that meant my sister had to come along too. My mom knew I was in for a long day. We were in the car and drove past an ice cream shop, and that's when my little sister decided out loud, ""I'm hungry, I want ice cream!"" She kept yelling for five minutes straight. That's when my mom yelled, ""If you speak another word about ice cream, you're not getting it!"" My sister then had a face that meant she was about to cry, which was even worse. My mom gave her a cookie to keep her content for a while. We started driving home, and my sister heard a song on the radio. She loves to put the word ""ice cream"" in every song, so she started squirming and holding her tongue. She stayed that way all afternoon without speaking a word. But as we drove past the ice cream shop again, she couldn't hold back anymore and started to cry, demanding her beloved treat. We went back and got her the ice cream she wanted. My sister learned an important lesson that day - being patient means good things will come to you."
446	18333	7	3	A time I was patient was when I went to get my teeth cleaned. I waited three hours for my appointment, passing the time by reading a book. After my teeth cleaning, I went to the doctor's office to refill my medication and get a check-up. I waited for about two hours before being called in, and then waited an additional five minutes for the shots to be prepared. In total, I spent about five hours and five minutes waiting that day. Finally, after all the waiting, I treated myself to lunch at a nearby restaurant.
447	18334	7	3	Loyalty is when individuals stand up for, and support something. I think everyone should show loyalty in your relationships because that means that you believed and that you have a reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty means to me not backing down showing perserverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother @PERSON1 is going to get into a arguement with everybody. My brother is loyal to the ìaliensî. I say that because he thinks aliens are ??? and doesnít cares about what anybody else has to say. I tried to confince him millions times there is no physical poof aliens exist. But he keeps saying that ì@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.î @CAPS2 my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about that isnít true he will defend you. He says, ìits not cool when somebody else talks about another person, all that means is that person has insu??? My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back.  One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone hes not. He said, ìI tried being someone im not and its not me. Im a nerd with street smarts, I mean I still watering carbons.î In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes. Even if its alien, ??? or himself. My brother's loyalty is unwavering, and his dedication to his beliefs sets a strong example for others to follow.
448	18335	7	3	This is my story about being patient. I had to wait for hours at the doctor's office to get a brace for my friend's wrist. My dad and I sat in the waiting room along with several other people. Despite the long wait, I remained patient while my dad grew restless and eventually fell asleep. After what felt like an eternity, I couldn't take it anymore and woke my dad up to inquire about the delay. Finally, the doctor arrived, gave me the brace, and I left feeling relieved. Patience truly pays off in the end.
449	18336	7	3	Being patient is good because then you respect that your problem will take time but when you're impatient, you want to overcome the problem now or soon. I remember when my brother was impatient. My brother and I were waiting for a new video game to come out but it comes out in 10 days. So he waited a day, checked the date, 9. Then waited another day 8. He wasted 2 days waiting while I focused on school. His grade dropped to a C+ and now he's blaming me! So I told him hard work leads to success. He tried harder - he was using his time on grades while his game he wants is 6, he's a lot happier now that he's patient using time wisely while keeping himself occupied.
450	18337	7	3	"This is the story about the time I was patient. It was a warm day and I was sitting on the grass with the radio on. As my favorite song went off, I reached to change the program. But when I heard the man say usher tickets on sell that and then I froze to listen, the tickets were going on sell downtown. I told my mom and she rushed in the car and got us there so fast you wouldn't even see us leave. When I got to the line, it was so long it seemed like it went on forever. I waited and waited, it felt like it only moved an inch. I waited and still waited, I began to get mad but I stood in line. When my long wait was over, I began to jump for joy. As I walked to the concert, she said ""sorry, we are all sold out."" I couldn't believe it, I began to scream my head out. I did all that waiting for nothing, it was so unfair. And that's the time I was patient for nothing."
451	18338	7	3	Being Patient by: @PERSON1 A few years ago, I started to horse back ride. I love it so much. About @NUM1 month ago I ordered new riding boots. This is a time when I definitely had to be patient. Me and my mom went on stake line tack.corn and ordered my new boots. When they arrived, they were too small so, we sent them back. Days and days went by as I waited for my boots. They didnít come. I had to be patient. Another day went by and my mom finally called them. They said when you re-ship something, it goes through fourteen day processing. Both me and my mom had to be patient. Weeks went by and still no boots. My mom have gotten a new credit card that week. Another week went by and my mom and I were getting impatient. She called the company again and they said when we tried to change the shipping to your credit card, it said declined. But the problem is fixed and Iím glad I was patient enough to wait for the boots, now riding comfortably in my new riding boots. Finally, my patience paid off, and I can now enjoy my horseback riding with ease.
452	18339	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was waiting for my mom to pick me up from school at 3:00 PM. School ends at 1:30 PM, so I had to wait outside for an hour and a half. It was winter at the time, so it was about 25 degrees Fahrenheit. The wind was strong, and I used my instrument case to shield my face from the cold. Despite my efforts, my face was numb, and I was only 30 minutes into the wait. I passed the time by counting the number of teachers and students leaving the school, feeling increasingly bored. My face was red from the cold, and I started dreaming of hot chocolate, summer, and warm days in Florida. I tried to stay patient, but it was challenging. My fingers were freezing, so I put on gloves and continued reading. Suddenly, I thought I saw my mom's red car, but it turned out to be a false alarm. Just as I was losing hope, my mom finally arrived. I quickly gathered my things and got into the warm car, grateful for her timely arrival. As we drove home, she thanked me for being patient.
453	18340	7	3	Having patience is a virtue that not everyone possesses. In a world where instant gratification is often the norm, learning to wait for things can be a valuable skill. The story of the little girl who had patience serves as a reminder that good things come to those who can wait. By exercising patience, we can avoid rushing into decisions and allow things to unfold naturally. Just like the little girl in the story, we too can achieve our goals and desires by being patient and trusting the process. So let us all strive to cultivate patience in our lives and enjoy the rewards that come with it.
454	18341	7	3	I was at the Detroit airport. It was around 7 am, the sky was bright and gloomy but no rain, just a warm breeze blowing in my face. My mom, brother, and I walked through the tall metal doors and saw everything from gift shops to our destination where we would board the plane. We got our tickets and headed off into the plane. We went through metal detectors that caught nothing but my leather striped pink and brown belt. I slipped it back and started walking. When we entered the plane, we passed a lot of people I didn't know. I got the window seat, and there my mom, brother, and I sat in the carnation blue chairs, waiting in excitement and fear to fly off into the Sunshine State. The anticipation of the journey ahead filled us with a mix of emotions, as we prepared for an adventure in a new place.
455	18342	7	3	Patience is a crucial virtue to have in life, especially when dealing with individuals who face challenges. I once had to exercise a great deal of patience with my little cousin who has had a disability since birth. Despite her struggles, I have seen her make progress over the years through gentle guidance and understanding. It is important to approach her with kindness and patience, as she is sensitive and emotional. By being patient and supportive, we can help her improve and overcome obstacles. It is a continuous journey, but with patience and love, she can continue to grow and thrive.
456	18343	7	3	Yesterday, I went to the orthodontist and waited for my check-up. It took a little while, but it was my turn next. When I got home, I felt like I was starving. I waited for dinner to be ready, but even though it was only an hour until it would be ready, it seemed like a lifetime. The delicious aroma coming from the kitchen only made my hunger worse, but I sat patiently and read my book until it was done. Afterwards, I was watching ghost hunters when my little brothers came in and started to clean up the mess they made with their toys. So I had to pause the show because they can't do anything when the show is on. So patiently, I waited for an excruciating 10 minutes until they were done. So overall, I think I was very patient yesterday.
457	18344	7	3	This is the time when I was patient about going to the doctor. It was a two days before I had to the doctor. My mom had told me I needed three shots, I never liked shots because they hurt and make you fill sleepy. I usally never have patientís but this time I did. I had one more day and then I will be at the doctor. I experience why people should have patient and itís easy to do. Today was my doctors appointment and I was scared. When I walked in the clinic I always fill sick and tired. My mom will go sign my name in and I fill more sicker because I will worry about how many shots I will have to get. My doctor had call me and I was terrified my mom always told me that it donít hurt if you donít look at it. So I went back to the doctor office and my doctor told me to get on the scale, I was really he gave me an hearing test and a eye test. I asked if I have to get any shots he said not yet but I might have to. When I got finish with my hearing test, I was finish and I was scared for nothing. When I got home I had learn two lessons one was not to worry about anything and I learn how to have patients. This is when I was patient about going to the doctor.  After the doctor's appointment, I realized that having patience and not worrying excessively can make situations much easier to handle. I learned that sometimes, the things we fear the most turn out to be not as bad as we imagine them to be. It was a valuable lesson that I will carry with me in the future.
458	18345	7	3	This @DATE1 me, @CAPS1 mom, and @CAPS1 @CAPS2, all went to A @ORGANIZATION1í concert, @CAPS1 mom wasnt very excited, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was only excited just to see ë@PERSON1í, I was very excited just to be going  @CAPS4 we entered the parking lot to the ë@ORGANIZATION2 music  @CAPS5í @CAPS6 was a huge line at the door, it took up half the parking lot! But we had to wait in that line for an hour before we got in. When we got inside and to our seats. It started to rain and of course it was on outdoor concert. So by the time the opening act got done I was soaked. Then people started setting up  the stage for The ë@ORGANIZATION1í. We waited another hour and a half for them to finish setting up. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 mom were both getting irritated I kept waiting and staying positive. On the bright side it was an amazing concert and @CAPS7 glad I got to have the experience but next time @CAPS7  whering a hat! Despite the challenges and delays, the concert turned out to be a memorable experience that was well worth the wait.
459	18346	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when my brother, sister, and I were told we were going to @LOCATION1, which is a big deal to us. My siblings and I were fighting in the kitchen about something stupid, of course, when all of a sudden our parents called us out. ""Great,"" I thought. As I was thinking about what punishment we were going to get, my mom broke my thought and told us we were going on vacation. ""No punishment,"" I asked. ""What?"" my mom replied. ""Yes,"" I told her. We were going on vacation to @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION2. But we had to wait one whole week. Every day my little brother would ask, ""When are we going on our trip?"" and every day my mom would say the same thing, ""In one week, in four days, in three days, in two days."" Finally, it was the day to go on our vacation, and my parents were proud of me for being very patient for a week waiting to go to @LOCATION3. That was a time when I was very patient."
460	18347	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at my dadís office. We were there for an hour. And be patient until we left. It was not easy being patient. I had to take an entire hour not saying anying. Until my dad told me too. Being patient in situations like this can be challenging, especially when there is a desire to speak or move around. However, learning to be patient can help in various aspects of life, including improving relationships and reducing stress. In this instance, practicing patience at my dad's office allowed me to demonstrate self-control and respect for his work environment. Ultimately, being patient can lead to positive outcomes and personal growth.
461	18348	7	3	My dad can be very patient sometimes. When he's not angry, he takes the time to listen to others and considers their perspectives. He remains calm in stressful situations, offering support and understanding. This patience allows him to handle challenges with grace and wisdom, setting a positive example for those around him. Overall, his ability to remain patient demonstrates his strength and compassion as a person.
462	18349	7	3	A time when I was patient was actually a few days ago. I was standing in line at @ORGANIZATION1 store with my mother so we could return abox that didnít work. This was the third time we have had to return these boxes. I had to stand in line for an half of an hour and watch nothing but angry coustumers. Still @CAPS1 wasnít our turn in line. This one man who was up at the counter was not very patient at all in fact he when he left he slammed the door and mumbled stuff under his breath. Finally @CAPS1 was our turn and my mom was very patient the worker, (even though she didnít want to be) the worker didnít know what was wrong with box so she gave her a new one and we left. Being patient can bring good things just like this quote I have always like @CAPS1 says ìgood things come to those who waitî @CAPS1 is very true so remember! Be patient.
463	18350	7	3	Thompson volleyball players lost our tournament. We went on Saturday at a local restaurant. And you know Sarah. She had asked for some chopsticks and the waiter made us wait for 10 minutes for chopsticks. So, Emily, a volleyball player, asked and she gave everybody some but the adults! We had so much fun. I had asked for some napkins but we did not get any. I was really mad at the waiter but I had fun and the other girls had fun too!
464	18352	7	3	One important skill you need in life is patience. With my new, hard cast on my arm, I couldn't do many things. I was a very active child doing soccer, basketball, cross country, and football. But, with my broken arm, I had to be patient with my sports. Being patient paid off, and my arm healed faster without complications. Then I played sports after I had my cast cut off. Patience can be rewarding, just if you wait long enough.
465	18353	7	3	I was waiting for my grandpa to get home. He had gone to an Amish sale to find me a chicken coop for my chickens. While waiting, I helped my grandma with canning. I was excited for his return and passed the time by cleaning the barn, tending to the cattle, and taking care of the chickens. After some work, I also practiced sports like volleyball, softball, and basketball. Eventually, I decided to tackle the thistle hill by thrashing it with the slasher. When my grandpa finally arrived, we headed to town together.
466	18354	7	3	One time when I was patient was playing a football game with my friends. The other team was creaming us, but even though we were losing, I managed to stay calm. In the end, we ended up beating them.
467	18355	7	3	Patience is a valuable trait that can greatly benefit individuals in various aspects of their lives. One particular area where patience can be particularly advantageous is in the pursuit of employment opportunities. When seeking a job, it is essential to exercise patience, especially when dealing with potential employers who may take their time in making decisions. Demonstrating patience in these situations is crucial, as becoming impatient and rushing the process can potentially harm one's chances of securing the job. By maintaining composure and exhibiting patience, individuals can navigate the job application process more effectively and increase their likelihood of success. In essence, patience is not only a virtue but also a practical skill that can significantly contribute to personal and professional advancement.
468	18356	7	3	Just be patient, Lucie said to @CAPS1. I will be done soon. How soon is soon? A while. I will be done filing papers in about an hour, then I will take you to the park. An hour? That is such a long time. Just go watch TV. But I don't want to, leave me alone or when I get done I won't take you to the park, okay?   @CAPS1 went and played video games with his little sister @PERSON1 for a while, made some pizza, and then his friend from school came over and asked if he and his sister wanted to go to the park with him and his mom. He asked Lucie if he could go to the park with Ryan, and she said yes, just be back by five o'clock.   He and @PERSON1 had a great time, and Ryan's mom even got them all ice cream. Through this experience, he learned that being patient is very important in life.
469	18357	7	3	Iíve been to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 before, my family and I went about a year ago. Their were so many rides! we were astounded of how many people were their. My family and I decided to go on the little rides first. We went on things like the ì@CAPS2 trapî, ì@CAPS3 starî,. Also many water rides. At the end of the day, my family and I walked in line to the biggest ride their. It was called the ì@CAPS4 timbers.î The track was made out of wood, thats what made most of the ride scary to. Their was line of prolly @NUM1 people. I told my mom I didnít want to wait long. She said ìyou need patienceî  I said ok fine ! It was the ride, it was pretty fun .After we got off I said ìmom that patience really paid offî. The excitement and thrill of the rides, along with the lesson of patience learned, made our visit to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 a memorable and enjoyable experience for my family and me.
470	18358	7	3	When I got my bow I was very very very excited. Well I was excited because my older sister @PERSON1 got a bow before me and I thought that it was unfair. I had to wait @NUM1 whole year till I got my bow at @CAPS1 time. Well my mom and dad hide it in my bedroom in my closet I never noticed it before. That is the time when I had to be patient when I had to wait to get my bow. Now almost every day Iím outside shooting it. Thanks for listening and reading. Now, with my own bow, I can practice and improve my skills just like my sister. It feels great to finally have my own bow and join in on the fun. I can't wait to continue honing my archery abilities and creating lasting memories with my new favorite hobby.
471	18361	7	3	Let me make one thing clear - I am not a patient person. Sure, there are moments when I can muster up some patience, but most of the time, I simply can't wait for things to happen. Whether it's an upcoming event like my birthday, I am constantly talking about it and counting down the days. However, when it comes to mundane family gatherings that I find boring, I have no problem waiting for those to pass. Patience is not my strong suit, especially when it comes to things I am excited about.
472	18362	7	3	Melted One day my sister and I woke up to a bright morning. Sunlight streamed into the room, casting a warm glow. As we got up, our mom called us to help with the chores. While in the kitchen, I noticed a strange smell and soon realized something was burning. Panicked, we rushed to put out the fire and I scolded my sister for her cooking mishap. It was a chaotic morning, but we managed to handle the situation and learned a valuable lesson about fire safety in the kitchen.
473	18363	7	3	"There are over 7,000 different languages in the world and out of these languages, more than 2,000 are considered endangered. But in each language, the word ""patient"" holds the same meaning of being understanding and tolerant. We all need to exercise patience at some point in our lives. I remember a time when I had to be patient with my best friend after we had a disagreement. Despite my attempts to reach out to her, she did not respond. With the advice of my cousin, I decided to wait patiently for her to come around. Eventually, after five days, we were able to reconcile and move past our argument. This experience taught me the value of patience and how it can lead to positive outcomes in relationships. So, next time you find yourself in a challenging situation, remember to be patient and understanding. It may just be the key to resolving conflicts and fostering stronger connections with others."
474	18364	7	3	The time I was patient is when I was to clean up my house and my mom said I would like me to when she gets back. So I straightened up, vacuumed, made my bed, cleaned the bathroom, took the dogs outside, cleaned their haven, did the dishes, took out the trash, and did the laundry. Once I was done with a lot of chores, I would watch @CAPS1 play the game or be on the computer. I waited the whole day, and once she got home, she didn't mention what she had said earlier. She then told me she had forgotten and suggested we order pizza instead.
475	18365	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at the doctors office. I was waiting for my doctor to come out. But he was taking a really long time to come out and I was trying to be patient. It was hard to stay calm and composed, but I knew that the doctor must be busy with other patients. So, I took a deep breath and waited quietly in the waiting room. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the doctor came out and called my name. I felt relieved and grateful that I had been patient because now I could get the medical attention I needed. This experience taught me the importance of patience, especially in situations where waiting is necessary.
476	18366	7	3	One day me and my friend @PERSON1 were at @ORGANIZATION2 and we were in the line for the @ORGANIZATION1. We ran up to the line, and we had to wait about a half hour till we got on. But the good thing is that me and @PERSON1 were patient. After the ride we got in line for the @CAPS1! WOW! What a line, I think we were in that line for at least a hour and a half before we got on. But you know, me and @PERSON1 are really patient. The @CAPS2 was totally worth the wait though. The excitement and thrill we experienced made the long lines seem insignificant in comparison. The memories we created that day will be cherished forever, and the fun we had together will always bring a smile to our faces. It just proves that sometimes, good things are worth waiting for.
477	18367	7	3	One day my dad needed his keys and I had them. His keys were somewhere in my room so I looked everywhere. After twenty minutes went by, I still could not find them, but my dad was still patient. I destroyed my room looking for his keys; they were not in my dresser, closet, bed, or on my floor. I just had them to unlock the car, and now the keys are gone. When I went to tell my dad, who had been patiently waiting for an hour, I found them in my pocket. It turned out that the keys had been with me all along, causing me unnecessary stress and worry. I learned the importance of checking all possible places before jumping to conclusions.
478	18368	7	3	Once upon a time, there were two kids, one named @CAPS1, who was impatient, and the other named @PERSON1, who was patient. During a walk in the woods, @CAPS1's impatience became evident as he constantly complained about being lost. @PERSON1 tried to calm him down, but @CAPS1's complaints continued until they stumbled upon a haunted house. Excited, @CAPS1 persuaded @PERSON1 to enter with him. Inside, @CAPS1 pretended to be hurt, causing @PERSON1 to rush in to help. However, they soon realized they were trapped as the door knob fell off. In the darkness, they were terrified until a light suddenly turned on. To their surprise, the ghost approaching them was actually their dad, who had built the house as a surprise. He revealed that all they needed to do was push the door open to leave. Relieved, they all headed home, ending their spooky adventure.
479	18369	7	3	Patience. If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait 24 hours for something. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a birthday party, I can manage. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though summer was almost over. I didnít care though because I was focused on one thing- my birthday. Like most kids, I had waited three days until I would get a big pile of presents stacked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while until the party started. I played some video games, played outside, and just kind of sat on a couch until 1:27. I couldnít believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend's house. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave. When I got home, I dashed to my clock like a deer in headlights at 1:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour had seemed like a whole other year to me, but Iím still alive, right? My friends donít know me to have patience and I donít either. And trust me, I will never be that patient again. Ever.
480	18370	7	3	When I was younger, I struggled with math. I couldn't figure out the problems on my own, and even when my aunt tried to help me, I just couldn't grasp the concepts. I wanted to give up, but this time, I was determined to push through. I was patient, focused, and dedicated to learning. With perseverance and hard work, I was able to overcome my struggles with math. It was a challenging journey, but in the end, it was worth it. Now, I am confident in my math skills and proud of the progress I have made.

482	18373	7	3	The goalkeeper shirt I had been eagerly waiting for finally arrived on the expected date. It was a beautiful combination of pale yellow, red, blue, and purple colors. I was ecstatic to have it in my possession, ready to wear it to my games and showcase my skills on the field. My mom's willingness to get me the shirt despite its price made the moment even more special. Now, I was fully prepared to make great saves and stand out as a goalkeeper in my team.
483	18374	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my dad to come home from work so I could open my package that I got before he left on a three-day trip out of state. I patiently waited for him to return so I could finally see what was inside the package.
484	18375	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was my 21st birthday. I was eagerly anticipating receiving a new phone as a gift from my mom, who kept reassuring me that I would get it on the first of the month. Despite my doubts, I remained patient. To my surprise, my patience paid off when my mom presented me with my brand new cell phone and a case as my final birthday gift. It was a lesson in the virtue of patience, and I was grateful for the outcome in the end.
485	18376	7	3	"""Are they here yet?"" I said as I paced back and forth. ""Patience, it takes a while to get from the locker from all the way down here,"" said @CAPS1. ""@CAPS2! @CAPS6 on the camera!"" ""Got him!"" said @PERSON1. ""@CAPS4's right behind us."" ""Funny guys! You guys better give me back my clothes or I swear I'll @CAPS6 off the camera!"" yelled @CAPS7 as @CAPS4 attempted to grab his clothes... and missed. ""Enough! My patience has run out @CAPS7!"" I said, taking another picture. ""I think @CAPS3 should put this up on the internet,"" I continued. ""Oh, you can't even put this on the internet!"" ""So you're going to stop picking on us?"" I asked. ""Fine!"" @CAPS4 said, ""Then I'll just zoom in right here."" ""Hey!"" @CAPS4 screamed as his towel fell off. To show the little respect I had for him, I gave him his clothes, turned around, and walked away."
486	18377	7	3	Crack! I twisted through the air and landed face up with my arm wrapped around me. I felt a throbbing pain as I wobbled to my feet, wondering what had just happened. The excruciating pain shot through my forearm, causing me to bite my lip hard to hold back the tears. My friends rushed towards me, asking if I was okay, and I could only manage to reply that I thought I might have broken my arm. They quickly sought aid for me, and soon I found myself in the sick room, waiting for my parents to come pick me up for an X-ray at the children's hospital.  Hours passed as I anxiously awaited my parents' arrival, and finally, the bell rang. My dad and mom appeared, relieved that it was only a broken arm. They rushed me to the hospital, emphasizing the importance of patience in life. It was a lesson learned through an unexpected turn of events, but one that left a lasting impact. In life, challenges will come, and patience is key in facing them head-on.
487	18378	7	3	"Jenny and @PERSON3 were twins brother and sister, and every year a carnival was built up next to their house with games, rides, and food. One day @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 went to ask their mother @PERSON2 politely for some money to go on the ferris wheel. ""Mom, can we each have a dollar to go on the ferris wheel?"" asked @PERSON1. ""Sure,"" replied mom, handing them two dollars. Excited, @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 ran to the line for the ferris wheel. They waited patiently for an hour, and when it was finally their turn, two mean boys pushed them off and took their seats. Remembering their mother's teachings about kindness, @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 let the boys go ahead. The man in charge of the ferris wheel noticed what happened and praised their patience. He offered them three more rides on the ferris wheel as a reward. After the ride, @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 thanked the man and happily ran home to tell their mom. She was proud of them for their actions, hugging them tightly."
488	18379	7	3	I was patient when I am hunting because when you have a bow and you can only shoot so far and you have to have the deer come in to a nice clearing not behind brush. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes close and you get your bow ready and then your mind makes you think like you. It going to come up close and then it walks as slow as possible and you just have to go with it. And when all that patience comes to an end and you get ready to shoot and you got it then it really pays off. Hunting requires a great deal of patience, especially when using a bow. The hunter must wait for the deer to come into a clear, open area without obstruction. This requires a calm and patient demeanor as the deer approaches slowly. The culmination of this patience is when the hunter finally takes the shot and successfully hits the target. This patience is essential for a successful hunt and makes the reward even sweeter.
489	18380	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I was in 1st grade. It was after my birthday and I had wanted pink shoes. My dad in a different city said he would get them but he would have to buy them, send them to grandma's house and then have my grandma send them to me and that I would get them sometime after my birthday. So one day he called and told me he sent them and I should get them in one week. So I patiently waited for my shoes and in one week. They were not at my house. I didn't want to bother my dad and call him every day about them so I just patiently waited. After another week, I began to worry and get mad so I called my dad and asked him about the shoes and to my surprise he said that my grandma was bringing my shoes in an hour. So I was patient and waited one hour and my shoes still hadn't come. At this point I just decided they would just come when they came and I would just wait. Finally, I got my shoes the next day and I was ecstatic. I thanked my dad and I wore my shoes the next day knowing my patience paid off.
490	18381	7	3	"@CAPS4 I'm patient, and sometime I'm impatient. But no matter how impatient l am, my @CAPS5's even more impatient when it comes to waiting in a big traffic jam. He huffs at the long delay, sighs, and gets very impatient. He says things like, @CAPS1 on, @CAPS2"" ""@CAPS1 on!"" @CAPS4 it's scary to be with @CAPS5 in traffic jams, or long lines. But after the long line. @CAPS5's himself again which is a great relief on my past! When faced with delays, @CAPS5's impatience can be overwhelming, making the situation even more stressful. However, once the obstacle is overcome, he quickly reverts to his usual self, bringing a sense of calm and relief to the situation. It's a rollercoaster ride being around someone so impatient, but the eventual return to normalcy is always a welcome relief."
491	18383	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I was fighting my little brother in the backyard and then he kicked me in the chin. Despite the pain and the injury, I made a promise to myself to not tell on him. As I fell to the ground after the second kick, I could feel my chin throbbing and the blood trickling down, but I kept my composure. Even though I was surrounded by onlookers, I remained patient and didn't react impulsively. It was a test of my patience and self-control, and in the end, my decision to stay calm in that moment paid off.
492	18384	7	3	One time I was told by my big brother that we were going to go to Micigman Adventure, so I was waiting for him to come home. When my dad told me to get ready to go, I quickly packed my shorts and other essentials. After waiting for a while, I decided to call my brother to see where he was. He then informed me that he had forgotten about our plans and couldn't make it.

494	18387	7	3	One day my mom, my sister, and I went to the hair salon to get our hair done. The salon was bustling with people chatting, the TV blaring, and the radio playing. After signing us in, we had to wait for what felt like forever. Despite feeling hungry and tired, I stayed patient and entertained myself with my music player. Finally, after a long wait, it was our turn to get our hair done. We left the salon satisfied but hungry, so we grabbed some food before heading home. It was a test of patience, but in the end, it was worth it to see our new hairstyles.
495	18388	7	3	Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack who had a little brother named @PERSON1. Jack was older, and his brother was younger. Due to their parents working late, Jack had to watch over his little brother every night. Although Jack had a lot of patience, his brother sometimes found him annoying. Their parents knew that paying Jack to watch over @PERSON1 would keep him responsible. One day, when @PERSON1 wouldn't stop complaining, Jack got upset and threatened to stop watching him. This made @PERSON1 realize his behavior and he apologized. The next day, they spent time together happily, realizing the importance of their bond. Jack was glad they resolved their differences because he didn't want his brother to go to daycare, and @PERSON1 didn't want to be away from his brother either. Their relationship grew stronger as they learned to communicate and understand each other better.
496	18389	7	3	There was a time when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. We were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 then there was a long line of traffic so we had to wait. So we waited on a bridge for @NUM1! It was a night more coming true. We got hungry. We really didnít compliments. But we were there for a long time, about @NUM2 we got into the pork. So we were deciding which roller coaster to go on. We decided to go on the @CAPS1. We looked at the line it was a @NUM3 hr wait. We got in line. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and my brother @PERSON1 were companing a lot. Again it was a nightmare coming true. So my dad and I were fine with the line for the @CAPS2. Actually it didnít take as long as I thought it would. After the wait we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time. The coaster was over. I was sad. But it was worth the three hour wait. Later that day we rode the @CAPS3 the first ever built standing coaster I was scared again the wait was @NUM4 hours long. And @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 dying from the wait. But the wait only felt like an hour long. I was scared of that coaster. But I loved it. It was a lot of fum to ride roller coasters. We left after a while. It was a long day. The end. After leaving the theme park, we were exhausted but filled with joy from the thrilling experiences we had. The memories of waiting in line for hours and conquering our fears on the roller coasters will always stay with us, making it a day to remember.
497	18390	7	3	In this story, I am eagerly awaiting the release of the video game @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for @CAPS3 @NUM1. The game is said to be the final installment in the popular @CAPS4 franchise. I have already pre-ordered my copy, and the excitement is building as the release date approaches.  The game itself is known for its intense gameplay and challenging missions. One particular aspect that stands out is the character of your mom, who mysteriously stays on a planet called @CAPS2 all alone, facing relentless attacks from @NUM2 alien enemies armed with swords. The graphic violence in the game is striking, as these aliens viciously chop up your character into tiny pieces with their toy-like swords.  When the game finally arrived at @CAPS5 @CAPS6 at @NUM3, the scene was chaotic with eager fans lining up outside the store. Among them were probably many hardcore gamers who spend their days in their parents' basements. Despite the long wait, we managed to purchase the game and dive into the action.  However, to our surprise, the game turned out to be shorter than expected, with a lackluster storyline and repetitive gameplay. We breezed through the missions in no time, leaving us feeling unsatisfied with the overall experience. This taught me the importance of patience and not getting too caught up in the hype surrounding a new release.  In conclusion, while the anticipation for @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was high, the actual gameplay fell short of expectations. It serves as a reminder to approach new releases with a level head and not rush into purchasing them based on hype alone.
498	18391	7	3	When I was in fifth grade, I struggled with math, so my tutor agreed to help me study for my upcoming test. On the scheduled day, I woke up early, but my mom was running late from work, causing us to arrive an hour and a half late. Despite the delay, my tutor remained patient and understanding. As we began, I found myself completely lost and struggling to grasp the concepts she explained. Despite my difficulties, she continued to try her best to help me understand. I got most of the questions wrong, but she persisted in guiding me for about two hours. Thanks to her dedication and patience, I managed to score an A on the quiz. I am truly grateful for her unwavering support and understanding throughout the tutoring session. Her perseverance and willingness to help me learn made a significant impact on my academic success, and I will always appreciate her for that.
499	18392	7	3	A time I was patient was @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2. I was sitting doing my meap test when my stomach started to hurt. For about @NUM3 minutes I sat there moving around. Then I raised my hand to ask call my mom. When I called on me I asked her and @CAPS3 said ì @CAPS1.S @PERSON1 can you take ??? to the office.î And @PERSON1 said ok. Then me and @PERSON1 went to the office and I called my house phone my sister picked up the phone I said to her ì@CAPS2 me speak to mama.î @CAPS3 said ìhold up. Then my mom said ìit do.î I said mama can you please come pick me up my stomach hurts reel bad.î @CAPS3 said ìokî and hung up I waited about @NUM3 minutes sitting the patient, tosing and turning from my stomach hurting so bad. Then finally called agian ìI said moma is you comingì @CAPS3 said ì@CAPS4 on my wayî. I said ìokî and hung up. I was sitting there patient and in pain till finaly my mom walked through the school doors and signed me out the @CAPS3 said ìcome onî my sister and ??? were sitting out in the truck waiting to go to the family health center. I sat in the front seat. I was sleep the whole way home then I woken up when we got there I went in the house layed on the couch and fell asleep. I realized the importance of being patient and how it can lead to a positive outcome in difficult situations.
500	18393	7	3	My mum is someone who is patient. One time when I was little, I got gum stuck in my hair. I was crying a lot and moving around as my mom patiently tried to get the gum out of my hair. She kept on telling me to sit still, but she never got mad at me, even if she had really wanted to just stop and make me get it out myself. When she couldnít get it out and said that she would have to cut it out, I had screamed. Yet, with patience, she was somehow able to cut the gum out and still keep my hair looking nice even though I wouldnít sit still. I think my mom is the most patient person that I know, because whenever something happens, she is patient about it.
501	18394	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at the dentist's office to get a cavity filled. When we got there they said my appointment wasn't for another hour, but my mom didn't want to leave. I was so bored as the TV was on a news channel that I wasn't interested in. When it finally was my turn, it took the dentist, who is also my uncle, about another half an hour to get ready. A learning experience is that I learned to be patient when someone takes too long to do something simple.
502	18395	7	3	Beep! Beep! Beep! My alarm clock was going off at 7:00 am, and I had already missed the bus. I hurriedly got dressed, hoping my siblings were downstairs waiting for me. However, they were still in their rooms. Panicking, I woke them up and rushed to get breakfast ready. As we all finally piled into the van, my sister and I urged my brother to drive faster to school. Despite being a few minutes late, we managed to make it just in time. It seems my brother was the most patient one in our household.
503	18396	7	3	There was a kid named @PERSON2 who was always very patient. He always waited for everyone else and he never complained. That morning @PERSON2 just woke up and so did his five brothers and sisters. They all were trying to get ready for school within an hour. All of the bathrooms were taken up but @PERSON2 didn't complain he actually used up that time to clean his room and make his bed. @PERSON2 was a little bit late to school. The @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 said come here and the class said ooooo!!! Ha! Ha! @PERSON2 is in trouble. @PERSON1 said come here and @PERSON2 put his head down and walked as if he was pulling a ton. During lunch @PERSON2 was at the end of the line. Once @PERSON2 had gotten up there, there was no more food it was all gone. The lunch lady saw how upset he was and she gave him a special lunch. Once @PERSON2 got home his family threw a patient party. @PERSON2 was honored and also happy. That night was the best for @PERSON2. The lesson of patience and kindness was celebrated, making @PERSON2 feel appreciated and loved for his virtues.
504	18398	7	3	As my dad always tells me, patience is one of the keys to being successful in life. As I mature, I find out more and more that patience is important. I remember a time when I had to display patience for a long period of time. My family and I took a trip to Cedar Point along with my friend. My friend and I could only think about the biggest ride in the park, Millennium Force. This ride gave me the most fun, heart-stopping, adrenaline-pumping rush ever. But it would be a while before I could ride it. So we walked and walked, and I began to get tired. After hours of walking, we reached the Millennium Force. I was disappointed to find out it's a 1.5-hour wait. The sun was blazing out. I figured the best way to do it was to keep quiet and relax. It seems that the more you complain, the longer it takes. And before we knew it, we were about to get on the ride! The thrill and excitement of the ride made the wait worth it. It taught me that sometimes, patience is the key to experiencing the best moments in life.
505	18399	7	3	ì@CAPS1 hour and thirty minutes, are you kidding!î I said as my dad and I got into the line for the ride the ìmaverickî at @CAPS2 point. ìThatís what the sign sayís, but it could take longer,î my dad replied. I said in a disappointed tone ìI guess we can wait,î but in my head I reminded myself you have zero, zilch, none, no patience! Why did I say yes. Right when my thoughts were done, the line moved up a little. That was quick, I thought. During that time to the time the line moved again, I occupied myself by watching people on the @CAPS3 and other rides go by. The line moved up again. Watching people didnít work this time, so I started thinking about how much fun the maverick would be to ride, and other rides I wanted to go on next. Those thoughts lasted halfway in the line. My patience was running out. I started tapping my fingers on the side of my leg. I thought nothing and just tapped my fingers and moved up. We were finally at the front, and I didnít complain once! I got into a seat, and the ride started. At the end, it was really worth it, I thought. Now it was time to go on more rides and not complain. That was a time I was patient.
506	18401	7	3	"One time I was patient when we were going to @LOCATION1 for one of my baseball tournaments. It is like a @NUM1 hour drive through @LOCATION2 and that is the way we went, I was sitting in the back of the car and I had an ear ache so my ear was hurting and I had to wait @NUM1 hours. Another reason is my little brother @PERSON1 was trying to grab my feet, and take his stuffed animal and hitting me with it. I would tell him to stop and he would not, so eventually I took the stuffed animal and he would yell at me to give it back so I would. The last reason is we had to wait @NUM3 minutes in a line so we could get back into the @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION2. Then when we were at the front of the line a guy asked my mom a question and he asked my two brothers and I who the two people were in the front seat and we said ""are mom and dad."" He asked that to make sure we were not being kidnapped. Those are all reasons why I had to be patient on our @NUM1 hour drive to @ORGANIZATION1 town."
507	18402	7	3	A lot of people are patient and they wait because they donít want to make someone mad or mess up something that they are doing. People always are careful of what they are doing. Being patient is not that hard, it is pretty easy. Everyone knows that there are people out there who are patient, trust me. There are many different things that you can be patient for, but I donít know which one to choose to write about, as there are many. For example, if someone is in the bathroom, you wait patiently, but if you canít hold it, you may keep knocking on the door or use another one. If someone is on the computer and it has been over an hour, you can politely ask them to get off so you can have your turn. Being patient for at least a few minutes is not too hard. Itís pretty easy and everyone knows that too.
508	18403	7	3	I am going to write about a time I was patient. The time I was patient was when I went to fuzzys and it took a long time. It took @NUM1 minutes. It seemed like took forever. It was a @ORGANIZATION1. I think the reason why it seemed forever was probably because I didít eat nothing. There was me my mom and dad. You can also buy ice cream. My stomach was hurting and I was hungry. I had tries to. Some people have patient and other donít. I kind of have patients. But this time I had no patients. Now when I get a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 it seems not that long. That is a time I needed patients. It was a test of my patience, but I managed to stay calm and composed despite the hunger and discomfort. In the end, the wait was worth it, and I learned the value of being patient in challenging situations.
509	18404	7	3	A time when I was patient was at the beginning of the year of the seventh grade. It was fourth hour and the principle had made an announcement saying that the sixth graders took too long at lunch and said there was a delay. So as the rest of the class complained, I sat there calm and patient. It wasn't really fun just to sit there bored and hungry though, so I just kept my cool. Then eventually our grade was called down to have lunch. That was the time when I was patient over something. Despite feeling bored and hungry, I managed to remain patient until it was finally our turn to go for lunch.
510	18405	7	3	My mom's patience was truly tested during her wait for her driver's license. She endured a six-hour wait in line, remaining calm and composed despite the frustrating circumstances. Whether it was waiting for the licensing official to return from a break or standing under the scorching sun, she never lost her cool. Her ability to remain patient in such trying situations is truly admirable.
511	18406	7	3	The time I was impatient was when I had to wait at the doctor's office. Despite my efforts to distract myself with magazines, the wait felt endless. My mom kept reminding me to be patient, but my hunger and tiredness made it difficult to stay calm. Finally, when my name was called, I had to wait again to see the doctor. This experience taught me that waiting is not my strong suit, and I prefer not to deal with long waiting times in the future.
512	18407	7	3	Once upon a time there were two boys named @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION1 was impulsive and always wanted things his way, while @PERSON1 was patient and shared with others. One day, while watching TV, they saw a rocket building kit and asked their dad if they could have it. His dad informed them that it would take two weeks to arrive.   When the two weeks passed, @ORGANIZATION1 was restless and eager to get his hands on the rocket kit. On the other hand, @PERSON1 calmly waited for his dad to bring it home. Days went by, and @ORGANIZATION1 would pester his dad constantly, unable to contain his excitement. In contrast, @PERSON1 simply went about his day as usual.   When the day finally arrived, @ORGANIZATION1 rushed out to grab his rocket kit, while @PERSON1 followed at his own pace. As they opened their kits, @ORGANIZATION1 impatiently tried to put his rocket together quickly, resulting in a crooked and broken creation. Disappointed, he yelled in frustration.   Seeing his friend upset, @PERSON1 went over to help @ORGANIZATION1, and together they successfully built the rocket in just a few minutes. They then played together, having fun and enjoying their time. In the end, they both learned the value of patience and teamwork.
513	18408	7	3	Lost in @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @CAPS1 was early @DATE1, the leaves just beginning to change colors and flutter down above your head. My mother, sister, a friend of hers and I piled into the car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and I'm very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2. My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way we came to a fork in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, permitting the long drive to the vets. My mother, instead of taking my advice, started us off in a completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained, dragging their feet. For the next mile or so we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees, my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring my kitten to the vet. I was looking forward to taking him, making me further stressed. Finally, after another half hour of walking, we ended up at the exit. I was happy I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 turned out all right, and my mother was always patient with us as we complained and moaned.
514	18409	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was in science class taking a test. I was patient because I went up to the teacher because I needed help and so did the kid in front of me. It took him a while but I just stood there and waited. It took him around 10 minutes because he needed help with a lot of things. That is the time I was patient. As a result, I learned the importance of being patient and understanding that sometimes things take time to be resolved. Being patient not only helped me in that situation but also taught me valuable lessons that I can apply in various aspects of my life.
515	18411	7	3	Having patience is crucial when helping friends with school work or homework. Some friends may take longer to understand concepts, requiring a calm and patient approach. Personally, I have experienced moments of frustration, but I understand the importance of remaining patient. This quality will also be valuable when tutoring for @CAPS1 in the future. Patience is a key characteristic that can greatly impact the success of helping others academically.
516	18412	7	3	I am not a very patient person, but when I have to be, I am. For example, at my house, we only have one bathroom. I hate waiting to go, but I have to wait because I don't want to juggle pee, so I will wait. I also have to wait for my bus. I hate waiting; it's so boring. But patience is a good thing to have. If we didn't, there would be a lot of deaths by car accidents, murders, and nervous breakdowns. My sister is very patient; she can wait in one spot for hours. One time, it was Halloween, and I was all fidgety from waiting until the bell rang so we could go trick or treating. She waited patiently while she did her hair, and I complained. That is a reason why patience is important.
517	18413	7	3	Flave you ever been to the doctor? Well, on @DATE1, my brother, sister, and I had a doctor's appointment, so we missed school. When we got there, it was packed with people, and we had to wait for three and a half hours. As time passed, I started to feel impatient and hungry, so I told my mom about it. We all agreed that we needed something to eat, so my mom went to the food court to get us some pizza and water. After finishing our meal, we continued waiting for another three hours. The long wait made me frustrated, and I couldn't help but express my impatience. Finally, the nurse called my name, and we were able to see the doctor. I realized the importance of patience in such situations, and I apologized for my earlier outburst. It taught me that sometimes, waiting is necessary, and patience can lead to better outcomes in the end.
518	18414	7	3	Patience is crucial in various aspects of life. It involves being understanding and tolerant of situations that may test our emotions. For instance, when a child's mother leaves for work and returns after a few hours, the child's immediate response of thinking that the time passed quickly showcases the virtue of patience. It is about accepting the natural flow of events without rushing or becoming frustrated. Developing patience allows us to navigate through challenges with composure and grace, ultimately leading to a more peaceful and harmonious existence.
519	18415	7	3	For me, I'm not that patient when someone close to me or any of my friends is being mistreated. I don't tolerate seeing my friends being picked on by someone they don't even know. One time, while walking down the school hallway with my friends, a kid suddenly appeared and started pushing one of my friends around. I immediately confronted the kid and asked him what his problem was. He rudely replied that it was none of my business, but I couldn't stand by while my friend was being bullied. The situation escalated when the bully tried to pick on me, not realizing that I had my brother and another friend just around the corner. I quickly signaled to my friend to go get them, and the bully, upon seeing reinforcements arriving, cowardly ran away.
520	18416	7	3	One time when I was patient was when my momís car needed a new battery and I had to go to school. My mom called her friend that lived down the street to come and give us a boost. We waited an hour and a half waiting on her. My mom called called her back and she said she canít make it because she needed an oil change. After that we walked to the bus stop for thirty minutes, it picked us up and took us to @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. Then we walked the rest of the way to @NUM1 mile and @PERSON1 where the was another bus that took us to @NUM2 mile and @PERSON1 where my school is. That was time when I was patient.   Despite the unexpected delays and obstacles, I remained calm and composed throughout the ordeal, ultimately reaching my destination with a sense of resilience and understanding.
521	18417	7	3	Patience is essential when it comes to waiting for something. It involves staying calm and understanding that things take time. For example, instead of constantly worrying about when your new shoes will arrive, it's better to patiently wait for them to come in two weeks. Similarly, in activities like hunting, patience is key as you need to wait for the right moment for a deer to appear.   Being patient means accepting delays and not getting frustrated easily. It is important to remain composed and relaxed, even when things are not going as planned. For instance, waiting for a scheduled appointment can be tiring, but staying patient can help manage the situation without getting upset.   In some cases, impatience can lead to negative outcomes, such as becoming irritable or agitated. It is crucial to understand the reasons behind delays and practice patience in such situations. Even when things do not go according to schedule, it is important to remain patient and hopeful for a positive outcome. Remember, good things come to those who wait.
522	18418	7	3	Paitience is when you are calmly waiting for something, someone or for something to happen. When I was little I went to the doctor to get a shot, but momdid not tell me it was for a shot, so I was thinking I was I was just going to go in and come out with a sucker. I had asked my mom when I could have a sucker and she said wait a little while be paitient.î I went into the room and got the shot and got my sucker. I was angry with my mom because she knows I hate needles. However, looking back, I realize that patience is an important virtue that helps us deal with unexpected situations and challenges in a calm and composed manner. It teaches us to wait for the right moment and trust that things will eventually work out in our favor. So, even though I may not have liked getting a shot that day, I understand now the value of being patient in all aspects of life.
523	18419	7	3	"A beaker bubbled in the lab at @LOCATION1. I could smell the sulfur smell wafting from the beaker. ""What's going on!"" I yelped across the room. ""I found the cure for cancer!"" @CAPS3 said excitedly, doing a little jubilee dance to show off. As a doctor, I was skeptical but intrigued. I mentioned a patient with extreme brain cancer, and @CAPS3 urged me to try the cure.  After a frantic rush to the hospital with the cure, we encountered @PERSON1, the patient in need. With cautious optimism, I administered the cure, and to my relief, @PERSON1's condition improved. The smile on her face spoke volumes, expressing gratitude for the second chance at life.  Just as we celebrated the successful treatment, @CAPS3 revealed that the cure had also saved a kitten's life. This unexpected twist highlighted the potential of the discovery beyond human applications. The experience taught me the importance of patience and trust in the face of uncertainty.  In the end, the miraculous effects of the cure brought hope and healing to those in need, showing the power of perseverance and compassion in the field of medicine."

I kept on asking my dad is the doctor coming yet, and my dad would always say patience. It got to the point when my dad was so frustrated, and he told me to go play with some toys; which I did not notice until then. But when I saw those fun toys gleaming in the sunlight I ran to them. But after a few minutes it got so boring, so I went back and sat down. It was getting so boring I couldnít take it anymore! I wanted to scream! But then I couldnít take it, I started to get so mad, wanted to just get out of there. But I didnít let my dad know, because I wanted him to think I was patient.

The opposing player skated in and attempted to outmaneuver me, but I held my ground. Anticipating his move, I stayed upright and stopped the shot, preserving our team's victory. This save was a pivotal moment in maintaining our unbeaten record. As a goalie, staying patient and focused is key to success in intense situations like these.

528	18426	7	3	One time when another person I know was patient was when my friend stood in line for over an hour to get the tickets for the show we were going to see. This shows patience because my friend did not complain while standing in line. Additionally, they remained calm and collected throughout the wait, demonstrating remarkable patience in the face of a challenging situation. This act of patience not only ensured that we were able to secure tickets for the show but also made the overall experience more enjoyable.

I didnít have it but then a few months went by and it was Christmas and I got it and I was so happy. Another time when I was patient was when I had to babysit my cousin for a week. And I waited a few weeks for my uncle to give me my money but he did not. So I waited and he finally gave me my money. But not only did he give me the money he owed me, he also gave me a late fee and I was happy. And that added up to the money that my mom gave me and it was enough for me to go skating and to the store with my friends. And I spent some of it at the movies and on snacks.

531	18429	7	3	Patience is a virtue that I struggle with, much like my mother. Waiting through commercials on TV is something we both avoid by recording shows to watch later. Long lines, tardiness, and idle waiting are also tests of my patience. I can only tolerate about five minutes before impatience sets in, especially during lengthy car rides with nothing to occupy my time. I often wish for shortcuts to reach our destination faster. Increasing my patience is a goal, but it proves challenging to achieve. I hope you've had enough patience to follow along with my tale.
532	18430	7	3	One time I had to be really patient. It was when I was on my way to visit my family in another city. The journey took longer than expected, lasting four days instead of the usual two or three, mainly because my dad insisted on stopping at every store and restaurant along the way. While I found it frustrating, my dad seemed to believe it was necessary. Throughout the trip, my uncle called us frequently, eagerly inquiring about our whereabouts and jokingly asking if we had brought him his favorite cereal, Coco Wheats. His persistent calls added a humorous element to the journey. By the time we reached our destination, my legs were sore from sitting in the car for so long.

By the time we reached the meat section, I was starving. My mom told me to wait, and as we stood in the long checkout line, a little girl even tried to provoke me. Despite my frustration, I managed to stay calm. Finally, when it was our turn, I was relieved. Once home, my mom cooked bacon, and I was more than ready to eat and head to bed.
535	18434	7	3	As I waited at the airport, I gazed at all walking by I pondered these thoughts in my head: ìwhen will @CAPS2 be here?î @CAPS1 long have I been waiting and what time is it, wasnít his flight supposed to be here @NUM1 minutes ago? Then suddenly I heard a soft female voice ë@CAPS2 will be here soon, honey dont worry.í I dont understand @CAPS1 my mother told a @NUM2 year old not to worry it was in our nature. I was about to lose my patience, but then I asked myself ëwhat good does complaining do? It only makes you upset.í @CAPS3 these things ran through my mind, I gained back my patience. An hour later, I felt my mom shaking my shoulder and telling me to wake up. When I opened my eyes, I saw my dad standing in front of me, I ran to him and gave him a hug. ëI almost lost my patientí @CAPS4 glad I stayed patient because if I wasnít it wouldíve ruined my fathers trip.

It's essential to trust the process and have faith that things will work out in the end.
536	18435	7	3	A time I was patient was when we were at the store and I was excited to go to the toys section. However, we had to go to the grocery first. I was mad, but my mom told me to be patient because the quicker we finish, the sooner we can get to the toys. After the grocery, we had to go to the clothes section, which I also didn't like. But again, my mom reminded me to be patient so we could get to the toys faster. Finally, I got to pick out a toy - a cool truck with big tires, flames, and in green. I was thrilled and grateful for being patient, as I was able to choose the toy I really wanted. This experience taught me the importance of patience and how it can lead to good outcomes.
537	18436	7	3	I was patient in getting my @NUM1. It took me ten months of waiting, but I finally received it on my birthday.

539	18441	7	3	I am going to talk about what I think patience is. I think patience is about waiting. For example ìyou were very patience in line for cotton candyî, said the clown. You know something like that I know this a short story, Iím sorry. Patience is indeed the ability to remain calm and composed while waiting for something, like standing in line for cotton candy. It involves controlling our impulses and emotions, allowing us to endure delays or difficulties without becoming frustrated or agitated. In a fast-paced world where instant gratification is often expected, patience is a valuable virtue that can help us navigate through challenges and setbacks with grace and resilience.
540	18442	7	3	I remember one day I was waiting in the waiting room in the doctors office with my mom because I wasnít feeling well. We sat there talking for about ten minutes when my mom said ì@CAPS1 itís already been ten minutesî ìI wonder when I will get to go and talk to my doctor.î I said. ìI doní.t know but lets wait a bit longer. Mom said. So as we waited and sat patiently more kids started coming in. I noticed some were young and some were older. I signed. What is taking so long? I wandered. Was my doctor even here today? I starred at the wall and looked at the color of it. Orange. Before I knew it half an hour passed. My mom was looking at her watch. ì@CAPS1 itís almost @NUM1!î ì@CAPS2!î I said flustered and annoyed. ìAre we just gonna sit here all day?î I asked.

I was so excited and grateful for my mom taking the time to make sure I got the toy I had been wanting. It made the wait worth it in the end.
542	18445	7	3	Patience can come in different ways in life, and it can bring various rewards. One significant aspect is that patience can lead to a bigger reward in the end, making the waiting worthwhile. Additionally, being patient allows individuals to engage in other activities while waiting for the desired outcome. This ability to multitask can make the waiting period more productive. Moreover, exercising patience can be challenging, but it is essential to remain calm and composed during the process. Rushing through things due to impatience may result in undesirable outcomes.

543	18446	7	3	When I am a patient person, I try to always be polite and not complain. I believe in staying calm and being patient in various situations, whether it's at school, in restaurants, or waiting in long lines at the fair. However, there are times when things take too long, and I struggle to maintain my patience. Despite my efforts to be patient, I find it challenging when delays occur.

We got in the car, and drove to my uncle @PERSON1ís house. When we arrived at his house, my dad started packing everything onto the boat. Once we did that, we hopped in my uncle @PERSON1ís old, rusty, red truck. The red paint was chipping all over the truck. We started to drive, and my uncle @PERSON1 had to keep watching the boat. The boat was very small. It just barely fit all of us. It was only about a foot and a half wide and about @NUM1 foot long. It scared me when we put the boat in the water and started driving. We went through a gorgeous river all the way to the back of the @ORGANIZATION1. The @ORGANIZATION1 were on is called @ORGANIZATION1. It is in @LOCATION1. I was patient right when we got in there. I thought we were going to stand, so I was having second thoughts on fishing. It turns out, we just sat in there while we fished. We fished for a good @NUM2 hours that day. I was so very patient waiting for my bobber to go down so I could set the hook. ì@CAPS1î my uncle @PERSON1 said. It means that the bobber is going under the water like a submarine does. We had @NUM2 rods out at once! @NUM4 pike rods, and @NUM1 bluegill rods! I caught the biggest blue gill of the day that day! This day was one of the best days of my life!! That is about the time I had to be patient on the @ORGANIZATION1 for @NUM2 hours straight. After a successful day of fishing, we headed back home with big smiles on our faces, cherishing the memories made during our time on the water. It was a day filled with patience, excitement, and the joy of bonding with family in the great outdoors.

However, she realized she was a dollar short when it was her turn to pay. I kindly offered to give her a dollar, and in return, she gave me a mint as a token of gratitude.  After purchasing my slurpee, we had to cross the road to get to my house. We waited for what felt like an eternity, but eventually made it across. Along the way, one of my friends suddenly needed to use the restroom, so we stopped at a market. He took longer than expected and got lost, causing us to wait for an hour before he finally returned.  Reflecting on the events of the day, I realized the importance of patience. It can be challenging to wait, whether it's in line at the store, crossing the road, or waiting for a friend. Despite the frustrations that may arise, practicing patience is essential in navigating through various situations in life.

They were always running around and shouting. I had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children or it would make the situation worse. Later on this week, I was put in carge of a young, special needs kid. He just couldnít sit still! I had to remind him over and over not to be so loud. He was very determined to get what he wanted.

549	18454	7	3	Patience is essential in all interactions with others, as I learned during a recent visit to the dentist's office. Despite having my own appointment scheduled, I found myself waiting as others with more urgent dental needs were seen before me. A young boy in severe pain, an older woman requiring a root canal, and a little girl excited about her loose tooth all took precedence over my routine check-up. Initially frustrated by the delays, I ultimately realized the importance of patience in such situations. While it can be challenging to wait, showing understanding and empathy towards others in need is crucial. In the end, I learned that practicing patience is not only considerate but also necessary in our daily interactions with others.
550	18455	7	3	One time, my friend showed great patience while waiting for the teacher to finish talking to another student.

In the end, her patience paid off as she was able to receive the assistance she needed from the teacher.

Additionally, showing patience towards others, such as letting someone in a hurry go ahead of you, demonstrates kindness and empathy. In challenging circumstances, having patient individuals around can make a significant difference in how the situation is handled. Ultimately, patience plays a crucial role in how we navigate through daily challenges and interactions with others.
552	18458	7	3	I remember the time I got my new puppy we had to be patient. We had to be patient because, he wasnít fully potty trained yet and he was crazy. My dog is a Border Collie and they are known for herding cows. So whenever we used to go outside he would bite our shoes. I donít know why he would try to herd us, but he did. We had to be very patient when we trained him, it took until he was a year and a half years old to figure out that he wasnít supposed to do that. But my dog is still growing into new habits. We just have to stay calm and patient, and then we are able to train him. It takes a long time for a dog to develop his habits, so we must stay patient. This is the time when I was patient.
553	18459	7	3	"My mom woke me up early in the morning and said I need to get up and get ready fast. I asked what was the matter and she said were going to Potter Park Zoo. I didn't know why, maybe just a sudden idea. I got all dressed and we hit the road. I wasn't feeling well that morning. We got Subway breakfast. I didn't eat my sandwich though because my stomach hurt too bad. It seemed like hours before we finally got there. I was feeling better now. We paid and got a map and started looking at all the awesome animals. I got to see giant wolves, snakes, monkeys, lions, peacocks, camels, and a lot of other animals. It was so fun! We got to this bird cage that you can go in, the birds were just flying around loose! There was a little boy in there and a bird landed right on the top of his head! Then my mom's phone rang. It was my brother. He said he stayed home because he didn't want to get up. I could barely hear my mom over the birds. She walked out and stood outside, I followed her. She was saying, ""No, because I said so you don't need to go anywhere."" Next thing I knew she was hanging up. We walked toward the fish building when her phone rang again. ""Don't ever hang up on me again! Get home, I don't want to fight with you! It's going to storm, I want you home!"" Suddenly, it started pouring rain and my mom was still on the phone. I was getting very wet and bored, I really wanted to see the fish. About three minutes later, my mom hung up her phone. We walked in, soaked wet. My mom smiled at me and said, ""Thanks for being so patient!"""
554	18460	7	3	I time I was patient is when we had to do mcap teats. I was one of the first ones done so I had to sit quitly and read. I read most of my book. It took about an hour for evrey one to finish. it was vary long time to read. I got board but I sat quite so people could finish, and so I wouldent be disrptintt. Thean when evry one finshed we took a batheroom brack. After the bathroom break, we gathered back in the classroom to continue with the rest of the day's activities. Despite the boredom I felt while waiting, I was glad that I remained patient and considerate towards my classmates. It was a good lesson in practicing patience and understanding in a group setting.
555	18461	7	3	One operation I remember vividly from my childhood is when I had to undergo surgery. It all started when my mom and cousin Cindy were engrossed in a conversation, and I patiently waited for them to finish before asking my mom if I could go ride my bike. Despite my excitement, my mom reminded me to wait my turn, which I did. I proudly mentioned to my mom that I could ride without training wheels, which prompted her concern due to my upcoming surgery. As I waited for the surgery, I anticipated what it would entail. The surgery turned out to be an interesting experience, and I found it to be quite enjoyable.
556	18463	7	3	I test my patience when I was waiting for a bus. You know if you have patience if you wait for a long time, and at one point, you will know if you have patience or not. I will be strong and patient, but I can also get impatient at times. You will never be entirely patient because there will always be situations that test your patience. I was at a crowded bus terminal, and I had to be patient to see the bus arriving. When I got impatient, I had to wait for a week to get food so I could have some time to do what I wanted. That's how I learned to be patient.
557	18464	7	3	There was a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when my cousins @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3 were playing the wii. And I said I play winner @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON2 won and @PERSON1 didnít give me the controller and she wasnít sharing. @CAPS1 then I said she could play one more time then its my turn, instead she played four more times @CAPS1 I said @PERSON1 its my turn you played and I didnít, she said ìit is not your turn.î @CAPS1 then her mom said ì@PERSON1 you can play @NUM1 more minutes then its @CAPS2ís turnî one hour thirty minutes past and she still didnít give it to me @CAPS1 then I said @PERSON1 its my turn, and Iíve been patient for a long time you either give it to me or Iím going to take it, she still didnít it to me. Iíve been getting ready and you still didnít share @CAPS1 then she said Iím tired of it anyways. And thatís the time Iíve been patient. Despite being patient for a long time, my cousin @PERSON1 continuously refused to share the controller, even after multiple reminders and extended periods of play. Ultimately, she gave up and declared she was tired of it, ending the situation where patience was tested.
558	18465	7	3	One time I was patient was when I had to go to the doctor to take my shot for sixth grade. I didn't want to go but I had to go, I didn't have a choice. So, I got in the car and we drove to the doctor's office. Finally, we arrived. My mom had to sign in and we sat down. Even though I was waiting for three hours, I didn't complain about it. The doctor finally came out, and I got scared but also happy that it was finally my turn. However, he called a different name, so my mom and I kept on waiting in the waiting room. Despite the long wait, I didn't complain. My mom noticed and mentioned how I was showing more maturity and patience. Eventually, the doctor called my name, and we went into the room. The doctor noted how much I had grown since my last visit. I asked if the shot would hurt, and the doctor reassured me that it wouldn't. I closed my eyes and imagined something nice as the shot was administered. I didn't even feel it, proving the doctor right. I thanked the doctor for being the best in the whole wide world, and he reciprocated with a kind response. It was a lesson in patience and maturity for me, and I handled the situation calmly and bravely.
559	18466	7	3	"I remember the time when my older sister was so patient for her birthday on the fourth of @DATE2. She was always calm and composed whenever I asked her if she could wait until her birthday. She would simply reply, ""Yes, I can wait until my birthday. It's not long now, just until the fourth of @DATE2."" Her excitement and anticipation were palpable as she eagerly counted down the days. She spent time with her friends, went shopping for herself, and enjoyed the festive atmosphere with fireworks in the air. It was a joyous occasion, and her patience truly paid off. That's how my sister demonstrated remarkable patience and made her birthday celebration even more special."
560	18467	7	3	"Ahh! I screamed in my mind. Baby sitting my cousin took a lot more patience. ( more her than me) @CAPS1 all at started on a @DATE1 @TIME1 my family went to go do some drink (I stayed behind to work on my homework) A little after my mom left I heard a knock on the door.  My aunt come in and whispered ""you most??? @CAPS1 was okay is if I left @CAPS2"" @CAPS3 I replied  ""okay"" @CAPS4 was asleep for about half- an hour. When I woke up @CAPS4 was @CAPS5 started crying. First thing I did was pick her up and carry her around. Still @CAPS4 was crying! @CAPS3 I thought her cloth need changing. I changed her cloth and??? Keeps crying. Now I had to keep my patience though because who would yell at a baby. Then I thought @CAPS4 was hungry. I didn't know how to make a bottle though @CAPS3 I had to read??? (@CAPS4 had no patience all @CAPS4 want was  her bottle) @CAPS5 when I was about to lose my patience I made a bottle bat sure if @CAPS1 was good) but @CAPS4 drank @CAPS1. Finally I put her back to sleep (if @CAPS4 cried one more time. I would do finally lose my patience) @CAPS6 @CAPS4 was sleeping @CAPS4 looked in peaceful until @CAPS4 woke up. @CAPS4 started crying again (this time I knew why because @CAPS4 likes to be carried).By the time my aunt came back my hands hare sore. Although at the end of the day I figured out, that you need a lot of patience to take care of a baby you need way more patience for a younger brother though trust me)."
561	18468	7	3	"I have been patiently waiting for my advocate to buy me some pens for many years now. Every day, without fail, I ask him if he has done his daily shopping yet. Each time, the answer is the same: ""no."" I remind him that he still owes me those pens from a previous occasion, but he always tells me to be patient. My patience is wearing thin, but I continue to wait in anticipation."
562	18471	7	3	"Have you ever had to wait in line to get on the biggest roller coaster at a theme park? Have you ever waited until all your chores are done before you can play with your best friend? Have you ever had to wait for your little brother or sister to catch up? Well, in this story I will tell you about one time that I had to be patient. During a visit to the doctor to get shots for safety, I had to wait in a room for my name to be called. It was quite boring! I kept thinking, ""How long does it take for a few people to get shots so I can leave?"" I had to sit there for about half an hour until my name was finally called. Once in the back room, I had to wait even longer for my mom to sign papers and for the doctor to prepare the shots as per my mom's instructions. But in the end, I was able to go home and play with my friend. This is just one of many instances where I had to practice patience. Despite the waiting, I still got to enjoy time with my friend. Patience truly pays off in the end."
563	18472	7	3	I was patient when I was waiting for a chance to go to Chicago. I really wanted to go see the Windy City because my mom went there. I tried to forget about it until I went. It kind of worked but once in a while, it came back to me. Although I did stay patient and I didnít bug my parents about it once. It took a few years, but I kept my patience. Sometimes I even forgot I forgot about it. I just lived every day as if I didnít care about Chicago. No matter how tempting it was seeing a Bulls or Blackhawks game on TV, I kept my cool. Then it happened in July, and it was finally happening and I was still patient! So, to put it in a nutshell, no matter how long it took, I would be patient.
564	18473	7	3	It was a sunny day when my sister turned six years old. The party was held at a beautiful park, with colorful decorations adorning the tables. My mom was busy styling my sister's hair, and I eagerly waited for my turn. Impatiently, I made a snarky comment but eventually sat down to have my hair curled. As the day went on, we had the bowling alley all to ourselves, and I eagerly waited for my turn to play. After what felt like ages, I finally got to bowl, but the waiting continued for cake time. Frustrated with the waiting, I rudely interrupted my sister's present-opening, only to be scolded and forced to sit out. Looking back, I realized that if I had been more patient throughout the day, I would have enjoyed all the activities without any issues. Patience truly is a virtue, and I learned that the hard way on my sister's birthday.
565	18474	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I had to train my dog. ìSit boy,î I command to my puppy. My dog, instead of sitting, runs at me, jumps, and grabs the treat out of my hand. I go and try to grab the treat back from him, and he gulps it down. While walking to grab his collar and take him for a walk, he bolts away. After chasing him for hours, he finally stops and looks at me, waiting to run again. ìCome here, Iím done chasing you, let's just go for a walk, please,î I say as I slowly lose my patience. I begin to walk toward him again very slowly. I get close enough to grab his collar, but then the dog bolts again, just leaving a bunch of dust behind. ìI'm done!î I scream and walk away with anger. I go to my room, ready to sleep. The next morning, I get up and go outside to try and train the dog. I lost my patience yesterday and stormed off, but today I'm ready to work hard and keep my patience. ìCome!î I yell, waiting for my dog to stop running, and he does. With my first command, I tell the dog to sit, and he does not, so I don't give him the treat. I say it again, and he sits! Finally, some progress after that waiting. I give him the treat, and he starts wagging his tail. To see if he understood, I say it again. He sits again and gets another treat. After that work with my dog, I begin to ask him to do more things. Sometimes he doesn’t listen, and sometimes he does. That was a time when I was patient with my dog to teach and train him, and it definitely paid off.
566	18475	7	3	One time when I was patient was when we flew in the @LOCATION2 to visit my sister at the I asked school. We flew to @LOCATION4 well and the to @ORGANIZATION1 but after that it was down hill. When we got to @LOCATION3 we were stuck there for four hours! after an hour I got bored with my little brother with us didnít help at all. Then over the intereem we hear that we have to go through security now and sit in a room with a gift shop ??? all for @NUM1 hurs. When there was an hour left there was another announcement and it was that we will be delayed three more hours, after that I was listening to my ipod and luckily fell asleep for three and a half hours. When we finally get to leave we walk up to six seater phase for us to fly to a small island near by. When we got to @LOCATION1 we hurry to the island school to see my sister. That was one time when I felt patient waiting in an airport for @NUM2 hours. On top of that, the delay was inconvenient and frustrating, but I managed to stay calm and composed throughout the ordeal. It was a test of my patience, but in the end, it was worth it to finally reach our destination and be reunited with my sister.
567	18476	7	3	@CAPS2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2  @CAPS3‚Äù I can hear the clock ticking, probably to annoy me. I can feel the tension in the small classroom building. Everybody is on the edge of their chairs waiting; why does @CAPS4 seem so long? It's almost @NUM1 minute now. The aroma of pepperoni pizza is so strong that I can practically taste it. This is agony. My stomach rumbles; I am so hungry. Can I wait for @NUM2 seconds? I'm not sure. The tension of the whole class is so great; I think my brain will erupt. I can't take this; it's too much. My eyes flash nervously to the @NUM4 seconds; it seems like an eternity. @NUM5 - why is time so short? I am not a patient person at all. Do I have any patience at all? If I do, I'm not seeing it now. I'm about to jump out of my seat as if I'm ejected from a rocket. I'm trying to hold still, but anxiety is getting to me. If I knew I'd be this anxious for lunch, I would have had breakfast. We're down to @NUM6 seconds now. My excitement grows, but so does the tension. It's enough to crush me now. I think I might just make a run for it. My stomach rumbles again, louder this time, begging for food, no, demanding it. ‚Äú@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,‚Äù the clock mocks me, taunting me. @NUM8 seconds - I can't bear this much longer. I think I am about to snap. I don't handle patience well. It's like a ticking bomb inside me, just waiting to go off in @NUM9 seconds. It seems the bomb and the clock are counting down together, both anticipating my snap. I'll show them. My will is stronger than my need. I can do this. I will prove I have patience. ‚Äú@CAPS10!‚Äù Finally, the bell goes off, signaling lunchtime. I zoom out like a squirrel who just sat on a snow cone, eager to finally satisfy my hunger.
568	18477	7	3	Some people have a lot of patience. I am one of those people. I have had a lot of patience in my life. We were driving to @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 and I was getting antsy. I knew this would be a hectic day for my mom so I decided to be patient and read. Before I knew it, we were there. I was waiting to get a lemonade with my mom and we had already been waiting here for @NUM1 minutes. I was starting to get tired of waiting in this long line for a little lemonade. But I knew my mom had already had a tiring day because my sister wouldn't stop complaining. So instead of complaining, I stopped thinking about how long it would take to get our lemonade. I started thinking about what it would be like to ride the @CAPS2 and the next thing I knew we had our lemonade. I was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @CAPS3 hawk because it was so long. I was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was @NUM2 seconds long. But then I remembered that my mom was with me and she had a bad headache. So I shut my mouth. I was glad that I was patient that day. Because if I hadn't been, my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at the end of the day.
569	18478	7	3	One time that I was patient was when we went to an amusement park. We had to wait in line for half an hour to get on the cork screw ride. Despite my excitement to go on the ride, I decided to be patient. Finally, after waiting for what felt like an eternity, I hurried up and got on the ride. Even though standing in line for that long was not enjoyable, it taught me the value of patience.
570	18479	7	3	"On @CAPS1 while I was fishing in Little Traverse Bay for salmon, there was a tremendous hit on the trolling line. I lunged from where I was sitting like a rocket, heaved on the line, and waited. At first, I thought it was a false alarm (snag), but I quickly realized I was wrong. The pull on the line did a dance, then bent rapidly once again. ""Fish on,"" I yelled to my cousin, who ran back to my aid. We both stared at the water, the pole still flexed and unmoving. I scanned the water, half expecting to see a tumbleweed roll by, feeling like I was in an old Western movie standoff. Finally, I turned to my cousin and asked, ""I have been patient, do you think I should reel him up?"" ""Let me get the net first,"" he responded, grabbing it and adding, ""When you are ready.""  Slowly, I cranked the handle on the reel, pulling the fish up from the murky depths. Suddenly, the steel cable that was my line shot from the reel like a bullet, only to be met with a sharp jerk from the fish. The line went slack, and my cousin and I knew what had happened. The fish that I thought was going to be mine was now swimming off into deeper waters, frustrating more fishermen with its patient ways."
571	18480	7	3	Quite a few times my mom has been very patient with me. I tend to tell my mom stories about my day at school when I come home. Once when we were sitting there in the living room, I was telling my mom the story. As I go on and on my mom has the patience to listen to it. Though the story @MONTH1 have been boring for her, and extremely long, she listened, she made coments and never showed a sign of boredom. The expression on her face made me happy to know she was listening. My mom's patience and attention make me feel valued and loved, and I am grateful for her unwavering support and understanding.
572	18481	7	3	One time I was patient when I let a stranger cut in front of me to get some food. I noticed the person looked hurried and stressed, so I decided to be understanding and allow them to go ahead of me in line. Additionally, when me and my brother both had to use the bathroom, I let him go first even though I was first in line. I knew he was in a rush, and I didn't mind waiting a bit longer. It felt good to show patience and consideration towards others in these small acts of kindness.
573	18482	7	3	"Patience is a very hard thing to capture. The way I think of it, patience it is a gift to have. One time I had to try and test my patience was before a big football game. One part was driving there. It was busy and people were migrating to the stadium! It took us hours to go just a few miles! I was about ready to just run to the game! ""Patience is key!"" my dad kept reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the traffic I had to wait another hour before the game! How could I wait that long? Would it be possible? I just sat there in a lawnchair watching people drive by our tailgate on college game day. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and get to the stadium so bad! Finally, we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking up with all the excited fans and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line just trying to be patient. Again, I had to question myself if I could be patient enough. One by one, people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my patience. When it was finally my turn, I just ran right in, so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my patience throughout the day. It was great to finally be in there, having overcome my rushed feeling and letting patience take over me."
574	18484	7	3	I was very patient one time when my grandma was in the store, taking her time to browse through the aisles and pick out items. Despite my urgent need to use the bathroom, I held back my frustration. I started to feel irritated, thinking that the cashier was intentionally going slow to prolong our time in the store. However, I remained composed because most of the items in the basket were mine. In the end, I realized that patience was indeed a virtue, and I managed to get through the situation without causing any unnecessary conflict.
575	18485	7	3	Every year we have a family reunion for two weeks. Cousins, aunts, uncles come all across the country to enjoy these few weeks together. We go to the small town of Greenfield right next to famous Greenfield State Park. The only problem is its a four hour drive, and if you know me Iím not that patient. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me she is the most impatient! But once you get there everybody is happy to see to wait for the start of our annual family reunion. And that's my story being patient.
576	18488	7	3	One time I had to be very patient. I had to wait five hours for my grandma to get to my house. Every hour I would go look outside to see if she was there. Eventually she did, and I was very happy. Some examples to help stay patient are focusing on something else, going to someone's house for a while, or even taking a nap. These strategies can help make the waiting process more bearable and help maintain a sense of calm and composure while waiting for something or someone.
577	18489	7	3	My grandma's patience is truly remarkable, especially when she takes the time to teach me new skills like sewing, baking, and cooking. Whether it's showing me how to change the thread on a sewing machine, frosting sugar cookies, making caramel corn, or baking delicious treats, she always remains calm and understanding, even when I make mistakes or move too slowly. Her unwavering patience and gentle guidance have helped me learn and improve, and for that, I am truly grateful. I am lucky to have such a patient and loving grandma in my life.
578	18490	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was going on the raptor at Cedar Point. There was a two-hour line, and my friend and I were getting bored. There was some music playing, but it didnít really amuse us. However, I had never been on the raptor before, and I was really thrilled to go on it. One hour dragged by, and then finally, there were only ten more minutes left until I got to go on the raptor. When I finally got on the ride, it was the best experience ever.
579	18491	7	3	When they had no idea when to get inside and how to protect their food. Our time is way easier than in the old days, they had to work hard at everything what everything is given to us. Our two time periods are a lot different. There arenít to many days where I am patient but this day was one of them. I was playing a football game on a great sunny @DATE1 @TIME1. I was starting quarterback and I scored @NUM1 touchdowns and I passing touchdown just in the first half. At that point we were up @NUM2 and the coaches took out all the starters for the whole second half. I was expecting to still play but nope they told me to sit the bench for the rest of the game. This was very hard for me because I had to wait until the game was over to get up off the bench. Iím not a very patient person so this was @CAPS1 hard for me. I hope Iíll never have to do that again. It was a challenging test of my patience, but I learned to accept the decision and support my team from the sidelines.
580	18492	7	3	I was patient before; I went hunting with my dad before, @DATE1. I was in the blind with him for a long time, waiting for deer to come in. He said they come in at night, or towards late afternoon. We waited forever, when they finally came in, me and did not get one. Some other guys shot one they all ran away. We waited maybe, ten more minutes, and then went in we were all there from @TIME1 until @NUM1. I was patient the whole time. As the sun began to set, the forest came alive with the sounds of nocturnal creatures emerging from their daytime hideouts. Despite not getting a deer that day, the experience of spending quality time with my dad in the peaceful wilderness was truly priceless.
581	18494	7	3	"One day, me and my parents went fishing. Our fish finder was going off like crazy but no fish were biting. It got to the point where our dog would bark like crazy whenever we started to reel in our lines, even if there was nothing on them. We waited, and waited, and waited, but still nothing came. Every once in a while we'd have to move again because of the current. After we'd been sitting there for hours on end, I felt something on my line. I thought at first I was snagged on a rock, but as I started to reel in, the line came a little, then I reeled some more, and it felt like a fish pulling on my line. I called out, ""Mom, dad, I think I have a fish!"" My dad told me what to do. Eventually, I felt like my arms were going to fall off, but the fish came into view! While dad got the net and pulled the fish out of the water, I asked, ""What kind is it?"" He said, ""It's a walleye."" I didn't know what to say. My first walleye! And dad even said it was big enough to keep! So, we went home, filleted the fish, and had walleye for dinner. It was a successful fishing trip after all."
582	18495	7	3	It was a boring day at school when my friend came in on crutches, informing me that she had broken her leg and couldn't hang out for a month. I patiently waited for her to recover, helping her around school in the meantime. As weeks went by, she finally got rid of the crutches and cast, and I was thrilled to see her back on her feet. I even got her a gift to celebrate her recovery. Patience paid off, and I was glad to have supported my friend through her injury.
583	18496	7	3	I am the type of person who you would call impatient, but I will try to explain it in the best way I can. The only time I am patient is when something exciting on TV comes on. My friends are always patient for everything else, but I am never patient.
584	18497	7	3	"@PERSON2, get down here I need you to open an envelope! My mom said. We sprinted downstairs because an envelope can only mean a report card, letter, gift card, or checking account balance. We got downstairs and we saw they had a camera out, and the envelope had a star on the back that said @NUM1 radio. We opened it and it says congratulations, you won tickets to @NUM2 first @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with @PERSON1! I was just looking at them in awe, my sister was freaking out! Then, my mom told me that my aunt is going with us! Surprise just kept coming and coming. Another huge surprise was the lines about @NUM3 girls were lined up at the front doors of the @CAPS4 oak music @PERSON3. Then security started to move and spread all the girls out, we got pushed about a quarter mile away from where we were standing. @NUM4 1/2 hours later we were waiting, then I see this boy's head pop out a window of the music @PERSON3 and say, ""Hey girls!"". After he said that about @NUM5 girls went crazy screaming. @NUM6 1/2 hours later from that, they started to let people in. The theater was cozy and warm for being out in the cold for @NUM7 hours. It felt good. Iyaz was the special guest to get us warmed up for @PERSON1. When he got out, every girl was screaming their lungs out! He sang at the concert and it was a great experience for my first concert ever!"
585	18498	7	3	One day during the summer, my phone rang. Not many people call my cell phone. I dashed to my room, but my phone was nowhere in sight! Oh where is it? I swear, I was about to completely tear everything down. I stopped, felt my back pocket, and there it was. I felt like such an idiot, freaking out over my phone because I couldn't find it when it turned out to be in my back pocket. Anyways, it was still ringing, and when I saw that it was my friend, I answered the phone. She wanted to know if we could have a sleepover in her backyard. I was so excited, but that same day my family and I were going to a fair. I asked my dad, and after some hesitation, he said yes. I packed my bags, hopped in the car, and we were off to the fair. All I could think about was how much fun I was going to have at my friend's house. After some time at the fair, we finally headed to my friend's place. I couldn't contain my excitement and immediately let her know that I had arrived. Despite the waiting, I was thrilled to finally be at my friend's house, ready for a fun sleepover.
586	18499	7	3	"Tap, tap, tap. The tips of my fingers bounced off the armrest with every movement. I had asked my sister to hurry up; I wouldn't be late. I had told her a million times before, ""You know how much being on time for practice means to me."" I sat there slumped over on the couch, my backpack strapped tightly over my shoulders. This happened all the time; I thought she would have learned by now. As I waited, I turned on the television to keep me busy. Unfortunately, with every flip, I became more irritated. ""Where is she? Why is she taking so long?"" Thoughts like these swirled in my head.   Then, my sister finally came stumbling into the family room. She snatched her keys, and we hurried into the car. As I snapped my seatbelt into place, I flipped the switch to open the garage. As I sat in my seat, wiggling, the garage door creaked open. My sister started the engine, and we cascaded down the driveway and towards the road. Just to make my luck even better, we got caught in traffic. As the cars sauntered along, time was ticking away. The clock showed 3:00, and I knew for sure that I wasn't going to make it on time. I threw myself back into the seat, closed my eyes, and took deep breaths. Taking lots of deep breaths helped slow down my heart rate, which allowed me to tone down my stress level. ""Be patient,"" I told myself. ""Relax, you'll make it there.""   Suddenly, my sister slammed onto the brakes. My eyes flew open to see that we had made it to the pool. The time read 3:15. I was going to make it! I exploded out of the car with my bag on my back. At that moment, I told myself, ""See, you can do it. You made it to swim practice, and all you had to do was slow down and be patient. Great job."""
587	18500	7	3	I was patient when it was my birthday and I didnít get anything. I thought I would get at least one thing but I got nothing. I didnít do anything wrong but still I got nothing. The next day I got nothing I didnít ask for anything but I still got nothing. The next day I got nothing. But that night while it was skating at skate port, I saw my cousin and she gave me money for my birthday. I thought that everyone forgot but I was wrong. I was so happy too. I had to be patient in order to get something and donít have to ask for something. And in the end, my patience paid off, and I received a thoughtful gift from my cousin that made my birthday special despite the initial disappointment.
588	18501	7	3	The power went out in our house one day when my aunt was watching me. We thought we blew a fuse, but after trying to fix it, we realized it was a bigger issue. My aunt tried calling my mom, but the connection was lost. We had to rely on a generator for a week, and it was frustrating. Finally, after some time, we were able to get in touch with family members, and we had to be patient while waiting for the power to come back on.
589	18502	7	3	I've been waiting for like two hours. When am I going to get my food? I was hungry so I told my mom, and she asked me if I wanted to go out. I said sure and went to get my jacket on. Mom said I had to go get dad, so I waited in the car for them for like a few minutes. When they finally got out, dad asked if I was ready, and we headed out. When we arrived, there were no other stores open. Inside, the place was packed with what seemed like a billion people. I was famished, feeling like I could eat a pig, metaphorically speaking. We went to the chicken area and inquired about the wait time. The guy at the counter mentioned it would be about two hours. After about an hour, I picked up a magazine to pass the time, noticing some people leaving, but unfortunately, the ones in front of us took their seats. Although we were next in line, it still took another hour before we could sit down. Despite my hunger and impatience, I remained silent throughout, which was unusual for me as I tend to talk a lot. It was a test of my patience, but I made it through without complaining. And that was the time I displayed exceptional patience.
590	18503	7	3	One time I was patient was I went to the doctors office. Yesterday I went to the doctors office and the waiting room was so full that we had to stand. Because there were so many people waiting we had to wait along with them. We were number @NUM1, and it took us @NUM2 hours just to get to sit down! It took a lot of patience because the waiting room time + the time waiting for a doctor about @NUM3 hours. When I finally got in I felt @NUM4 relieved!

591	18504	7	3	Patience can be challenging, especially when you are filled with excitement. It can be difficult to remain calm and composed, especially when you are eagerly anticipating something. This is similar to when a family member is speaking to you, and you are eagerly waiting for something else. In these moments, practicing patience is essential. It requires self-control and the ability to wait calmly without getting frustrated. While it may be hard, patience is a virtue that can bring about positive outcomes in various situations.

She said you have to be patient. I told her I will but when she said as soon as possible like on @DATE1 . I said Iíll be patient till then and will not bug you about it. Thatís one time I had to be patient. I understand her reasons for making me wait, but I can't help but feel excited for the day I finally get my own phone. I'll try my best to be patient until then, knowing that good things come to those who wait.
593	18506	7	3	One time me and my dad were at a store.There was a line about five people ahead of us, and my dad and I were starting to get impatient. I told myself to calm down and wait, but I was still feeling agitated. Then, the very first person in line finished their transaction and left. As the line started moving, I felt myself beginning to relax and just waited for the next person to go. It taught me the importance of patience in situations like these, and how sometimes, all it takes is a little bit of time for things to fall into place.
594	18507	7	3	My finger tips were icy as I sat and waited. The seconds tarried into minutes, turned into hours. My body heat escaping rapidly like sand in the winds.

I should have waited, wait have I shoulded. The words mixed together. My bones cold, I was only about ten yards from home. My legs refused to walk as they shuddered violently. Wait, be patient, I reminded myself. A cop car in my parents' driveway. I shoved my left leg through the mess of leaves and mud, patience wasn't a factor right now. Nine yards, eight, seven, six. I stopped, pulled my hood over my head but the wind and rain blew it off again, five, four, three, two, one. I was at my doorstep. I weakly raised my hand to knock. The door burst open.

Once you sit down you can't move. So I was sitting very still for 10 minutes and finally, I saw a squirrel. I took my shotgun and shot her in the chest. I was patient, so I got a squirrel. So that's my story on patience.  As I sat there waiting, my heart raced with excitement and anticipation. Every rustle of leaves or snap of a twig made me hold my breath, hoping it was the squirrel I had been waiting for. The minutes felt like hours as I remained perfectly still, not wanting to scare off my target.  When I finally spotted the squirrel, my hands trembled with nerves as I raised my shotgun. I took a deep breath, steadied my aim, and pulled the trigger. The shot rang out through the quiet woods, and I watched as the squirrel fell to the ground.  I felt a rush of pride and accomplishment as I walked over to retrieve my prize. It was a small victory, but it taught me the value of patience and perseverance in hunting. I learned that sometimes, the best things come to those who wait.

It was too small so he threw it back and continued fishing. The lake was quiet that day, with a small breeze in the @DATE2 air. Despite the peaceful surroundings, @PERSON1 had yet to get a bite after an hour of waiting.   As they took a break to eat lunch, enjoying sandwiches, chips, and water, @PERSON1 remained hopeful.

However, as I have matured, I have come to understand the importance of patience. It is crucial to listen to others and wait for the right moment to receive what we desire. Patience allows us to appreciate the details and not rush through life. Enthusiasm is different from patience, as it is about excitement rather than waiting. It is essential to teach children the difference and help them understand the value of patience. Ultimately, patience is a virtue that can lead to better understanding and fulfillment in life.
605	18518	7	3	Once before I went to Cape Point with my friend, I demonstrated patience at every turn.

My patience extended to enjoying all the rides without complaint. Another instance that tested my patience was when I had to visit the hospital for an echocardiogram. Despite the anxiety of waiting for the results, I remained calm and composed. This trait of patience also manifested when I traveled to an airport. I patiently navigated through security, waited onboard the plane, and endured the wait for my luggage upon arrival. Even in everyday situations like waiting for lunch at school or for classes to conclude, I consistently exhibit patience. While there may be moments of impatience, overall, I have cultivated a patient demeanor in various circumstances.

After two hours of waiting in line, we saw a sign that said one hour more to go at @ORGANIZATION1. Frustrated, I kept telling myself it's the best ride, I can wait an hour longer, so I did. When we finally got on the ride, it was indeed fun, but the ride was only @NUM2 seconds long.

Once on board, I thought, okay, this is the last plane we have to take today. But then the pilot said it was to be a nine-hour flight. Then I looked around to see what I had to do. I had my iPod, a book, and the in-flight entertainment system in front of me. Once we were in the air, I thought I would take a nap. But that only killed an hour, so then I decided to watch a movie. I watched ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" which took off another two hours. By then, I was starting to get bored. I decided I would read. But after an hour and a half, I finished the book. Then my iPod came out. I listened to music until lunch came an hour later. After eating lunch, which took 30 minutes, I decided to watch another movie. I watched ""Forrest Gump,"" which killed off enough two hours. Then with only two hours left, I wanted to watch season three of The Office.

Finally, when my teacher handed back the assignments, I saw my name and was ecstatic. I quickly scanned the paper to find my grade, hoping for the best. As I waited patiently to see my grade, my heart was racing with anticipation. I was relieved and grateful when I finally saw the grade I had received. It was a moment of pure joy and satisfaction.
632	18547	7	3	Being patient is like being a good person. If you are patient, then good things will happen to you. Some patient people get good opportunities like job promotions, relationships, and success, but some impatience could bring you negative consequences. Therefore, practicing patience in various aspects of life can lead to positive outcomes and personal growth.
633	18548	7	3	Patience is truly a virtue that can be challenging to develop. It is a skill that requires mental strength and resilience. Patience is something that everyone will encounter at some point in their lives. Without patience, one may find themselves easily succumbing to feelings of anger and frustration. Take, for example, the miners who were trapped underground for two months - their survival depended on their ability to remain patient. Similarly, pursuing a college education takes several years of dedication and perseverance, necessitating a great deal of patience. Whether it is waiting for a desired toy or waiting for a divine intervention, patience is a quality that is essential and enduring. It is a fundamental aspect of human experience that will always play a significant role in our lives.
634	18549	7	3	This is a story of the time I was patient. It was four in the morning, I was in bed sleeping. It was dead silent. All of a sudden, I woke up to the sound of footsteps, it was my dad. Out of nowhere, my bright light flashed on and I squinted and put the blanket over my head. My dad yelled, ìitís time to go, Alex!î I replied ìokay!î I quickly flung out of bed, got dressed, ate breakfast, grabbed my bag and put it in the trunk of my momís car. It was the middle of summer, and we were on our way to the beach. I knew I had to be patient, so I popped a movie in the DVD player for me and my brother Adam to watch. It started to get lighter out and I was still watching movies while everyone else was asleep. Except for my dad of course, he was the driver. When everyone woke up we stopped for food and gas. I was very patient because I had to wait for everyone to wake up before I got to eat. After we ate we got back in the car and drove off. A couple hours later, we got to the beach. I was thrilled to get there, I burst out of the car and yelled ìfinally!î That was the story of how I was patient.
635	18550	7	3	The last time I was patient was yesterday. Because we had to go to the neighboring city to pick something up and it took about 30 minutes each way. Then on the way back, we spent another 30 minutes on the road. Both trips were quite boring, but I had to be patient. Also, just this morning, I had to be patient because my brother was taking a shower and I needed to use it. I had to wait because he takes like 15 minutes. Later in the afternoon, we were having chocolate milk, and my mom was making it. We had to be patient for her to finish preparing it.
636	18551	7	3	Patience is crucial in maintaining positive relationships with others. Without patience, it is easy to become frustrated and upset quickly, potentially leading to conflicts with friends and loved ones. By practicing patience, individuals can cultivate stronger connections and foster a more harmonious environment. Many times, impatience can hinder progress and cause unnecessary stress. In contrast, patience often paves the way for favorable outcomes and smoother interactions. Therefore, embracing patience can bring about numerous benefits in various aspects of life.
637	18552	7	3	Some times when people take a long time my family is patient. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is taking a long time plus all the whining from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load. In short, my family is really patient whether it's sitting in the office or deployed to a new country my family is always patient. My family members exemplify the virtue of patience in various situations, demonstrating resilience and composure in the face of challenges.
638	18553	7	3	Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patients at many things. Examples of losing patients can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever. Having patients can be a good thing. Your calm and you donít have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, because those people will struggle while waiting for something. In conclusion, I think that having patients will sometimes help you to succeed in life. If your un-patient than you should try not to be because the thing you want or your waiting for will eventually happen someday.
639	18554	7	3	It was a light breezy morning. It was summer, my parents were just finishing packing for our trip to A-Town because my sister had a lacrosse tournament in B-City. It was a terrifying thirteen-hour drive ahead of us. We started loading our suitcases into the van. My grandparents were coming along with us for the weekend, adding to the stress. Just as we were about to leave, I remembered we had a TV in the van. I quickly went back inside, unplugged my gaming console, grabbed the wires and controllers, and rushed back to the van. We set off on our journey, admiring the scenic mountains we passed along the way. After a couple of hours, tensions rose between my brother and sister, leading to arguments that needed to be settled. As we approached our destination, we decided to watch a movie to pass the time. The last hour flew by, and finally, we arrived at our destination. Patience was tested, but in the end, it was worth it for the adventure that awaited us.
640	18556	7	3	One time my uncle planned a fishing trip to a remote location. I didn't know about it until the last minute, but I was thrilled to go. We packed our bags and headed out early in the morning. The scenery on the way was breathtaking, with cliffs, hills, and even a bear sighting by the river.   Once we arrived, we wasted no time and started fishing. Although we didn't catch much at first, we enjoyed a delicious meal of roasted hotdogs over the fire. The next day, we tried our luck on the lake and the river, but still had no success. The owner of the cabin advised us to try for bigger pike, but the rain had made it challenging.   Despite our efforts, it wasn't until the final day that I had a thrilling encounter with a massive pike. It put up a tough fight, eventually snapping my line and escaping. It was a memorable experience, and even though we didn't catch as much as we hoped, the time spent in nature with family was priceless.
641	18557	7	3	Back when I was in about third grade I had to be really patient. I was at a @ORGANIZATION1 game. It was almost the seventh inning and I was ready to go onto the field. I had to wait a really long time. I had missed about an inning of the game already. When I was down there, there were about @NUM1 people. It was so crowded. My mom probably couldíve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time. It was so boring. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live t.v. I was one of them. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad. People were sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. The reason I was happy though is because I got to go onto the field. It was an experience I will never forget.
642	18558	7	3	For some people it is as hard as a rock, but to some it just comes naturally. Patience is a big part of hunting. You must be tolerant and understanding. Even if things seem to take a turn for the worst. Take this for example. I had woke up at six and jumped out of bed. I was finally going to shoot my first deer! I pulled on my camofage and hunterís orange as my grandpa drove down my long drive way to get me. The moon light shone bright and I was giggling with exitment, but I knew I had to calm down. As we drove to the place I was going to hunt I was amazed by how quite evreything was. We walked back to the blind on a leaf covered trail and set evrething in itís place. After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up. We always had tomarrow. So that was the end of our hunt. We had an exiting time, and it was all because of patience. Patience not always help in ways you wish, but it can help you see many diffrent and beautiful things. In the end, patience is key in hunting, allowing you to appreciate the natural beauty around you and savor the experience, even if the desired outcome is not always achieved.
643	18559	7	3	One time @CAPS1 mom took a test to become a @CAPS2. That means certified nursing assistant. After she took the test she was very nervous. She waited and waited. A phone call would come very soon but she had to have patients. The first day she took the test it was very hard to have patients. I understoond because I get that feeling when Iím waiting for test results. It is nerve racking and exciting. The next day was not as hard. She just went on with her day. The third day of waiting she started wondering if the call would come. Later that day the phone rang. A smile spread across her face. She had passed the test. This is a time @CAPS1 mom showed patients for three whole days!  Throughout those three days of waiting, @CAPS1 mom's perseverance and determination were truly admirable. The anticipation and nerves she felt could have easily overwhelmed her, but she remained patient and hopeful. Her unwavering patience paid off when she received the call confirming her success. This experience taught her the value of patience and persistence, qualities that are essential in her future career as a certified nursing assistant. Her dedication and resilience have undoubtedly set her on the path to success in her chosen field.
644	18560	7	3	"It can be really hard to be patient, depending on the effect. Even I lose my patience some times. But one time I was so patient that I was about to explode. On a dry @DATE1 day, my family and I decide to go on an exciting vacation to @ORGANIZATION1. We drove @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and headed east towards @ORGANIZATION1. After the boring road trip, we parked our silver mini van in a five dollar parking lot right next to the @ORGANIZATION1. First we went up the @CAPS1 tower, where we saw everything from the incredible height. After that we saw our cousins. I never even saw them before. As we were looking at the waterfall my brother said, ""@CAPS2, look at those boats under the waterfall. Dad, can we go on them?"" ""@CAPS3, but first we have to buy tickets."" @CAPS4 my dad. We bought the tickets and went in line."" @CAPS5 are there so much people?"" I asked. There was about @NUM1 people waiting in line with us. ""@CAPS6 be patient,"" my dad replied. I stood there looking at all the people in front of us. We were never going to get on the boat. I saw people handing out blue rain jackets. After @NUM2 minutes we still did not get the jackets yet. We were moving as slow as the plates on the earth were. Finally, we got a jacket, but we weren't on a boat yet. My brother was complaining and my dad started yelling at him. I was still standing, almost to explode. At last, they called us up onto the boat. It was amazing going under the waterfall. We were in the mist. When we came back to shore, we talked about how amazing it was. Being patient has a reward at the end. Even though it is hard to be patient, I still did it and anyone can. I was patient the whole time in line to get in the boat. Patience can be rewarding."
645	18561	7	3	In third grade, one day, it was one of the happiest days of my life. It was the day when we were going to get our dog, and I was excited and patient. It was a cold winter's day, and I couldn't wait for the school day to be over so we could bring our new family member home. When school ended, my mom picked up my sister and me, and we eagerly waited at home for my dad and our new dog to arrive. Finally, we heard the jingling of the door, and we all burst with excitement as we rushed outside to greet our beloved pet, the best dog in the world. That day, my patience paid off, and I was rewarded with a joy that I will never forget.
646	18562	7	3	It was a normal old boring day in the @DATE1 but I had just got a call from my sister in law. She literally just called me and asked if I wanted to go to Cedar Point the next day. I was astonished! I didnít know what to say! At first I thought she was joking, but when she asked to talk to my mom, I knew she was legit. When she was done talking to my mom, my mom too was in shock. I was so grateful I could not fall asleep. I ended up waking up at @NUM1 am and I was not too fond of that but it was totally worth it.  It was a long two hour drive but when we got there we bought our tickets and waited in line for the Maverick. The line was humongous but we waited. Halfway into the line, the ride broke down. I could not believe my eyes. Iíve wanted to ride that one forever. I was disappointed. We waited patiently for around @NUM2 @NUM3 hours, maybe @NUM4. I was hungry, tired, and baking in the sun. Once it opened up again we only had to wait like half an hour but all in all, it was worth it.  My sister in law @PERSON1 was very impressed with how patiently I waited. After the ride, we went to the car to get some food. It was the best food I had ever eaten. The rest of the day was tremendous but that was definitely the most patient I had ever been in my entire life. Due to the fact that it was just me and @PERSON1, I think thatís why I was so calm. Even though that part of the day kind of sucked, it was still overall a great time!
647	18563	7	3	This year, my mom married my new stepdad, and in an effort to bond, we decided to try trap shooting together. Even though I had never done it before, I was eager to give it a shot. With my stepdad's background as a former cop and his shotgun in hand, we headed out to the shooting range. Despite my initial struggles and numerous misses, I remained determined to improve. After a few failed attempts, I finally managed to hit a clay target, boosting my confidence. With each practice session, I focused on my technique and gradually saw progress. One day, as I carefully aimed and pulled the trigger, I watched in awe as the bird exploded into a cloud of dust. It was a moment of triumph that marked my improvement in the sport. Through patience and perseverance, I went from missing every target to hitting them consistently, surprising even myself. This experience taught me the value of persistence and the rewards that come with dedicated practice. I may have started off on the wrong foot, but with time and effort, I was able to turn things around and achieve success in trap shooting.
648	18564	7	3	A time when I was patience is when our family goes to @CAPS1 point. My family and I go to @CAPS1 point a lot. Usually, the lines are very long, sometimes over and hour! Once, on my first time on the @CAPS3, the wait was @NUM1 hours, but we went anyway. We were about @NUM2 hour in and then they had some technical difficulties. After about @NUM3 min, the line was moving again. When I got to ride it was really fun (although it only lasted @NUM4 seconds) A couple years later the new ride The @CAPS4 opened up and it looked very fun, but the line didnít. I am not sure how long we waited, but when we go to the end, and rode the ride, it was amazing.I was glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines. Even though the waiting was difficult, the end result was always worth it for the thrill and excitement of the rides at @CAPS1 point.
649	18565	7	3	Patience is a valuable quality that is becoming increasingly rare in today's fast-paced world. In a society where everything is expected to happen quickly, individuals who possess patience stand out for their ability to endure difficulties without complaint. Whether it be waiting in long lines or dealing with traffic jams, patient individuals are able to remain calm and understanding in challenging situations.   In a world where impatience seems to be the norm, it is important for people to cultivate patience in order to create a more peaceful and harmonious society. By learning to take deep breaths and stay calm in frustrating situations, individuals can develop the ability to handle stress and conflict with grace and understanding. If everyone were to practice patience, conflicts and misunderstandings would decrease, leading to a more perfect and harmonious world for all.
650	18566	7	3	Vincenta was walking one day and she saw her friend Maria. “Hey, Maria,” said Vincenta, “you know to call me Vinnie,” replied Maria. “Vinnie, my mom told me to make sure that these beans get to Jack. Would you do it for me?” Maria asked. “Sure, us folks of Greenfield always have each other's backs,” Vinnie assured. “Thank you! I have to go now! Bye!” Maria said as she ran off.  Vinnie walked over to Jack’s house and knocked on the door, but no one answered. So, she decided to go to Old Man Miller’s abandoned house. “I know! I’ll plant them here!” she thought to herself. Vinnie dug a hole and planted the beans. Several minutes later, she was still waiting. “Grow, darn it!” Vinnie yelled in frustration.  Just then, Maria’s brother Tony was passing by and scolded Vinnie. “Vinnie, why are you shouting so loudly? You're going to wake up my dad!” Tony exclaimed. “These stupid beans aren't growing, Tony,” Vinnie replied. “If you want to see beans, go to bed and they’ll be there when you wake up!” Tony told her before walking away.  The next day, Maria came by and exclaimed, “Oh my goodness, Vinnie!” Vinnie woke up and couldn’t believe her eyes. The beanstalk had grown all the way up to the two-story house. “You're incredible!” Maria praised. Suddenly, Vinnie woke up; it was all just a dream. She looked at the beans in disappointment.  A day later, still waiting, hungry and tired, Tony came by again. “Maria doesn’t know, does she? Come inside and forget about the seeds, Vinnie,” Tony suggested. “No way, Tony! Leave me alone!” Vinnie screamed. “You’re just going to upset yourself, Vinnie! Go away!” Tony stomped off once again.  After two days of waiting, the beanstalk finally sprouted. One bean produced a living creature that lasted only a few minutes before dying. The other bean turned out to be just a regular bean. Vinnie had mixed feelings about the whole experience. She asked herself, “Was it worth it?” Yes, it was, Vinnie decided.
651	18567	7	3	"Being patient is a very hard thing to do, most people are very bad at it but some are good. I am one of the people that are bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my entire life is wait in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at cedar point. It was a very hot and sticky summer day and cedar point was packed. There were flies everywhere, tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear, and even biting you. You could hear the screams from a mile away overweight people were wearing shorts and tank-tops, eating popcorn. It was brutal! I had riden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is the ride that takes you up to the very top and shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which I did, it was a three and a half hour wait! ""Can I just go ride the skyscraper again?"" I pleaded. ""No! You came all the way to Cedar Point; you are not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait!"" quickly replied. ""Fine! I never get what I want do I!"" ""You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms. Heck you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much!"" ""Well I don't want to put somebody else through that pain but you I might!"" By the time we were done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, we didn't get front cart but the wait wasn't even that bad. In the end, the thrill of riding the dragster was worth the wait and the arguments."
652	18569	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class on his project. We were doing a science project and this kid didnít understand anything about it. He would put things in the wrong place, write down things that didnít go with science, and he didnít listen to anything so he was correctly but he lost it! I couldnít beleive he lost all of our hard work! So we started over and I helped him more and was very patient with him. After three days we were almost done with it. When he was done putting the final touches on it he presented it and got an A+ on it; @CAPS1 he got an A+ on it, it made me feel so good and I got rewarded for my hard work and me being patient with him. To the end being patient makes you feel good and the person you helped feels good, too. This was a time when I was patient.   After putting in the effort and staying patient, the end result was rewarding for both of us. It showed me the power of patience and how it can lead to success in helping others. I felt proud of the hard work we put in, and it reinforced the importance of being understanding and supportive towards others, especially in challenging situations. Patience truly pays off in the end.
653	18570	7	3	"There once was a little girl named @PERSON2. @PERSON2 was the important girl in the land of narrative. Narrative was a little land filled with loving and patient people who waited for everything. And every child was patient but @PERSON2. @PERSON2 was an only child living with her mother and @CAPS12. @PERSON2 hated being the only child so her mother, @CAPS3, told her husband, @CAPS1, that they should have another child so that @PERSON2 would not be alone. Soon, they told @PERSON2 that @CAPS10 would be having a little brother or sister. @PERSON2 was very happy. In fact, @PERSON2 was so happy that she ran upstairs and began to make up baby names. Then she ran downstairs and shared them with her mother while rocking in her chair. ""I like Kevin,"" said @CAPS12 walking towards the dinner table where @PERSON2 and her mother were sitting. ""Ok,"" said @PERSON2, cleaning the table off. ""Do you like Emma, Sarah, Liam, Noah, or Olivia?"" she asked. ""I like Olivia,"" said @CAPS12, pushing in his chair. ""Me as well,"" said mother walking up the stairs to her bedroom. ""I can't wait till the baby gets here,"" said @PERSON2 on her way up the stairs.  The next morning, @PERSON2 woke up early to see if her mother had the baby yet. ""Have you had the baby yet?"" she asked her mother and @CAPS12. ""Not yet,"" said @CAPS12, ""the baby has to grow inside of mommy, okay?"" ""Okay,"" said @PERSON2. A few months later, Kerry got up very early screaming, ""It's here! The baby is coming!"" Mother lefted her head over her belly to see @PERSON2. ""That baby will never come, I hate that thing, I will be lonely forever,"" said @PERSON2 walking towards her bedroom. ""Be patient, @PERSON2, it will come,"" screamed @CAPS12 from the other room. ""It's a girl!"" said @PERSON2, very happy. An hour later, mother screamed from her bedroom, ""Oh, oh, oh!"" ""Are you okay, mommy?"" asked @PERSON2 walking in. ""The baby is coming, call your @CAPS12,"" said mother. Three hours later, dad came home, ran up the stairs, and went into his room. He saw @PERSON2, his wife @CAPS11, and the new baby @PERSON1 fast asleep. ""Told you, if you were patient, @PERSON2, the baby would come,"" said @CAPS12 to himself."
654	18571	7	3	Some stories when I was patient is when I needed teacherís help, grandma had surgery, wait for turn in sports, and wait for mom at work. When my grandma had surgery we waited for three hours. During that time I played chess with my aunt. I talked with them. We went to the gift shop there. Also we went to the mall. The teacher gave us home work (h.w.) and I did not understand a part. The teacher was helping a different person so I waited. I skipped the part came back by then the teacher could help me. Then I understood the homework. My mom took me to her job after school or I would have alone at home. While waiting I mopped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table. Talked with some of the employees and pasted time by walking back and forth. These are the stories about a time I was patient.
655	18572	7	3	A time when @CAPS2 dad was patient was when he had an important meeting with his boss. Despite the boss being late, @CAPS2 dad patiently waited for @NUM1 hours until the boss finally arrived. Even when the boss asked for more time to talk to @CAPS2 dad's wife, he remained calm and understanding. Eventually, after a long wait, the meeting concluded, and @CAPS2 dad's patience paid off. This incident showcased @CAPS2 dad's ability to stay composed and composed in challenging situations.
656	18573	7	3	"@CAPS1 @CAPS1 my cell phone buzzes in my pocket. Lexa, @CAPS2. I don't know if I can ever get over the fight that we had yesterday after she called me some names. I actually answered once and said, I need sometime @CAPS5 be patient. She definetly isn't listening. So, I decide to call her back. She picks up on the first ring.@CAPS3, Are you there?"" she sounds desperate to call  me the nickname she always has ''yes''  ''I'm sososososorry, I didn't mean it''. ''I told you I needed time and for you to be patient.'' I say almost in tears. ''I know but I can't be when I @CAPS5 hurt my best friend''. ''Patience means that you are understanding & tolerant about waiting without complain''. ''@CAPS4''.  ''@CAPS5 try to be patient and @MONTH1 be you wouldn't be complaining''.  ''@CAPS6'' she saysl then hangs up. Sure I think I am so mad that she thinks she can @CAPS5 can and it would be all better. She should've waited. I fonly she'd been patient.  I sit there, the weight of the argument heavy on my chest. Maybe I should have been more understanding, but the hurtful words still linger in my mind. Communication is key in any relationship, but sometimes it's hard to find the right words to express how we truly feel. Maybe with time, we can both learn to be more patient and understanding with each other. As I put my phone back in my pocket, I hope that we can eventually move past this and strengthen our friendship."
657	18574	7	3	One day, it was me and my mother going to the store when we needed to pick up my big brother from basketball practice. When we arrived, he wasn't outside waiting as expected. My mother began calling his phone repeatedly, but he wasn't answering. Despite the frustration, she decided that we would wait until he finished practice before leaving. This moment showcased my mother's incredible patience and determination to ensure that we were all safely together.
658	18575	7	3	There once was a time when someone I knew was patient. It was a cold day and I was at school. My teacher was very sick so we had a substitute. He was a very mean substitute. All of a sudden a kid started breathing heavy. He needed his inhaler. I told the sub the kid needed to get it but he said no. The person next to me said the same thing, but she was patient and said “okay” as the sub let the kid go. That was the time a person I know was patient. Another instance of her patience was when a classmate accidentally spilled water on her notes, and instead of getting upset, she calmly helped him clean it up without making a fuss. Her ability to remain composed and understanding in challenging situations truly showed her patience.
659	18576	7	3	"Patient! I was patient when I was waiting for my football game. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and I went to go get my shoulder pads, my helmet, and my pants for football. We woke up @CAPS3 early though we were going to be the first ones there I thought wrong. There were like @NUM1 people there. I was freaking out, man, freaking out! I said to my mom, ""you said we'll be early, you said we'll be the first ones here."" Well, wasn't she totally wrong. I was mad at her. We were the last people in line. All of the good helmets were gone. Mom said, ""you need to be patient like the other parents."" I tried to be patient. It wasn't working out well. I was impatient, I was yelling, saying, ""come on, we don't have time for you to be sitting around all day, we don't have time to waste."" When I got there, I said out loud, ""darn! The football stuff got mad at me."" I said, ""I hope they have my size for my football stuff."" Just what they didn't. I was mad and just what she said, ""come back tomorrow and we'll have your size."" Well, that's my story. I was kind of patient toward the end, but at the beginning, I was yelling. That shows you if you're not patient, you probably won't get what you're waiting all day for."
660	18577	7	3	"My favorite books, now a movie, I have to see it. Twilight eclipse, me and my mom were heading to the movie theater and I wouldn't stop talking about the movie. We drove into the parking lot and there was nowhere to park. My mom was about to leave before I said, ""There's one mom."" ""Sweet,"" she replied. Me and my mom had been waiting to see the bloodsucking movie for three months, and as we stepped into the building, we rushed to get the tickets and the food. The movie was going to start at 8 pm. I was going to start saying something, but I calmed myself down and used patience for three hours straight. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things to pass the time. It actually helped; the security said it was time for trivia. They asked a bunch of questions about the last movie, ""New Moon."" I raised my hand and answered the question right; I had a choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I got the pin. I was so excited; the movie was about to start. After the movie was done, me and my mom headed home and we fell asleep right when we got there. This was the story when I used patience."
661	18578	7	3	"Can we watch @ORGANIZATION1.? I looked at the clock. Five thirty. ""You'll have to wait,"" I said. ""@CAPS3 doesn't come on till eight."" ""But I want to watch @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, and @ORGANIZATION1,"" he persisted. Not again, I thought. Do we have to go through this every day? Why don't I still have ??? I walked slowly to my room, knowing I would have to keep him quiet until eight o'clock. ""Kumehnn, be quiet,"" I said, starting to get mad. "" @CAPS3 doesn't come on until eight, okay?"""
662	18579	7	3	I am never patient, whether it's waiting for dinner or waiting for a friend. The only exception is when I am eagerly anticipating the start of school. I can wait for hours, days, weeks, months, or even years for that. On the other hand, I struggle to wait for a friend's call as I always want to be doing something every second. I will anxiously run around the house until they finally call. When the phone does ring, I am quick to answer, sometimes even staring at the phone in anticipation. Surprisingly, I can also be patient when it comes to avoiding cleaning my room. I often try to stay out of the house until bedtime to delay the inevitable task. It seems my patience is selective, depending on the situation at hand.
663	18580	7	3	My cousin's patience stood out as we waited in line for the top thrill ride at Cedar Point. The hours dragged on, but she remained calm and composed, while I grew increasingly restless. Despite my fidgeting and complaints, she stayed quiet, abiding by a rule set by her mother that limited our talking to avoid homework consequences. In the end, her patience paid off, as I learned the value of waiting and composure.
664	18581	7	3	Being patient means that when you're in a bad situation, you don't complain. Some people aren't very patient, while others are very patient. In my eyes, patience is crucial. I like to think of myself as somewhat patient. Once, I had to be very patient when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to our destination. It was not a pleasant journey. One challenging aspect was always needing to use the restroom. When the privilege of stopping whenever needed was taken away, the desire to go increased. However, I reminded myself to be patient and that we would stop at the next available place. Another struggle was constantly feeling hungry and thirsty. We only stopped three times, and the food never seemed to be enough. Despite these challenges, I did not complain. Lastly, the anticipation of reaching our destination with sandy beaches and waves made the journey feel never-ending. It was a real test of patience, but I persevered. When we finally arrived, I realized that the trip had been a significant lesson in patience, and it wasn't as bad as the journey back.
665	18582	7	3	One day I went to the hospital where the nurses attended to me with various procedures. They started by giving me an IV, which was a bit painful, but I remained patient throughout. Despite my initial hesitation, I underwent a CAT scan as it was necessary for my treatment, displaying patience during the process. The nurses faced difficulty finding a vein for the IV, resulting in some discomfort, but I endured the situation calmly. After several hours, when it was time to remove the tape securing the IV, the nurse assisted me in taking it off, causing a sharp pain. However, I maintained my composure and did not let the discomfort overwhelm me. Despite experiencing pain and discomfort throughout the day, I demonstrated patience and resilience in the face of adversity.
666	18583	7	3	I was patient when my dad said he would get me some new shoes. They were expensive and cost a lot of money. I asked a few times, but he didn't answer, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I cleaned the dishes and tidied up my room, hoping that my efforts would be rewarded with the shoes I wanted so badly. However, after a month of waiting and cleaning, I still didn't get the shoes. My frustration led me to act out at school, but I eventually realized that I needed to get my behavior back on track. Once I did, I finally got the shoes I had been waiting for. It taught me the importance of patience and responsibility.
667	18584	7	3	Don't you just love waiting for something to come or happen and when it does you realize it was all worth waiting for? I know I do! Sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I have had to use patience many times before. Recently, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my baby cousin @CAPS1 to be born. I had to wait a long time @NUM1 weeks to be exact! I was just so excited I couldn't keep myself together. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel great. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only until I get out of school. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. But, the days never seem to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom. So, all in all patience is important. If you use it, the thing you are waiting for is much better. Waiting is always worth it in the end.
668	18586	7	3	Patience is truly a virtue that not everyone possesses. It is not just about waiting, but also about maintaining a sense of calm and kindness while doing so. It is admirable when someone can wait for you without getting frustrated, whether you are busy on the phone or occupied with something else. Being patient shows respect and consideration for others, and it goes a long way in fostering positive interactions and relationships. In a world where everything moves quickly, having patience is a rare and valuable trait that can make a significant difference in how we relate to one another. So, let us strive to cultivate patience in our daily lives, as it not only benefits those around us but also helps us grow as individuals.
669	18587	7	3	Aooooh, when I am seven, I will be able to ride on the Hoder Hunt; this adventure is something I have been looking forward to for a long time. The Victory Adventurer was a fun place, and I couldn't wait to experience this thrilling ride. As I waited in line, I was getting very anxious. My brother tried to calm me down by telling me we were halfway there, but I couldn't help feeling impatient. He suggested that I talk to the person in front of me to pass the time. Eventually, we made it to the front of the line, and I thanked my brother for his advice. With his help, I learned the importance of patience and how to make the most of waiting in line.
670	18588	7	3	Patience is a quality that not everyone possesses, but those who do exhibit it in challenging situations stand out. I remember a time when my older brother demonstrated immense patience with me, despite my actions causing inconvenience. It was a night when I was supposed to stay over at my aunt and uncle's house, a situation that always made me homesick. As the evening progressed, my longing for home grew stronger, and I couldn't hold back my tears. Despite trying to distract myself with games, the overwhelming feeling of missing my mom consumed me. I eventually broke down and expressed my desire to go back home, much to everyone's surprise. My cousin, who was babysitting, helped me contact my mom, who arranged for me to be picked up. As I left, my cousin asked if I really wanted to go, to which I replied with uncertainty. The incident was not mentioned again until I returned home, knowing that my punishment would be no more sleepovers for a while. My brother's patience and understanding in that moment left a lasting impact on me, teaching me the importance of composure in difficult circumstances.
671	18590	7	3	I had to be patient many times. I had to be patient when my brother broke his ear-drum, waiting for x-rays, and waiting to go on stage. When my brother broke his ear-drum, I was about five years old. I had to wait with my brother in the waiting room, feeling like it was taking forever. In first grade, I hit my wrist in a door and a wall, spending hours in the emergency room with my mom. We were stuck watching cartoons on the TV, feeling cold in the waiting room with ice on my wrist. Lastly, I had to wait to go on stage for my first-grade concert, feeling nervous and waiting anxiously. Sitting next to my friend helped calm my nerves. When we finally got on stage, I sang my heart out, happy that I waited. These experiences taught me the importance of patience, even though I struggle with it.
672	18591	7	3	I have been patient in my life, especially when I was waiting for my dog, Mae, to have her puppies. It all started when we took Mae to the vet for her early check-up. The vet confirmed that Mae was pregnant, and the anticipation began. As the months passed, Mae's due date drew closer. The excitement in our household grew each day.  When the day finally arrived, it was a flurry of emotions. Mae gave birth to six beautiful puppies, all girls. Our family expanded with the addition of these adorable new members. Mae, along with her puppies, brought joy and love into our home.  I will always cherish the memory of patiently waiting for Mae to have her babies and the happiness that filled our hearts when they finally arrived. My dogs hold a special place in my heart, and I am grateful for the love and companionship they bring into our lives.
673	18592	7	3	On my birthday, we went to get a cake, and I chose an ice cream cake. The place was crowded with over a dozen people, making me a bit impatient, although my mom handled it well. The event seemed to be a playground night, so I eagerly went to play while my mom took care of ordering the cake. It was a fun and memorable birthday celebration.
674	18593	7	3	Patience can lead to rewards, @PERSON4 the brown bear learned that @DATE1 when he was in line to get an autograph from @PERSON1.

675	18594	7	3	When I was patient. Their was a time when I was patient. Their are more and more wayís I get @CAPS1 patient when Iím not in no hurry to do something. Iím going to tell you a true story when I was patient. And I was not in a hurry in get it done. My first day at school and we was having fun with a bunch of people and on that first day we had work. When we attended to do it some people was not patient. I looked around the bright room and I was thinging about how should I be patient, ì@CAPS1 I saidî to myself I have to take the time @CAPS1 I could reach a good grade and @CAPS1 I was patient. The next day I was ready to see my grade on that work. I had a fun thatís the day when I was patient and taking my time.  I realized that being patient not only helped me achieve better results but also made the process more enjoyable. It taught me the importance of taking my time and not rushing through tasks. Patience truly is a virtue that can lead to success and fulfillment in many aspects of life.
676	18595	7	3	At time when I was patient was when I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I was patiently waiting when to get on the rollercoaster. For an hour and a half. I was patiently waiting when I had to get something to eat. I was patient when I wanted to get on any of the rides. That is a time when I was patient. Another instance of my patience was when I waited in line for the souvenir shop to purchase a memento from the theme park. Despite the long queue and the heat, I remained calm and composed, knowing that eventually, I would reach the front of the line. This experience tested my patience once again, but I successfully managed to stay patient throughout the wait.
677	18596	7	3	A time when I was patient was last summer. My friend, Sarah, took me to Cedar Point in Ohio. The place was so packed, it took five minutes to get from the car to the entrance. As we got in, the place looked amazing! They even had a ride to take you from one part of the park to another. The first ride we went on was the Millennium Force. We waited for about ten minutes, and then things got boring. It had been almost fifteen minutes, and we werenít even close to the ride! So we waited, and waited about ten more minutes, and things got a little faster. At this point, the line was moving a little faster. Finally, it was our turn to ride. We had a yellow car, and you could feel the adrenaline already. After we were strapped in, the person who locks peopleís seats said ìgo!î and we took off like a bird. In the end, it was worth being patient. The exhilarating experience of the ride made the wait completely worth it. Patience truly paid off that day at Cedar Point.
678	18597	7	3	I have been a patient before, and I remember a time when I was really sick and in a lot of pain. My mom took me to the hospital where she works, and even though I was crying non-stop, I miraculously stopped when we arrived. We waited in the busy waiting room to see the doctor, and after a thorough examination, I was diagnosed with just a cold and an ear infection. I got my medicine from the pharmacy and went home to rest. The next day, I got to enjoy a lollypop as a treat. It was a scary experience, but I was grateful for the care I received as a patient.
679	18598	7	3	"One day @CAPS1 was ordering a dress with a pair of shoes and accessories. But when she was ordering it, they said a part of it had not yet arrived. ""Would you like to proceed with the order without that item?"" Rosy asked. ""No thank you, I know it will arrive,"" said @CAPS1.   The next few months passed, and the dress had still not arrived. The magazine company called and apologized for the delay, offering it free of charge as a gesture of gratitude for @CAPS1's patience. Despite the initial setback, @CAPS1 decided to order two more dresses, which surprisingly arrived the very next day. Happy with the outcome, @CAPS1's trust in the company was restored."
680	18599	7	3	I am not a patient person. I hate waiting for anything and everything, and I complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school. There are a few girls in my team that completely kill my patience. I am sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. This few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just what the ???for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even sad so herself that she is going to shop a few practices that would ??? her attitude was driving me mane. Another girl trys pretty hard, but shes boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over hand ??? these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underland n crying out loud! This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls hard quite a bit of practice, and I know it wont happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep many patient.   Despite their shortcomings, I understand that these girls need time and practice to improve their volleyball skills. I will try to be more patient and supportive as we work together as a team.
681	18600	7	3	"Patience is hard for me. I am simply an impatient person. Patience in my life is a rare occurrence, so I will describe a time that I was patient. ""You can get it this time,"" I encouraged myself. I stared at the net, the obstacle in my way. If the net was shorter, I would be able to get my volleyball serve over. I balanced the white ball in the palm of my hand, taking a moment to focus. Lowering my left arm and raising it quickly, I sent the ball high above my head. With determination, I thrust my hand forward, making contact with the ball. Thwap! It struck the net, causing a moment of disappointment. ""You got this!"" I reassured myself, ready to try again.   My team watched as I bounced the ball twice, spun it around in my hand, and prepared for another serve. Ignoring the pressure and focusing on my goal, I struck the ball with precision. This time, it flew over the net and landed in the middle of the court. My persistence and patience paid off as I achieved my goal. This experience taught me a valuable lesson - patience leads to victory."
682	18601	7	3	Patience is something that can be challenging to cultivate, especially for those who prefer instant gratification. Waiting can feel tedious and time-consuming, making it difficult to remain calm and composed. Personally, I struggle with patience, particularly when I am eagerly anticipating something. The act of waiting seems to stretch time, making minutes feel like hours.   One of the most frustrating experiences of waiting is for a package to arrive. The anticipation builds as you track its progress, only to be met with delays and uncertainty. The waiting game can be agonizing, as each passing moment feels like an eternity.   I vividly remember a time when I was eagerly waiting to visit a friend I hadn't seen in months. The excitement of reuniting with her made the waiting unbearable. Despite our plans being in place for weeks, the day of the visit seemed to drag on endlessly. Waiting for my dad to drive me to her house felt like an eternity, with every red light and slow driver prolonging the journey.   Finally arriving at my friend's house, the impatience melted away as we embraced each other, the long-awaited reunion making the wait worthwhile. Although patience may not come easily to me, moments like these remind me that sometimes, good things are worth waiting for.
683	18602	7	3	My story is about a time I was patient. One day I was so excited because it was Halloween and my friends and I were going trick or treating. I was so impatient for the clock to turn 6 pm because my best friend Kate was going to pick me up in her pink convertible, and we would go trick or treating. I was very impatient because it was only 2 pm, so I did my chores thinking time would fly by. Instead of putting dish soap in the dishwasher, I put grapes in it, so when the dishwasher was done, I emptied it, and all the dishes smelled like grapes. I looked at the clock, and it was only 3 pm. Then I remembered that my favorite movie was on, so I ran to my room but ended up running into the wall and getting knocked out. After 4 hours, I was fine, so I told my mom that I would be patient because I didn't want to get knocked out again. I only had 5 hours and 6 minutes to go, so I went to my room and wasted some time until eleven twenty. I then had an hour to get ready to go trick or treating. Before doing my makeup, I went into the kitchen, put all the grape-smelling dishes in the dishwasher, and washed them the right way. Then, I put on my bumblebee costume and did my makeup, looking really cool. Finally, the clock turned to 6 pm, and suddenly I heard a horn honking; Kate was here. I got in the car, and we went to pick up Kate. I almost forgot to tell you that Kate was dressed as a ladybug, and Kate was a witch, so we went trick or treating. That was a time when I was patient.
684	18603	7	3	I remember, just a few days ago, my mother had to get her tooth checked out and guess what I did, I read a book! Even though it took forever, I was done with my homework. When my mom came back, we got up to leave and my feet were numb. So far my patience, we got ice cream. So you could get rewarded if you're just patient. Sometimes, waiting patiently can lead to sweet rewards in the end.
685	18604	7	3	I must admit there are times when Iím not very patient. But I can still remember the day I learned what patience was. I was @NUM1 years old and I was going to my annual checkup at the doctors office. It was around @NUM2 am on a @DATE1 @TIME1. I was with my mother in the waiting room, when a elderly man came in. He seemed extremely sick and I remember being really scared. The women at the front desk came up to us and said it would be a wait, @CAPS1 explained that the man was very ill and could be dying. My mother told me to be patient but I didnít know what that meant so she explained it to me. She said, ìYou have to wait quietly and not complain no matter how long it takes. I told her I could do it and sure enough I could. Patience is a very important thing to me. I feel it is not only for yourself but for the consideration of others. When you complain about having to wait it is disrespectful to others. And I know other people are patient for me so I should be for them also.
686	18605	7	3	Being patient isnít that hard if you try. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and I needed help with my math homework but the teacher was helping someone else. So I waited for what felt like an eternity. Five minutes past and they still werenít done so I decided to skip that problem. Ten minutes past and yet they still werenít done so I just waited and waited. Then finally they were done, and it was only two minutes. I thought, well I guess I give it another try and if I still donít get it, Iíll ask her tomorrow. So while I was trying to figure it out, it just wasnít making sense so I waited until tomorrow to ask her. The next day in class, I asked her about it and she said that we didnít have to do that one. I laughed and told her I had been trying to figure it out all yesterday. That is an example of being patient.
687	18606	7	3	One day I spent a night over my best friend's house for a few days and ended up going to school with her. All of my clothes and shoes were at her house, and I wasn't able to retrieve them because we went out to eat right after school. I realized I had left my favorite shoes at her place, so I asked her to bring them to school. Despite my patience, she kept forgetting to return them, even after several reminders. It wasn't until a few weeks later that she finally gave them back to me. Although my shoes were worn out and dirty, I understood that she was a good friend and I valued our friendship more than material possessions. I learned to be patient and forgiving, and I realized that true friendship is about more than just shoes.
688	18607	7	3	A time where I was patient was when I had to go to the eye doctor. I was in a rush because I was running late. It was a busy day and my appointment was at noon. I was at least 20 minutes away from the place. When we got there it was already 12:15, so I missed my appointment. I had to wait in the waiting room for a long time as my mother and I had to wait until all the people who made their appointment were finished. We waited at least an hour and a half. As I was being patient I talked on the phone and went on the internet. Lastly, I listened to music the rest of the time until they called my name. In conclusion, this is a time when I was patient.
689	18608	7	3	"@LOCATION1 @CAPS10 sit down, my friend says. You don't need to be moving around like you're a fly on the wall."" I sit down, anxious to get up and move again."" @CAPS1's too many people here, we're never getting in,"" I say. The line was the longest to get my driving test, so I'm thinking to myself to get up and move around because I'm not a very patient person. I should be able to move around while I wait, but my friend thinks it's annoying and awkward. ""@LOCATION1, I wonder if they have a vending machine here."" ""I doubt it,"" I proclaim. @CAPS3 glances at me and I turn away. I get up and walk around, only to come back later and find @CAPS3 gone. Sitting down, I talk on the phone for a while, passing the time. As I sit and look around, I consider striking up a conversation with someone to combat my boredom. However, I refrain from getting up and moving around, as I see my friend pacing in circles and another acquaintance has left. Time passes, and it's getting closer to 3 p.m. I realize I'm up next. ""@CAPS5, you're next,"" I think to myself, feeling a mix of impatience and readiness. I approach the teller and request a driving test. Reflecting on my time waiting, I acknowledge that although I struggled with patience, I managed to endure the lengthy wait. The driving instructor calls my name, and as I begin the test, I realize that I had the patience to wait for hours, a feat I never thought possible."
690	18609	7	3	Patience is essential in life as it allows individuals to wait for something without complaining. It is important to practice patience in various situations, whether it be waiting in line, for a promotion, or for a desired outcome. Those who lack patience often find themselves frustrated and unhappy, unable to endure delays or setbacks. On the other hand, individuals who possess patience are better equipped to handle challenges and uncertainties with grace and composure. While it may be difficult to cultivate patience, the ability to wait without complaining is a valuable trait that can lead to greater success and fulfillment in life.
691	18610	7	3	A time I had to be patient was at the doctor's office. The clock seemed to move so slowly, ticking around and around. I tried to pass the time by saying the alphabet forwards and backwards, but it felt like forever before a doctor finally called my name. Sitting there with nothing to do, I attempted to fall asleep or watch TV, but there was only one channel playing. After what felt like an eternity, I was finally called in to see the doctor.
692	18611	7	3	Oh, a time when my mom and I were patient was when we had to wait for her to get her tags renewed on her birthday. We started our day by getting ready together, eating breakfast, and taking care of our morning routine. After all that, we realized it was time to head out and wait at the DMV. As we waited, we both started feeling hungry, so we decided to stop at Burger King for a quick meal. That day taught me the importance of being patient and understanding that sometimes things take time. It was a good opportunity for us to bond and appreciate each other's company. In the end, the wait was worth it, and we were able to celebrate my mom's birthday with her new tags in hand.
693	18612	7	3	Before, when I had to go to the doctor, I had to wait forty minutes. So I just played my 3DS. I was playing Mario Kart. I got bored so I just fell asleep. My mom woke me up because it was time. So we went in, did my appointment, and went home. Then we had to wait twenty minutes for my dad to get home from work. After he arrived, we all had dinner together and spent the rest of the evening relaxing at home.
694	18613	7	3	Last month, I had to go get a root canal. I was very nervous. I arrived at the dentist office, half scared to death by the thought of the pain. There were two people in front of me, so I had to wait, which made me even more scared. Finally, it was my turn to go in with the dentist. Throughout the procedure, I remained patient and calm. Surprisingly, it didn't hurt at all. When I got back home, I fell asleep, but later woke up feeling intense pain in my tooth, as if it was on fire. Despite the agony, I never complained or rushed my mom when she was getting my medicine. It was a test of my patience, and I managed to endure it without losing my cool.
695	18614	7	3	This story is about my anticipation for my upcoming birthday in three days. I have been eagerly looking forward to seeing what gifts I will receive, even though the waiting can be difficult. One way I have been patient is by excitedly planning a sleepover with all my close friends, where we will enjoy cake and ice cream. The countdown to turning twelve has made me even more eager for the celebrations. After the sleepover, I have a fun day planned with my mom and brother, including a trip to the mall where I have been given a hundred dollars to spend. While it can be challenging to wait for these exciting events, I have learned the value of patience in enjoying the anticipation and excitement leading up to them.
696	18615	7	3	When I was little we went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was finally big enough to go on the newest @CAPS1 @CAPS2! When we walked up to the line we noticed how many people were there. The line looked as if it were five miles long! My mom asked me if I wanted to keep going in the huge line or go next time when less people were there. This is what I had been waiting for! I was not opportunity. I told her I wanted to keep going and so we kept walking. It took what felt like two days to get to the top. My mom and I were so patient! So we waited, and waited, and waited. Till we were finally at the top. Then we came down. It had been worth the wait! we were so patient. I will always remember all the fun I had that day and the great accomplishment. I never knew I could be so patient and my mom and I could wait so long.  As we made our way down from the top of the ride, the exhilaration and joy of the experience filled me with a sense of pride and satisfaction. The wait had been long, but the thrill of the ride made it all worthwhile. I realized that patience truly pays off, and the memory of conquering my impatience that day will always stay with me. It was a day of fun, learning, and growing, shared with my supportive mom by my side.
697	18616	7	3	Buzz, buzz! @CAPS8 I hear ì@CAPS1 your phone is @CAPS2.î so I got up and checked it @NUM1 missed calls. I look who they are from at @NUM2 all from @CAPS6 dad.

Patience truly pays off in the end, bringing us closer together and strengthening our family ties.

But then, as I started to distract myself with other activities, the days seemed to fly by. Before I knew it, my dad was telling me it was time to go shopping to get my Xbox.

702	18621	7	3	One day my sister had a volleyball tournament that lasted all day. Arriving at the worst time, I felt weary and impatient.

Finally, when the tournaments were over, my mom would often praise me for my good behavior. This experience taught me that patience is a challenging yet essential trait to possess.
703	18622	7	3	This is my story about patience. I go to the doctors every three months. Me, my brothers and my sister, and it takes about two to three hours. When the doctor asks my brothers questions, by the time he finishes with them, I am already coming up with my answers. Despite waiting for my turn, I try to stay patient. However, when it finally comes to me, the doctor takes about five minutes to finish with my examination. After that, he has to talk to my mom before I can leave. When we go to the doctor or dentist, we have to be patient as it takes time for them to do what they need to do. Patience is key in these situations, even when it may seem difficult.
704	18624	7	3	Once on a sunny break day, my family and I headed to a popular water park. Excitement filled the air as we arrived, eager to explore all the thrilling attractions. Persuading our parents to join in on the fun, we quickly got changed into our swimwear and set off to find the water slides. The moment we stepped inside, a massive sunken ship caught our attention, with zip-lines hanging above it. Racing towards the ship, we discovered a long line awaiting us. Despite the wait of what seemed like an eternity, we patiently stood in line until it was finally my turn. Gripping the handle tightly, I pushed off and zoomed through the air, nearly reaching the end before coming to a gentle stop. With a splash, I let go and plunged into the refreshing pool below. The anticipation and thrill of the ride made the wait well worth it, creating unforgettable memories with my family at the water park.
705	18626	7	3	ìPatience is a virtue.î You might hear that phrase a lot if you dislike waiting on things for a long period of time. Hereís a question for my audience what is patience? Do you know? Well in my essay, Iím going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this day and age, itís very hard to come across someone with a decent amount of patience. Due to all the services and goods such as pizza delivery @NUM1 minute wash & dry acts, people have begun to lose patience. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money. Another reason people need patience is their family. If you lack patience you won't be able to deal with your young and immature family members. For example, I have no patience whatsoever so I can't deal with anyone younger than @NUM1 years old. That will affect me in a very negative way. Those are the pros and cons of having patience, thank you for reading my essay.

She told me to just be patient. So when we got to the hotel I was patient as long as I could be then I couldn't wait anymore. So I put on my trunks and went swimming with my cousin. And that was a time when I was patient for something.

The rule was to take turns, so they all played for a while. I had to wait patiently for my turn, which felt like forever. Eventually, my friends agreed to play a different game with me. After waiting for some time, no one wanted to play anymore. Despite feeling disappointed, I managed to stay patient and not get upset. Even though it was my birthday, I stayed calm and handled the situation well. This experience taught me the value of patience and understanding in challenging moments.
710	18631	7	3	"The clock is ticking down, waiting, ready, ready to burst into a massive explosion. A never before seen bomb, the countdown is planted at the white headquarters, patience is key because with this bomb, anybody that attempts to defuse this explosive except from the last minute of the countdown to certain destruction will detonate this explosive. The alpha team leader says it's waiting, waiting for the right time. Three minutes left, two minutes left, one minute. ""Go, go!"" yelled the leader of the squad. This is our only chance to save the white headquarters. Time is running out, seconds of peril riding on our shoulders, the fate of the white headquarters is in our hands. The enemies are calling in infantry, just as all hope is lost, ""I got it!"" I exclaimed. All that was left was to escape and let the army do the work. We rushed to the van with our shields out and plowed through the defenses. Suddenly, we heard a strange noise and noticed a charge on the bottom of the van, we ran for our lives while our night-equipped van exploded to pieces right behind us. We lived, patiently waiting for the patrol to walk by. We just needed to cross the field to the army helicopter and we were home free. We sprinted across the field and victory was ours.

711	18632	7	3	It was late at night, and I was eagerly waiting for my friend to come over to my house. I sat patiently watching TV, trying not to let my excitement get the best of me. The shows on TV only added to my anticipation, making me even more eager for my friend's arrival. Despite my growing excitement, I managed to remain calm and patient, not letting my impatience show.  As the time passed by, my mom eventually told me it was time to go to bed. Reluctantly, I obeyed, still hoping that my friend would show up soon. However, sleep eluded me, and I found myself sneaking back downstairs for a glass of water. In the dim light of the TV, I ended up dozing off on the couch, completely unaware of the passing time.  When I finally woke up, it was already morning, and I realized that the night had flown by in what felt like mere minutes. Despite my best efforts to stay awake and wait for my friend, exhaustion had gotten the best of me. Nevertheless, I was grateful for the lesson in patience that the night had taught me. Next time, I promised myself, I would try to stay awake and enjoy the time spent with my friend, no matter how late it got.
712	18633	7	3	I have been patient in various situations. One instance was when I waited for my friend, who took much longer than he said he would to walk to school with me. Despite almost being late for first hour, I remained patient. Another time was when my mom and I were at @ORGANIZATION1 to pick up my new shoes. The employee took quite a while to fetch them, but the wait was worthwhile for my new pair. These are just a couple of examples showcasing my patience in different scenarios.

Then get off bus at the corner and walk back to the house. The experience taught me the value of patience and perseverance, as sometimes things may not go as planned but staying calm and composed can lead to a successful outcome in the end.
715	18636	7	3	"Just before Christmas break, in the fourth grade, there was a holiday party at my neighbor's house. My parents and I were invited, and since we didn't have plans, we decided to go to the party. The party was spectacular! There were stockings hung over the fireplace, green and red streamers everywhere, and a huge Christmas tree in the living room. Under the Christmas tree, there was a large pile of presents - each one for the children. My neighbor saw me staring at the presents, so he walked over, picked up a present, and handed it to me. The present was a rectangular shape wrapped in blue gift wrap decorated with snowflakes. On the front was my name in marker. I was about to open my present when my neighbor told me to wait. He said that if I opened it now, I would only get one gift. If I waited until Christmas morning to open it, I would get two gifts. Christmas was a week away! How in the world was I supposed to wait until then? Of course I wanted two gifts, so I told my neighbor I would wait. Deep down inside though, I wanted to tear the present right open. The days dragged on. Why was the week going by so slowly? As Christmas drew near, I grew impatient. I almost opened my present three days before Christmas. Finally, on the twenty-fifth of December, I was able to open my present. Instead of quickly unwrapping it like I planned to, I slowly tore the paper away... and found a lovely velvet diary with golden borders. Inside was a note: ""Not only have you earned yourself a new diary, you now have the gift of patience."" Now I understood the true meaning of waiting for something special."
716	18637	7	3	"This is the time when I was patient. One day I was playing with my old game, I told my mum I wanted a new game, because my games were kinda old. My mum said, ""Sweetie just be patient."" I was patient for a month. My brother asked my mom for a new game and he got it the next day. My sister wanted a curling machine and she got that too. So I just kept waiting and I was also patient. My dad came back from his trip, and I asked him, ""Dad, can you get me a new game?"" ""Honey, but I can't get it now. You just have to be patient."" ""Ugh, okay!"" I hollered. The next day my dad had already gotten what my brother and sister wanted, and I was the only one who hadn't gotten my game yet. So I still waited, and waited until my dad took me to the video store. I was so happy even though my sister and brother had gotten what they wanted. I still got my game. Waiting is not that hard; it just takes patience. That's how patience helps you accomplish what you want."
717	18638	7	3	To me patience means that you are ready to wait a long time to do something. I was somewhat patient when I was delayed at an airport then canceled, it was not very fun because I didn't eat all afternoon. But I was happy because I had my DS. The story was we went to Disneyland on the 1st of January for vacation. It was snowing when we reached the airport. We had to hurry through the check line and the security. When we got to the boarding gate, we looked for where we had to board. I saw that our flight was delayed, that meant we had to stay at the airport. I at least saw that we were going to New York first then to Disneyland, but I stayed patient. Well, that's the day I stayed very, very patient. Despite the delays and cancellations, having my DS helped me pass the time and remain calm during the unexpected changes to our travel plans.
718	18639	7	3	I was patient for days waiting for my birthday presents. It was almost my birthday and I kept asking for my presents, but my mom kept saying no. It was getting closer and closer, and I continued to ask, despite my mom's reassurance that I would get them. Finally, on the day before my birthday, I couldn't contain my excitement. I asked once more, but my mom still said no. The next day, on my birthday, I went to school eagerly anticipating what awaited me at home. When I returned, my mom surprised me with a cake and a present, mentioning that there were more to come. That was the moment I realized the value of patience as I happily received my birthday gifts.
719	18640	7	3	It was a dark and suddenly stormy night when we went to pick up some Subway for my family. A strike of lightning caused everything to go dark, but the manager quickly came out with navy blue flashlights to calm everyone down. Unable to reach our car due to the heavy rain and thunder, we were all frightened of getting shocked. After a while, our stomachs began to growl, signaling hunger. My grandmother and I asked if we could still have our subs made since there was light available, and the manager agreed. Within minutes, the manager distributed subs, chips, soda, and cookies, and we all enjoyed a late-night meal. Exhausted from the ordeal, I fell asleep, only to wake up the next morning to the sun shining brightly. As we left the Subway, the scent of freshly baked bread and savory meats lingered on our clothes. It was a memorable and unexpectedly enjoyable experience during what initially seemed like a chaotic night.
720	18641	7	3	I ride a beautiful paint horse named @CAPS1, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of her is completely white and the other side has brown patches. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I am putting tack on her she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait until I put her bridle on, and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently, so @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm nowhere near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her, after I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watched me walk down the long row of stalls, and patiently waits until I come back with her treat. Once she's done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then runs to her friends after a drink of water, and doesn't have to be patient anymore for a while.
721	18642	7	3	A time I had to be patient was when we went to @LOCATION2. It was a @NUM1 hour flight with a two-hour layover in @LOCATION1. It was really hard for me to be patient because I really wanted to go to @LOCATION2. In the layover, to pass time I listened to my iPod and used my MacBook Pro to get on Facebook. It really helped me be patient because it took my mind off @LOCATION2. Before I knew it, we were in @LOCATION2, and my patience paid off. When we arrived, I got to swim on beaches and party in @LOCATION2 for @DATE1 break @DATE2. That is my story about a time I was patient.
722	18643	7	3	There were three girls, and their mother, who was gay, took them to a motel for the middle child's birthday. Everything seemed fine until the mother's girlfriend, Cathy, and another woman left to get presents for the birthday girl. They returned two hours later, but Cathy had been taken to jail, leaving them with no money or way to get home.

Thankfully, three kind ladies eventually picked them up, and that's how they ended up moving from Southhaven to Bangor.
723	18644	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I waiting in the hospital One time when my grandma went to the hospital for passing out and not breathing. When we got to the hospital we couldnít go and see her for a long time. My mom, brother, cousins, uncle were just sitting waiting very patiently. When the next day came we still couldnít see her which was sad and scary. My uncle took us to get something to eat while my mom stayed at the hospital. When we came back to the hospital my mom was very upset because we couldnít see her at all. The doctor came out and said we can see her. When we got into the room she was sitting up smiling. My mom told her that it took forever for us to see you. My granny scud the doctor said it wasnít a really big deal. We stayed at the hospital for like @NUM1 more hours and then we left but my mom stayed.            In conclusion I told you when I was patient at the hospital. Even though we wanted to run in but we didnít and we stayed very calm. This is the time I was patient.
724	18645	7	3	Being patient is an important quality that can help in various situations. While some people may find it challenging to wait for things, learning to be patient can bring many benefits. For example, my cousin is someone who demonstrates great patience. When I advise her to wait calmly, she is able to do so without getting frustrated. On the other hand, my other cousins often struggle with impatience, like I used to. However, with the guidance of my patient cousin, I have been able to improve my patience skills. Now, I can endure waiting periods without feeling anxious or rushed. Overall, being patient is a valuable trait that can lead to a more peaceful and content life.
725	18646	7	3	I was in class waiting for the first period to be over so I could finally go to lunch. Math class was almost finished, and I was counting down the minutes until I could leave. I wasn't a fan of math, so the wait felt even longer. Finally, the teacher told me to put my folder away, signaling that it was time for lunch. I rushed out of the classroom, eager to be the first one in line. However, my excitement was short-lived when I saw a girl already ahead of me. I couldn't believe I had been beaten by someone else. It was a disappointing end to my wait for lunch, but that's just how it goes sometimes.
726	18647	7	3	"When most people think of patience, they think of waiting. But that's only half of it. Patience is waiting without complaining, like when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was about a five-hour drive. I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but I @CAPS1 corridor. I just @CAPS1 them, pure and simple. But me and my brother didn't complain, mainly because the night before our mom said, ""Two complained, we'll sit with her in the hotel room the whole time. Isn't that scary?"" So we finally got there. The week was fun; we ate good food, played sweet games, and went to an awesome museum. But on the ride back, it was another trial of patience, even more so because we got in an accident. Despite the challenges, we maintained our patience and made it home safely. Patience truly pays off in the end."
727	18648	7	3	In @DATE1 my dad had a business trip in @CAPS1 Disneyland. We got to the park and rode some rides. My dad had to leave for a meeting, so he did.

We came back the next day and the wait was @NUM2 hours. We got in line and waited and waited and waited. After @NUM3 minutes I was bored. I asked my mom if we could leave but the line was too big to get out. After hours that seemed like years we got to the front, but my sister wanted to leave! My mom got out of line and so did my sister, but I stayed. I waited all by myself for @NUM4 minutes when I got on the coaster! It was fun, and I got a fast pass for @NUM5 other rides! In the end, my patience paid off as I enjoyed the thrill of Space Mountain and made the most of my time at Disneyland.
728	18649	7	3	It was late @DATE1 when my @CAPS1 and I was going to @CAPS2 point for my @CAPS1. So we take forever to drive there just sitting in the back sent all alone back there no one to talk to but my phone. So we finally get there wasting all my patients on being in the car after we get in we go on the @CAPS4 @NUM1 @CAPS5 wait to ride a @NUM1 minute ride it is worth it but still @NUM1 hours is a lot of time. So I m waiting then we get off the ride they we go on the @CAPS6 @NUM4 @CAPS5 line for @NUM5 second ride. All the rides there were at least 1-@NUM1 hours long. Except one ride the @CAPS7 we got there before the crowd came in. So it was on leg @NUM7 minutes and @CAPS8 the time we got on the ride and at the top of the hill it was probably a @CAPS5 line. So we really lucked out on that one. But @CAPS8 the time the park closed and we got to our car there was a huge traffic jam and that was all the patients left so we were in line to leave the park for another @CAPS5 and a half so we waited and waited and finaly it moved and once we got through the park and out of it the road we had to take was closed because of a car accident so we had to talk this huge detoer that added a @CAPS5 to our time because of traffic taking that way and @CAPS8 the time we got to our hotel I didnít have one drop of patients left I felt like I was going to blow up but I didnít I acted very patient but it was a good thing I have a lot of patients. Additionally, we encountered unexpected obstacles like a traffic jam and road closures, which tested our patience even further. Despite these challenges, I managed to remain calm and composed throughout the journey, showing that patience truly is a virtue in such situations.
729	18650	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when I went to @CAPS1 point with @CAPS6 family and @CAPS6 friend @LOCATION1. We rode some rides, then @CAPS6 sister said, ""Can we ride the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 again?"" I replied, ""Sure, even though it was our fifth time riding the ride."" @CAPS6 sister and I went and stood in line for the ride. I suggested, ""We should ride front row."" @CAPS4 agreed, and so we waited in the packed line for about twenty minutes until someone threw up on another cart. The employees had to clean up the mess, which added another twenty minutes to our wait. Despite the delay, we persevered and finally got on the ride. After the ride, I exclaimed, ""Who would barf on a ride like @CAPS7?"" @CAPS6 dad simply said, ""I don't know."" That day, I realized the value of patience as we waited forty to sixty minutes for a ride that wasn't truly worth the wait. However, the joy on @CAPS6 sister's face and her laughter made the entire experience worthwhile."
730	18651	7	3	"I know a lot of patient people, and I have had many experiences that have to do with patience. My friend, @PERSON1, is usually impatient. Whenever she is waiting for something she texts me saying, ""Hey!,"" or, ""Come on!"" @PERSON1 one day she was actually very patient. My family, @PERSON1, and I were going to the zoo one @DATE1 @TIME1. We brought snacks and packed everything the day before. We were going to pick @PERSON1 up from her house and then go to the zoo. But my mom slept in and she still had to take a shower! She said we would pick up @PERSON1 on the way to the zoo around 10 am, and it was already 9 am. We were running late and I thought @PERSON1 was going to get mad. Fortunately, @PERSON1 wasn't mad! She was understanding and said that it was okay. Usually, she would say something like, ""Hey, where are you? Why are you taking so long?"" This time she didn't say any of that. We ended up going to the zoo around noon, but it was all fun and joy! I have had experiences with many patient people and this experience turned out to be fun!"
731	18652	7	3	I think patience is all about waiting for something you want to happen or you donít want to happen. Sometimes it hits uninspected. Especially at Cedar Point, you need a lot of patience. Beep! Beep! I hit my alarm clock with all my force, hoping the thing would turn off. But on the day I was going to Cedar Point, I couldn't wait. I got up, took a shower, and ate breakfast - my mom made blueberry muffins, which were great. I had packed my clothes a week early out of excitement and was all ready to go. The car ride was three hours long, but with a TV in the car, the time passed quickly for my siblings and me. Arriving at the hotel, my sister was amazed by the stuffed animals but couldn't buy any. The next morning, we rushed to the park, only to find a long wait for the first ride. Despite losing patience, we waited, and eventually, the ride was worth it. We had a fun day at the park, although we had to leave the next day. In the end, I got my hot dog, and it taught me that sometimes, patience is necessary to enjoy what you want.
732	18653	7	3	One hot summer day my family and I went to Cedar Point. There was a new ride open called shoot the rapids. It was a brown tall water ride with a tunnel and two hills. As we walked over to see how long the wait was it said an hour wait. We all really wanted to go on it so we decided to wait. When we got in the line it was about 90 degrees outside, we were all sweating. And to make things worse there was this annoying little boy talking to me about some food or something. It was really annoying. We were about half way through the line when my nerves kicked in I was really scared but I knew I had to be brave and suck it up. About 30 minutes later we were 4 people away from the ride. My heart was pounding, my knees were shaking. I thought I was going to die. Then all of a sudden it broke down. We had to wait another 15 minutes. As time passed we finally got on the water ride. I regret it. I screamed and cried but I'm glad I didn't chicken out. That was a time I had patience and regret it.
733	18654	7	3	"One time I had to be really patient when my grandma said there was something in the mail for me. I was so excited. I waited and waited but nothing showed up. Then I started getting impatient. My grandma said, ""Keep waiting, it will come soon."" So I did what my grandma said and the next day a big package came. I was so happy it was finally here. My uncle had sent all my sisters and I some new sneakers. Also, we all got NBA players. I was so happy that me being patient had finally been something worth it."
734	18655	7	3	One day when I was in third grade, my mom surprised me with a special gift. She had mentioned in the morning that she had something for me when she picked me up from school. Throughout the day, I was filled with anticipation, eager to find out what the surprise could be. Despite my excitement, I managed to stay patient and focused on my schoolwork, counting down the minutes until the end of the day.  When the final bell rang, my mom was there to pick me up as promised. I eagerly climbed into the car, unable to contain my curiosity. As we arrived home, she instructed me to go to my room. I hurried inside, not knowing what to expect. To my delight, there was a adorable, black puppy waiting for me. I was overwhelmed with joy and gratitude towards my parents for this wonderful gift.  I immediately named the puppy Chloe, and she quickly became my new best friend. I couldn't believe how lucky I was to have such a loving companion. That day taught me the value of patience and how it can lead to amazing surprises. I will always cherish the memory of the day I received Chloe as a gift from my mom.
735	18656	7	3	"Being patient is a very hard and difficult thing to do sometimes, but we have to go through it. Being the one who is patient usually pays off. We were on our way to the airport and my two younger brothers and I couldn't wait to get to our destination. We got to the airport thinking we would get right on the airplane. But when we got there we found out we had to wait five hours until the plane left and we'd be on our way to our destination. So we decided to play our games we brought with us. We were being very patient. Finally it was time for us to get on the plane. We walked through the long tube that leads to the airplane door. We sat in our seats, buckled up and we were ready for takeoff. We heard the pilot talk into speakers, ""I'm very sorry, but there is a severe thunderstorm appearing on the radar, we cannot proceed until it clears up."" ""How long will it take?"" asked my mom. ""About five hours,"" she said. It's a good thing we brought our DVD player so that would hold us off for about two hours. For the rest of the time, we played, slept, and just waited patiently. The flight attendant came up to us and said that since we were very patient for the whole five hours, even my three-year-old brother, she would reward us with five Disney World pass tickets for my family. In conclusion, when you are patient, no matter how hard it is you will maybe get rewarded just like my family."

737	18658	7	3	Itís like when you're waiting in line, that's patience. Or like when you keep raising your hand in class, and the teacher keeps telling you to do your work, and if you do it again, she'll send you to the principal's office. That's when a teacher loses her patience. Patience is key in situations like these, whether it's waiting in line or following classroom rules. It's important to remain calm and composed, even when faced with challenges that test your patience.
738	18659	7	3	I am writing about a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when it was the first week of football. We went down to subway before the game and got a sub. I was the first one in line but then I was followed by other people, only one cut me at first but then others followed and I became the last one in line, it felt like an hour in line! Finally, I was up next I got my sub. It had turkey, lettuce, pickles, banana, pepper, cucumbers, and great fresh spinach. It taught me something in that line being patient really pays off and by the time in at back. It had over been 15 minutes. I sighed in relief. We were pumped for our first games we played starta we tied it though but that was still a great day!
739	18660	7	3	One after school I was walking home with my friends from school, feeling hungry. Knowing me, I suggested we stop at a fast food restaurant called @LOCATION1. As we entered, the place was bustling with customers, but I was determined to satisfy my craving. While my friends decided to leave, I chose to wait in line. After a short wait, I finally reached the counter and ordered a double stack burger, fries, and a strawberry milkshake. To my surprise, the cashier gave me the milkshake for free as a token of appreciation for my patience. Excitedly, I shared the good news with my friends waiting outside, and we headed home, satisfied with our unexpected treat.
740	18661	7	3	About two weeks ago, I ordered a book series online from a bookstore. It was a series that I have been eagerly waiting to read for a long time, called the @LOCATION1 series. These books are my absolute favorite, and I have read them multiple times.   The wait for the books to arrive felt like an eternity, even though the estimated delivery time was less than 24 hours. I tried to be patient, but it was difficult not knowing when they would finally be in my hands.   After waiting for five days, the books finally arrived. It was a moment of pure joy and excitement to finally have the series in my possession.   This experience taught me the importance of patience. Sometimes, good things come to those who wait. If we can be patient and persistent, we will eventually get what we desire. Patience is truly a valuable quality to have in life.
741	18662	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I took my first CAPS test this year. The test was not too hard, but not easy. I finished it with about one and a half hours left. For an hour and a half I had nothing to do but just sit perfectly still and silent. Sitting still and quiet for even five minutes is hard for a 12-year-old, imagine 90 minutes! At first I was fidgeting, then my neck started to hurt, so I layed my head down. I closed my eyes and just layed there perfectly quiet and still. Soon enough the time flew by and the CAPS test was over. I was very proud of myself for being patient and calm during those 90 minutes.
742	18663	7	3	Hi my name is @PERSON1 and Iím going to tell you a story about how one time I was patience. I remember when I was patience. It was chismis day. There was tons and tons of precidens under the tree. There was tiny ones all the way to hamuges ones. But I couldnít even peek at them because my mom and dad were still not up. I wanted to go into my momís and dadís room and wake them up. But no without some brekfast in bed, so when I wake them up they can hurry up and eat so can open my precidens. After my mom and dad were done eating I finally got to open my precidents.  I unwrapped each present carefully, savoring the excitement of discovering what lay beneath the colorful wrapping paper. Each gift brought a smile to my face and filled my heart with joy. From toys to books to clothes, each present was a thoughtful gesture from my loved ones. I felt grateful for the love and thoughtfulness that went into choosing each gift.  As I sat surrounded by torn wrapping paper and new treasures, I realized that the true gift of the day was not the material possessions, but the time spent with my family. The laughter, the smiles, and the shared moments were what made the day special. I learned that patience truly pays off, not just in waiting for presents, but in appreciating the moments and memories created with the ones we love. And that, to me, was the greatest gift of all.
743	18664	7	3	Patient is when you are tolerant and understanding. Many people donít have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but hereís a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny day. The sun was shining like there's no tomorrow. Too bad I couldn't play outside. I was too busy kicking back, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. ìHey,î my brother yelled all happy and in my face. ìHa ha, loser, lions are winning and steelers are losing,î he added. ìDonít get too happy, there's still plenty of time left,î I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that Iíd lose, but taking deep breaths in and out, I was very patient. The clock winding down. It was the beginning of the game. The score was 21 to 14, lions lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the quarterback for the Steelers made an awesome pass and they scored. I screamed, dancing and jumping around. I told my brother, ìWho's the loser now, huh?î Wow, all it took was patience and hope. Patient can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little competitive, but if you just wait and tolerate whatís happening around you, youíll end up getting rewarded.
744	18666	7	3	I guess you could say that patience is one of my strong talents. I go through many things that require patience and manage to get through them without any issues. Everyone knows that one of the most challenging places to be patient is during church services. You are constantly shifting from standing up to kneeling down, then sitting, standing again, and so on. It seems to go on forever. I understand that there are many kids who struggle to be as patient as me. Some of them may have ADHD or other learning disabilities that make them impatient, while others are just naturally restless. I have seen people who are so energetic that they can't sit still, and I know how difficult it must be for them. I feel sorry for those who struggle in school because of their impatience. Sometimes, I find myself getting impatient when I am around other people who are impatient. It's frustrating when no matter how many times I try to calm them down or encourage them to stop complaining, they just can't seem to relax. What I'm trying to say is that everyone is different - some people are quiet and calm, while others are more energetic. The same goes for patience.
745	18667	7	3	There was a fish named @CAPS1. @CAPS6 lived around the @CAPS2 archipelago, a dangerous place for fish that couldn't slow down quickly. Luckily, @CAPS1 was the legendary many codscanth all that specif does is float slowly. Yesterday, @CAPS1 caught two fish and gave them to his wife. Today all of fish are in the desert, which @CAPS1 absolutely despises. Using his patience, @CAPS6 waits for something to jump out. Suddenly, @CAPS6 sees a big chunk of meat on something shiny. It was too far away to grab, though. @CAPS6 went home to his wife. The next day, @CAPS6 went to the current and saw the floating meat again. @CAPS6 lunged for it and started chewing when something stabbed him. @CAPS1 started pulling fiercely when @CAPS6 heard a snap. When @CAPS6 tugged again @CAPS6 fell into the current. @CAPS6 was finally free! @CAPS6 also realized the current felt pretty nice. @CAPS6 ate a couple of fish and slept. When @CAPS6 woke up, @CAPS6 saw a big ugly fish standing on two fins. @CAPS1 couldn't breathe and @CAPS6 was in a not @CAPS6 snapped at one of the fins of the other fish and died. The ocean was a harsh and unforgiving place, where survival was a constant struggle for even the strongest and most patient of fish.
746	18668	7	3	In sports, patience is key. @PERSON1 exemplified this in his basketball career at @PERSON2 high. Despite not initially making the varsity team as a @CAPS1, he didn't give up. Through hard work and perseverance, he eventually earned a spot on the team, leading to a successful college career and a championship win. Drafted by the @CAPS2, he faced challenges but stayed patient, ultimately winning multiple @ORGANIZATION1 championships. In his final season, he remained calm under pressure and led the team to their sixth championship. Through it all, @PERSON1's patience and determination paid off, solidifying his legacy as an all-star player.
747	18669	7	3	The day I was patient was at camp, and I was on a ropes course. The person in front of me was taking a long time to move forward, so I had to be patient. When I finally got to go, I encountered the first obstacle, and the person ahead of me was still waiting on the platform. I had to wait until they were taken down before I could proceed. As I navigated through the obstacle, I was told to be patient again and wait for everyone to clear the platform ahead. It took a few minutes, but eventually, I was able to continue. That day taught me the importance of being patient in challenging situations.
748	18670	7	3	My mom's patience shines through when she helps my brother @PERSON1 with his homework, despite his strong dislike for math, reading, and spelling assignments. His frustration often leads to tantrums, but my mom remains calm and supportive, working with him until he completes his tasks. Her unwavering patience in these challenging moments truly demonstrates her caring and nurturing nature.
749	18671	7	3	Waiting to be the best. Music is pretty much my life, I love the way a song can make you feel, I love how walking a line on the bass guitar can change your day. As a young musician, all I can ever think about is music. I had reached my skill level on guitar, drums, and piano, the only instrument my family owns that I can't play is the bass. So when my guitar broke, I took Mr. Groth up on his need for a bassist in his band. I studied hard, learning the art of the bass guitar, reading the clef and learning the notes. I was waiting for my skills to increase and my memorization to improve, and I quickly fell in love with the instrument. I soon became better and it seemed each week I got better and better. I easily fell in love with the sounds it made and found that I loved it way more than the guitar. Sure, it will take time to become a pro, but I learned it's worth it.
750	18672	7	3	When I first saw my puppy, we were at the animal shelter. The volunteers brought over some dogs to be rescued, and as soon as I saw all six of them, the second one caught my eye. I knew he was going to be mine. Despite being told that he was scared and got carsick, I didn't care - he was my favorite. I made it clear that I wanted him, and after a week of waiting, I finally brought him home. We named him Max, and although he was initially afraid of everything, he now loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow. Every night, I tell him it's bedtime, and we sleep together. I learned that if you want something badly enough, patience is key.
751	18674	7	3	My dad has a girlfriend named @PERSON1. She has two kids, one thatís seven years old, and one that is four years old. The oldest one is @PERSON2, @CAPS1 loves to skateboard. The youngest one is @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 is kind of a spaz and if you jumped out of a airplane, @CAPS1 would too. This one day @PERSON2 and I were going to go skateboarding at a park, @PERSON3 wanted to come but @CAPS1 didnít even know how to ride a skateboard. @PERSON2 went over to the park and when we got there, @CAPS1 realized @CAPS1 didnít have his skateboard. I had to let him use my skateboard. I didnít have a problem with him using it, itís just that I didnít get to use it. In the end, we all had a great time at the park, and @CAPS1 even managed to learn a few skateboarding tricks by the end of the day.
752	18675	7	3	I believe that being patient means understanding and tolerant, especially in difficult situations. This story is about a time when I had to practice patience with my two-year-old brother. Despite his mischievous behavior, he was too cute to stay mad at. Throughout the day, I took care of him, played with him, and bathed him. Despite the challenges he presented, I remained patient and understanding. Patience is key when dealing with difficult situations, and in the end, it pays off in maintaining relationships and creating a positive environment.
753	18676	7	3	I have been a patient man in my life. An example is when I wanted to see @LOCATION1 their was a @CAPS1 line. I was in the mall and from where @LOCATION1 was it went all the way to the street. It was @NUM1 and my bedtime is @NUM2 so I had to hurry up. My sister and I ran to the back of the line where me and our parents were. They saved us a spot in line. It was all ready @NUM3 after @NUM4 and the line didnít even move. I was so mad. Every @NUM5 the line would scoot to a bit. When I was about to leave the line just started going up like a boom-army. @CAPS2 when I started getting excited. All I wanted to ask him was to get me a airsoft gun and a pony. The reason why is because I would ride the pony and shoot people who crossed my path. That would have been the life. @CAPS2 all I wanted to do. And I think @LOCATION1 would give me good airsoft gun because @DATE1 can come earlier than expected. As I was talking to my guys as were next is. We went to???.  I ask him what I wanted and he said ìyouíll shoot you eye out side.î @CAPS2 when I got mad because it had to be so patient. That is the last time Iím going to visit @LOCATION1 at the mall. Finally, my patience was tested to its limits, and I realized that waiting in long lines is not worth the frustration and disappointment.
754	18677	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at my football game and the defense had the upper hand. I waited on the sidelines, eager to get back in the game. Finally, my friend intercepted the ball, and our offense, including myself, rushed onto the field. I was handed the ball and managed to score a touchdown. During the two-point conversion, a high pass came my way, but I patiently tipped it to myself and caught it for the extra points.   After a brief pause for halftime, I took on the role of kick returner. I received the kick and ran it back for another touchdown, breaking numerous tackles along the way. As the game progressed to the final quarter, my team was neck and neck with the opposition. With the game on the line, our defense intercepted a pass, giving us possession. Our fullback caught a crucial pass and scored the game-winning touchdown. It was a moment that highlighted the importance of patience in the face of adversity, ultimately leading to our team's victory.
755	18678	7	3	The definition of patience is when someone demonstrates understanding and tolerance in situations that may test their calmness or composure.

Developing patience is crucial, especially for professions like therapy, where the ability to remain composed and understanding is essential. Patience is a valuable trait that allows individuals to navigate various situations with grace and empathy.

757	18681	7	3	"This is a writing piece on how I had to be patient to get a phenomenal bowl of ice cream. My grandparents had just picked my brother and me up from our house to go get ice cream at Cold Stone. I had never been to Cold Stone before, but my friends had said it was good, so I asked my grandparents if we could go. I was excited. When we arrived at our destination, the line was huge, shaped like a snake. The sign said ""15 minutes wait."" I was disappointed and almost left, but then I saw it - the peanut butter ice cream. It was right in front of me, so I convinced my grandparents to stay. When we finally reached the front of the line, I ordered the peanut butter ice cream. It was time to treat my taste buds to something special. It was fantastic - so smooth and delicious. I was grateful that I had been patient and had the chance to enjoy that amazing ice cream. That was the moment I realized the importance of patience in savoring simple pleasures like a bowl of ice cream."
758	18682	7	3	"Patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. There was a time when I was patient. Being patient is difficult to do, but I did it before. ìExcuse me, this isnít even moving,î said my brother impatiently. ""Hello, excuse me, can you walk any slower?"" a nice man said to me. ""Well, I can if you want me to,"" I replied. My brother, on the other hand, was getting impatient and rude. ""Are you that dumb? I wasn't being serious. I'm cutting you because of your stupidity,"" he said aggressively. The nice man in line remained calm and patient, while my brother cut ahead of him. Eventually, my brother's impatience led to him being kicked out of the park. As I waited patiently in line, I realized that being patient can be rewarding. It takes understanding and tolerance, but in the end, being patient leads to the best outcomes."
759	18683	7	3	A kid in my school, @PERSON1, has had a crush on my best friend Mycaela for who knows how long. He has asked her about fifty times. She likes him as a friend but nothing more. She has dated many guys since @PERSON1 first asked her out. Mycaela can be a little boy obsessed. In fact, she is now dating a boy who I asked out two days ago, sorry off-topic. Anyway, @PERSON1 is always very patient, hoping Mycaela will come around someday. Itís been almost two years with him stalking her, and she still hasn't come around. I just think that @PERSON1 is very patient and he is a great kid. Despite the long wait and lack of reciprocation, @PERSON1 continues to show unwavering patience and hope for a romantic relationship with Mycaela.
760	18684	7	3	One time I was patient when my mom was on the phone with my dad for about at least 3 hours. We were in the car on our way to my aunt's house. I was watching my dog on my lap for the first hour. The second hour I was sleeping. The third hour I was watching a movie and by this time I had to go to the bathroom really bad. Then by the last hour and a half, I was legitimately tearing up because I had to go so bad. By the time my mom got off the phone, we were at my aunt's house. I ran into the bathroom and then I was fine.
761	18685	7	3	I'm @PERSON1 and a year ago I was a foster kid. I had to have patience for a lot of things. First of all, my foster parents got divorced with kids. I had to have patience waiting till my foster mom found a home to move to. Secondly I wasnít told when I could go home. I had to wait till everything was over. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mom within a week. I packed and waited. I had to have patience with everyone. It was hard, extremely hard, mind crazy hard. It took two weeks and a day to get home and on top of all that I had to move all my stuff home and unpack to this day I am still unpacking. Being a foster takes a lot of patience. I learned that.  Being a foster child taught me the value of patience in a way that nothing else could. The waiting, uncertainty, and constant change tested my resilience and forced me to develop a level of patience that I never knew I had. Despite the challenges, I persevered and eventually found my way back home, grateful for the lessons I had learned along the way. Patience truly is a virtue, especially for a foster kid like me.

They were also making the food very slowly. Then people started yelling, ""Hurry up,"" they were also honking their horns but he was the only one who wasn't honking his horn. They were waiting for 20 minutes and an hour had gone by. He was starving and he still was being very patient. He usually is not patient. He was very excited to eat at the new restaurant. When it was his turn the cashier said, ""Thank you for being very patient."" By the time they got their food it took an hour. The food wasn't even good! He showed a lot of patience that day.

765	18690	7	3	I believe patience is important for many reasons. One reason is without patience you wouldn't be able to wait for anything. One example is you wouldn't be able to wait in line. My second reason for patience being important is without it people would complaint everyday because you use patience everyday. One example is if your waiting to buy a ticket or waiting to get gas you have to wait your turn to get it. Lastly patience is important because without patience wouldn't be able to read. This is because books sometimes take a while to read and you wouldn't want to take the time to finish it. That's exactly why l believe patience is important.  Patience is crucial in various aspects of our daily lives. Whether it's waiting in line at the grocery store, dealing with frustrating situations, or simply taking the time to read a book, patience plays a vital role. Without patience, we would constantly find ourselves becoming agitated and unable to handle everyday challenges. Therefore, it is evident that cultivating patience is essential for a more peaceful and fulfilling life.
766	18691	7	3	One time I went to a carnival with my dad. We had a blast while we were there. I kept on winning prizes at the games they had. I thought to myself ìnothing will get in my wayî well I was wrong. Everyone has their own level of patience. Mine is low but this one time I was tolerant and kept calm. As we were at the carnival is saw this new ride. Everyone was lined up to see what it was. When I got in line I was ready to go on. Until, someone got infront of me. Thatís when I began to get impatient. This is not going to be good. I waited and waited  as the line slowly moved up. It seemed like an hour but, it was only 20 minutes. People kept on going ahead of me. As if they did not see me, so did more people. It got to the point where I was about to say a rude remark. As I was about to say the rude things on my mind, I quickly held myself back. I remembered that I wanted my dad to be proud of me. So, as it was my turn to go on I finally did something good. I was so proud of myself on how I did not say anything. When the ride was over I quickly went to my dad. I so proud of myself on how I was tolerant. People going ahead of me wasn't so bad. Look like I can do something positive. If they thought was gonna get to me, they were right. But, they were wrong if they I was gonna say something.

I have to bit almost two hours for the games to be over and my parents make me wat in the game. My favorite speed is football and since I am a first base man and an eat fields; I have to wait of the ball to ??? so that  I can help the team. I also have to be patient during the meap because it is a long so and I must wait until people are we done. As you can see, I am very patient are have to be in many situations.   In addition to being patient during sports games and meals, I also have to practice patience when dealing with difficult school assignments. Sometimes, I have to spend hours researching and writing essays, waiting for the moment when I can finally submit my work. It can be frustrating at times, but I know that being patient and putting in the effort will ultimately pay off in the end.  Furthermore, I have to be patient when it comes to achieving my long-term goals. Whether it's working towards improving my skills in sports or studying hard to get into my dream college, I understand that success takes time and dedication. I remind myself to stay focused and patient, knowing that good things come to those who wait.  Overall, patience is a virtue that I have learned to cultivate in various aspects of my life. It helps me navigate through challenging situations and work towards my goals with a calm and steady approach. Being patient not only improves my performance in sports and academics but also shapes me into a more resilient and disciplined individual.
768	18694	7	3	Freezing cold and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait. What I was waiting for was the start of the @CAPS1 @DATE1 for @CAPS2. I had friends with me but they mostly talked among themselves, leaving me and my friend @PERSON1. Her dirty blond hair whipped her face, and she hunched her back against the wind. My yellow lab, @LOCATION1, tugged at his leash, and @PERSON1, being the one holding the leash, stumbled sideways. ìAre you sure you donít want me to take him?î I asked for the third time. ì@CAPS4, I got it!î @PERSON1 said happily. I felt bad; @LOCATION1 was my dog, I should be the one holding him. ì@CAPS5!î @PERSON1 said lightly as @LOCATION1 pulled her again, causing her to fall into me. I caught her, and she mumbled a quick apology. All day I had been complaining, partly about our luck with the weather, but mostly just to start a conversation. ìI think my hands are numb,î I said, burying them in my pockets. ì@CAPS6, at least it's not raining, like the weather man said,î @PERSON1 smiled, and I returned the gesture. A voice boomed out of the speaker, ì@CAPS8 walkers, let's get moving!î I glared at @PERSON1 and asked one more time, ìDo you want me to take him?î She patted my back and said slowly, ìI got it.î As we finally started the @CAPS1 @DATE1 for @CAPS2, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the warmth of friendship amidst the chill of the cold winter day.
769	18695	7	3	A time I was patient was when I had to baby sit little cousin. He was just a little baby, so I knew that if he started crying, or got upset that I coudn't get frustrated with him because he's a baby. There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, @CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important. I am proud of myself and being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not loosine my cool, or patience, with him or anyone else.
770	18696	7	3	"Ugh, what is taking the gym teacher so long? @PERSON1 whined. ""It's only been a few minutes,"" @PERSON2 said. ""@PERSON1, it may feel like hours, but you just need to be patient,"" @PERSON3 explained. However, @PERSON1 was impatient and decided to walk behind the stage, ignoring the advice of others. As a result, the gym teacher caught him and scolded him for disrupting the class. Nobody was able to play basketball because of @PERSON1's impatience. Hopefully, he will learn to have more patience in the future."
771	18697	7	3	I woke before school started getting ready, grabbed all my stuff and walked out. When I got to school I started hanging out with my friends and having a good day so far. At around lunchtime, we went outside to do some gymnastics moves like back walkovers, handstands, and cartwheels. After lunch, during resource time, I started feeling hungry and just wanted to go home. However, I had to wait until my mom got home around dinner time. I had to be patient and wait for a few hours, but in the end, it was worth it because dinner was delicious. Being patient paid off, and I enjoyed a satisfying meal with my family.
772	18698	7	3	There havenít been many times were I was patient but Iím going to tell you about when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver @PERSON1 made me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasnít allowed to talk the whole ride home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework. Which gave me something to do. That was one time I was patient but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was standing in line for a rollercoaster at cedar point. The beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait but we didnít care because it was my friendís and my favorite ride, it wasnít so bad because itís all worth it when you ride the ride. Those were times I were patient but Iíve had to wait patiently even longer than that! One other time I remember being patient was when I had to wait for my turn to play my favorite game at an amusement park. The line was long, and the people in front of me were taking their time, but I stayed calm and waited my turn. When it finally came, the excitement of playing the game made the wait worthwhile. Patience is not always easy, but the rewards of waiting can often be fulfilling.
773	18700	7	3	Hi, my name is @LOCATION1 @DATE1 and this is the time I was patient when waiting to go to a friend's house. Savannah's dad is a firefighter and he had to put out a fire and could not pick me up until the next afternoon. I was sad. It was the middle of @DATE2 and I haven't seen Savannah in @NUM1 months. That day I learned patience is a way of life people have to live with, and this is the time I had to live with it. Waiting for Savannah taught me the value of patience and understanding that sometimes circumstances are out of our control. It was difficult, but it made our reunion even sweeter when I finally saw her the next day. Patience truly is a virtue that can lead to greater appreciation and gratitude in the end.
774	18701	7	3	"There I was at Six Flags on a hot summer day, standing in line for the popular roller coaster. The sun beat down on us, making us sweat profusely. With at least two hours left to wait, the tension in the line was palpable. People around me were becoming irritable, their voices rising in frustration. Suddenly, a man shouted, ""Move up!"" This caused a commotion, with others in line joining in the shouting match. I chose to stay calm, not wanting to escalate the situation further. After an hour, everyone began to relax, and I saw that we were nearing the front of the line. As we finally reached the front and boarded the ride, I couldn't help but smile. The thrill of the roller coaster was exhilarating, and as we rode, I felt a sense of satisfaction for having remained patient. As the ride came to an end, I remarked, ""I knew patience would pay off."" It was a reminder of the importance of staying calm in challenging situations."
775	18702	7	3	"It was blistering hot, we had been waiting in line for an hour already. ""When can we go?"" I asked, feeling impatient. My parents reassured me, ""Just be patient, we're almost at the front."" My body was aching from walking around all day, but I was determined to go on all the rides.  After ten more minutes, I started to feel thirsty. My brother and sister agreed to go get a drink with me while my mom held our spot in line. Finally, we reached the booth and I asked for water, feeling relieved as I took the ice-cold drink.  On our way back to the line, I spotted a colorful shirt that caught my eye. ""Can I please get this shirt?"" I asked my brother. He hesitated, reminding me that we still had to wait a bit longer in line. But he eventually agreed, and I got the shirt before we headed back to the line.  Luckily, we were the second ones up when we returned. ""All aboard the mummy ride,"" the ride operator announced. We walked on, feeling excited because being patient had paid off. I had a feeling that this ride was going to be a blast."
776	18703	7	3	My name is ?? and this is a story about the time I was patient. Once when I was eight years old, my mom said she would take me to the fair that day. After lunch, we went to the fair, and I wanted to ride the biggest ride there. The line was very long, so I had to be patient to get on the ride. Even though I didn't want to wait in line, I knew I had to be patient. Halfway through, I started complaining, but I reminded myself that patience is key. I am glad I stayed patient because the ride was a lot of fun. That day, I learned that it's good to be patient. I promised myself that I would never be impatient again. That was the story of the time I had to be patient at the fair.
777	18704	7	3	Being patient is a valuable trait to possess. I recall a time when I had a dentist appointment scheduled for 10 am, but the wait extended beyond the designated time. My father and I sat in the waiting room, growing increasingly restless as the minutes ticked by. Despite the discomfort and hunger gnawing at me, I resisted the urge to complain or become agitated. The lack of entertainment options made the wait seem even longer. However, I then remembered the handheld gaming device tucked away in my pocket. As I immersed myself in the game, time seemed to pass more swiftly. This experience taught me the importance of patience and how a little distraction can make a seemingly endless wait more bearable.
778	18705	7	3	Patience is a virtue that often requires time and effort to cultivate. I remember a time when I had to exercise patience while waiting with my dad at the hospital. We were waiting for a hip replacement surgery, and the wait seemed never-ending. Despite the long hours spent in the waiting room, I tried to keep myself occupied. I counted the circling tiles on the floor, played games with my dad, and even managed to entertain myself with a book.  As the hours passed by, I could feel my patience wearing thin. However, I reminded myself that complaining would not make the time go by any faster. Instead, I focused on finding ways to pass the time and stay calm. Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, it was time for us to go home. Despite feeling exhausted, I was proud of myself for remaining patient throughout the ordeal.  This experience taught me the importance of patience and how it can help us navigate difficult situations with grace and composure. While it may not always be easy, practicing patience can lead to a more peaceful and fulfilling life.
779	18706	7	3	Patience is truly a challenging virtue to possess, especially when faced with difficult circumstances like being on punishment for not fulfilling responsibilities. In such situations, it is crucial to wait it out and not rush the process. Patience allows for things to unfold in their own time and in the right way. It is essential to understand that rushing through things may not yield the desired results and that patience can actually save time in the long run. By being patient, one can achieve their goals more effectively and efficiently. So, while it may be tough to wait it out, patience is indeed a valuable quality to cultivate.
780	18707	7	3	As I sit in the waiting room at @ORGANIZATION1ís @CAPS1 @CAPS2, waiting for my grandpa to come to the recovery room, I can't help but worry about the outcome of the surgery. What if something went wrong? What if he doesn't make it through? I try to calm myself down and ask the nurse if we can see grandpa now. She reassures me to be patient and everything will be fine.  After what feels like an eternity, a nurse finally comes out and informs us that the surgery went well, but my grandpa will need to stay in the hospital for a week and a half. I breathe a sigh of relief, grateful that he made it through. My mom tells me that as soon as he's settled in the recovery room, we can go see him and then finally leave the hospital.
781	18708	7	3	A time when I had patience was when I was waiting in the car to get to my destination. From my house to the location, itís about two hours away. So I had to sit in a car for two hours. The only things to do were listen to music and sleep, which I didnít do. It would take a lot of patience to wait in a car for two hours. After an hour had passed, it felt like four if you werenít doing anything. By that time, I was ready to do something, but I knew I had to be patient. I pulled out my phone and started texting people, but no one answered. I tried looking out the window, but that made me sleepy. Finally, two hours passed, and we made it to our destination. This was a time when I had patience.
782	18709	7	3	"I was off to the Autorama to be exact. I got to see a whole bunch of cool old cars, some were rusty and some were state of the art. As I walked around, I saw a sign that read ""Come see Chip Foose!"" Excited, I joined the line to meet him. However, the line seemed to never end, and I had to wait for what felt like forever. Eventually, I had to take a break and walk around with my brother to stretch our legs. After a long wait, we were finally next in line to meet Chip Foose. My brother, disappointed that he didn't get Foose's autograph, was comforted by a kind couple who offered us their spot. After 5 1/2 hours of waiting, we finally got the autograph we had been waiting for. It was a lesson in patience that I would not soon forget."
783	18710	7	3	Patients are individuals who have been injured or are ill and are receiving medical treatment in a hospital to recover. I, too, was a patient once when I fell sick for an extended period. My concerned mother rushed me to the hospital, where I received the necessary care. However, as we were leaving, I unexpectedly fainted and accidentally hit my chin on the door, resulting in another injury. This unfortunate incident required us to return to the hospital and stay for an additional hour. Thankfully, with the help of the medical staff, I was able to recover from both my initial illness and the subsequent injury. Being a patient, even for a brief moment, allowed me to appreciate the hard work and dedication of healthcare professionals in helping individuals like me regain their health and well-being.
784	18711	7	3	I was patient when I was at home yesterday watching the movie called @CAPS1. So I waited for a long time until the food was ready. I was so interested in the movie that I couldn't get my eyes off the t.v because the movie was so good. When I was really hungry, I had a second plate. After that second plate, I didn't get to eat the rest of my food, but I didn't complain that I was hungry.
785	18712	7	3	Being patient is essential, especially when someone is busy. I remember a time when my mom had just come back from work, and I was eager to go to my friend's house. Despite my repeated requests, my mom asked me to wait until she was done with her work. Even when I asked my dad to take me, he couldn't as he was already running late for work. So, I decided to be patient and wait for my mom to finish. Finally, when she was done, I was overjoyed and quickly went to my friend's house. It was a lesson in patience that taught me the importance of waiting for the right time.
786	18713	7	3	I think patience is the ability to be quiet and wait at the same time. For example, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost 10 times a day. First I need to be patient for my mom to drive me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc. I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didnít even know that means, but if Iím patient Iíll probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday. I think patience is a gift and I enjoy it.
787	18714	7	3	On @DATE2, I understand what my mom was saying to @CAPS1. She told @CAPS1 she couldnít get @CAPS1 anything for @CAPS2 because she had to pay the bills. She thought that she wasnít doing a lot for @CAPS1, but I reassured her that I was content with what I had. I just wanted to be around her, especially since my father wasn't helping to take care of us. My mom had to juggle two jobs to support our family, including @NUM1 kids, some of whom were not even his own. Despite my father's empty promises, my mom worked tirelessly to provide for us.  Everything seemed to be going okay until @DATE1 when my grandmother passed away. This loss hit us hard, and my mom, auntie, and uncle @PERSON1 all had to work harder to cover the expenses. We all mourned her absence, struggling to come to terms with her passing. I found it difficult to accept that she was gone, and my family tried to console me by explaining that she was now in a better place with her loved ones.  Even to this day, I struggle to fully grasp the concept of someone being gone. The memories of my grandmother still bring tears to our eyes, and the pain of her loss lingers. Despite the passage of time, the void left by her absence remains unfilled. The love and warmth she brought to our lives are deeply missed, and we continue to cherish her memory.
788	18715	7	3	The time I was patient was when we were on our way to @ORGANIZATION1. Our trip was only supposed to be three hours long, but one of the cars following us had a tire issue. We waited for them at a gas station, and it took some time for them to catch up after getting their tire fixed. Once we were all back on the road, we finally arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 and had the time of our lives!
789	18716	7	3	ì@PERSON1 let's go, this line is taking too long!î ì@CAPS1 @PERSON2 just be patient!î ì@CAPS2?î asked @PERSON2. ì@CAPS3 @NUM1 replied. ì@CAPS4 @CAPS2?î ìYou have never heard of patience?î ì@CAPS1î ì@CAPS6 you want to tell me that out of all these thirteen years you have never heard of patience?î ì@CAPS1î ì@CAPS6 you're trying to tell me that out of all these thirteen years you have never heard of patience?î ì@CAPS9î @PERSON2 replied in a confused voice. ì@CAPS10 @CAPS12 well, patience is when... Wow, I never knew patience would be so hard to explain.î ì@CAPS11 now do you get why I don't know!î ìI got it!î he yelled as he snapped his fingers. @CAPS16 one in the line was staring at them. Their faces turned red. But @PERSON1 ignored that fact and said, ì@CAPS12 @CAPS6 patience is like when you wait a long time but you don't care that you wait a long time and in the end, because you waited patiently, you get what you wanted.î @CAPS6 @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 @CAPS20 and @CAPS20 and @CAPS20 in line. Soon @CAPS21 they were up next. ì@CAPS14 tickets to @CAPS15 @CAPS16 where I look, please,î @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 said excitedly. ì@CAPS17 umm, hold on one sec while I open a new package of tickets,î the ticket booth man told them. @PERSON2 glared at @PERSON1 then said, ì@CAPS12 @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21: @CAPS19 @CAPS20 in this line for twenty minutes and now I have to wait more?î ìHere you go, kids, that's @CAPS14 dollars, please.î @PERSON2 was embarrassed but yet happy he got his tickets, @PERSON1 said, ì@CAPS11 you @CAPS20 and got what you wanted, that's called patience.î @CAPS6 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 sat down in the movie theater and watched a great movie. If they weren't patient, they would have never gotten to enjoy their new favorite movie!

792	18719	7	3	I was patient when I had to wait for my grandpa in the ER for his heart because he's not doing very well. My grandpa is in and out of the ER for his heart every day. He has to go see his cardiologist to check up on his heart, and that is why I am patient.

794	18721	7	3	In this narrative essay, I will write about different times when I had to be patient. One day, I was very anxious to get out of school on a Friday. The clock was ticking slowly, and I had a busy schedule planned for my day. Despite my impatience, I had to be understanding when unexpected delays occurred, and I was almost called home for being impatient.  Another time I had to practice patience was when I had to wait for my mom to wake up so I could go to the mall. I had received a low grade on my report card, and a new game was releasing that I really wanted. Despite my eagerness, I had to wait for my mom to rest after a night out, showing understanding and empathy for her situation.  Being patient during these moments taught me the importance of understanding and flexibility in various circumstances. It allowed me to appreciate the value of patience and how it can lead to better outcomes in the long run.
795	18722	7	3	As they continued on their journey, the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the land. The shadows grew longer, and the air grew colder. Little @CAPS2 shivered, her excitement slowly turning into impatience. But @ORGANIZATION1 reminded her to stay calm and keep looking for the castle.  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, they saw the towering walls of the castle in the distance. @CAPS2's eyes lit up with joy as she realized they had finally arrived. The queen awaited them, and @CAPS2's heart raced with anticipation.  As they approached the castle gates, @ORGANIZATION1 held @CAPS2's hand, guiding her towards their destination. @CAPS2's patience had paid off, and she felt a sense of accomplishment and pride in herself.  Entering the grand castle, @CAPS2 was greeted by the queen, who welcomed them with open arms. @CAPS2's imagination of a kind, patient, beautiful queen was realized, and she knew that this journey was just the beginning of an incredible adventure.  Through patience and perseverance, @CAPS2 had not only found the castle but had also learned an important lesson. Patience truly is a virtue, leading to great rewards and unforgettable experiences. And so, their adventure in the magical castle began, filled with wonders and excitement beyond their wildest dreams.
796	18723	7	3	A time I was patient was when I got my braces. I was so nervous, so it was hard to be patient. I waited in the waiting room for about fifteen minutes, then the assistant called me in. First, she told me what she was going to do. Second, she took an x-ray of my teeth. Third, she put metal bonds with a really strong glue on the back of my teeth. Fourth, she put the brackets on with really strong glue. Then the assistant put the wire between the brackets and metal bands. Finally, she asked me what color I wanted, then she put them on and I was free to go. The whole process took two hours, and I had to sit in a dental chair for that long. I had a lot of patience; it was hard but I did it. That is the time I had patience.
797	18724	7	3	So, despite the initial disappointment of having to wait longer for the family party, the anticipation for the PlayStation only grew stronger. The wait may have been excruciating, but the end goal was worth it. Finally, after all the anticipation and saving up, the moment to finally purchase the coveted PlayStation arrived. The dedication and patience paid off, and the joy of owning the desired item made every moment of waiting worthwhile.
798	18725	7	3	A time I was patient was at my friend cousin's birthday party. I was patient because the whole entire time that we were at the party I was waiting for an answer from my parents and my friend's parents to see if me and my friend could have a sleepover. So during that time that my friends and I waited we colored a couple dinosaurs pictures, watched a movie, ate dinner, played in the basement, went in the garage and ate cake and ice cream, decorated/painted our dance tool boxes, colored some more pictures, watched my friend's cousin open his presents and much more. Then it started getting dark outside so we tried to take a little nap, it was hard with a whole bunch of kids screaming. Soon enough it was time for my friend to go and then my parents said that we could have a sleepover, but my friend's mom said not tonight because my friend has a volleyball game in the morning. It felt like I waited for nothing. Then I realized when you're patient you get what you want more often.
799	18726	7	3	Being patient is important, as Iíve learnt before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight years old, and @PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself. I was able to call my @CAPS1 @PERSON2 anytime I was in need of help, but if I did call, I wouldnít get paid. @CAPS3 was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. This is how I was able to do so. I arrived at my @CAPS1ís house at about one thirty on the dot. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had just gotten back from a friendís birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sugary foods, like @CAPS2, cake, and ice cream. @CAPS3 could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in the door when they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My @CAPS1 left and I was stuck with them. @PERSON1 wanted to play on his play station. But @PERSON3 waited to play  box @NUM1. I began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I found a game that we could all play and enjoy. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 played tag while I watched. However, @PERSON3 being the unfair one denied that @PERSON1 had tagged him, and began to part. I was frustrated at their immediately, and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide-and-seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, @CAPS3 told them that only I would count so they wouldnít fight. Finally, @PERSON2 came home and I got paid the money @CAPS3 had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards.
800	18727	7	3	Patience is a virtue that involves waiting for someone or something in a polite manner. It is essential to exercise patience in various situations to show respect and consideration towards others.

Therefore, it is important to practice patience in order to build positive relationships with others and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
801	18729	7	3	There are lots of times that I have been patient. One time I was taking the @CAPS1 test we had a very long time to the different parts on the test. I was always done early, so I couldnít go on to the next part. Also we couldnít talk or get out of sets. I really wanted to go on t the next part because I had so much time left and nothing to do. Every one in the class got done early to sense we couldnít talk we just sat and weighed for testing time to be over I think every one wanted to go to the next part but we didnít no body complained or said anything we had to do this for a few day every year. Every year Iím alway patient. That a story on when Iím patient.  During the @CAPS1 test, I found myself in a situation where I had finished early and had to wait for the rest of the class to catch up before moving on to the next part. Despite my eagerness to proceed, I remained patient along with my classmates, as we were all bound by the rules of the test. We sat quietly, unable to communicate, and waited for testing time to be over. Even though we all wanted to move on to the next section, no one complained or caused any disruptions. This experience taught me the value of patience and the importance of following guidelines, even when it may be challenging.

If so, then you know how I felt when my sister didnít want to go outside for her own reasons. The other day, I was trying to get my sister to go outside with me because we have a special willow tree that we love to visit. Despite my efforts, she kept refusing to go out and exercise. In the end, I had to involve my mother to convince her, but even then, she brought a book along. Eventually, we made our way to the middle of our neighborhood, but then we went our separate ways.

Who went inside to check on everything, got directions, call my uncle to see if he was ready, and all this time us kids are sitting in the car waiting. Of course my brother was getting antsy and couldn't stop moving around until I finally couldn't take it anymore. ""That's it!"" I exclaimed, ""I'm going in to get them!"" I was the least patient of us all. Even my two little sisters had longer patience than I had. Tyler comes out 10 minutes later and tells us they're coming. WRONG! They didn't come out for another 5 minutes which made my brother mad. ""What took you so long?"" he asked. ""I had to make sure uncle was ready to leave,"" my dad answered. As soon as we got going, everyone fell asleep except for my dad who was driving. So no one really did much. At least we were all patient, except for my brother who's still like that now."

One particular incident that taught me the significance of patience occurred when I was seven years old at the mall. My sister and I were shopping at my favorite store, and after a long wait, a dressing room finally became available. However, my sister rushed ahead of me and went in first, despite my wait.

Despite my initial excitement, no one was willing to purchase it for me, prompting me to save up my money diligently. The days seemed to drag on endlessly, almost feeling like weeks had passed before the much-anticipated day finally arrived. To alleviate my impatience, I attempted to convince myself that I no longer desired the Wii, hoping to curb my eagerness. Surprisingly, this tactic somewhat lessened my anticipation.

It was a valuable lesson in managing expectations and appreciating the process of waiting.
823	18753	7	3	In my opinion, I am a very impatient person. Whenever I ask someone to stop doing something, theyíd better stop it on the spot. Also, I am not one of those kids who waits for dinner; I snack my way to it! When I am at school, I just can't stand listening to meaningless instructions for hours on end. That reminds me, my teacher is driving me crazy! He has absolutely no patience in any way, shape, or form. If we make one noise, he immediately goes on a rampage! Overall, I think people need more patience these days.

With this pick, they selected @ORGANIZATION5, a talented defensive lineman from the @ORGANIZATION2, who has proven to be a valuable asset to the team.

When the time came to see the winning artwork, there was no line, and I was able to fully appreciate the beauty of the piece depicting a scene of serenity. This experience taught me the importance of patience, as waiting made the moment even more special and rewarding.
845	18776	7	3	A time when someone else I knew was patient was when I was trying to have a sleepover with my friend @CAPS1. My parents ordered pizza for me and my two brothers because they went out for their anniversary dinner. It was around @NUM1 pm when they left, and we just started digging into the deep dish @CAPS2ís pizza. Halfway through dinner I got a text from my next door neighbor, ??? my best friend, asking if I wanted to have a sleepover. I replied saying that my parents are out, theyíll be back in a few hours, Iíll ask later. Finally around @NUM2 pm my parents came home and I asked about the sleepover. She said, ìI donít know.î And walked away. About an hour later I got my answer. It was a yes! I texted @CAPS1 and said that I could. She replied, ìfinally!î I had to go pack. So I went to my room and got everything I would need for a sleepover. I was just about to walk out the door when my mom shouted from upstairs, ì@CAPS5! I need you to take the dogs out before you leave!î I dropped everything, put the leashes on the dogs and stood outside in the pouring rain waiting for them to finish up. When they were done I grabbed my stuff and ran out the door before she made me do something else. When I got to @CAPS1's house she opened the door and let me in. I said, ì@CAPS1 it took so long. Thanks for being patient!î
846	18777	7	3	I donít have a time when Iím patience so today I going to write about how impatience I am. I thank one day I was in a long line at the stare. (@ORGANIZATION1). I was a hot day and I was ready to go my cool and big house and relax and chillout. You all know how old people are they walk slow and talk to much. If you already notice. @NUM1 of those people where in front of me. Heís taking all the day taking out his wallet and talking to much. So I said ìyou know what Iíll jus go to another @ORGANIZATION1 and get me a slippery due rite know I canít deall of this slowness or a humid dayî and left.  Feeling frustrated and impatient, I decided to abandon the long line and seek out a different store to satisfy my craving for a refreshing slushie. The slow pace of the elderly gentleman in front of me was testing my patience, especially on such a sweltering day. I couldn't bear the thought of enduring any more delays or the oppressive heat. As I made my way to another location, I left behind the tedious wait and embraced the opportunity to cool off and unwind in the comfort of my own home.
847	18778	7	3	"Being patient can sometimes be very hard, especially when whatever you are being patient about is really distracting and painful. This is the story of how I had to be patient when I fell outside and hurt myself. One day, my brother and I were playing outside, throwing water balloons at each other. I was already soaked from head to toe, but we still kept playing. Suddenly, I heard a buzzing sound by my ear. I turned around and saw a huge bee next to me. I was only seven years old and very afraid of bees. I panicked and ran down the driveway, thinking that the bee was still following me. I was starting to get tired, so I tripped and fell, scraping off a good amount of skin in the process. I immediately began to cry when I saw blood.   I went inside to tell my mom, ""Mom, I fell!"" I managed to scream between sobs. ""Oh my gosh! Let me go find some band-aids,"" my mother replied. The pain was intolerable for my little body. I kept silently crying, but I knew I had to be patient while my mom went to look for bandages. Just like when I had wasted a bunch of band-aids by plastering them across my dolls' faces, I had to be patient and wait for a long time until my mother finally found the bandages. ""I found them!"" my mom said, while running down the stairs. ""Thank you for being so patient."" She stuck the band-aids across the cut on my leg and then gave me a lollipop. I knew I had been a good girl by being patient."
848	18779	7	3	Yo! Iím the narratorÖ you know the dude that tells the story, well Iím gonna tell you a story about patience. Ok, so, there was this armadillo. His name is @CAPS1. Now @CAPS1 is no ordinary armadillo. @CAPS1 was an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. So @CAPS1 being the smart @CAPS1 he is thought about this idea and decided to make a shell of his own. @CAPS1 went to the junk yard to look for things to help him make his shell. He found a lot of light weight metal so he took it home, melted it down, and started the long process of metal smithing his shell. When his shell was complete he tried it on and it fit nice and snug. The next day he went to school and everyone was so impressed and it was super shiny. @CAPS1 was no longer made fun of. @CAPS1 had to be patient to make his shell!  @CAPS1's determination and patience paid off in the end. He showed that with hard work and perseverance, he was able to overcome the obstacles he faced and create something truly special. The other armadillos learned to appreciate @CAPS1 for his unique shell and no longer made fun of him. It just goes to show that patience and dedication can lead to great things.
849	18780	7	3	Being patient is a very difficult thing to do. Many people canít be patient. For example my brother. If he orders something online or is wait for dinner be perparred he always has to be winey of when heís going to get what he wants. Iím not like that. I actully have patience. For example I needed shoes so I searched the internet to see if I could get a good deal. I was searching on the @ORGANIZATION1 store when I saw these really good shoes. I asked my dad if I could order them online. So the next day my mom orders them online, I was so excited, I waited and waited. After three day I missed my school bus. My mom had to go to college and she couldnít drop me off. So I stayed home alone. I found out that my dad was comeing home that exact day and the house was a mess. So I started cleaning. My mom came home and saw a box laying on the front. She picked it up and opened the box and saw my shoes were in there! I went to go welcome her and I saw my shoes lay there. I jumped up in excitement and put them on and it was a perfect fit. My mom came in the room and said they were suppose to arrive on @DATE1 but since you were patient they came early. My patience paid off in the end, and I learned that good things come to those who wait.
850	18781	7	3	I have never met a more patient person than this girl I know. She always demonstrates remarkable patience, such as the time when I was hesitant to go sledding down a hill. Despite my reluctance, she remained calm and understanding, suggesting that she go down first before I followed. Her patience was also evident when I was taking a long time to get dressed for a dance, even though we were already running late. I am amazed by her surplus of patience and hope some of it rubs off on me as I could certainly benefit from it. I believe I may be one of the few people in the world without much patience, and witnessing her patience in action inspires me to cultivate this valuable trait.
851	18782	7	3	One rainy day my dad's leg was bothering him. He took medication but that didn't work, so we took him to the hospital in Coro. They looked at his leg and told us we had to go to the hospital in Covent Hospital. When we arrived, there were around ten people in the waiting room. Despite the crowd, my dad patiently waited his turn. After being called into the examination room, he underwent X-rays to determine the issue. With more patience, he awaited the results. Upon learning that surgery was necessary, he remained calm and composed. Despite the uncertainty, he showed remarkable patience while waiting for the surgical procedure. Thankfully, his patience paid off, as the surgery was successful and his legs are now fully healed. I never realized how much patience my dad had until this experience.
852	18783	7	3	I am patient every day this year for @CAPS1 so I can get some @CAPS2. I was buying @CAPS2 but I canít buy any more because @CAPS1 is coming up. That's why I have to be patient because it will seem longer if I keep getting excited. Every day requires patience; sometimes I canít wait to get out of school so I can play. Iím always trying to be patient because it's one holiday after another, each one more exciting than the last. Every kid tries, but being patient is one of the hardest things to do. How Iím patient is by acting like nothing exciting is even coming up.
853	18784	7	3	Today was Thanksgiving, and we had to drive up to a rural area to visit my cousins. The car was burning a lot of fuel on the trip, but despite the long journey, the patience was hard to come by. I wished I had a plane ticket to fly out and see the cool things along the way. As we turned off the highway, we were greeted by the warmth of family as we sat down together. We caught up, exchanged gifts, and enjoyed a delicious turkey dinner. It was a heartwarming Thanksgiving spent with loved ones, making the trip well worth it.
854	18785	7	3	On my way to @STATE1, I was patient because I had to wait for the buses. I also noticed that on some stops, it seemed like there were more buses arriving at @NUM1 intervals. It made the wait a bit more bearable as I could see that the buses were running frequently. However, when the bus finally arrived at my stop, I was so tired that as soon as I got on the bus, I fell asleep.
855	18786	7	3	"Today was the final day of tryouts, the deciding moment for all the girls hoping to make the team. As the envelopes were handed out, I tried to contain my nerves. ""Wait until you've left the building to open your envelope,"" the coach instructed. It was a test of patience, but one that made sense to prevent any unnecessary heartache inside the room.   I received my envelope and resisted the urge to tear it open immediately like some of the other girls. I knew I had to wait until I was outside. The anticipation was almost unbearable, but I held on. Finally, when I was in the open air, I opened the envelope. And there it was - I had made the team! The excitement and joy that flooded through me were worth every moment of waiting.  I was grateful for the lesson in patience that day. It taught me that sometimes, delaying gratification can lead to a sweeter reward. I was glad I listened to the coach's advice and savored the surprise of the moment. It was a reminder that good things come to those who wait."
856	18787	7	3	It was my family vacation, and we were going to @CAPS1 Point. We were staying in the magical hotel, which was beautiful. You could see a real waterfall, making it feel like a haven. Our room was huge, with a massive bathroom and big beds. Looking out the window, we could see roller coasters and all kinds of rides. Among them was the new ride called the @CAPS3 Breaker: towering at @NUM2 hundred feet tall and as big as the Statue of Liberty, it would pick you up, drop you, and twist you like a tornado. It moved from side to side, an exhilarating experience.   Excited, my mom, dad, and I decided to ride it. However, there were many people waiting in line. While my parents were hesitant, I was eager to try it out. I joined the line, knowing patience was key. Despite the wait of several hours and only @NUM6 people ahead of me, I persevered. Finally, my turn arrived. The ride lifted me up @NUM7 hundred feet, dropping and spinning me around until I felt exhausted. When I got off, tears welled up in my eyes, but they were not of fear; they were tears of exhilaration and joy. This experience taught me the value of patience and the reward it can bring.
857	18788	7	3	"I elevator tapping my foot, smooth jazz music humms out of speakers above me. Eventually the all too familiar click was head and the smooth metal doors slid open to reveal a well furnished hallway with many other people waiting @CAPS6 their turn of departure on the elevator. I slipped out, trying now to become trampled by the massive crowd, then, silence. My footsteps echoed off the tiled floor as I searched for room @NUM1. Finnaly finding my destination I open the door and step inside where many other squirring children are waiting. I remove my coat and hang it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. I continue by searching through the magazine section, torn up fashion magazines and delicately handled sports illustrated are flipped through until I find an interesting looking article on swimming. Magazines under my arm I choose a seat in the far corner to wait in. Minutes pass, I can tell that the child next to me is becoming impatient fast, he taps his mothers jacket repeatedly and asks the same thing he did two minutes ago,î ""Mom, how much longer?"" The mother checks her watch and in a closely annoyed tone replies, ""Not much longer now dear."" So, the little boy slumps back in his seat and jams his thumb into his mouth to keep him occupied. I roll my eyes, but canít help but crack a smile at his actions. Somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowns as she texts on her cellphone, after a quick glance at the clock she scowls and continues. Just then, the glass door slides open and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes steps out. Across the waiting room, patients look up at her, their eyes full of anticipation and hope. ""Ms. Smith, the doctor is ready to see you now."" Quickly, I avoid the angry glares from other patients and follow her out the door. ìYou know itís funny,î she says well snapping her gum. ìFor someone so young you were the most patient person out there!î I merely nod my head and grin because I understand that patient people experience difficulties without complaining and I am very grateful that Iím a patient person."
858	18789	7	3	One day my brother, my mom and me were going to the doctorís because my brother was sick. When we got to the doctorís officeís and sat in the waiting area.

Being patient may seem difficult, but in the end, it is a valuable trait to have.
859	18790	7	3	Patience is essential when faced with long lines, whether it's at the grocery store or waiting for a new video game. I experienced this firsthand during a trip to California, where I had to endure lengthy lines at the airport and for food. Despite the boredom and hunger, I learned the value of patience during that week. It was a test of endurance, from waiting in lines to traveling long distances. In the end, I realized that being patient can lead to positive outcomes, even in the most trying situations.
860	18791	7	3	To be considered patient, you must be tolerant and understanding, and you cannot complain. I love babysitting my little cousin, especially when they are still infants. This @DATE1, I went to my cousinís house to watch her daughter @CAPS1í @PERSON1, for about three hours. I was getting paid fifty dollars, and I couldnít wait. When I got to their house, @NUM1 was sleeping, and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that, I figured it was a bad idea she started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her in the swing, and even tried to feed her but nothing worked. I was so upset, I fell like screaming. The baby cried for an hour and a half, and wouldnít hush. Then I said, ì @NUM1, whatís the matter?î @CAPS2 I spoke, there was a moment of silence, she had stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I was being patient because I stayed somewhat calm and I didnít complain to @CAPS1í@CAPS4ís mom.  In the end, my patience paid off, and I was able to calm the baby down without losing my cool. It taught me the importance of staying composed in challenging situations and the power of patience in dealing with infants.
861	18792	7	3	Every year since I learned about Christmas and presents, now that I think about it, they never said youíd have to wait months until Christmas came around. I love Christmas but once a year or so, Iím patient enough to wait until Christmas rolls around. The first day of December told me Christmas was coming along with all the decorating, caroling, and joyful Christmas spirit. I usually try to pass the time by having snowball fights with my cousins. I still feel the temptation to try to rush time and make it go faster, but I try to be patient and let the anticipation fade away. When Christmas Eve finally comes, Iím grateful I made it this long with patience because Iím just like my parents and canít wait for anything that takes months. Then Christmas comes around as slow as possible and then leaves quicker than I could imagine, making me realize how fast it went by. Just like the saying goes, time flies when youíre having fun.
862	18793	7	3	"Once when I was a little boy, about seven years old, I was extremely patient about a toy I wanted. Ever since ""The Last Airbender"" was on television and in stories, I was crazy about them, and I still am today. The Avatar is the only person in the world who can master all four elements: water, earth, fire, and air. Now I can write you a whole book about the Avatar. So, I saw an Avatar toy set on TV, and I asked my mom if she could buy it. She said she would when she had the money, but until then, no. Of course, I was upset. I waited and counted the days until finally, the day came. I was so excited, but then I found out my mom only had two hundred dollars, so I had to wait another week. I was so upset that I ran upstairs, locked my door, and cried myself to sleep. My birthday was approaching, and I was so caught up in my disappointment that I forgot all about the toy. When my birthday arrived, I finally got the Avatar toy. My mom said that all the patience I had shown paid off, and I got what I wanted."
863	18794	7	3	Patient is like your waiting for something and you don't complain its taking to long, and your just sitting there waiting quietly. Here is an example.

The teacher asked if he had a page of a story that was due a month ago, to which the kid replied that he did not because he had been busy with a basketball tournament. The teacher then gave him until the next day to submit the paper.  The following day, the kid was still unable to turn in his paper. When asked why, he explained that his grandpa had passed away. Understanding the situation, the teacher granted him another day to complete the assignment. Despite the difficulties, the kid managed to finish his paper in time.
865	18796	7	3	I have been patient many times in my life, but this particular instance tested my patience greatly. We were in the midst of building something special, a project that I had been looking forward to for a long time. After starting on a day after school, we had to pause our work for a week due to various reasons.  During that week, it felt like time was dragging on forever. I was filled with excitement and anticipation to continue working on our project. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, we were able to pick up where we left off and finish the task at hand.  The sense of accomplishment and joy I felt upon completing our project was indescribable. Seeing the walls painted in the colors of my favorite university, with my bed all set up, filled me with happiness. It was a long journey to get to that point, but the end result was worth every moment of waiting.  Now, I could finally enjoy my new room and sleep peacefully in a space that we had worked so hard to create. The feeling of satisfaction and fulfillment made all the patience and waiting worthwhile.
866	18797	7	3	During those weeks of waiting, I resisted the temptation to spend my money on other things and stayed focused on my goal.

So my dad asked if we could get off the rollercoaster and they said once you get on there is no getting off. So I had to ride it and when I did, I wanted to go on it over and over again. Even though it was a 17-second ride, it was the best thing that I had ever waited for in my life so far. That is the time when I had to be patient to get something that I really wanted.

After I asked my dad when we would be there, about 10 minutes later we finally arrived at @LOCATION1 adventures! The line to get our tickets was long but not too long. Once we got them, we went to look for a locker to put all of our stuff in. The line for that wasn't long, so we did that quickly. We were all hungry, so we went to eat. The line to order was very long, but we managed to get through it.   After eating, it was time to ride some awesome rides! ""Oh, man!"" is what I kept saying when the lines for the rides were super long. But I stayed patient.

We spent about 10 minutes browsing around. When we were ready to check out, the line was surprisingly short. Finally, a short line!  Throughout the day, I tried to be patient despite the long lines.

After I ate all the meat, I said, “Okay, I am done.” My dad laughed at my stubbornness. “Eat the vegetables out of it,” my dad said. “No way! I hate celery!” I whined. After a half-hour of the war of wills, my dad won. I didn’t want to leave the table, but he was very patient with me. I ended up eating the chop suey and leaving the table.

We were suppose to be going to @CAPS1 adventures and my grandma said she wanted me and my cousins to be ready by a certain time so we wouldnít get there that late. So the next day we get to her house right there at @NUM1 like she said and we had found out that she had over slept and we all looked at one another because we new that it was going to take a long time. So I said thatís ok we can wait and we all went into her house and waited until every one was ready. So as we were walking out I noticed that my grandparent were caring suitcases and I said why do you guys carring suitcases my grandma and that we were going to spend the night in a hotel I so we would be even closer to @CAPS1 adventures. So she drove all of us back to our houses to get our??? ??? and @NUM2 extra pair of clothes after that we were as our way to the hotel and ready to go to @CAPS1 adventure that next morning. Even though we were suppose to go to @CAPS1 adventure straight from my grandma's house, I remained patient and understanding throughout the changes in plans, which ultimately led to a fun and memorable trip with my grandparents and cousins.
880	18811	7	3	One time I had to be patient was when I went to @LOCATION1 with my mom, dad, @CAPS1 my sister and my grandma. My cousins live in @LOCATION1 so we were going to visit them. We had to drive @NUM1 hours in a small col bolt with five people. We had to be patient on the car ride there because we were all really exited. When I first found out that we were going I was really happy and I knew I would have to be very patient. We had to drive the hole day then get a motel to stay in. Then we had to drive till about @TIME1 and we were fanaly @TIME1 my great aunts lake house, my my grandmas sister. It was so fun geting to see them again! But then came more patients on the trip home. We were all sad to leave but we had a great time. The trip home felt shorter than the trip there but still long. When we got home everyone of us was tired and tired of being in the car but we were glad we didnít have to drive anothe hour home like my grandma. That was a time when I had to be patient.  On the journey back home, we reminisced about the wonderful moments we shared with our relatives and the fun times we had at my great aunt's lake house. Although the ride felt shorter on the return trip, we were all exhausted and longing to stretch our legs. Finally arriving home, we were relieved to be out of the car and grateful for the memories we had made. The patience we exercised throughout the trip was well worth it for the joy we experienced with our loved ones.
881	18812	7	3	This is a story about a time I was patient. It was night time and all of a sudden wire from my braces popped out of place. It was sticking out of my mouth and there was nothing I could do about it. I had to wait for my mom to get home and help me but I was scared. However, I remained patient. I kept waiting until my mom arrived and we were able to fix the wires. I was relieved that I had been patient and waited for her assistance. It taught me the value of patience in difficult situations.
882	18813	7	3	Be patient a day when I had to be patient was on my birthday, waiting for my dad to give me some money so I could go to the store. I waited all day until 1 o'clock, and when he finally agreed, I got 20 dollars. It was worth being patient because if I had rushed him, he might have lowered the price. In another instance, I had to wait for my mother to pick me up from football practice. We waited for a while, and I was the last one there. I sat under a tree when it started raining and lightning, unable to put on my helmet. Being patient in such situations is important as rushing can lead to undesirable outcomes. So, in moments of waiting, it's best to stay calm and composed.
883	18814	7	3	What exactly is patience? Patience means to wait calmly for something. One of the times that I had to be patient was when I wanted my ears pierced. I tried everything for four years, begging, pleading, even cleaning, but it still didnít work. My mom says I have to be 12 before I can get my ears pierced. So instead of annoying her, I sat back and stayed patient. By doing that, I got my mom to change the age to twelve. So all I have to do is wait until soccer is finished and find a place and sheíll take me. Patience really helps in many different ways and I encourage you to try being patient when you want something, because it will all fall into place.
884	18815	7	3	Sometimes being patient is hard. I've had to do it a lot of times. One time in particular was very life-changing for me. It was my favorite day of the year, my birthday. I always waited eagerly for this day to arrive. I woke up early, excited to see my presents, but to my disappointment, there were none. My mom seemed preoccupied, and when I asked her about my birthday, she just brushed it off. Disheartened, I returned to my room and waited patiently for something to happen, but nothing did. I decided to distract myself by playing video games, hoping someone would acknowledge my special day. However, the day passed without any mention of my birthday. Just as I was starting to feel disheartened, I discovered a surprise birthday party in the basement later in the evening. It turned out to be a fantastic celebration with friends and presents. I realized that my patience had been rewarded, and now I approach each day with a sense of patience and anticipation.
885	18816	7	3	Last weekend I went with some friends to the annual Christian rock music festival, Rock the Kingdom. The highlight of the event was getting to see my favorite Christian rock band, The Messengers, perform live. They wowed the crowd with their new songs and epic guitar solos that had everyone on their feet.  After the concert, my friend and I decided to wait in line to meet the band and get their autographs. The line seemed to stretch on forever, winding its way towards the parking lot. Despite the long wait, we ended up striking up a conversation with the girl behind us, who turned out to be a huge fan of The Messengers as well. We bonded over our shared love for their music and ended up exchanging contact information.  When we finally reached the front of the line, it was all worth it. The band members were incredibly friendly and down-to-earth, taking the time to chat with each fan and sign autographs. I even got the chance to give the lead singer, Michael, my lucky bracelet as a token of appreciation for their music.  Overall, the experience taught me the value of patience and how sometimes waiting for something can lead to unexpected friendships and memorable moments. I left the festival feeling grateful for the opportunity to meet my favorite band and make a new friend in the process.
886	18817	7	3	One time there were two twin chipmunks, their names were A.J. and @PERSON1. @PERSON1 always had patience, while A.J. did not. One day, on a sunny day with a cool breeze, A.J. decided he wanted to go on a trip with @PERSON1. They packed up their camping gear and ventured deeper into the woods, reaching their destination around dusk. They attempted to build a fire, with @PERSON1 gathering firewood and trying to start it as their parents had taught them. However, A.J., lacking patience, struggled to get the fire going. Frustrated, he eventually gave up, leaving @PERSON1 to successfully start the fire after a few minutes. A.J. proceeded to cook some acorns but continuously burnt them by leaving them on the fire for only a few seconds. After multiple failed attempts, A.J. finally gave up and the two went to bed. The next morning, @PERSON1 woke up to find A.J. cooking breakfast, having learned the importance of patience. In the end, A.J. had finally grasped the value of patience through their camping experience.
887	18818	7	3	My head was in the sky. It was mine. The ticket I'd been dying for was actually mine. I was going to see three days @ORGANIZATION1 and breaking @CAPS1 with my own eyes! Only one thing was bad. The concert was @NUM1 days away. So soon but oh so far. For three days (no fun intended!) I whined and whined, but only in my head. I didn't want to annoy my father after all he did just spend loads of money on me! After those three days, I was okay. I still promised myself I wouldn't break my rule of no complaining. I couldn't tell if the week went fast or slow. All I knew was I couldn't wait any longer. Soon enough, it was @DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 tonight. The day crawled. I wanted to explode with excitement. All I could think was what would happen later today. Every second my heart pounced until I got in my dads car at @NUM2. cool clothes, crack, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days of no complaining? CHECK! We listened to the three bands we would be seeing all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought my heart had gone back to normal but with each beat of life along they hear got louder and louder and almost in time to the pound of their bass drums. Passed a limo with one window open, I swear I saw the singer of breaking @CAPS1.(@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. I saw the limo just as we entered @LOCATION1. No more than ten minutes later we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in. I reached into my bottle of patience, and pulled out the small scraps of what I had left. The enormous tunnels the lines were gray and dras. We had to walk for a mile to get to the end of the line, and the line sacrues of, if ???? up of snails, but before I knew it, I was in . I had yet to complain. I was proud of my patience.  The day of the concert arrived, and my excitement was palpable. As we made our way to the venue, the anticipation continued to build. The long line of fans waiting to get in did little to dampen my spirits, and I was determined to maintain my patience. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I found myself inside the venue, ready to enjoy the music of my favorite bands. It was a night to remember, and I was grateful for the experience. The concert was everything I had hoped for and more, and as I reflected on the day, I realized that sometimes, good things are worth the wait.
888	18819	7	3	One day I was being really patient. I was babysitting and it was going great until the kids started fighting! It was my two little brothers, of course. They were hitting, kicking, and the youngest one was biting. I told them to stop, and they did for a while, but then started again over a toy. I went back to their room and told them to stop once more. They stopped for good until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everyone said. I warned him to stop or he would go to his room. Eventually, he stopped, and everyone behaved for the rest of the night until mom and dad got home. That was a whole different story. So, that's the time I was patient with my little brothers and sisters.
889	18820	7	3	A time when I was very patient was last year. My auntie said she was taking me to a basketball game. So the next day when I woke up, I woke up too early. My aunt never told me what time she was coming. So I got ready at 7 am. At 8 am, I called her but she didn't answer. I decided to watch TV and play my game while waiting. Around 3 pm, my aunt called back, saying she had to go to the store. My frustration started to build up, but I tried to be patient. At 4 pm, my mom said we should go out. I was getting angry as I wasn't expecting to leave with my mom. We got home around 5 pm, and I was even more upset as my aunt hadn't called. Finally, I called her, and she said she was coming down the street. Later that day, I had fun with my cousins and aunt.
890	18821	7	3	ì@CAPS1, when do we open presents?î I asked eagerly. ì@CAPS2 we get back from church,î she replied. Our @DATE1 tradition involved preparing @CAPS3 eve dinner, attending the service, enjoying a meal with grandparents, opening one present, and then heading to bed briefly before the real gift extravaganza. ìAmen,î our pastor concluded the service, signaling the start of the festive celebrations. ìCan we go now, @CAPS1?î I pleaded. ì@CAPS6,î she chuckled.  After a delicious dinner, the anticipation grew, making time feel sluggish. It wasn't until my grandparents left that I could hardly contain my excitement. Finally, gathered around the @CAPS3 tree, the moment arrived for me to open a present. I received a sleeping bag, which meant we would all be sleeping on the floor in one room that night. Despite the discomfort, I was thrilled at the thought of what @CAPS3 morning would bring.  Lying on the floor, my mind raced with thoughts of the gifts awaiting me. As I drifted off to sleep, I dreamt of the surprises that awaited us the next morning. At @NUM2, I couldn't contain my excitement, waking everyone up in anticipation of the gift-opening. The wait was long, but the joy and happiness that followed made it all worthwhile.
891	18822	7	3	Patience is a virtue that involves waiting and persevering for what you desire. It requires you to maintain a positive attitude while waiting for things to come to fruition. Whether it's a material possession or a personal goal, patience teaches us to stay calm and composed until we achieve our desired outcome. It is essential to practice patience in all aspects of life to cultivate a sense of understanding and resilience. Remember, good things come to those who wait patiently.
892	18823	7	3	Once I was taking a test it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spair. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember bring something to do while your being patient. If you have nothing to do just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone. Waiting patiently can be challenging, but having a book or some other form of entertainment can make the time pass more quickly. Being patient not only helps in situations like these, but it also demonstrates maturity and self-control. So, next time you find yourself in a situation where patience is required, remember to bring something to occupy your time and practice waiting quietly.
893	18824	7	3	One day I asked my parents if I could buy this game that I wanted and they asked me how much is it? I said that I did not know how much it is. So he said that we would go to the store and see how much it is. When we got to there we found out that it was $2 and I said can I buy it and he said maybe after a while I started begging he still said $1! when I went home I went to sleep the next morning I was at home watching TV and I saw this commercial about the game and it said that the game was still $1 so I ???. When we went to the mall me saw that it was $3 and so I finally got to buy it.
894	18825	7	3	Everyone experiences moments of patience in their lives. I recall a time when I had to exhibit patience when I was just ten years old. It all started with a small popcorn kernel that got stuck in my throat. After watching a movie, I swallowed the last piece of popcorn from the box and immediately felt discomfort. Despite the pain and thirst that followed, I remained patient throughout the ordeal.  As my mom and I ran errands, I couldn't shake off the discomfort caused by the popcorn kernel. I asked my mom for a drink, but she only had a credit card and couldn't buy me one. Despite feeling extremely thirsty, I tried to distract myself and be patient. We then headed to the bank, where my mom needed to withdraw money. The minutes felt like hours as I waited, but I didn't complain.  Finally, when we arrived home, I rushed to the fridge, grabbed a bottle of water, and drank it all in one go. The relief was immediate, and I helped my mom with the chores, feeling content and happy that my patience had paid off. This experience taught me the value of patience and how it can lead to a positive outcome in the end.
895	18826	7	3	There have only been a few times in my life where I really had to be patient, but the I can remember the most was when I was at the @LOCATION1 airport. My parents and I were waiting at our terminal, for our flight to @LOCATION2. @CAPS2íd been waiting about @NUM1 minutes when @CAPS2 heard an announcement. ì@CAPS1 has gone wrong with the plane but @CAPS5 should be fixed in about an hour.î @CAPS2 eventually found out that the back door had been slammed too hard, which broke one of the parts. They needed a new part so the emergency slide would work. An hour of waiting sounded okay. But @CAPS6 there was another announcement ìIím sorry, but @CAPS2 cannot get the part right away. The wait will be a minimum of @NUM2 hours.î @CAPS3 sounded worse, but I kept calm. My mom was well freaking out. Three hours had passed. @CAPS6 four. @CAPS6 @CAPS4. My laptop and my iPod ran out of power so I was just fiddling with my fingers. @CAPS6 @CAPS2 heard ì@CAPS5 turns out @CAPS2 cannot get the part until tomorrow morning.î @CAPS6 a big ìughhhî swept accrcoss the terminal. But luckily, @CAPS2 received a free night at a hotel until the flight. The wait was exhausting, but @CAPS2 all had patience, so @CAPS2 got through @CAPS5. It was a test of patience that taught me the value of staying calm in unexpected situations.
896	18827	7	3	A couple of days ago when I was at cheer, a lot of drama was going around our team. It was fifteen days before the competition, and everybody was yelling at someone. There was so much yelling and talking back to our coaches that no one could understand what we were supposed to be doing. The side I was on for the pom routine in our second formation wasn't in a diagonal line as we were supposed to be and wasn't getting to the kickline in time because the people on the other side were pushing us. @LOCATION1, one of our coaches' daughters, was yelling at the side I'm on for not getting to the kickline in time, even though she was the one pushing us farther down so we couldn't get there. Then @PERSON2 stood up for @PERSON1, saying it wasn't all her fault and that @LOCATION1 was also to blame for pushing us over. @LOCATION1 tried to deny it, but it was evident that she knew it was true because she adjusted her position next time, moving farther away from the center. This incident showed that @PERSON2 was loyal to @PERSON1, even though they may not be best friends. They still supported each other, which was important in resolving the conflict within the team.
897	18829	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go but she wasnít ready. She had to get her hair done and some clothes on. I waited patiently and didnít say anything. I didnít want to but I did. I wanted to go outside and my sister wanted to go so I waited on her. I walked out the door quietly then my sister yelled I want to go wait. I went back in the house and waited for her to first find some clothes, so she went upstairs and found some. She put her clothes on then she had to look for her shoes. She searched the whole house and then found them in the corner. So we were about to walk out and I said girl whatís wrong with your hair surprised. She felt her head and said oh I forgot. So we went back in the house and I tried to put her hair in a ponytail and it wouldnít fit. So I let her do something and she couldnít. So I parted her hair and put it in two ponytails. Then we went outside. Thatís a time when I waited patiently on my sister.
898	18830	7	3	When I was getting ready to leave my uncle's ranch, I was waiting patiently for my dad to get back so he could help my brother put the bike on the trailer. It had been a few hours, and my dad had not returned yet. I was struggling to take my backpack off the trailer because it was too heavy, and my dad was still out riding his horse. Finally, when my dad arrived, my brother went off to ride his motorcycle. I was finding it challenging to load everything and leave, but thankfully, my mom and sister decided it was time to go and lent a hand. With their help, we were able to pack up and head home smoothly.
899	18831	7	3	"It was a rainy day in the town of Brookfield, Ohio. My cousin, brother, and I were excited to go to the carnival that had just opened up down the street. However, when we arrived, the weather had caused a delay in the opening of the rides. We patiently waited until they were all up and running.  As we went on ride after ride, the one that caught our eye was the ""Freax Out."" With its flashing lights and loud music, it seemed like an exhilarating experience. Despite my initial fear, my cousin, being the kind person he is, waited for me to gather the courage to join them in line.  After an hour of contemplation, I finally decided to face my fear and go on the ride. My heart was pounding as we got on, but as soon as the ride started, I felt an adrenaline rush like never before. In the end, thanks to my cousin's patience and encouragement, I ended up loving the ""Freax Out"" ride.  Overall, it was a memorable experience that taught me the importance of facing my fears with the support of loved ones."
900	18832	7	3	Yes, I have been patient before. I was sitting in a warm and cozy seat at the orthodontist's office, waiting for my name to be called. My mom was next to me, flipping through a magazine. I wondered what they would do that day - maybe remove my expander or adjust my top braces. I watched the office staff working diligently, and the sound of metal tools echoed from the back room. Finally, a girl emerged and called my name. I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness but was proud of myself for waiting patiently.
901	18833	7	3	"ëPatienceí was crucial as we made our way to the big city for a special baseball game. Can you guess which game it was? It was the ìDetroit Tigersî playing at the @CAPS3 Stadium. We were filled with excitement as it was our first time visiting @LOCATION1. ""How much longer until we get there?"" I asked eagerly. ""About an hour, why?"" my mom replied. ""Because it's so boring sitting here for four hours straight,"" I whined. ""I know, but you have to be patient,"" she reminded me. I pondered how long I could actually be patient for and before I knew it, I had dozed off for a couple of hours. When I woke up, we were stuck in traffic. ""Are we there yet?"" I asked. ""Not yet,"" my dad responded. So, I sat there waiting patiently. After a while, I requested to turn on the radio. ""Fine,"" my mom agreed. Eventually, we started moving again, and I began thinking about all the exciting things I would do at the game. As we finally arrived, I couldn't contain my excitement. ""We're here!"" I exclaimed. Walking to the ticket booth, I reflected that all it took was patience to reach our destination."
902	18834	7	3	Two weeks ago, my family and I visited Six Flags for Fright Fest. Anticipating long lines, which I have little patience for, we decided to start with City at Six Flags. Surprisingly, the wait was only ten minutes. We then headed to Superman, where the line was a bit longer. My sister and I were granted permission to go on the Riddler while the rest of the family waited for Superman. The Riddler, a wooden rollercoaster known for going off the track frequently, had a wait of only a few minutes between each ride. As we inched closer to our turn, I couldn't help but notice the frequent flow of people with flash passes bypassing the line. Finally reaching the front, my patience was wearing thin. The rollercoaster, spanning a mile, took us on a thrilling journey off the track. It was a test of patience, but in the end, the experience was worth the wait.
903	18835	7	3	One day, last year I had to be really patient my mom had told the family that we would be going to six flags soon. I was filled with excitement and I couldnít wait so I asked her when and she said she didnít know yet. This made me upset because last time she said that about going somewhere, we ended up not going. The only thing that I knew for sure was that it had to be on a @DATE1 because she works during the week I was just happy that school was finally out so I didnít have to worry about home-work. So I waited until @DATE2 and then asked my mom if we could go that @DATE1. She said no because we would have to plan it more and that we couldnít randomly go one @DATE1. That @DATE1 I bugged her every day until she finally started planning it. The first thing she did was look at her work schedule to make sure. She didnít have any meetings or projects for the coming @DATE1. My stomach dropped when she told me that she had stuff to do so she kept looking at her schedule. The next free @DATE1 she had was two weeks away. I was okay with it though because thatís better than nothing .Throughout the next two weeks I saved money up for six flags. When the two weeks were finally over I had about @MONEY1 saved up and I was practically bouncing off the walls because I was so excited. I think that was the most patient I have ever been.  In the end, my patience paid off as we finally made it to six flags. The anticipation and excitement I felt as we walked through the gates made the wait all worth it. It taught me the value of patience and how good things come to those who wait. I had an amazing time at the park, enjoying all the rides and attractions, and creating unforgettable memories with my family. Patience truly is a virtue, and I was grateful for the experience of waiting for something so special.
904	18836	7	3	Patience is waiting without complaining to do something you want to do. When I was at an outdoor mail with my mom, two older sisters, younger brother, niece, and dog, I waited patiently to go to the @ORGANIZATION1 store to try out the iPad. When I did, I realized that the iPad is awesome! After ward, we went to get ice cream. My little brother got a root beer flavored slushie, my niece, dog, and I got vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream I put the container on the ground and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We had spent @NUM1 hours there! What a surprise! Then we went home! It was a fun and satisfying day filled with new experiences and delicious treats.
905	18837	7	3	One time when @PERSON1 was patient was when @CAPS1 & I taught him how to pitch. @PERSON1 easily developed a nice windup and delivery but the arm angle was off. But this didnít stop him. @CAPS1 asked him if he wanted to stop but @PERSON1 said ìno!î As time went on, @PERSON1 started to get better and better. He now enjoys throwing @NUM1 mph fastball at a catcher. On days that he's inaccurate, he doesn't give up; he keeps trying and doesn't whine. @PERSON1 is now the number two starter in the rotation. Thanks to some patience, he has improved significantly and become a valuable asset to the team.
906	18839	7	3	"""@CAPS1 be @CAPS3! It will be here soon donít worry,"" @CAPS2 said. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. Well over these few days (which feels like eons) I have not been this so-called ""patient"" person. Halloween was coming in a few days, and my costume still didnít come in the mail. Iíve been waiting and waiting, but it's just too long! For the fifth time, I watch the little red hand on the clock go around. They said it would come @DATE1, but it didnít. ""Iíve been sitting here since ten oíclock, where is the @CAPS4 package!"" I scream. Then I glance at the clock @NUM1. What! It feels like an hour! How can someone bear to wait this long! ""@CAPS5 coming,"" I say to myself. A few hours later, I see a little white @CAPS6-@CAPS7 truck wander along the street. (@CAPS8 thatís it!) @CAPS9 to gaze. Nope, it keeps going past. I sigh then drag myself down the steps. ""Patience!"" I sob in agony, ""why does this feeling consume me like this?"" I stroll to the kitchen, and a brown box is on the counter. I get giddy as I take giant sneaky steps to it. ""@CAPS5 here! @CAPS5 here!"" I yelp as I hop up and down. Finally! The anticipation and frustration melt away as I open the long-awaited package, and a sense of relief and excitement fills me."
907	18840	7	3	One of the many times I was patient was when my family, my friends, and I went to a restaurant. We ordered our food and found a table. We were sitting there waiting for the food. I asked my friend how much longer it was going to take, and they replied that I needed to be patient and wait. After a little while, our food was ready. It was totally worth the wait. The delicious meal made the patience worthwhile.
908	18841	7	3	About three or four times I was patience; it was when I was five and it was my birthday and my grandmother when shopping for me I had to be patience and wait for her to come back with my presents. The other time was when I was @NUM1 and it was @CAPS1 day and I was up super early and ready to be to patience, once again and wait for my dad to wake up so I can open my presents. Then the other time was when my friend had to do something so I had to be patience again so I waited till he got back. This will conclude my being patience paper.
909	18842	7	3	"The time I was patient was when @CAPS4 went to @LOCATION1 ""mom!"" I exclaimed. ""@CAPS1's go I want to leave I'm packed and ready to go."" @CAPS2 mom and I were in the house packing everyone's things. It was a beautiful @DATE1 in @LOCATION2, and it was also @CAPS2 step dad's birthday. ""@CAPS3 you need to be patient okay, @CAPS4 have a long drive, do you have everything you need."" @CAPS5 got me there. I had to get coloring materials, the portable @CAPS6 player, etc. I had @CAPS7 @CAPS8 what else @CAPS4 needed until @CAPS2 stomach growled, sounding like a bear protecting its cubs, fierce and starving. Then I remembered, ding, I thought in @CAPS2 head, food - that's what I need to get. So I rushed into the kitchen like a race car trying to win a race. I packed turkey sandwiches, pb&j sandwiches, chips - salt and vinegar, sour cream and onion, and jalapeno cheddar - now I have everything I thought, ""off @CAPS4 go."" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 mom, and again I rushed out the door ""got the address,"" asked @CAPS2 father. "" @CAPS10 @CAPS3 I got it."" @CAPS11 when @CAPS4 started to go @CAPS2 sister fell asleep. @CAPS5 slept like a rock the whole way there, although rocks don't snore. After @NUM1 hours of being awake in the car, I thought maybe I should try to sleep, but the excitement was rushing so fast I could feel it, then I fell asleep. Finally, @CAPS2 stepfather yelled ""wake up!!"" I was so tired when I woke up, ""are @CAPS4 there yet,"" the first thing that came out of @CAPS2 mouth ""yeah,"" and, of course, the first thing I did was jump up and out of the car! ""@CAPS12!"" @CAPS2 mother shouted. I paused as if I was a character in a video game and the player pressed pause. ""@CAPS13 take in some of the bags."" ""@CAPS14"" I said with a scowl on @CAPS2 face. ""@CAPS15 you have to be patient"" as I took in the bag there it was - the condo of @CAPS2 dreams, and the first thing I did was sleep."
910	18843	7	3	"Being patient isn't always that easy, in fact, last year was one year where I had to sit in a car with three rude, screaming, and crying kids for four hours. Last year I was so excited to see my great-grandpa in ??? with my grandpa. My grandpa is fun to talk to, but later than I found out my two younger cousins were coming. This was going to be a long car ride. We packed our things in the car. I brought my iPod and a book, but my cousins brought loud, noisy, and flashy toys they bought just for the ride. As we started heading for the location, I turned my iPod on and found out it only had 10% battery left. Halfway there, I was almost dead bored, but the kids were just settling down. When I was sure they were asleep, I decided to join them. WACK! I awoke to a slobbery slap to the face, ""we're here,"" my cousin exclaimed. Finally, I said to myself as I was still waking up with a sore and stiff neck. After we were done visiting my grandpa, it was about four hours, and my cousins were all asleep again, and I knew it was going to be a nice ride home."
911	18844	7	3	There was a day when I was patient and I was so nice and this girl was so annoying. She kept pushing me and hitting me, getting on my nerves. I decided to let her go ahead of me in line, but when we were in class, she continued to bother me. I raised my hand to speak, but she told me to be patient. I responded by telling her to shut up, but she didn't listen. When I raised my hand again, the teacher called on me and the girl got mad.
912	18845	7	3	I am going to write about the time that I was patient. One day, after my family and I came back from church, I asked my mom if she could make breakfast, but she would not answer me because she was on the phone with my grandma, who talks a lot. It was so frustrating. I kept pacing back and forth, but then I decided to just sit down. After an hour of patience, my mom and grandma finally said goodbye and hung up the phone, and I was able to enjoy my breakfast. It taught me the importance of being patient and waiting for the right moment, even when things are not going as quickly as I would like.
913	18847	7	3	"One some day, it was about six flags. My mom woke me, my brother, and dad to get ready I donít know what we was getting ready far, but we get on the road as soon as we cloud. I fell back to sleep in the car when we were on the height. I woke up from a big halt on the breaks and when I looked up, we were in a long line of cars, ""Where are we?"" I ask. ""Six flags,"" replied my brother. I could hear impatient people all around me. They were thinking, screaming, and yelling while people tried to pay their way into the park. It seemed like we were moving faster than most of the fast people, and we were one of the first people to get in. That was the most impatient group of people Iíd ever seen."
914	18848	7	3	"I couldn't stand her crying! I just wanted to get out of the car and walk home. There were six of us in a suburban that were all smushed together! We couldn't even move our arms; I felt like I was locked in jail with chains on me. It was three o'clock in the morning, and I saw a big sign that read ""Welcome to Miami."" At that point, we only had an hour or so left, and I was so excited. We finally made it to our destination, Key West. It was the longest trip of my life! But I tried my hardest to stay patient and wait. However, in the long run, I realized I didn't care, and I had a whole weekend of waves and a temperature of 90 degrees. When I thought about how long it took to get here, I didn't even want to think about how long it is going to take to get home! But now I know I have the patience to go home."
915	18849	7	3	A time when I was patient was just yesterday. I had just finished part of the test and I was very anxious and I wanted to get up and move around, but we were taking the SAT so I could not. Instead, I entertained myself in any way I could, such as pretending to sing, writing songs in my head repeatedly, or even twiddling my thumbs. Finally, the proctor let us take a break and talk. I was sitting next to some of my friends, so I started talking to them. Somehow, we got into a discussion about Dungeons and Dragons, and they kept asking me what class they would be and what they were. I kept trying to talk but kept getting interrupted, so I just relaxed and waited for my turn. Finally, it was my turn to talk, but we had to go to lunch, so I never did get to say what class I thought I was. This experience taught me the value of patience and how it can lead to better communication and understanding in the end.
916	18851	7	3	I have and I'm going to tell you about the time I was patient. One time I was on my way to a location, the plane ride wasn't as bad as what I'm going to tell you. When I got to the border, it was hot!!! I had to wait in a small room with about several people, and they had no A.C. We were all waiting for the bus to come, and after a few hours, a bus arrived. I was getting on when some people came barging in front, causing me to miss that bus. Then I waited again for a bus and after a couple of hours, a bus arrived again, but I got pushed out of the way once more. I missed that bus and I was frustrated. Another thing that frustrated me was the thousands of flies all over the place. I waited some more and after a few more hours, a bus arrived but my little brother was in the bathroom, causing me to miss that bus. My mom was telling me to calm down and be patient, and I stayed patient until the ninth bus came. I got on, but the bus didn't go where I was supposed to. I had to go back to the same place, but my mom told me to stay patient. An officer saw how long we were waiting and once the next bus arrived after several hours, he let me and my family get on first and told the driver to take us by ourselves. We had the bus to ourselves, and it was all worth it.
917	18852	7	3	There was a time when I had to wait on handling my personal have it. My sisters and I came into the house and one of them went to handle their personal have it while I was being patient not to knock hard on the door. Telling her (@ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS1) to be considerate in whatever they were doing. By the way, @ORGANIZATION1 is @NUM1 years old and @CAPS1 is @NUM2 years old. I waited and waited, being very patient, not wanting to rush them. Eventually, I realized I really had to handle my personal have it. It felt good to show patience, rather than impatience, as people may perceive rushing to be rude. People tend to talk about such incidents negatively, so it's better to be patient. This was a reminder that sometimes we need to be patient with others and not rush them.
918	18853	7	3	Patience may seem easy at first, but in reality, it can be quite challenging. Whether it's waiting in line, waiting for results, or any other situation that requires patience, it can test our resolve. Everyone, regardless of age, possesses patience to some degree. I remember a time in my life when patience played a crucial role - when I was in first grade. Each day felt like a mix of dream and nightmare, filled with anticipation for something that could change my life forever. That moment eventually arrived after three years of waiting, when my family and I traveled to China to adopt a little sister. The journey was filled with uncertainty and excitement. When the day finally came, and we met her for the first time, she was overwhelmed and lashed out in fear. It was a challenging start, but with patience and understanding, she gradually opened up and became a cherished part of our family. Patience, as I learned through this experience, is essential in navigating life's ups and downs. It is a virtue that we all possess, but it is up to us to choose to embrace it in our everyday lives.
919	18854	7	3	"A person I know that is patient is my dad. He is very patient. One time, we were in the drive-thru at McDonald's, and as soon as we pulled up, the lady said, ""Just one second,"" but she took a long time. I was getting frustrated and wanted to go inside to order, but my dad just sat there calmly, adjusting his seat. After a few minutes, the lady finally came back, and I was able to get my food. As we drove away, my dad said, ""See, that's why patience is a virtue."" He then handed me my double cheeseburger, large iced tea, and chocolate chip cookies. My dad's lesson taught me that patience can lead to a better outcome, even in frustrating situations."
920	18855	7	3	The time I had to be patient was when I had to wait in line to ride shoot the @CAPS1 at @CAPS2 point. Frist @CAPS2 point was fun but waiting in line took patients we had to wait in line for about a half hour. Some people kept leaving because it was to long of a wait. I had to stay patient if i wanted to ride the ride. Second, I was exited to ride the rollar coster so I stayed in line. Staying patient was a little hard when people were pushing and cutting but it was worth it when i got to ride. As you can see sometimes its good to stay patient but when you get to do something fun its worth it. When people push you just had to stay calm and be patient.
921	18856	7	3	Iím always patient when it comes to waiting for my birthday because that's when I receive presents. I wait eagerly for a whole year for this special day to arrive. However, when my birthday is just a month away, I find it hard to contain my excitement as the anticipation builds up. This year, I am particularly looking forward to my birthday because I already know what presents I will be receiving. This knowledge makes the wait even more challenging, but it also adds to the thrill of the upcoming celebration. While I may not be patient in many other situations, I am willing to wait patiently for my birthday and the gifts that come with it.
922	18857	7	3	Patience is a virtue that many struggle to possess. Some individuals seem naturally gifted with this trait, able to wait calmly even in the face of anticipation. In a scenario where impatience threatened to take over, the narrator found themselves struggling to endure the wait for a highly anticipated book release. The journey to the bookstore was filled with obstacles that tested their patience, from slow traffic lights to leisurely drivers. Despite the initial frustration, the narrator eventually found solace in the countdown to midnight, realizing that the wait was not as unbearable as initially perceived. As they settled into the moment and embraced patience, the reward of finally obtaining the book became even sweeter. Through this experience, the narrator learned the value of patience and how it can lead to a more peaceful and fulfilling outcome. Embracing patience not only made the wait more manageable but also enhanced the overall enjoyment of the awaited moment.
923	18858	7	3	One time I was patient because the teacher had to tell me something. So I waited by the door, but then she had to go to the office, so I had to wait. When the teacher came back, she thanked me for being patient. Patience really means being able to wait. Some kids don't show patience; they get upset easily. For example, there were a few kids in one group we were playing a game with, and they would get upset because they weren't called on. The game was random, where you pick a stick, and whoever's stick it was got the turn. Being patient means being able to wait calmly, even when things don't go your way.
924	18859	7	3	Patience is crucial in life as it involves waiting for something or someone. While it may be challenging at times, having patience is essential for achieving goals and dealing with various situations. Without patience, it is easy to become frustrated and give up on things that require time and effort. Therefore, cultivating patience is necessary for success and personal growth. It is a virtue that can lead to better outcomes and a more peaceful state of mind. In a fast-paced world, practicing patience can help in making better decisions and handling challenging circumstances with grace. So, it is important to remember the value of patience and incorporate it into our daily lives.
925	18860	7	3	ì@CAPS1 go!î, I yelled while running to the entrance of @CAPS2 @CAPS3. ì@CAPS4 a minute, you got to @CAPS4 for your friendî, my mom said. As I stopped to @CAPS4 for my mom, my best friend @PERSON1 and @CAPS5 brother @PERSON2 I started to kick the rocks to keep me occupied. Once they finally caught up to me, we walked into the huge theme park. ì@CAPS1 go to the top @CAPS7 @CAPS8î, I said histaticly. ì@CAPS9, we can go on it, but me and @PERSON1 are staying in the backî, my mom said. ì@CAPS10 because me and @PERSON3 are going in the front row!î, @PERSON2 yelled.

It wasnít that much longer that we finally got to the rollercoaster ride. ì@CAPS11!î, the belt bucble sounded when we all got in the rollercoaster. ì@CAPS12!î, everybody said when we took off.  After that I told myself I can be patient. The thrill of the rollercoaster and the excitement of sharing the experience with my friends made the wait worthwhile.
926	18861	7	3	@PERSON2 and I went to the store. @CAPS1 was picking up some marshmallows and chocolate to make s'mores. @CAPS1 was walking down aisle six when @CAPS1 came upon a huge crowd of people shopping for supplies. So @PERSON2 and I got in line. @CAPS1 waited for at least fifty minutes to get marshmallows and chocolate, but ended up coming out with two packs of marshmallows and two packs of chocolate. I asked her why she had two, and @CAPS1 explained that they were giving away extra packs since she had waited so long. We thanked them and headed back to the car. When we told @CAPS2, our other sister @PERSON1, about it, she chuckled. Back in @PERSON2's car, we put the bags in the trunk where the other groceries were and drove home. Once we got home, @PERSON1 ate three s'mores, I had two, and @PERSON2 devoured five, much to our amusement. It was a fun and delicious end to our shopping trip. Thank you.
927	18862	7	3	@CAPS1 is truly a gem when it comes to patience. She never seems to be in a rush and is always willing to wait for others. Her calm demeanor and ability to wait without getting frustrated make her a pleasure to be around. Whether it's waiting in line for food or patiently listening to a friend talk, @CAPS1 handles every situation with grace and poise. Her patience is truly a rare quality that not many possess, and it makes her a valuable friend to have. I am grateful for @CAPS1's patience and the positive impact it has on those around her.
928	18863	7	3	Patience is essential in dealing with various situations, especially when it comes to handling children. I remember a time when I had to exercise patience with a six-year-old girl I was babysitting. After accidentally kicking a shoe into the wall during a game, I was at risk of being exposed by this young witness. She threatened to tell my mom about the incident unless I bought her ice cream. Despite the pressure, I remained patient and refused to give in to her demands. In the end, my mom was informed, but she took it lightly, showing that patience and handling situations calmly can lead to positive outcomes. It was a valuable lesson in tolerance and understanding, even in challenging circumstances.
929	18864	7	3	"Applause filled the building after the first dance ended. I was backstage with my dance team going over the routine for the third time. Backstage was cold and crowded, and I was already sweaty after one practice! This was my first dance recital, and I thought the whole thing would take an hour, but I was wrong. I soon found out that we were the last to perform, and it was at least five hours long. ""How many more dances?"" and ""What dance are we on?"" were what everyone had on their minds or was saying. Every hour felt like a day! I had so many emotions going on - excited, bored, and nervous. Then finally, it was our turn to get on stage. I was so relieved after all that waiting that it was finally our turn! I did twirls, jumps, and leaps and had a great time! I had an amazing time dancing. Great things take patience!"
930	18865	7	3	One boring old rainy afternoon I asked my mom to take me to a place called modern, if you donít know what that is Iíll tell you. Well modern is a place I love it. It has everything I love, a spote park mony and tree stuff. I went there with my mom I told her she doesnít have to stay but she insisted she stayed. So she stared well I skated for @NUM1 hour, and watched me cheered me and even got me a new board. My mom is the most patient person I have ever met.  My mom's presence and support made my time at the skate park even more enjoyable. Despite the rainy weather, she stayed by my side, encouraging me as I skated and even surprising me with a new board. Her patience and unwavering support are qualities that I truly cherish.
931	18868	7	3	Being patient is a great trait to have. When you are patient, you are respected. That's why I have a lot of respect for my teacher, Ms. Smith. She is a very patient person. If you don't understand something, she will work through it with you until you understand, even if it takes a couple of weeks. One time, she was teaching us how to add negative numbers, and I didn't understand. She was very patient with me.   In class that day, when Ms. Smith explained the rules for adding negative numbers, I was already lost. After giving us some sample problems to try, she noticed that I was struggling. She asked me to see her after class, and she patiently sat down with me and explained the steps until I began to pick it up. After some time, I finally understood how to do it.   I thanked Ms. Smith for being so patient with me, and she just smiled. That was a time when she showed great patience, and I am grateful for that. Patience is truly a valuable quality, and I admire Ms. Smith for embodying it so well.
932	18870	7	3	"Whistle, whistle, that was the sound of the soccer refs blowing their whistle for sub`s. I was playing defense, and @CAPS1 was calling my name to take me off. When I got off the field, I got my water bottle and sat on the subed in until finally, I asked my coach if I could go in. His response was, ""You just got off."" In my mind, I was thinking that I had been off for almost ten minutes now, how could I have just come off. So I waited a few more minutes to ask again. When he finally put me in, I realized I was on the side that the ball had barely touched all game. I played for around five minutes, then got subed again. I was on the bench even longer this time. I was losing my patience. I asked my coach if I could go back in, and he said sure. When the game was over, I realized why my coach benched me so much of the game because he likes @LOCATION1 Wolverines, and I was wearing a state tattoo on my face. This is a time I was patient."
933	18871	7	3	This is a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when my mom went to go buy me a new pair of shoes. My mom was buying me some new pair of shoes because I havenít had a new pair of shoes in months. I was very patient that my mom would get me a new pair of shoes. I know when my mom has some money, and I need something new she gets it. I was waiting patiently for my mom. I had confidence that my mom would by me the shoes. Then I heard a knock on the door, I opened the door, and it was my mom standing there with my new pair of shoes.
934	18872	7	3	Real @CAPS3 was known as one of the fastest runners in @LOCATION1, with no one able to catch or beat him in a race. His speed made him incredibly impatient, causing frustration in his interactions with friends and family who struggled to keep up with him. This impatience led him to run away to @LOCATION2, where he expected to find people as fast as he was. However, he soon realized that speed was not everything, as the locals in @LOCATION2 spoke slowly and took their time. Real @CAPS3's outburst at the @CAPS7 made him realize that he needed to be patient and understand that not everyone was as fast as he was. In the end, he learned the valuable lesson that speed is not always the most important trait, and that patience and understanding are equally essential in life.
935	18873	7	3	As we unpacked our gear and set up our campsite, I realized that good things truly do come to those who wait. The scenic beauty of the lake and the peaceful surroundings made me appreciate the value of patience. Throughout the week, as we enjoyed fishing and bonding with nature, I learned that patience not only brings rewards but also allows us to savor the journey. So, the next time I feel restless or eager for something to happen, I will remember the lessons I learned on that fishing trip and embrace patience as a virtue.
936	18874	7	3	@PERSON1 is a young boy with a bladder of a squirrel and his waiting in line for the bathroom at the super @CAPS1. @PERSON1 said to himself, ''patience, something good always comes from being patient''. So he waited for his turn. @PERSON1 was in the middle of the line behind five people. @PERSON1 was a head of six people that were all doing the pee-pee dance. He learned to be polite in school so he let the six people go ahead of him. Ten minutes later, @PERSON1 entered the bathroom and he found a one hundred dollar bill on the floor. @PERSON1 knew more about finders keepers than being polite, so he took it. @PERSON1 learned being polite and patient is the right thing to do, plus it has its rewards sometimes. Overall, it pays to be patient and kind, as good things can come to those who wait and show courtesy to others.
937	18875	7	3	One time I was patient was when me and three other of my friends were hanging out at school one day. We were bored so we all went to the track and we decided to run a mile. Since itís a relay one person goes to run a mile, then the second person goes once the first person I done, after that the third person goes after the second person is done with his mile, then finally after the third person went I got to go run a mile because I was the fastest at running a mile. Since I had to wait until the very end I had to have patience to wait and then finally go.

939	18877	7	3	When I went to the local corn maze for youth group at my church, I took some of my friends along. In the maze, we had to go as a group of six: myself, my dad, my friend, and two others in one group, with another group behind us. Halfway through the maze, there was a guy chasing us with a chainsaw, and in the chaos, my friend accidentally knocked my glasses off my face. We had to stop and search for my glasses before continuing through the maze. Just as we were about to find them, my friends from the group behind us caught up and had to wait for a few minutes, which felt like an eternity. Thankfully, they didn't have to experience the scare of being chased by the chainsaw-wielding guy.
940	18878	7	3	"My story about being patient is the time I had to wait in line for over an hour to get on the ""King of Swing"" which is this really cool ride. First thing I did in line was to try to talk to the people because I knew I would be in line for a while. I said ""hi"" to the couple in front of me and then we talked for a while. It turns out that they had come down south from Miami, which is really close to Orlando where I live. It seemed so weird being in Orlando and meeting people who lived right across our town. Time seemed to fly by because before I knew it, we were getting strapped in our seats and away we go!"
941	18879	7	3	You @MONTH1 have heard before: patience is a virtue. If you donít know already, being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. The opposite of this probably having a temper, or having a @CAPS1 short time before you get @CAPS1 angry. I believe having patience in life is @CAPS1 important, and I try to have patience every day. I believe that life is a marathon, not a sprint, and by this I mean if something takes time, you have lots I related life to sports, because I am a @CAPS1 good athlete. I play football, which also requires lots of patience. When I make a good pass and my reciever drops it, I remember to have patience with him, just as my coach did with me. Football is a team game, and we all have to have patience with each other. Although sports are a great example, patience goes much furthur than that, you must have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether youíre a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong. If you come in late for work, you must brush it off and say to yourself, ì@CAPS2, donít do it again.î @CAPS3 that you forget about everything but what you just said. And once again I go back to sports. If you lose a game, you look at the film, realize what you did wrong, and donít make those mistakes again. Then, you forget about the loss and concitrate on winning next game. I believe patience is one of the most important virtue a person can have. Life requires patience, and by being patient with ourselves and others, we can navigate through challenges and setbacks with grace and resilience. It is through patience that we learn, grow, and ultimately achieve success in all aspects of life.

948	18886	7	3	"Finally, the day had arrived for the opening of the new roller coaster at Michogg's Adventure Park. My excitement knew no bounds as we set off in our cramped minivan towards the park. After a few minutes of driving, my brother couldn't help but ask, ""Are we there yet?"" We finally reached the park and waited in line at the ticket booth for what felt like an eternity.   My siblings were eager to go on the kiddie rides, which added another hour to our wait. But I had my eyes set on the big ride, and after convincing my younger siblings to join me, we braved the long line. It took us two hours to finally board the roller coaster, but the exhilarating experience made it all worth it.   As we got off the ride, my brother exclaimed, ""That was awesome! Can we go on it again?"" I couldn't help but smile, knowing that the wait had been worth it. Looking at the long line of people waiting for their turn, I realized that at least the other rides would now have shorter queues. Despite losing five hours in line, the thrill of the roller coaster ride made it a day to remember."
949	18887	7	3	One beautiful morning @CAPS1 went to renew his license. He woke up early, thinking he would be the only one there, but to his surprise, there was already a line forming. Despite his fatigue, he waited patiently and even enjoyed a hot coffee from the pancake house while waiting. Eventually, after a long wait, @CAPS1 finally obtained his renewed license.
950	18888	7	3	A time I was patient was when my mom was taking me to my friend's house to play football. It all started when my friend called me over to come play football. I asked my mom for a ride, and she agreed. However, during the car ride, my mom had to stop at a grocery store for some things, which took over an hour. Then, she had to go somewhere else, which added another few hours to our trip. Meanwhile, my friend kept calling to ask if I was coming. Despite the delays, I managed to keep my cool and waited patiently. Finally, after what seemed like a long wait, I arrived at my friend's house to play football. That was a time I had to exercise patience and wait for things to fall into place.
951	18889	7	3	"I was on the third day of volleyball tryouts, confident that I would make the A team. Despite a shaky start with my serve, I pushed through and gave it my all. As the coaches deliberated, I anxiously awaited their decision. When they finally handed me an envelope, my heart raced with anticipation. Opening it slowly, I saw the word ""congratulations"" and felt a wave of relief wash over me. I had made the B team, and I chose to focus on the joy of achieving that rather than any disappointment. I celebrated with my teammates, grateful for the experience and the chance to prove myself. In the end, I realized that the journey was just as important as the destination, and I wouldn't have had it any other way."
952	18890	7	3	"@CAPS7 where is my dad? He didn't come home yet, right?   ""@PERSON1, sweetheart,"" @CAPS2 @CAPS7 began, ""Your father was called out into war.""  ""@CAPS1,"" I ran up to @CAPS2 room, pacing back and forth, saying, ""He could have said goodbye. I haven't seen him in two weeks, and now he's gone.""  @CAPS2 @CAPS7 walked in, "" @PERSON1, I know this is hard for you, but you can send him letters.""  ""I know. I was going to start one now,"" I said as she walked out. I wrote a letter saying, ""Dad, you could have said goodbye, but you left. Well, I will wait."" Days passed with no sign of a letter from him. Every day I came home from school, I asked @CAPS7, ""Any news of dad?""   ""Honey, nothing for you,"" she replied. I started to feel forgotten. ""Why have I not gotten a letter from dad, but everyone else did?"" I asked @CAPS7. ""I don't know,"" she replied.   I sent him a letter every day, but I received no reply. I started to wonder if he hated me, didn't want to talk to me, or had forgotten about me. One day, @CAPS7 yelled, ""@PERSON1, you have mail!"" I ran down the stairs to the kitchen and found a letter with my name on it, but it didn't say who it was from.   ""Who is this from?"" I asked @CAPS7. ""Open it and find out,"" she said. I slowly opened the letter and started reading. ""I have not written to you yet, but maybe this will make up for it. I love you more than anything in the world, daddy,"" it read.   I opened the package and found a picture of us and his ransack with all the letters I had sent him. They were all opened and read. That very night, he called and said, ""I love you no matter what. Keep holding on, I'll see you soon."""
953	18891	7	3	Patient is where you can wait or stay put for someone or something. Some people can be very, very patient. But other people have no patience at all. Like if you're waiting in line at the store and someone has a lot of things and you're in a bit of a rush. Now you could be rude and yell, scream, and all that crazy mess, or you could wait patiently and maybe she will let you cut. That's what patience is to me. It's about remaining calm and understanding in frustrating situations, even when you're in a hurry. Practicing patience can lead to better relationships and a more peaceful mindset. So next time you find yourself in a situation where you need to wait, try to be patient - it can make a world of difference.
954	18892	7	3	Patience is indeed a crucial lifeskill, and I am fortunate to have learned it through my friendship with a neighbor named @LOCATION1, who has a sister with Down syndrome. @LOCATION1's sister may not grasp things quickly, but her unwavering happiness has taught me the value of patience. Interacting with her has honed my patience like never before. Despite the challenges, having @LOCATION1 as a neighbor is a blessing, as she has not only enriched my life but also helped me appreciate the things I often take for granted. In moments of frustration, I remind myself of her resilience and positivity, and I am reminded that not everyone is as fortunate as I am. Through her presence in my life, I have become not only a better friend but also a more patient and understanding individual.
955	18894	7	3	"It was a hot summer day in July, and my family and I decided to spend the day at Six Flags. We had a blast going on all the rides, but our final adventure was the popular roller coaster, the Thunderbolt. As we made our way to the ride, we were excited to see that the line was short. However, our excitement quickly turned to dismay when we realized that the line had unexpectedly grown all the way to the train.  Feeling a bit discouraged, my brother and I suddenly needed to use the restroom. We left our parents to hold our place in line and hurried off to find the nearest facilities. When we returned, we were surprised to see that our parents were even farther back in line than before. My brother couldn't help but exclaim, ""How did we end up so far back?""  As we waited patiently, our parents decided to step out of line briefly to grab a refreshing drink. During their absence, ten families mistakenly joined the line in front of us. Just when we thought our wait would be even longer, the park staff realized the error and directed the families to the correct line, allowing us to move up a few spots.  Despite the unexpected twists and turns, waiting in line for the Thunderbolt turned out to be an exciting and memorable experience. In the end, the thrill of the ride made it all worth it."
956	18895	7	3	Everyone has to have patience. Everyone has patience; it just varies in terms of length. People often say that patience is a virtue. Teachers need a lot of patience, especially if they are teaching first-grade students. As students progress to higher grades, teachers expect older children and young adults to be well-behaved. In contrast, jobs that focus on adults may require less patience. For example, my dad, a lawyer, deals with adults and has a lower threshold for patience compared to my mom. My mom, who grew up with four brothers and being the oldest, still deals with adults but has a higher level of patience. My dad values punctuality and expects people to be on time, down to the minute. On the other hand, my mom is more flexible with time, typically arriving within a ten-minute window of the agreed time. These examples highlight the varying levels of patience that different individuals possess based on their experiences and professions.
957	18896	7	3	Patience was sitting on the couch with her mom and sister, getting ready to go grocery shopping and then school clothes shopping. Her sister was reluctant to go but was persuaded by their mom. At the store, her sister was unhappy with the food choices, displaying her usual self-centered behavior. When they arrived at the school clothing store, her sister couldn't find anything she liked and threw a tantrum. Despite this, their mom remained patient and understanding. Eventually, they left with only Patience's purchases, leaving her sister behind in her frustration.
958	18897	7	3	It was @DATE1 and @PERSON4 was in class, fidgeting at his desk as usual. Known for his impatience, @PERSON4 eagerly raised his hand when the teacher posed a question to the class. Despite his eagerness, he waited patiently as other students also offered their answers. Finally, when it was his turn, @PERSON4 gave his response, only to find that someone else had already said it. Though disappointed, he was content knowing he had practiced patience.
959	18898	7	3	Bang! I had just shot myself in the foot with a gun. It all happened when my sister got a gun for his birthday. I went up to a target and got ready to shoot, that was when I got shot. I went to my mom and told her what happened. The next day we went to the doctor's office to have a look at my foot. The doctor had about three or four patients there not including me. My mom said it could take a while. I am a person with barely any patience at all. We waited, and waited, and waited for an hour. Today wasn't my lucky day. She called out a person's name but it wasn't mine. We waited for a total of three hours and then the doctor finally called my name. After the bullet got removed I went home to sleep. That was a time when I had to be patient.
960	18899	7	3	Patience is truly a virtue, as demonstrated in a personal anecdote I experienced. Two weeks prior to my birthday, I requested a male scooter as a gift. Unfortunately, I was told that I was too young to have one, which left me feeling disappointed and frustrated. However, instead of giving up, I decided to be patient and wait for the outcome. As days passed, I resisted the temptation to ask again and patiently waited for my birthday to arrive. Finally, on the day of my birthday, my patience paid off, and I was surprised with the male scooter that I had wished for. This experience taught me the valuable lesson that patience can lead to great rewards. It is important to trust the process and have faith that things will fall into place at the right time. In the end, being patient not only brought me joy but also reinforced the belief that good things come to those who wait.
961	18900	7	3	A time I was patient was when my grandparent and I were driving to Florida. It took about one and a half days to arrive. Then it took us six hours to get to our final destination. My uncle, his wife, and his four boys also joined us on this trip. They had rented a house for us to stay in together. On the day after we arrived, we went to visit my grandpa's sister. It took us about an hour and thirty minutes because we got lost along the way. The last time we visited Florida was for my cousin's sister's wedding. I couldn't wait to see them all. The wedding was beautiful, even though I didn't fully understand it. So I patiently waited for the ceremony to be over. After the wedding, we returned to my aunt's house. The next day, we went to a flea market, which was enormous. It took us an hour to explore the entire place. Although I wanted to leave at a certain time, I patiently waited to buy something for my parents. On our way back home, we arrived around 1 in the morning. I was exhausted but grateful for the experiences I had during the trip. Throughout the journey, I practiced patience, making the most of every moment with my family.
962	18901	7	3	Being patient is a crucial skill that we all need in our lives. Without patience, things can become chaotic and stressful. I remember a time when I had to wait in a long line at an amusement park. Despite the wait being over an hour, I decided to stay in line for a haunted house ride that I really wanted to experience. As the line slowly moved forward, I resisted the urge to leave and go on a different ride. Finally, after waiting patiently, it was my turn to ride the haunted house. The feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction I felt by being patient was worth the wait. It was a reminder of the importance of patience in our lives. Patience allows us to navigate through challenges and uncertainties with a calm and composed demeanor. It is a valuable skill that can help us lead a more peaceful and fulfilling life.
963	18902	7	3	One time I was a patient was when I broke my arm. I was playing outside and was climbing a pole when I dropped down and landed on it, causing it to swell up. My doctor was very peaceful and nice throughout the whole process. From the moment I arrived at the clinic to when I left with my arm in a cast, I felt well taken care of and reassured. It was a comforting experience, despite the pain of the injury. I am grateful for the care and attention I received during my time as a patient.
964	18903	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was in line to go see a movie at the theater. The line was incredibly long, and I was tempted to leave, but I didn't want to lose my place. As I waited, the line seemed to stretch on forever, but I remained patient. Finally, when it was my turn to enter, I realized the movie had already ended. I felt frustrated and disappointed, but I went home and decided to get some rest. It was a lesson in patience and perseverance, even when things don't go as planned.
965	18904	7	3	Patience is an essential part of our world, something that everybody needs but not everybody possesses. Without patience, it would be challenging to navigate through the complexities of life. Patience allows time to pass, giving us the opportunity to achieve our goals and fulfill our responsibilities. It is more than just waiting; it is about understanding that everything takes time and rushing through things may not lead to the desired outcome. Whether it's learning a new language or dealing with traffic, patience plays a crucial role in how we approach and handle various situations. Without patience, the world would be a chaotic place, and our ability to live harmoniously would be greatly compromised. Therefore, it is important for mankind to cultivate patience in order to lead a fulfilling and meaningful life.

967	18906	7	3	My neighbor was very patient when he killed that 10-point buck for the first time! He was thrilled and proud that he caught this beautiful white-tail deer. He said he'd never been this proud before. He went out to dinner and I remembered my neighbor's face when he told me; I was so happy for him. If I had the money, I would have got something for the 10-point buck. When I got to see the head, my jaw dropped; it was the most beautiful deer I've ever seen.
968	18907	7	3	@PERSON2 stepped out of his warm house and into the cold, blowing air, making his way to the barn. The unique pitching barn was where @PERSON3, a dedicated softball coach, trained many pitchers and catchers, including the narrator. Inside, the narrator was already warming up, practicing various pitching techniques with @PERSON1, their catcher. When @PERSON3 instructed them to demonstrate a screwball and rise ball, the narrator showcased their skills, receiving praise and guidance from the coach. Despite initial challenges, @PERSON3 remained patient and supportive, offering valuable advice to improve the pitcher's technique. After a productive session, @PERSON3 commended the narrator's progress and scheduled another practice for the following day.

The bond between them extended beyond familial ties, characterized by mutual respect and a passion for softball.
969	18908	7	3	Once when my dad and I were supposed to go to the races, I had to wait until he got off work at 1 o'clock, which was the time the races started. Knowing we would be late because it took an hour to get there, I patiently played with my toys in my room. I was worried we wouldn't make it at all. Eventually, I decided to take a nap.   Later, I felt a tap on my shoulder and saw my dad telling me it was time to go. Excitedly, we arrived at the races only to find out we were an hour early. This allowed me to meet the drivers and even sit in their cars, which was a dream come true for me. The weekend event included a three hundred lap race, followed by a figure eight boat race, and finally, the thrilling school bus derby race.  After the races were over, a little kid made a funny comment about the school buses crashing, adding a touch of humor to the day. Grateful for the experience, I thanked my dad for taking me to the races and making it possible for me to meet the drivers and witness all the exciting races. As we headed home, I reflected on the memorable day and couldn't wait to share my adventures with my friends and family.
970	18909	7	3	When I was going to Paris with my family, I had to be patient. Our flight left at 6:00 am, so we arrived at the airport at 4:00 am. We waited for two hours, but nobody complained because we all had something to keep us occupied. My brother and I played video games, while my mom immersed herself in a novel.  Finally, when we boarded the plane, it took three hours to reach Paris, and surprisingly, no one complained during the flight either. It was a peaceful and enjoyable journey, with everyone content in their own activities. This experience taught me the value of patience and finding ways to keep oneself entertained during long waits.
971	18910	7	3	On a scorching hot summer day, my mother, @CAPS1, and I decided to seek refuge from the heat at a Best Western hotel. With no air conditioning at home, we were feeling like we were melting away. Upon arrival, we were delighted to find a pool at the hotel. Quickly changing into our bathing suits, we made our way to the pool area, claiming a spot and laying down our towels. However, our excitement was short-lived as everyone was asked to clear out for a chemical cleaning session. Frustration and disappointment began to set in as we waited for what seemed like an eternity. Time passed slowly, and boredom started to creep in amongst the pool-goers. Just as our patience was wearing thin, a buzzing noise signaled that food was ready at the snack bar, momentarily lifting our spirits before we were reminded of the pool closure. Eventually, after what felt like an endless wait, we heard the announcement that we could finally re-enter the pool. Without hesitation, I dashed back in and leaped into the cool water, savoring every moment of relief from the heat. While the wait may not have been ideal, the end result was worth it as we enjoyed our time in the refreshing pool. Reflecting on this experience, I realized the importance of staying positive and patient, even in moments of frustration. Next time I find myself in a similar situation, I will strive to maintain a more optimistic attitude, knowing that the wait may lead to a rewarding outcome.
972	18911	7	3	One time I was patient was at my house when it was my turn to play the game. I had to wait a while, so I sat and watched. I am never patient when there's food involved. I don't like to wait for my food; it sucks when I have to wait. I don't know any other time I was patient. I don't like to be patient.
973	18912	7	3	There I was on a cold @DATE1 @TIME1. Still almost pitch black. I was hunting in my blind with my dad so quiet we could hear a pin drop. I had to be very patient cause even the slightest movement could scare a deer away. We were sitting there for almost @NUM1 hours not even making a sound. To me being patient was hard but I did it. I was in the woods being patient and soon enough a deer came by. I had to be patient and wait till his head went down so I could stand up and shoot it. That took about @NUM2 minutes. But it was worth it cause I finally shot the deer and me and my family all got to eat some deer for dinner. The thrill of the hunt and the reward of a successful shot made the long hours of patience all worth it. The memory of that moment will always be cherished as a special bonding experience with my family.
974	18913	7	3	Today I had to administer the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) to a student. The MEAP is a rigorous test that spans several days, covering subjects like writing, reading, and math. It is widely considered one of the toughest challenges in a student's academic career. Despite its difficulty, the MEAP serves as a valuable learning experience that can help prepare students for future academic and professional endeavors.
975	18914	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teachers said that we had to write a story about us being patient. So once upon a time, there was a girl named @PERSON1 who was not patient, so the whole world knew her as the impatient one. @PERSON1 hated that name, so she decided to change it. She went around her street asking everyone if they knew why she was called the impatient one, but no one had an answer. Frustrated, she shouted out loud, demanding an answer. Finally, an old man named @CAPS4 told her that all she needed to do was be patient. Taking his advice, @PERSON1 practiced patience by waiting in line at a store. Her efforts paid off, as everyone praised her for her newfound patience, and she was no longer called the impatient one.
976	18915	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I have, one time me, my mom, my dad, and sister went to @CAPS1. When we got there they gave us a number and told us to wait. I was being patient, sitting there quietly waiting. Then @NUM1 later we got a table. We all sat down and told our waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menuís and found out what we wanted. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said steak and so did my dad, my mum and sister got mini tocos. She said ok, and that our food would be out shortly. Well it turns out she was way off. We were sitting there for @NUM2. My mom wanted to leave but the rest of us said no and waited patiently. Finnaly after @NUM2 @NUM4. Our food came out and were were glad. The only bad part about that was the mini tocos were frozen solid. So we just asked for our bill. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily that wasnít frozen solid. We paid our bill left no tip and left. After that my mom thanked me for being so patient and we never went there again.
977	18916	7	3	Sometimes I find it challenging to be patient, but I know it is essential. Patience is a key trait of a good leader, as it allows you to stay calm and composed in difficult situations. Without patience, you may become frustrated and give up easily. As a leader, it is important to persevere and not give in to obstacles. Embrace patience and strive to be the best version of yourself. Remember, patience is key to success.
978	18917	7	3	Have you ever waited for something that seemed so far away, that seemed to take so long to get there, but in the end, it all paid off? I have, just last week I took the SAT to get into the prestigious UCLA campus, also known as Westwood, on a Saturday. I had to wake up at 6 am, on a sunny morning, to get ready. I had to beat the traffic on the freeway. When I got there, I had to wait in line for 20 minutes to find out what room I would be taking the test in. It took three hours to take the test! With three breaks! However, when I was done and exited my room engulfed in the crowd of about 500 other kids taking the test, I met my mom who gave me encouraging smiles and big hugs. Since my three best friends also took the test, we all got Slurpees afterwards and roamed the campus. It turned out to be a great day!
979	18919	7	3	@CAPS6 was a night full of anticipation for the upcoming celebration of @CAPS1. Unable to contain my excitement, I found it difficult to fall asleep, eagerly awaiting the gifts and festivities that awaited me the next day. The joy and happiness that come with @CAPS1 make it a truly special time of the year, and the act of patiently waiting for something good only adds to the anticipation. While some surprises may be revealed early, I choose to be patient with others, hoping for the same in return. Spending time with loved ones, whether they be pets, friends, or family, during @CAPS6 creates lasting memories and strengthens bonds. It is a time to cherish the moments shared with those closest to us and to appreciate the joy that comes with giving and receiving.
980	18920	7	3	I chose to write a story in my own way about patients. Patients is how long you can stay waiting for something or someone. Like in a restaurant you be patient and wait for your food. In an airplane waiting area you be patient for the plane to land and get ready for departure. Those are the things I know about patience.  Patience is a virtue that many people strive to embody in their daily lives. Whether waiting for a delicious meal at a restaurant or anticipating the arrival of a flight, patience is essential in navigating the various delays and obstacles that may arise. It is through patience that we learn to remain calm and composed, even in the face of uncertainty.  In a world filled with instant gratification and constant distractions, practicing patience can be challenging. However, those who are able to cultivate this quality often find that it brings a sense of inner peace and resilience. By embracing patience, we can learn to appreciate the journey as much as the destination, savoring each moment along the way.  So, the next time you find yourself waiting for something or someone, remember the power of patience. Embrace the opportunity to practice this valuable virtue, and you may find that the rewards far outweigh the wait. After all, good things come to those who wait patiently.
981	18921	7	3	I am currently in the midst of practicing patience as I wait for my upcoming birthday. My cell phone is malfunctioning, and I have expressed to my mother that I am in need of a new one. However, she is not financially capable at the moment, so I must exercise patience and hope for a cool surprise. It can be tough to be patient, especially when faced with the temptation to complain or become frustrated. Patience requires perseverance and a positive attitude, even when faced with challenges. I will continue to practice patience and remain optimistic about the outcome.
982	18922	7	3	I have to be patient all the time when Iím teaching my puppy (@PERSON1) right from wrong. @PERSON1 is a new part of my family and he is still learning. I try to teach him things every day and when I go over it like @NUM1 times, I get kind of mad. Mom tells me that @PERSON1 is just learning and to be patient with him, as it helps train him faster. I have to be patient when teaching @PERSON1 new things, and if Iím patient, he will learn faster. Being patient with @PERSON1 will ultimately lead to a well-trained and well-behaved puppy in the long run.
983	18923	7	3	It was a cold @DATE1 @TIME1 and the @NUM1 and @NUM2 grade football teams were playing at different times one at @NUM3 and one at @NUM4 and of course there were @CAPS1 leaders, and I just happened to be one of them. The game started at about @NUM3 o'clock and we started cheering. After about @NUM3:15 we were getting very cold despite wearing our warm-ups. As halftime approached, it only got colder. We took a break and grabbed some hot chocolate to warm up. Rushing back to our seats, I accidentally spilled my hot chocolate on myself, but I had to maintain a positive attitude as a @CAPS1 leader. We continued cheering, enduring the freezing temperatures even as some leaders decided to remove their warm-ups. Eventually, the @NUM7 game ended, and we all headed home, likely to seek warmth and rest after a chilly but spirited day.
984	18924	7	3	I think patience plays a crucial role in various aspects of life. For instance, patience is essential in the job search process as rushing into things can lead to missed opportunities. Employers appreciate candidates who display patience and perseverance. Furthermore, success often requires a great deal of patience as achieving goals and milestones can take time. Instead of becoming frustrated by delays, it is important to remain patient and continue working towards desired outcomes. Additionally, in matters of financial stability, patience is key. It is important to wait for earned income rather than resorting to impulsive and illegal actions. Overall, practicing patience can lead to better outcomes and a more fulfilling life.
985	18925	7	3	Once I was at an airport in Chicago. We were coming home from Paris. After we got off the plane we had to go to customs. There were only two people working for US citizens. The line was very long. After half an hour we were only half way through the line. There was a lot of waiting and a lot of whining but we finally made it through. Of course they all thanked us for our patience and once the passports were stamped we were on our way to the next flight. As frustrating as the wait was, we were relieved to have cleared customs and could now continue on our journey home.
986	18926	7	3	"Once upon a time, there was a young girl named @CAPS1 who lived with her parents in a small town of @PERSON2. It was almost her twelfth birthday, and she was filled with excitement as twelve was her lucky number since childhood. Her parents planned a surprise birthday celebration for her at Chef @PERSON1's restaurant in town. On the morning of her birthday, @CAPS1 helped her dad make pancakes with fresh strawberries and milked their stubborn cows. Despite her impatience, @CAPS1 practiced patience and waited for her mom to come home from work. When they arrived at the restaurant, the lights were off, and as they turned on, @CAPS1 was greeted by her close family and friends shouting ""surprise."" Overwhelmed with joy, she discovered twelve presents and a dog named Wonder waiting for her. The unexpected gifts taught @CAPS1 the value of patience and how wonderful surprises can come when least expected. And so, with her newfound companion, Wonder, @CAPS1 embraced the magic of patience and the blessings it brings in life."
987	18927	7	3	Being patient is waiting and not getting frustrated. When my family and I went to a state game. My dad was Patient and that is unusual because he is normally impatient. So we were surprised. When we got in the stadium there was a line of people not thinking and someone sat in our seats so we waited for security to tell them to move. It took about a half an hour for them to arrive, and again my dad was patient. When security finally got there, we had to wait for them to check our wristbands. My dad remained patient throughout the ordeal, even when others around us were getting angry. Eventually, we got our seats and enjoyed the game. I was grateful for my dad's patience, as it helped us avoid any further issues and allowed us to have a good time at the game.
988	18928	7	3	When I was at Cedar Point with my friend @PERSON1, I had a lot of patience. It was my first time visiting the amusement park, while it was @PERSON1's @NUM2nd time. Despite the long lines for the rides, I managed to stay patient throughout the day. Even when the lines grew even longer towards the end of the day, I remained calm and composed. It was interesting to see that my friend, who had been to Cedar Point multiple times before, was the one lacking patience this time. Overall, the experience taught me the importance of being patient, especially in situations where waiting is necessary. I hope that more people can learn to cultivate patience in their daily lives.
989	18929	7	3	Do you have patience? Well, if you do, you're like me. But I know a guy that embodies patience – his name is @CAPS1.M. @CAPS1.M holds the secret of patience. What helps him a lot is his ability to not talk much. One time, we were at the store waiting in line for three hours! @CAPS2 didn't seem to mind though; he was just content being there. Another instance was when we were playing outside and he got stung five times by bees, but he didn't complain about how much it hurt. I have some patience, but not as much as @CAPS2. However, @CAPS2 isn't perfect; when he's hungry, he has no patience. The most impressive display of patience by @CAPS2 was when his mom's car broke down in the middle of nowhere, and it was freezing outside. It took nine hours for a tow truck to arrive, but @CAPS2 remained calm throughout the ordeal. Despite his mom's frustration, @CAPS2 stayed composed and showed incredible patience. @CAPS2 truly exemplifies what it means to have patience.
990	18930	7	3	As my mother and I stood in line at the store, we encountered an elderly woman who was struggling to move quickly. Despite knowing she was old, I found it difficult to muster patience. I observed her slow movements and realized that some people naturally have more patience than others.
991	18931	7	3	There is only one time a year I'm patient for something, and that is Christmas. I can never wait for Christmas to come. I get to see my brothers, uncles, aunts, cousins, everybody. It is the best time of the year and it is right next to my birthday. The festive atmosphere, the delicious food, and the joy of spending time with loved ones make Christmas a truly magical and unforgettable time. I eagerly count down the days until Christmas arrives, knowing that it will be a time filled with laughter, love, and cherished memories.
992	18932	7	3	"There was a time I had to go to my doctor for a monthly check-up. When we got to the building, my aunt and I realized that there were more cars there than usual. When we stepped inside, we noticed that a flier said, ""@NUM1 shots @DATE1 through @DATE2."" When we took the elevator up to the fourth floor and stepped into the waiting room, we saw @NUM2 people. Luckily, not all the people were waiting for @PERSON1, but I did have to wait for an hour and forty-five minutes. When I finally got to see my doctor, she gave me my shot and made sure I was okay. After a long day, I went home and took a big nap. It was a tiring experience, but I was glad to have completed my monthly check-up despite the long wait."
993	18933	7	3	One time I had to be patient was when we went on a family trip to @LOCATION1 to see family and friends! We had a long journey ahead of us, starting with a flight that lasted @NUM1 hours. After landing, we had to endure another @NUM1 hours in the air for the next leg of our trip. Driving along Highway One, with the Pacific Ocean on one side and scenic views on the other, we patiently made our way to our destination. Despite the long hours spent traveling, we finally arrived in San @CAPS1, where we took a break before catching our flight back home. The journey back was a challenging one, with a cramped flight to Atlanta lasting @NUM4 Ω hours. Surrounded by noisy college students, it was hard to find comfort and rest. However, I remained patient throughout the journey, knowing that it would eventually come to an end. Despite the discomfort, I was grateful for the time spent with family and friends, making the patience well worth it in the end.
994	18934	7	3	Patience is the ability to control oneself while waiting. It involves maintaining composure and waiting for a desired outcome. For instance, when waiting at the doctor's office for an appointment, one must exercise patience as they wait for their turn, even if it takes a long time. Similarly, when ordering food for delivery, like a pizza that may take around 30 minutes to arrive, patience is required. Patience is a virtue that not everyone possesses, but it is essential in various situations where waiting is necessary.
995	18935	7	3	One day me, my mom, my dad, my sister, my brother went to Fire Mountain. We had to wait for a long time until we finally reached the front of the line and got our seats. As we settled down, we started singing songs to pass the time while waiting for our waiter to arrive. After a while, our waiter finally came over to take our orders, and I couldn't help but urge her to be quicker.  Once our drinks and food arrived, we eagerly dug in and enjoyed our meal together. After finishing our food and drinks, we headed back home, reminiscing about the fun day we had at Fire Mountain. It was a test of patience, but in the end, it was worth the wait.
996	18936	7	3	One time when I was patient, I got rewarded. Just a few weeks ago, my science teacher assigned my class a leaf project. We had to collect leaves to get extra credit. When I started collecting my leaves, I had to press and dry them. To do this, you have to put the leaves in newspaper and then place books on top to absorb the moisture. It's a time-consuming process, as you may need to repeat it multiple times for each leaf. Despite the approaching deadline, I remained patient at my mother's advice to submit the project by the next due date. My patience paid off as I completed the project before the extended deadline and earned extra points. This experience taught me that patience can lead to rewarding outcomes.
997	18937	7	3	My mom and I were on our way back home from Sonco when we encountered a slow-moving train on the tracks. We patiently waited for the train to pass, but after a few minutes, my mom grew restless and suggested turning around. However, we decided to stay put and soon enough, the train had passed, allowing us to continue on our journey home. It was a small inconvenience, but by being patient, we were able to avoid any unnecessary delays. It's a good reminder that sometimes it's worth waiting a little longer for things to work out in the end.
998	18938	7	3	One time I got birthday money I wanted to buy an electric scooter. On the weekends, I always waited for my dad to get home so we could look on the internet. He always got home and we looked, but I never liked any. But one day he did not have to work, so we looked and I found two that I liked. One was a gas scooter and one was an electric scooter. We went to look at the gas scooter, but it was too expensive and had a bunch of issues. So, we called the person with the electric scooter, and we went to see it. I bought it and used my birthday money for it. When I got home, I rode it for three days, but one night it went out of control. We thought it was the fuse, but it turned out to be the controller. We ordered the part from the company, but they sent us the wrong one. After several attempts, we finally got the right controls. Now, I have been waiting for about a year and three months to ride my electric scooter again.
999	18939	7	3	Patience is a virtue that not everyone possesses. While some individuals may struggle to maintain their composure in challenging situations, there are those who exhibit remarkable levels of tolerance and understanding. One such example is the math teacher's assistant in my @NUM1 grade class. Despite facing a group of students who repeatedly asked the same questions, she remained patient and composed throughout the lessons. For students like me who grasped concepts quickly, her ability to cater to the needs of others was truly admirable. Witnessing her unwavering patience left a lasting impact on me, as I realized the importance of tolerance in guiding others towards success. It takes a special kind of person to demonstrate such patience, and I am grateful to have witnessed it firsthand.
1000	18940	7	3	One time I had to wait very patiently. One afternoon my brother went to pick up some car parts. Then it all happened, out of nowhere a car drifts into his lane then collided with him. Since our truck didnít have airbags, it was a bad situation. The other driver was in a van with airbags. About 30 minutes later, my mom got the call about what happened. Then we rushed as fast as we could to the scene of the crash. I had to wait in the car till my dad got back from going to get my brother. I waited patiently and prayed he was alright. Thankfully, my prayers were answered. He just got some bumps and bruises. But the car got towed away. We later went to where the truck was to get our belongings and see the damage. The truck was not nearly as damaged as the other driver's van. We got the truck back a few weeks later. But Iím glad I still have my brother.
1001	18941	7	3	Iím going to tell you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes agoÖ I came into the classroom prepared for anything. I was clearly not, because a four minutes later, I have this thing on front of me. So, I started out by thinking about the time I used patience. This time was good as any. Now donít get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, toÖuh, I think itís to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I donít know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! Itís very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I canít help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a ìsniffî, ìsniffî, ìsniffîÖ ìsniffî, ìsnot. Weíre not aloud to get up, so weíre stuck ìsniffî, ìsniffî, snotî-ing all hour long. When you weíre a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, itís none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, thatís better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares. You probably donít have the patience to read this so let me finish by saying thisÖ writing about patience, but now, Iím done. (yes!) My hand is sore, my mind is tired, and the test is finally over. Patience may be a virtue, but in this moment, I am just grateful for it to be done.
1002	18942	7	3	One time when I had a lot of patience was when I sprained my arm ice skating. I was doing spins and tricks everywhere, and one I did not land. I fell on my back, but the bone I hurt was my arm, my mom was surprised that I could even stand up because of how hard I fell. My arm was hurting so bad from it. So my mom rushed over to help me, and then we had to go home. The next morning it was hurting even more. I had to go to the doctors to get x-rays for it, and they took two weeks to develop. So I was in two weeks of pain. So it turns out that I didn't break my arm, however I was in a lot of pain waiting for the results. It took a lot of patience for me to just wait, and wait, and wait for those x-rays.
1003	18943	7	3	It was a cold fall afternoon. My grandpa and I were out on a hunting trip. We had eaten breakfast at dawn and headed to the ground blind at around 10 AM. The day seemed long as we waited patiently for any sign of deer. Hours passed by, and just when I was starting to lose hope, a massive deer appeared in front of us. It was the biggest deer I had ever seen, standing at around 4 feet tall with an impressive 5-point rack. With precision, I aimed my rifle and shot it in the shoulder. The feeling of excitement and accomplishment rushed through me as I realized my patience had finally paid off. This experience taught me the value of patience and how it can lead to great rewards.
1004	18944	7	3	One time I was patient. I donít want a birthday party. So my mom and dad talked about it. So my mom and I went to @LOCATION1, we got to play almost all the games (didn`t went to play the dum ones) and rode on the go carts twice, then we went and bought a new video games and some new dirt biking gloves. That was a time I was patient so I could do something fun. My mom understood my feelings and we had a great time together, making memories that will last a lifetime. It was a day filled with laughter, excitement, and the joy of simply being together. I learned that sometimes being patient can lead to unexpected and wonderful experiences, like the one I had on my birthday.
1005	18945	7	3	ìPatience is a virtue.î I hear that saying over and over again from my mind. ìpatience is virtue, patience is a virtue.î I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysit my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, does anything you say. Sheís an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3, he has to go by his own agenda. Not that I donít love him, just that I think he has to be one of the hardest little kids to babysit. We started off pretty good that morning. We had a snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, Iíve dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, so I wasn't too worried. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table, and took her diaper off before I realized that I didnít have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those milk pumping bottle things. ì@PERSON4, I need you to go get wipes please. Now.î @PERSON1 was now squirming, and I had to hold on to her if I didnít want poop all over the house. ìI know, but I canítî ìwell why canít you?î ì@CAPS1 I donít want to.î I was starting to lose my temper when I realized the saying ìpatience is a virtue.î I took a deep breath and I realized I was feeling what patience must feel like. ì@PERSON4 Iíll bet you canít go get them as fast as a cheetah!î ì@CAPS2 I can!î ì@CAPS3, prove it.î @CAPS4 he did. And I realized, you will get things done faster if you're patient, and a solution might just come to you.
1006	18946	7	3	I wondered who would win. I just hoped I would. I was nervous. I was also a little bit scared. I didnít know what was going on to happen. I was very patient to hear who won the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 contest. I was waiting for the contest to end. A little bit earlier I played the game. I was currently in first place. I was nervous. I was nervous because if I win I will get two tickets to @LOCATION1ís @CAPS3. I sat quietly in a chair. I tried not to show that I was nervous. All I could do was wait for it to end. Then, my mom said we could wait by riding rides at the fair. First, I went on the tilt I whirl. I was wondering if anybody beat my score during the whole ride. Next, we looked for another ride. I was trying not to think about the contest. Later, we found a ride to go on. When we got of my mom told me that I won. Happily, I walked back to the place to claim my prize. When I was waiting it was scary, but it was worth it. I was nervous the whole time. I tried not to think of it too. I was very anxious I want to do it again some time. I told you when I was patient. When were you?  I was relieved and ecstatic to find out that I had emerged victorious in the contest. The anticipation and anxiety I experienced while waiting for the results made the moment of victory even sweeter. The thrill of winning and the reward of receiving two tickets to @LOCATION1ís @CAPS3 filled me with joy and satisfaction. Despite the nervousness and doubts that plagued me during the wait, the outcome was truly rewarding. It was a memorable experience that I would cherish and hopefully repeat in the future.
1007	18947	7	3	"The thing that frustrates one the most is when people don't ever think about patience. They act the complete opposite. They don't seem to consider others' moods. Right then and there, they say ""Do it now."" Let me tell you about a time when my brother and I were walking to the store with our mom. We needed to pick up something urgently. When we arrived, it was quite a distance to walk. The store wasn't very pleasant; it was messy and there were items scattered around. The walk was affecting us. Only one thing was on my brother's mind, finding that bottle. As we passed the produce section and were close to the cleaning aisle, my brother spotted the bottle he wanted. He rushed to grab it, but I had to remind him to be patient. We needed to get home, and rushing was not the solution. On our walk back, we handed the item to our mom, who calmly asked why we didn't read the label. She then reminded us about the importance of being patient and understanding the situation before acting. It was a valuable lesson learned that day."
1008	18949	7	3	When I was patient. It was this @DATE1 we were going to this place in @LOCATION1. It to took us @NUM1 hours to get there but we said forget it we were in @LOCATION1. But we were not in @LOCATION1. It was @NUM2 minight, we were so sleepy we went to holiday inn and wonce we got to the room we went stright to sleep then that morning we went swimming then we lift and went to @LOCATION1 pack. My two cuzins were gotten on my nervs I was about to kill bouth of them they kept fighting and talking about each outher. Then we finally got there at about @NUM3 pm we had to take a little train to get there. The park was huge. The first ride me and my sister and my lil cuzins was the commet. The we got on the, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 runney foleon, and the @CAPS2 and that was a time which I was patient. The thrill of the rides and the fun moments with family made the challenging journey worth it. The memories created that day will always be cherished, despite the initial frustrations.
1009	18950	7	3	I was over at my friends house one afternoon, when she couldnít find something she needed. So we went over to her sister, but she was on the phone, so we sat there patiently until she was done. We had sat there for about seven minutes and both of us were getting in-patient. We moved to go ask her mom. I guess she was busy, because she told us to sit, be quiet and patient. We sat there again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean in-patient tone. ì@CAPS1ís in the drawer! Now get out of my room,î she yelled. After looking and looking we finally found @CAPS1. She isnít that patient and I learned Iím not patient either. My friend was still patient but her tone wasnít. Thatís the time of when I know someone was patient.
1010	18951	7	3	One day I woke up and looked outside it was snowy +cold. I went to the living room and told my mother that I wasnít feeling well so my mother checked my tempture and said I had a??? .I also had a runny nose so she said I probably had a cold. She had to go to work @DATE1 and she said she would stay from work to stay home with me. So she made my hot chocolate and breakfast every time I need something she just got up and got it for me. Every time I needed something like a drink, food or even another blanket she got up and got it for me. She was patient because every single time I asked for something she got it without complaining she just did what I asked her to do. She even went up town to get me my medication. That is why my mother is the best and patient.
1011	18952	7	3	I had to have patience in the emergency room where we had to wait for hours. The waiting room was incredibly slow, and by the time we arrived, it was packed with patients. It felt like an eternity before we were finally called in. Despite feeling exhausted and tempted to go back to the car to sleep, I maintained my patience. Eventually, we were seen by a doctor, and I realized the importance of having patience in such situations. It allowed me to endure the long wait and ultimately receive the necessary care.
1012	18954	7	3	There was a time when I had to be patient. My family and I were getting two pug puppies from a nice lady who lived thirty minutes away. I was so happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them. We visited the puppies one more time when they were still really young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks because they had to be old enough to go home with new families. These three weeks seemed to go by really slowly, but all of the waiting paid off. Being patient gave me a chance to get ready for the puppies. We bought them beds, toys, crates, and other dog essentials. We wanted to be prepared for our new family members. The day finally came to pick up the puppies. They were so adorable! We brought them home and we let them explore all around our house. They loved it! Our pugs turned out to be great dogs. I am so glad that I had to be patient when waiting for our pugs. I guess good things really do come to those who wait!
1013	18955	7	3	I had patience when my dad passed away because we had to wait for the doctor to update us on his condition. After some time, the doctor informed us that he had suffered a seizure and a stroke. We stayed by his side, using numerous boxes of tissues as we waited for any sign of improvement. The doctor decided to keep him overnight for observation, and the next day, we returned to the hospital. Unfortunately, his condition did not improve, and the difficult decision to remove life support had to be made. Throughout this challenging time, I remained patient as we navigated through the emotions and uncertainties that came with my dad's illness.
1014	18956	7	3	I was a patient in the doctor's office due to a sprained knee and a fresh neck injury that required attention. Despite initially focusing on my knee, I remembered the lump on my neck and decided to bring it up with my doctor for further evaluation. This additional concern prompted me to seek medical guidance to address all aspects of my health and ensure comprehensive care.
1015	18957	7	3	"Sometime it can be hard to be patient, especially when it needs to be something I want or want to do. It was a cool day in Washington D.C. I had just turned 13 and was going to meet president Barack Obama face to face! I won a contest that allowed me to do that. As we arrived at the White House, a man took us inside. He led us to a little room then left. It was around 10 AM then. He said we can't come out because we might distract somebody. So we waited, played hangman and saws other games. Then it was around noon and I was hungry. Around 1:30pm President Obama came in! He said ""would you like something to eat?"" I said ""yes""Öwe went to this fancy restaurant I can't pronounce. He said sorry for having to wait, but I didn't care, it was worth it."
1016	18958	7	3	I show loyalty to a lot of people that I know, and in return, they show me loyalty as well. This mutual loyalty forms a strong bond between us, built on trust and support. Whether it's through small gestures or big actions, we always have each other's backs. This sense of loyalty creates a sense of security and comfort in our relationships, knowing that we can rely on each other no matter what. It's a valuable quality that enhances the quality of our connections and makes our interactions more meaningful. In a world where loyalty is sometimes hard to come by, I am grateful for the loyal individuals in my life who make it a priority to stand by me. The loyalty we share is a testament to the strength of our relationships and the value we place on each other.
1017	18959	7	3	"A time when I was patient is when Iím at gymnastics. When you are trying to learn a new skill patience is the key. For example, when I was learning a new skill on the bars called a cast to handstand, it was difficult. Day after day, I never could do it. I put my personal best every day, but I had to be patient, my coach said. He said, ""When the day comes, youíll do it, but until then, you need to keep trying and do the best you can do."" It could take days, months, or even a year to get this skill, but I just have to wait until the day my body will do the skill, he said. So I waited and waited, tried and tried, but still no result of getting my new skill. Finally, after four months of doing this, I did it. I got up on the bar and did it. All my waiting would be over. That day, my coach told me, ""I told you that you could do it, it just takes time and patience, but today was your day and you did it."" This is a time I had to use patience to get my new skill. I learned that being patient is hard, and all you can do is wait and see what patience will bring you."
1018	18960	7	3	"Book ""And the characters lived happily ever afterÖÖ..for now!"" ended, leaving @LOCATION1 desperate for the next installment. Rushing to the library, she discovered her coveted book was already checked out. After joining the waiting list, she learned patience while eagerly awaiting her turn. Finally, her patience paid off when the book became available on her account, teaching her the value of waiting."
1019	18961	7	3	A time that I was patient was when my family and I were waiting to get @ORGANIZATION1's autograph. We stood in line for hours, my legs cramping and aching, but my excitement overshadowed any discomfort. All I could think about was getting that autograph, and my perseverance paid off in the end.
1020	18962	7	3	One day just before football practice, my lock on my locker got stuck. All of the coaches tried to get it off. All of them except for one, coach @PERSON1. He stayed in the locker room with me trying to get it off. When we realized it wasn't coming off, we had to find the custodian. When we found him, we asked for bolt cutters. We had to walk all the way across the school to get them. Once we had them, we had to walk back to the locker room. When we got there, he tried to cut the lock. He tried for several minutes. They wouldn't work, so we had to walk back across the school to the tool room and get another pair. This one finally cut the lock after a few minutes. I think this took a lot of patience from coach @PERSON1. It was frustrating, but we eventually got the locker open and made it to practice on time.
1021	18963	7	3	In the old testament long ago there was a man named Job who was very rich, very happy, and loyal to God. One day the devil pointed out to God that Job would easily turn away from Him. God denied this, so the devil suggested testing Job by taking away his crops, livestock, and wealth. God agreed, but instructed the devil not to harm Job himself. Despite facing numerous tragedies, Job did not curse God. The devil then made Job horribly sick, but even through his suffering, Job remained faithful. God eventually healed Job, blessed him with a new family and fortune, and Job found happiness once again.
1022	18964	7	3	A long wait, it was. I had moved to Novi when I was only four years old. It was quite a journey from my previous home in Franklin, Michigan. However, as a young girl, I didn't mind the change too much. I quickly settled into life in Novi, making friends and creating new memories. But when I was seven, I found out that we were moving again, this time back to Franklin. It was bittersweet, leaving behind my friends and the familiar surroundings of Novi. Yet, I knew that I would adapt and make new memories in Franklin. And that's exactly what happened. I seamlessly integrated into my new life, forming strong friendships and enjoying every moment. Four years have passed since we moved back to Franklin, and I have kept in touch with my friends from Novi. Now, after years of waiting, I finally have the chance to visit Novi again. I can't contain my excitement to reunite with my old friends and relive the memories we shared. The patience has paid off, and I am grateful for the opportunity to reconnect with my past while cherishing the present.
1023	18965	7	3	When I got bit by a dog, I was in my hometown of Phoenix when it happened. The dog suddenly jumped up and bit me in my face, causing a lot of pain and panic. My dad and his friend quickly sprang into action, placing me in the truck, and rushing me to St. Luke's Hospital, a well-known medical facility in Phoenix. At the hospital, I was immediately admitted and made to sit in a hospital bed for what felt like an eternity, waiting for further instructions.  After several hours of observation, it was decided that I needed to be transferred to a larger hospital in Hurley for surgery. The journey to Hurley was nerve-wracking, but once I arrived, I was relieved to be in the hands of skilled medical professionals. However, even at this new hospital, I had to endure more waiting as I sat in the hospital room, passing the time by watching TV until the surgery could be performed.  Finally, after what seemed like an endless wait, I underwent the necessary surgery to treat the dog bite. It was a long and tedious process, but I knew that it was essential for my recovery. Throughout this entire ordeal, I had to remind myself to be patient, as healing takes time, especially when dealing with such a serious injury. Despite the challenges and the risk of infection, I remained hopeful that I would eventually recover fully and be able to put this frightening experience behind me. Patience truly was a virtue, especially when I was a patient in need of medical attention and care.
1024	18967	7	3	I am patient every Thanksgiving and Christmas. I have to be patient every holiday season. I get so hungry I start to whine and I have to wait. On Thanksgiving, we gather with family and friends and feast on the delicious turkey. I get so excited I just keep sniffing. Then, oh I can now tell you about the dessert I love it but we eat like an hour after so I'm hungry then too. Every Thanksgiving at my house, my mom makes homemade apple pie, and as soon as they walk in I jump up and down. At Christmas, I have to be patient because I always want to see what presents I get. I search eagerly for gifts with my name on them. If I find one that is mine, my parents or grandparents tell me we have to wait to open it. Then, as the day goes on, I have to patiently open my stocking.
1025	18968	7	3	"Today was Christmas Eve and everyone in the household, including young Timmy, was filled with excitement. Timmy couldn't contain his enthusiasm and was bouncing off the walls with anticipation. ""I wonder what Santa will bring us,"" he exclaimed, flipping through a catalog and pointing out all the things he wanted.  His mother gently reminded him that they needed to clean the house and prepare for Christmas Day before Santa would come. Despite his initial protests, Timmy eventually agreed to help out, knowing that being patient and responsible was important.  As the day drew to a close and bedtime approached, Timmy reflected on his actions and was glad he had been patient and helpful. He knew that in just a few hours, he would finally get to see what surprises Santa had in store for him. With a contented smile, he drifted off to sleep, eagerly awaiting the magic of Christmas morning."
1026	18969	7	3	Patience paid off as we finally arrived at Six Flags after a long journey. Despite getting lost on the way, we made the most of our time by playing games and enjoying each other's company. Waiting in line for the Superman ride tested our patience, but the exhilarating experience was worth every moment of anticipation. I learned that being patient and staying positive can lead to great rewards, making the day at Six Flags a memorable and enjoyable one.
1027	18970	7	3	My mom's patience is truly commendable. Whether it's waiting for hours at the beauty shop, dealing with unfinished chores, or handling a heavy workload, she remains calm and composed. Her ability to stay unruffled in challenging situations is truly remarkable. Patience is indeed a virtue, and my mom exemplifies it in every aspect of her life.
1028	18971	7	3	Patience is crucial in various aspects of life, including dealing with teachers at school and understanding their perspectives. It helps maintain a harmonious relationship and prevents conflicts. Patience is also essential in sports, enabling individuals to handle situations, whether favorable or unfavorable, with composure. Developing patience takes time and practice, but it leads to better outcomes in the long run. In school, patience is necessary for learning and interacting with teachers effectively. It is particularly important when dealing with younger children, as it helps manage their behavior and responses. Overall, cultivating patience is valuable in both minor daily tasks and significant challenges, making it a vital quality to possess.
1029	18972	7	3	In my life, there have been many instances where I have demonstrated both patience and impatience. One recent example of my patience was when I asked my mom to drive me to Target so I could buy gum. Despite having to wait for her to finish up a few things before we could leave, I remained patient throughout the process. Even when there was a long line at the checkout, I continued to wait calmly. On the other hand, there was a time when I lost my patience. When I asked my dad to play catch with me and he said I had to wait a while, I became frustrated and started yelling about why I had to wait. However, I quickly realized my mistake, apologized, and we were able to enjoy playing catch together. It's important to remember that patience is a virtue, and it can lead to more positive outcomes in the end.
1030	18973	7	3	Patience is indeed a valuable trait that everyone should possess. I recall a time when my cousin, who was eager to leave a store, had to wait patiently as her mother finished her errands. It is moments like these that teach us the importance of being patient in various situations. Whether it is waiting for a friend to drive you home or waiting for a job offer, patience is key. By remaining patient, we can navigate through life's challenges more effectively. In a world where instant gratification is often sought after, practicing patience can lead to better outcomes in the long run. Remember, good things come to those who wait.
1031	18974	7	3	"@CAPS2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS1, @CAPS2-@CAPS1! The sound rattling through @CAPS11 cars. All I can think about is after @CAPS6 and lunch. I grow more impatient as the clock ticks and @CAPS11 heart throbs. I do not like the meap for that reason. During the reading selection all I think is, "" @CAPS7 has to be the most boring story in history,"" then I turn the page, @CAPS8, @CAPS7 one is, "" @CAPS9 makes me so impatient. All I wanna do is finish the test. Little beams of sweat read @CAPS9 slow but I do not want to be the last to turn @CAPS9 in. In the writing I think, "" @CAPS10 am I going to write about?"" @CAPS11 hand starts to ache, and @CAPS11 head will pound because of everyone's pencil running as if @CAPS9 were in a horror film. @CAPS2-@CAPS1, scribble-scribble, eek-eek, bom, bom, then you have to read over and over, make sure you have a title and read handwriting. The most nerves working of all, is the math segment. There are questions I forgot. All the math teachers seem to cram all of @CAPS9 in @CAPS11 head at once. @CAPS9 is absolutely terrifying. Then while you're testing, there is someone who can sit still and their desk starts rattling. Well, if anyone could not tell, one, I am very impatient and two, I do not like the meap. @CAPS2-@CAPS1 is the most annoying sound. Along with many others, I am trying to get a good score. @CAPS2- @CAPS1, little, beams of sweat, libom bom, eek, eek scribble- scribble. The pressure and anxiety of standardized testing can be overwhelming, with every small detail and sound magnified in the test-taker's mind. It's a challenging experience that can test one's patience and nerves to the limit."
1032	18976	7	3	One time I was patient was when me, my dad, @ORGANIZATION1, and @CAPS1 were going to @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @LOCATION1. Me, @ORGANIZATION1 and my dad wanted to ride the millennium force. So we waiting in line for two hours in the hot sun waiting to ride the ride. Some of the difficulties was the ride was having some problem. So when we finally got to the ride it turned out ok. Despite the long wait and the ride experiencing some technical issues, our patience paid off as we were able to enjoy the thrilling experience of riding the millennium force.
1033	18977	7	3	On @DATE1 I was with my dad at @NUM1 am. I was sitting watching hoping something would come & all of a sudden I grew tired & I fell asleep for an hour. When I woke up I was watching but nothing came for an hour as I was waiting & waiting & waiting. Then from many nights I heard leaves cracking & I thought, is it really true? On my first day, I would shoot one if I saw one. I was a little too excited! I reached to get my gun too quickly & he ran away. On another day we came out, I saw another doe but to my left this time. But I got my gun even slower this time & @CAPS1 I aimed & fired! Well, thatís what I thought, but no, it was jammed and @CAPS1 I had to unload it. Then my dad called me over the walkie-talkie, & asked ìwhat are you doing?î @CAPS1 I said, ìI see a doe,î @CAPS1 he said, ìthen shoot it,î & it stood there @CAPS1 I shot again & then it ran away, ìI missed,î I said all that patience for nothing.
1034	18978	7	3	I walked into the big open room. The smell of crayon, animal crackers and dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and a lot of crayons. The kindergartners are running around screaming like little animals that hear they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like sheís about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag her face lights up a little bit. The teacher introduces herself then says theyíre all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew Iíd do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with 20 kids and a ìwar.î I eventually, with some grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor. Itís too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled,î Jimmy, thatís not nice, please stop.î Jimmy stops for about 2 way too short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild-eyed, crazy-haired dwarfs. It took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about Z when the kids got fussy again. At that point, I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally, I get that light bulb going off in my head feeling. I run to my purse, grab my bag of candy, and say, ìWhen we finish learning the alphabet A-Z, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!î I realized to them thatís like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldnít believe my ears. Every kid learned A-Z, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bickering. When the bell rings, I hastily leave to go home. It took a lot of patience but I did it, and reward myself. I slept!
1035	18979	7	3	A day that I was patient was, one day I was really happy about my birthday coming up. I couldnít wait to see what I was getting. I though about it for about a week begging my mom to tell me what I was getting. The days past and it fell like they got even longer and longer. I tried and tried day and day to try and take a peak at what I was getting, but I always got caught. So finally my mom told me to just stop thinking about it and be patient and it would name faster. So I waited, it seemed like it was taking forever. The next day I woke up my brother came and jumped on me and said ìah-ah I know what you're getting and you donít. ìAnd I jumped up and said what! How come you know and I donít? ìThatís bad tell me please.î And he said no. ìThen I got up and walked out the room and went to my mom and said ìI give up.î She looked and said just be patient and it will go by faster you only have four days left. ìThen I walked away. Then days started to go by faster and then my birthday came up I was so happy to finally see what I was getting. And that was the day I was patient.
1036	18980	7	3	A time when I am patient is when I want something really bad, like a phone or to get on the computer. However, being patient is not only necessary in situations like these. It is also important to be patient in places like church and the doctor's office. There are many ways to practice patience in various aspects of life.
1037	18981	7	3	I was patient when I had to wait in a very long line at Leader Park's amusement park! In California, I had to wait for 3 hours for the ride, The Titan. It went from 0 to 85 miles per hour in just 2.5 seconds! When going up, the coaster went straight up, then stopped at the top (255 feet). We just sat there for about 5 seconds! Then it moved, and we went straight down at 90 miles per hour; it was really cool! It was worth the wait. That was the time I was patient! Waiting in line for hours can be frustrating, but the thrill of the ride always makes it worthwhile.
1038	18982	7	3	It takes a lot of patients especially when you are travelling for long hours straight. When I was younger, we went to a remote location for half a year. My mom, dad, and I left home at the crack of dawn for the airport. After a long wait, we boarded a plane for a short hour-long flight to our first stop. From there, we embarked on a lengthy ten-hour journey to Los Angeles, with layovers in between. The waiting time at the airports tested our patience even more. Following that, we endured another five-hour flight to our next destination, which happened to be the longest flight I had ever experienced. The aircraft was a massive double-deck jet, making the journey quite an adventure. Finally, we took a seven-hour flight to our ultimate destination, Hawk Bay. The entire trip required a great deal of patience, but it was worth it as my dad was building a golf course there. Patience was also crucial for him during the construction process, but it was a rewarding experience for our family. Overall, it was the most patience I had ever needed to have in my life.
1039	18983	7	3	Last year, I went to New York City with my mom, step-dad, three brothers, aunt, uncle, cousin, and her two kids, Sarah and Jack. The first place we visited was the Statue of Liberty. We waited in a long line to board the ferry that would take us to the island where the statue is located. After going through security checks, we finally boarded the ferry. Despite the crowds, the ferry ride was enjoyable, and we were able to sit down during the journey. Once we arrived at the island, we marveled at the sight of Lady Liberty. Unfortunately, we couldn't go inside the statue due to the scorching heat. After exploring the island, we made our way back to the ferry and patiently waited in line to return to the mainland. My mom later thanked me for being so patient throughout the day. Overall, despite the long lines and hot weather, visiting the Statue of Liberty was a memorable experience.

1042	18986	7	3	This story is about when I broke my ankle about four years ago. I was at swim practice, getting ready to dive off of lane three. As I tried to get on the block, I lost my balance and ended up falling into the water, twisting my ankle backwards from the swim block. It was difficult to get out of the water, and my mom had to come to the pool to take me to the doctor. After nearly four days of waiting, I finally got an x-ray and found out that my ankle was broken. I had to spend four weeks not being able to go to swim practice, which left me feeling bored and impatient. It was a challenging time, but I learned the importance of being patient and taking care of myself during the recovery process.
1043	18987	7	3	Ok, it was a time when I was on a bus to go to Texas to see my great grandfather. The bus had a pleasant smell, but there was a lady who kept spraying perfume, so I had to try to sleep and snack on a few snacks. The constant crying of a baby kept waking me up, and every time I needed to use the bathroom, it was occupied. Despite my efforts to rest, the other passengers seemed to get louder as the journey went on.  When it was time to catch some sleep, the bus driver would wake us up to switch to another bus. It felt like I was never going to reach my destination. Patience was essential on this long journey, as it required a lot of waiting and staying calm. After enduring the bus ride for several days, I finally arrived in Texas.  The experience was worth it in the end, as we got to visit Six Flags. Without patience, the long bus journey would have been a dreadful experience.
1044	18988	7	3	One time I showed patience was when I finally purchased a laptop that I had been wanting for a long time. After quickly placing the order online, I anxiously waited for it to arrive. Days passed, and I eagerly anticipated the delivery. Finally, after a week of waiting, I arrived home to find the package waiting for me. Opening it up, I was overjoyed to see my new laptop. My patience had paid off, and I was thrilled to finally have it in my hands.
1045	18989	7	3	"There was this day not too long ago that I had to wait. Nothing but wait. It was at basketball tryouts when we were finding out if we made the team. I had to wait and wonder if I made it. I thought to myself, I wonder if I pushed enough, I wonder if I messed up too much. All I could think about were the mistakes I made, so that day, that I had been sitting down waiting to hear my name. I had my name! ""Number 21, tryouts please come get your paper."" I got it, took it outside, opened it, and read. ""Congratulations, you have made the gold team."" I jumped up and down. That day I had my patience, and there it was. I made the team."
1046	18990	7	3	Two summers ago, I went to New York City and Washington D.C. We had to drive for six hours straight. I mostly just sat in the back seat and listened to my music player. It was a very boring car ride. On the way, I looked for license plates with different states on them. We were halfway there, so we stopped at a Dunkin Donuts. It was early in the morning, my sister and I got donuts and hot chocolate. Then we arrived at a series of booths where we had to show our passports to get in. Finally, we were in New York City. We stayed there for three or four nights. Then we were on the road again for five hours to go to Washington D.C. When we got there, all the patience paid off. And that's a time when I was patient.
1047	18991	7	3	This story is about a time when I was patient. I was about 9 years old. It was a gorgeous day outside. The best part is that it was my birthday. All of a sudden I had a brainstorm. I was going to try and ride my bike with no training wheels. So I ran inside as fast as my little feet would let me go. I went through the front door and I yelled ìMom, Dad, quickly I have something to tell you.î ìWhat is it buddy?î my mom screeched as she ran down the stairs. ìDad is coming.î ìCome on sweety you have to go somewhere with your son wants us to hear it must be important.î ìIt is, it is, it is,î ìCome on mom we can meet him outside.î ìOkay, we will be outside.î ìOk, let's go.î My mom and I ran outside to wait for dad and that was a time that I was patient.
1048	18993	7	3	My mother is always busy, and I often accompany her wherever she goes. One day, we visited a place whose name I can't recall. Despite the waiting, I remained patient, although it was challenging as there wasn't much for me to do. I displayed patience like never before. I tried not to rush her or complain about being hungry or ready to leave. Ultimately, I felt content when we departed, knowing I had shown understanding and support for my busy mother.
1049	18994	7	3	When I was patient I ask my mom to buy me a bike and I had to wait and wait for like two weeks for a bike on my birthday I wanted a fish, and I ask my mom to buy me a fish she didnít say anything so I keep asking and asking and asking so I stoped asking for three days then she got me a fish then it died. Four weeks later then I ask for a turtle and she said yea she will then I waited and waited tell she got me one then I was happy thatís when I was patient.

1050	18995	7	3	One time my sister and my mom were patient when I went to Dick's Sporting Goods and wanted a new bag, Adidas sandals, and crazy socks. It took me hours to pick out socks as there were various designs like zebra, stripes, plain, plaid, and dots. My sister couldn't get anything since she didn't have money. Eventually, I settled on the zebra socks. Next, I had trouble finding the Adidas sandals, but after an hour of searching, I found the last pair in my size, only to have them taken by another customer. My mom was visibly upset. Finally, I managed to grab the last pink bag available and headed home.
1051	18996	7	3	I do not have much patience because this year I am eagerly awaiting a new laptop. Every day, I find myself searching for laptops online, unable to focus on anything else. I constantly talk to my family about it, and the anticipation consumes my thoughts. I have everything prepared for the new laptop, but I must wait for the right time to make the purchase.   This waiting game is not unfamiliar to me, as I experienced a similar situation last year when I received an iPod as a gift for Christmas. Although my family had already purchased it on Black Friday, I had to wait until Christmas Eve to actually get my hands on it. The excitement was overwhelming, and I found myself watching YouTube videos about iPod touches to ease the anticipation.   It can be challenging to practice patience when you have your heart set on something, even if you know it's coming. However, the thrill of finally getting the desired item makes the wait worthwhile. Patience truly is a virtue that teaches us the value of delayed gratification and the joy of anticipation.
1052	18997	7	3	"A time of patience is always necessary, as rushing through life leaves no time for oneself or loved ones. As my mother used to say, ""Slow down, you're not going anywhere,"" reminding me to take things at a steady pace. If you are always in a hurry, you will miss out on important moments and experiences. Learning to be patient is a simple yet essential skill that allows us to fully enjoy life. Take your time, savor each moment, and appreciate the beauty of patience."

Initially hesitant, I eventually agreed to give it a try. After waiting in line for what felt like an eternity, it was finally our turn. As we strapped in and started the ride, I felt a rush of adrenaline like never before. The coaster zoomed at incredible speeds, twisting and turning along the track. To my surprise, I found myself enjoying the exhilarating experience. In the end, I discovered a newfound love for roller coasters and learned the value of patience.
1054	18999	7	3	On a morning when every one of my family members wake up at 6 or 7 o'clock am, my siblings and I asked our mom if we could play the game and use the laptop. She agreed but reminded us to take turns. We agreed and started playing. Each of us had one and a half hours to enjoy the game and the laptop. I patiently waited for my turn, letting my younger siblings go first. I respected the rules and waited until it was finally my chance to play. I made sure to follow the schedule, and even if the day ended or it was time for bed, I knew I could play again the next day. Being patient and respectful towards my family members is important, and I was happy to show those qualities during our time together at home.
1055	19000	7	3	There were many times when I was patient. One particular instance was when I had to wait for a whole month to get a new basketball video game. The anticipation was killing me, but I had no choice but to be patient. However, just a day before the game was set to release, I lost the money I had saved up to buy it. I had to work two jobs for two weeks to make up for the lost money. When I finally had enough to purchase the game, I found out that there were no more copies available. This meant I had to wait another two weeks before I could get my hands on it. It was frustrating, but I knew it would be worth the wait. In the end, my patience paid off, and I finally got the game I had been eagerly waiting for. Patience truly is a virtue.
1056	19001	7	3	At my grandma's house in @LOCATION1, my cousins and I patiently waited for my grandma to return so we could go to the beach. We entertained ourselves by playing video games, which helped pass the time quickly. Despite waiting for several hours, I remained patient and decided to watch a movie to occupy myself. As the movie played, my grandma finally arrived home, and we waited patiently for her to get ready before heading to the beach. This experience taught me the value of patience and how it can lead to enjoyable moments in the end.
1057	19002	7	3	I remember a time when someone I know was patient with me. It was near the beginning of the 4th grade. I had enrolled in band that year, playing the trumpet. We played songs and had tests to ensure we were playing right. But on my tests, my band teacher noticed something funny on my tests. I was playing the wrong notes. He told me I needed a long private lesson if I wanted to play my notes right. So one afternoon after school, I took the lesson. I started by playing my notes for him. He said they were wrong. Then my teacher broke down the notes for us one by one. He told me the correct way to play the notes. He had me play the notes again and again, patiently guiding me. When I messed up, he showed me how to play them correctly, being patient with me. Finally, I was playing every note right. The lesson lasted about 30 minutes, and he was patient throughout the process. Now, I play my notes correctly thanks to the lesson and my teacher's patience. I know that if I need more lessons in the future, I can count on my teacher's patience to help me improve.
1058	19003	7	3	"This year I tried out for the 7th grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After two days of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, B or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against Northern Middle School. As Northern Middle School, we obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For bragging rights, we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didn't play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play two games in a match. The best two out of two wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which meant we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all three! Pretend like it's the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discouraged because I hadn't played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about a point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, ""can you do it?"" I shot right up and subbed in. I went to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! I had made the winning point! In the end, I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point. It really taught me a lesson!"
1059	19004	7	3	The word patience holds various meanings, including waiting and enduring through challenges. It requires time, effort, and a willingness to persevere. Some individuals, like myself, struggle with impatience and a tendency to complain. Teenagers often lack patience, but as one grows older, patience can develop, although some adults still struggle with this virtue. The level of patience a person has can be influenced by their life experiences and how much they actively work on cultivating patience in themselves. Ultimately, patience is a valuable trait that can greatly enhance one's quality of life.
1060	19005	7	3	My mother is the most patient person I know. When she drops me off at practice she waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly, and dance the whole routine. When I go to science programs she waits at least two hours until itís over. Every morning she waits on me to finish getting ready. After school she waits on me to buy something at the table in the lobby. All that she asks is for us to return the favor. She doesnít rush us unless we're late. And she always hugs us before we leave. Additionally, she patiently listens to our stories and problems, offering support and advice without judgement. Her calm demeanor in stressful situations helps us stay grounded and find solutions. Her unwavering patience is a constant source of comfort and strength for our family. We are truly grateful for her endless patience and love.
1061	19006	7	3	Patientce continued throughout the camping trip, even when faced with uncomfortable sleeping arrangements on the ground. Despite the challenges, the experience of seeing a moose for the first time and catching fish made it all worthwhile. On the journey back, patience was again tested, but a stop at a gas station provided the necessary break and refreshments. The trip may have had its ups and downs, but patience ultimately led to memorable moments and a sense of satisfaction.
1062	19007	7	3	@CAPS1's stomach growled as he waited for dinner to be ready. Impatient, he decided to pass the time by playing his favorite video game. The sounds of lasers and explosions filled the room as he navigated his space ship through enemy territory. However, the excitement soon wore off, and he found himself back in the kitchen, hoping that dinner would be ready soon. To his surprise, his mom had finished cooking in record time, and a delicious meal was waiting for him on the table. With a satisfied smile, @CAPS1 dug into his food, grateful for his mother's hard work and patience.
1063	19008	7	3	Patience is when you wait for something without complaining. A time I was patient is when I was 10 years old. It was about noon that day but the winds were picking up just a little. I was being patient so I could go on a ride in Adventureland. It was called Shimbering Timbers. The line was very long. It took me about a half hour to get on the ride. Another ride I waited for was the Dragon's Den. But that one was shorter. It only took about 15 minutes. All these rides required patience because if I didn't show patience, I wouldn't be able to enjoy the thrilling experiences they offered. The last instance was when I was 14. I wanted to ride the Thunder Hawk, and the line took an entire hour. I played my Nintendo while I was waiting to help pass the time and maintain my patience. An hour later, I finally got to ride that exciting attraction, all because of my patience.
1064	19009	7	3	Patient is an essential quality when welcoming a new family member, especially a young sibling like a 9-year-old sister. Adjusting to a new dynamic at home requires extra effort, such as providing additional supplies and accommodating the newcomer's needs. While it may be challenging, the parents exhibit patience and understanding towards their daughter, even when she doesn't follow the household norms. Despite occasional disagreements and differences, the parents remain kind and forgiving, setting a positive example for their children to follow. In such situations, patience plays a crucial role in fostering harmonious relationships within the family.
1065	19010	7	3	I do not have patience, especially when it comes to waiting for results. Whether it's waiting in line at the store or waiting for a response to an important email, my lack of patience can sometimes get the best of me. I find myself constantly checking my phone for updates or tapping my foot impatiently while waiting for something to happen. This lack of patience can be frustrating, but it also motivates me to find ways to improve my ability to wait calmly and trust the process. By practicing mindfulness and reminding myself to stay present in the moment, I can work on building my patience and becoming more at ease with uncertainty. Ultimately, developing patience is a valuable skill that can help me navigate life's challenges with grace and composure.
1066	19011	7	3	This is a story about a time when I had to be patient. This happens every year Iím pretty sure every one knows about it. It is call birthday. Every year I have to wait for @NUM1 days for my birthday to come. It takes a while, but I know I have to be patient. Being patient is hard work but usually pays off. Another way that I have to be patient is waiting for the @CAPS1 tests to get over . But I always remember it has to end sometime. So I have to sit there do the work and be patient. Being patient is a virtue that teaches us to wait for the right moment and trust that things will fall into place when the time is right. It may be challenging at times, but in the end, patience is always rewarded.
1067	19012	7	3	I played soccer for a rec team called the cheetahs, which was in the best division possible. However, my two best friends and I were carrying most of the workload while the rest of the team wasn't contributing much. Feeling the need for a new challenge, I decided to try out for a select team, which was in the second-highest division. The tryouts were nerve-wracking, lasting three days, and the wait for the results felt like an eternity. During this period, I had to exercise patience while eagerly anticipating the phone call that would determine whether I had made the team.
1068	19013	7	3	I think patient is when someone is able to wait and not complain. I was never patient, so here is a story I have made up. One day there was a girl named @CAPS1. She really wanted to go to the park. But she still had to do her homework, chores, take care of her sister, and clean up the rest of the dinner. She was really busy. She started with her homework first because all she had was a math worksheet with 10 problems on each side. Which was easy because they were just addition and subtraction. That took her 20 minutes (10 on each side), which isn't that bad. Next, she did the chores. Her chores were to clean up her room and the living room because her sister's toys were all over the place from before. But luckily her sister was asleep. Now that she's resting and not making a mess, @CAPS2 took @CAPS1 about 15 minutes to clean up all the toys because all she had to do was throw them back into the toy box. Now, we go to her room. A messy room you first couldn't open the door. So she had to tug on the door until she could finally fit herself in. The door slammed shut from all the clothes but luckily didn't wake up her sister. @CAPS1 first made a checklist of what she needed to do - she had to vacuum, fix her bed, and put all the food away that was in her room back in the kitchen. That took about an hour and a half. So in all that's been about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Now all she had to do was clean up the rest of the dinner. Her mom couldn't because she had to drop off her dad at the airport for work, so it was up to @CAPS2. But the bad thing is that they had spaghetti for dinner and her sister spilled the sauce all over the floor so she had to mop. So right away she cleaned the table which took 7 minutes, mopped which took like 4 minutes. When she was finally done, her sister woke up and she had to feed her and then she could just take her with her to the park. She gave her some apples and then when they finally finished, she took her sister with her and they had a great time playing at the park.
1069	19015	7	3	I have had to be patient a few times in my life. Some times we have to be patient at the doctors, waiting for new game and movie releases. but I am going to tell you about a time I had to be patient at an airport. One time I had to be patient at an airport. The problem wasn't waiting for the plane to arrive or the line for our ticket. We had to wait because all the planes were down. We had to sleep there overnight. I was being as patient as I could but my grandma didn't like how we had to wait over an hour just to get into the food court and then another hour just to get our food. It was very crowded and it took all patience to not get angry at all the other people. Some examples of how I was feeling about my patience is picture being at the doctors, long car rides, or maybe even waiting for a test score and there are many other things. Make sure you work on patience and stay calm. Remember that patience is a virtue that can help you navigate through challenging situations with grace and composure.
1070	19017	7	3	I think that my coach is patient because there are many girls she is watching. She has to teach us things that we don't know, like plays and moves such as cross overs. She also helps us improve our speed, being patient with those who may not be as fast as others. Even when handing out jerseys, she remains patient as we all try them on, taking up some of her time. Our coach's patience is evident in the way she guides and supports us, making sure we all understand and improve in our skills.
1071	19018	7	3	We all don't like waiting, but we have to learn to be patient. When I went to @LOCATION1, I had to be patient for a lot of things. I had to be patient when waiting in the airport and using public transportation. Being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. Over my trip, I had to do a lot of waiting in airports while still being patient. Being extra patient was important when waiting for my flight to be called. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel. Another long wait to be patient at airport security. To sum up, you have to be patient in waiting in airports. When I went to @LOCATION1, I had to be patient when using public transportation. When waiting for a train to arrive during rush hour and the train was full, I remained patient. When I was in the taxi and faced traffic, I relaxed and was patient. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transportation. I still don't like waiting in line, but I am patient when I do. I learned patience when waiting and being, but it's something we have to do.
1072	19020	7	3	When me and my dad were inline for the kencer hauck at @LOCATION1 adventures! I had to wait patiently to get on. The line was massive so many people ??? of us and it was shocking that so many ??? ??? in line for this roller coaster we waited for what seemed like hours was only minutes, and as we got closer it was getting hard to be patient. Finally we got on the ride and it was on the ride and it was insane so waiting for those minutes that seemed like hours ??? rewarded with a ??? ??? The adrenaline rush was worth the wait, and the excitement of the roller coaster ride made the patience we had to muster in line completely worthwhile.
1073	19022	7	3	"One time I ate at the fast-food restaurant through the drive-thru. We had already received our food and were waiting to receive our drinks so we could eat. We waited for about ten minutes. Finally, our order arrived, but to our dismay, we had received all the wrong food and no drinks. My mom had to return the incorrect order to the restaurant. After waiting another fifteen minutes, we finally received our correct order. We left the restaurant and finally got to enjoy our meal. My mom praised us for being patient throughout the ordeal, saying, ""@CAPS1 the good thing is you guys were so patient. Thank you guys for being good!"" We even treated ourselves to ice cream after our meal. It was a lesson in patience and perseverance that we will not forget."
1074	19023	7	3	"(waiting) (heart beating) ""Hey, how are your report cards?"" asked Mr. Hemlock. I was the last one in line. ""You go, keep up the good work!"" said my teacher. ""Yes!!"" I exclaimed happily. I ran straight home with my straight A's. ""Mom, look!"" I called out excitedly. I asked my mom if I could order something online for $20 as a reward. ""Why not, for a straight-A student,"" she replied. I placed the order and waited for a week for it to arrive."
1075	19024	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to a skate competition in my town. The registration line was almost by the entrance of the park. I stood there for almost an hour, but when I finally got up to the registration table and paid my fee, it was all worth it because I got to compete against my best friends. The excitement of the competition and the camaraderie with my friends made the wait worth every minute. The patience I had shown paid off in the end, as I had a great time skating and bonding with my friends at the competition.
1076	19025	7	3	A time when I was patient was at the birthday bash of a friend, where I used to live. I was waiting in line, which seemed like a mile long. After waiting for what felt like forever, I realized I had left my ticket in the car. I had to trek all the way back to retrieve it. When I returned, the line had doubled in size. Despite the setback, I waited patiently. Suddenly, it started raining, and I had no umbrella. I continued to wait, hoping the weather would clear up. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, the concert was shut down. I went home that day, soaking wet from head to toe, feeling utterly defeated. It was indeed the worst day of my life.
1077	19026	7	3	Me, I have very little patience. I mean nearly none. When I wait I get this weird feeling, almost like a tooth ache. Weird huh? Well you get the picture, let me tell you a story about when I lost my patience. It was the same day, I was at my hunting safety course put on by the Department of Natural Resources. We had just finished up taking the test that determined success or failure in the course. They came out with the first group of people's names who passed and their certificates. By the way, everyone is outside waiting. The first group was done in about twenty minutes. It took about ten minutes to grade the tests and five to give out the awards. Unfortunately, my group was last. We all sat on a bench for three hours! My patience completely wore off, I just started rocking back and forth. Finally, my group got called up and we got our awards! My patience has thankfully gotten a bit better since then. I did pass the course and am becoming a good hunter. I've shot a partridge and one nine-point buck. That is my story, have a good night!
1078	19027	7	3	I have to be patient when Iím taking the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Iím patient because I have to wait for my classmates to finish their @CAPS1 @CAPS2 .I sometimes have to wait forever .But thatís fine I can just take a nap .I sometimes hate being patient .It just frustrates me .Waiting for like @NUM1 minutes just for people to finish a test .Itís good because you shouldnít rush on the @CAPS1. Its justs frustrates me that people take so long .Itís not just at school itís at my house too. The doctor, dentists at a friends house and and at the library. Man this is so hard to be patient .But itís not good  to be  in patient .I wish people were as fast is  I am during a test .Then I wouldnít have to be very patient.O well I guess Iím just going to deal with it man this really stinks being so patient.  Being patient can be tough, especially when waiting for others to finish their tasks. Whether it's at school, home, or various appointments, patience is a virtue that is often tested. Despite the frustrations that come with waiting, rushing through tasks or pressuring others to hurry may not yield the best results. It's important to maintain composure and understanding while waiting for others. While it may be challenging, practicing patience can lead to a more peaceful and harmonious environment for everyone involved.
1079	19028	7	3	Patience is a valuable quality that can lead to positive outcomes and prevent unnecessary negative situations. It involves dealing with challenges calmly and without complaint, as well as being able to wait for desired results. While some people struggle with impatience, learning to exercise patience can result in better decisions and more peaceful interactions. For instance, instead of reacting angrily to a persistent sibling, one can choose to wait for a parent to address the situation, avoiding unnecessary conflict. By practicing patience, individuals can navigate difficulties more effectively and achieve greater satisfaction in various aspects of life.
1080	19029	7	3	Once upon a time, there was a girl named @PERSON2 who had always dreamed of being a princess. Every gift she received was either a dress or jewelry, fueling her passion for elegance. Living in an old house in the woods with her two sisters, @CAPS1 and @PERSON1, @PERSON2's fantasy seemed distant until one day, a fancy letter arrived, inviting her to a ball at the castle.  Excited beyond belief, @PERSON2 went to the mall to find the perfect ball gown. Despite the high price, she managed to negotiate a deal by offering to work in the store for a few days. After hours of dedication, she finally owned the beautiful gown and adorned herself with makeup and jewelry, feeling like a true princess.  Arriving at the castle, @PERSON2 captivated everyone with her beauty as she danced with the prince. Enchanted by her grace, the prince couldn't resist asking for her hand in marriage, turning her dream into reality. @PERSON2, now a princess, learned that sometimes dreams do come true, bringing a fairy tale ending to her story.
1081	19030	7	3	One time when I had to be patient was when I had to babysit. My family friend has a one-year-old, and I have a six-year-old brother. I had to babysit both of them because my mom and her boyfriend were going to have a double date with our family friends. Things were great until they left. My brother was in preschool at the time, and they gave them these paper books and worksheets to do, and I had to help him. I thought, okay, this will be easy. I had him read the book, and my mom told me that he knows the words, so I won't have to sound out every single one. But I had to, as he wouldn't do the work, the baby wouldn't quit crying, and the dog wouldn't stop barking (he hates it when babies cry), making the house chaotic. I started to panic. What was I supposed to do? I didn't want to ruin my mom's plans and definitely wanted to prove her wrong. I calmed down and remembered what one of our friends said: be patient. I let the dog outside, picked up the baby, and headed back to the table where my brother was playing. First, I read the book aloud to get their attention. Then, I made a game out of doing the work, and it was all good. When mealtime came, I made some food that we all liked, set the baby in his high chair with his food, and gave my brother his plate. He then threw his plate at me, and food was everywhere. I got mad but told myself to be patient. I cleaned up the mess, fed the kids, put on a movie, and they all fell asleep. I quietly cleaned up the house, and when my mom and her friends walked in, they were surprised that I had managed everything. Patience is a big part of life. If you lose your temper, it just makes things worse.
1082	19031	7	3	One day my mom came home from work and suggested we go shopping for clothes. I chose to go later, and after some time, we headed to the store. The rush hour traffic tested my patience, but my mom reassured me that it would pass. Eventually, we arrived at the store, only to find long lines at the checkout. Despite the wait, we managed to get my clothes and finally left the store, feeling both happy and hungry. We decided to grab food at McDonald's, where we encountered another line. Surprisingly, the line moved quickly, and we received our order with a free large fries as a gesture of appreciation for our patience. This experience taught me the value of being patient in various situations.
1083	19032	7	3	The time I was patient I had trouble with football. I needed help doing everything. But my dad helped me. He taught me how to throw kick, run and kaney. I was patient because I watch them I did it. I saw one help my dad playing we went out to join them. The stuff he tate me was hard but it helped. My dad's guidance and support were crucial in my learning process, and through patience and perseverance, I was able to improve my football skills.
1084	19033	7	3	Patience is crucial in various aspects of life, as it can significantly impact how others perceive you and how you navigate different situations. Whether you are waiting in line at school or in a crowded amusement park, being patient not only earns you respect but also helps you avoid embarrassing moments or potential conflicts. By practicing patience, you can cultivate positive relationships with others and maintain a sense of composure in challenging circumstances. Embracing patience is key to fostering a harmonious and balanced life.
1085	19034	7	3	Fishing is a great sport that requires a lot of patience. My first fishing trip was at a lake about @NUM1 miles from my home, and ever since then, I have loved fishing. It wasn't an easy trip, but the patience it required was worth it. When my uncle visits from @LOCATION1, he always brings his fishing rods and fishes in a different way. I finally went with him about a year ago, and it was an experience that tested my patience.  The journey to the lake had its challenges, with a car breakdown and a long wait for help. Once we arrived, we realized we had forgotten bait and had to spend hours scavenging for some. Despite these obstacles, we found a nice spot by the lake and settled in to fish. Fishing requires waiting for the fish to bite, and it can be a test of patience.  In the end, after a long day of waiting, my uncle, my friend, and I caught @NUM5 fish. We enjoyed a meal by the lake and brought some fish home. Fishing relaxes me and allows me to unwind in nature. It may require patience, but the rewards are worth it. I will continue to enjoy fishing for years to come.
1086	19035	7	3	One time when I was patient was my birthday. I was turning @NUM1. I was very excited because I knew that I was getting a cell phone, which is all I wanted. All of my friends had them, and I just wanted one because if my mom had to pick me up and didnít know where I was, it would be helpful. My birthday was on a @DATE1, so the night before, at the football game, everybody was asking if I was getting it, and I kept telling them yes, Iím getting it tomorrow. The next morning, I ran downstairs, and the first gift I received was the cell phone. I was really happy and started getting all of my friends' numbers. I learned that being patient and not constantly asking for something can lead to getting what you want.
1087	19036	7	3	One day, my brother and I asked our dad to take us to GameStop to buy a new game controller. He told us to wait a little while, so we passed the time by riding our bikes for about 30 minutes. After that, we went swimming in our pool for a bit, but he still wasn't ready to go. We played with our dog, Macy, until he finally decided to take us to GameStop. Unfortunately, they didn't have the controller we wanted, so we went to another store and luckily found it there. We purchased the controller and headed home to play the game on our console. This experience taught me the importance of being patient and staying occupied while waiting for something you want.
1088	19037	7	3	My grandma was patient for five months because she had a big check that kept having mistakes with it, like her last name being spelled wrong. Each time they tried to fix it, they made more mistakes, causing delays in processing the payment. This situation put a strain on our finances as we struggled to pay our bills and desperately needed a new car and clothes. Finally, when my grandma received her corrected check, we were able to purchase a brand new car and update our wardrobe. Despite the frustration of repeated errors, my grandma's patience paid off in the end, allowing us to address our pressing needs and improve our quality of life.
1089	19038	7	3	The story is about a time I was patient. I am being patient right now. I am being patient about waiting for @CAPS1. Iím not a person who likes to be patient. When I want something, I want it that second. Christmas is my favorite holiday. There is so much good stuff about it. There are cookies, family, and presents. There is always a problem, and my problem is I like to try and figure out what my present is. That is what stinks about being patient; you are always waiting for something good to happen. All my family knows not to put anything in a bag for me because I will look in the bag easily, and if they donít wrap it very good, I will find a little slit in the wrapping paper. The worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents. I really hate that you have to go to bed and your presents are yelling not to leave them unpackaged. Sometimes it seems like all holidays are like that. Well, I guess we all have to be patient about something. Iím being patient about @LOCATION1 football winning the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 and Florida Gators. First, @ORGANIZATION1 has to get out of the @CAPS5 bowl game thing.
1090	19039	7	3	"Have you ever seen someone with good patience? Well, I have. My neighbor couldn't wait for the soccer tryouts to score. He practiced all day juggling, passing, and perfecting his moves. The day finally arrived for the tryouts. He showcased his skills, had a chat with the coach, demonstrated his best moves, and then headed home. ""It will be a couple of weeks to see if you're on the team or not,"" the coach said. ""I can't wait that long,"" my neighbor exclaimed.   After returning home, he shared his experience with me. ""I don't want to wait a couple of weeks,"" he complained. I explained to him the importance of patience. I told him that the more he complains, the worse his disappointment will be. So, he went back home and focused on mastering a move he had been struggling with.   A few days later, as I was outside, I heard my neighbor's excited screams. He came running towards me, shouting, ""I made it!"" I just smiled and said, ""Patience works."" And indeed, it did. My neighbor's perseverance and patience had paid off, and he had achieved his goal. Patience truly is a virtue that leads to success in the end."
1091	19041	7	3	One time that I was patient was when I was 10 years old and caught my first fish. My dad and I went fishing on my uncle's boat, and my dad was catching fish left and right. He helped me bait my hook and cast it out, telling me to be patient for my turn. As I sat waiting, my bobber suddenly went down, and I struggled to reel in the fish. With my dad's help, I caught a bluegill, which he said was a great catch for a first-timer. After releasing the fish, we continued fishing. It was a moment where patience paid off.
1092	19042	7	3	At my old school before this school, I was patient all the time. There was a moment when some students wanted to start a fight, and I calmly told them to stop and walk away. Despite their attempts to provoke me, I remained composed and did not engage in any conflict. The teachers intervened and addressed the situation, diffusing the tension. Later, I saw those students outside, still agitated, but I chose to ignore them as I understood their intentions were to disrupt the peace at school. By exercising patience and avoiding confrontation, I was able to uphold a sense of harmony within the school community. Patience truly proved to be a valuable virtue in handling challenging situations.
1093	19044	7	3	Patience is a virtue that allows us to stay calm and focused, especially in situations where we have to wait, like in line at an unemployment office. It helps us control our emotions and prevents us from getting angry or frustrated. When we are patient, we show care and consideration for others who are also waiting, demonstrating gratitude, respect, and trustworthiness. By being patient, we can take the time to observe our surroundings, appreciate the little things, and learn new things. It also teaches us not to rush things and to be grateful for what we have. Being patient is essential because it not only helps us get what we want in due time but also allows us to show kindness and understanding to others, just as we would hope for ourselves. Ultimately, patience is a valuable quality that can lead to positive outcomes in various aspects of our lives.
1094	19046	7	3	The first time I ever was patient was when I had to wait three years to get the film out of my camera. My mom always promised me to get the film, but since her money was used on other things, she told me to wait. So, I waited patiently for three years. Each time I asked her, she had a reason why she couldn't do it at that moment. Finally, after waiting for so long, I was able to get a new digital camera because the old one had been dropped too many times. Patience truly pays off in the end.
1095	19047	7	3	Every day at launch, I have to be patient while waiting to get called up to get my lunch. Especially when you're waiting in line, then you really have to be patient. But sometimes you're lucky, and you can go to the other line to pay for lunch. And then when you finish lunch, you can go out to ride and play. But first, you must finish your food, throw it away, and wait patiently. It can be challenging to wait, but being patient is essential in situations like these. By staying patient, you can enjoy your lunchtime and the activities that follow without any unnecessary stress. So, take a deep breath, relax, and remember that good things come to those who wait patiently.
1096	19048	7	3	I was patient in a plane ride going to @LOCATION1. All I did was stare at towers and buildings as I passed by them. I was also patient when my little brother got a flu shot and I had to wait in the lobby. The biggest time I've ever been patient was with my brother, dealing with his constant mischief, breaking my belongings, biting me with his toys, and his never-ending whining or crying over things he wanted. It tested my patience, but I managed to stay calm and handle the situation without losing my temper. Patience truly is a virtue, especially when dealing with challenging circumstances like these.
1097	19049	7	3	During the fishing trip at @LOCATION3, my family and I, along with @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @CAPS1, patiently waited for a catch. Despite only @PERSON3 managing to reel in a tiny clam, everyone on the boat remained calm and enjoyed each other's company. Even though we didn't catch much, the experience of bonding and sharing jokes made the trip memorable. I was impressed by everyone's patience and hope to embark on a similar adventure in @LOCATION2 in the future with my family.
1098	19050	7	3	"Being patient is not an easy thing to maintain. It takes self-control in order to have patience. Having patience is very important because if you have a job interview and you are not patient enough to wait your turn, they are not going to hire you. They are not looking for an impatient person.   First, my family and I were going on a trip to the beach, but we had to leave at 5 am so I couldn't go to sleep. I woke up at 3 am so I was tired. I couldn't take a nap because if I did, the nap would turn into a deep sleep. Next, I had to finish packing quickly so I was really tired and rushed because there was only an hour left. When I was done packing, I started to watch TV to keep me awake because I can't go to sleep under a time constraint. Then my cousin had to have his diaper changed so I was going to change it, but just when I was about to, my mom called and said, ""Let's go."" I was happy because now I could go to sleep in the rental van.   In conclusion, I had to maintain my patience, but it was really hard to do when you're really sleepy. I tried different things to keep me awake and it worked. What really almost made me angry was that I had to change a diaper, but somehow I maintained my patience."
1099	19051	7	3	"One beautiful day in she I by I up I, my sister and I were outside. My mom said that she'd be wide back. She's going to the store a couple hours late, she is no bake with a hot.

After a couple of days, she decided to be patient. She thought days would go by radius. They did to her stick, but not fast enough. My mom told her body to be waited of just target about the boy. @CAPS2 is hard for her to go that her house she is no ??? I was going to ???. I had decided ?? ?

""I can't have that I was patient for so long for clothes."" I bursted out in laughter. I thought @CAPS2 was bananas. After I stopped laughing for told me don't get used to the being patient house you might never be again."
1100	19052	7	3	Have you ever been in a situation when you know something good is coming or is going to happen and you just can't control yourself? You ask your parents, “when” and they say, “soon just have some patience!” well this has happened to me multiple times, such as when we were going to the beach or the amusement park, but on this special occasion, getting our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and be patient. It was last Saturday afternoon, the day my family was getting a dog and I was so excited. My stomach was filled with butterflies, trying to fly out and explode in happiness. Everyone else in my family was the same way, but just then, I remembered my goal about being a mature teenager and patient. So I carried on with my normal, everyday life. Eat breakfast, comb hair, get dressed, brush teeth, and go to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad will arrive with my puppy in 10 minutes. So I sat on my chair, in my room and watched the clock tic and toc for about 10 minutes. Then, I walked in to the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting and waited till I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my dads truck. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door as I simply walked to see the puppy. “aww!” everyone screamed. “Can I hold her,” and “she’s my dog,” and “let’s name her” also came in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing there quietly and handled me the dog. “you are being so patient, you get to be the one to hold her first!” I was so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the one that got to hold her first. Being patient does pay off!
1101	19054	7	3	I was patient when I was at my friendís house in the winter shoveling a sledding slot so we can put water on it to make ice. When we were shoveling, it was hard because we had to go through lots of snow just to get to a nice layer of snow to put lots of water on it. I am not a patient guy when we do something for hours to get it fully done. But I kept telling myself to just be patient. The only reason I was losing my patience was because it was getting dark and I had to go soon. But before I became impatient, we got it done and I was so happy we got the icy trail done. It was tough because we also had to wait for the water to turn into ice, but that didnít bother me at all. That's how I was patient that day to get a great and fun thing done. But we couldn't go on it that night because it was too late.
1102	19055	7	3	Patience is an important part of life and I learned that during hunting season. Most of the time, we sat and saw everything but deer. We were getting to the point where we didn't want to go anymore, but we did anyways. As the days went by and it got colder, we started to see some does. My stepdad said we would shoot one on the last day if we didn't see bucks. After a few days, it was the final day and we were going to shoot a doe, but we didn't see anything most of the day. With about 10 minutes left of daylight, the perfect buck walked into the field, making our patience and perseverance pay off.
1103	19056	7	3	One day, my mom, my brother, and I were driving to the beach when suddenly our car came to a halt. It turned out that the battery had run down and the car wouldn't start. Despite our frustration, my mom remained calm and collected. She quickly called a tow truck, but we were informed that it would take two hours for them to arrive. My brother and I complained incessantly, but my mom just sat quietly, unfazed by the situation.  When the tow truck finally arrived, my mom thanked the driver graciously and handled the situation with poise. Her patience and composure in the face of adversity left a lasting impression on me. It was a valuable lesson in staying calm and composed in challenging circumstances.
1104	19057	7	3	One time I was on my way to the bus stop, and I had got there 10 minutes before the bus came so I sat there and I looked at my watch, it was 5 minutes past the time I was supposed to get picked up. I waited and waited, checking my watch again, it was now 10 minutes past the scheduled time. Feeling a bit impatient, I debated whether I should just leave, but decided to stay put. As the minutes ticked by, I tried to remain calm and patient. Finally, after 15 more minutes, the bus arrived. Surprisingly, I was the only one left at the stop, and the bus driver let me on for free. When I got back home, my mom asked me how my trip went. I explained that the bus was late by 20 minutes, but my patience paid off as I got a free ride. She praised me for being patient and said it was a good lesson in perseverance.
1105	19058	7	3	I was waiting in line at @LOCATION1 adventure for a ride. I was becoming impatient just waiting there. But suddenly I saw the line move. So then I calmed down and waited, when it was our turn to ride. I just realized it was an hour we had been waiting. Understanding patience means you know why you have to stand there waiting. Because you canít push or shove your way to the front of the line. Tolerance means you canít do or get whatever you want unless you wait. You canít hit, cut, push, or shove to the front of the line, you just have to wait. Waiting in line teaches us the value of patience and tolerance, showing us that sometimes we have to wait our turn and respect the rules in place.
1106	19059	7	3	"Being patient requires a lot of tolerance. For most people, it's hard to be patient but sometimes it is very important. A few weeks ago, my neighbor really needed a break from her one-year-old daughter. I gladly offered to babysit because I love being with her. I definitely didn't know what I was in for. She came over at around noon and we played for hours. But then she got cranky. I gave her a snack but that didn't help. She started crying so loud I had no idea what to do. My mom came rushing into the room in panic mode. ""What's going on? Is everything ok in here?"" she asked. I told her that everything's fine but the baby is just really cranky. My mom replied, ""Let's take her to the park; she will have fun there!"" I agreed and off we went. I noticed that the baby likes to do things herself. She insisted on getting in her car seat alone, getting on the swings by herself, and putting together puzzles. That requires a ton of patience because she takes forever. I love watching her, but if I didn't have patience, it would be extremely difficult. Patience is indeed a virtue that can make challenging situations more manageable and enjoyable."
1107	19060	7	3	It takes patience when you are out hunting. After about three deer seasons, my patience paid off. I was using a bow and a beautiful eight-point buck walked out. He was about thirty yards from my stand, and I called him closer. Slowly, he moved to within fifteen yards of my stand. I took the shot, and he buckled. The five minutes I waited to find him felt like a lifetime. When I finally got out of my stand, I saw him run about fifty yards before dropping. As I approached him, my excitement grew because he wasn't just an eight-point buck; he was a magnificent twelve-point buck. Remember to use the right equipment and be patient, as you never know when you might have the opportunity to shoot the deer of a lifetime.
1108	19061	7	3	This is a story about patience. Patience is needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you need patience. One reason is if someone or something gets you mad, you need patience or you can get in trouble. For example, if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, you'll get in huge trouble. Or if you try doing something and you can't, you need patience or you can break something and get in trouble. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so you don't hurt their feelings if they can't do something right. They might get mad and not want to be with you. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both don't get in trouble. If you wouldn't have patience, things could end drastically. That's why you need patience. Without patience, you can get in trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong. That's why you need patience.
1109	19062	7	3	I have a lot of patience, which I believe is a valuable trait to have. For example, when I made the volleyball team, I patiently waited for the results without complaining. I think having patience shows respect for oneself and others. In another instance, I waited calmly for a test result while others around me were impatient and constantly asking about it. Patience can make difficult situations easier to handle. However, I have also experienced moments where my patience wore thin, such as when plans were not fully organized for a trip to a certain location. It is important to remember that everyone has their limits when it comes to patience, and it is a skill that can be developed over time.
1110	19063	7	3	I woke up at around 1 am not feeling very good. I was at my friend's house. I tried to wait it out until he woke up, but I just couldn't wait so I woke her up. I told her I wanted to go home so I called my mom, and in about 2 hours my mom had come to pick me up. I told her that I thought I was going to be sick. I had to wait and wait until finally we got home. It took about two hours until I threw up. It was horrible.
1111	19064	7	3	My mom shows patience with me and my brother, despite the constant fighting and violence happening around us. She is concerned about our safety and does not like us going out when there is so much danger in our neighborhood. As a result, she worries when we come home late, fearing for our well-being in such a volatile environment.
1112	19065	7	3	There was a time that I didnít want to be patient but had to be. We as a family were going to go to @PERSON2 common for a holiday. On the way while we were on the highway, about @NUM1 yards ahead of us, two cars were involved in a minor accident and both pulled over. They were beside the road, exchanging information with visible frustration. Soon after that, the cops arrived on the scene. Keep in mind that we were waiting behind all this. The cops investigated everything and called in for assistance. @NUM2 minutes later, a truck came around the traffic jam and started fixing the road. I donít know why there was nothing to be fixed. Finally, after a wait that felt much longer than it probably was, we were let past and continued our journey to @PERSON1.
1113	19068	7	3	"Lots of people are good at being patient, but Iím not so good at it. However, when traveling long distances, patience becomes a necessity. Several times a year, my family and I drive up to my grandmother's house, which is located about four hours away near a small town. My grandmother always looks forward to our visits, so we donít mind making the trip every few months to see her. I've lost count of how many times I've been there in my lifetime.  My mom, who works the night shift at a hardware store, usually finishes her shift around midnight. As soon as she gets off work, we pack up the car and hit the road. I always bring my favorite music player with me to keep me entertained during the journey, but more often than not, I end up sleeping through most of the trip.   There was one time, however, when I had consumed too much soda and was feeling hyperactive. I started annoying my mom by singing along loudly to the music, until my music player suddenly died. The sudden silence left me feeling restless and unable to fall asleep. As we traveled further away from the city, the radio stations became limited to country music, which wasn't to my liking.   Fortunately, our regular pit stop at ""The Up and Go Store"" provided a welcome break. I grabbed some snacks and more soda to keep me occupied. Despite my efforts to entertain myself, boredom soon crept in again. I gazed out of the window in frustration, only to eventually drift off to sleep.  I was awakened by the familiar sound of our car pulling into my grandmother's driveway, with her eagerly waiting to greet us. As much as I enjoy visiting her, the thought of the return journey home always looms in the back of my mind. Despite making this trip numerous times, I can't seem to shake off the boredom that inevitably sets in during the long drive. Patience may not be my strong suit, but the joy of spending time with family makes it all worthwhile."
1114	19069	7	3	I want to go see a movie. There are no movies here at home I want to see. ì@CAPS1 dad can I go to the movies with someone?î I asked. ì@CAPS2!.î @CAPS3 answered. I looked up what movies were in and their was a pretty good selection. I pick the movie I wanted to see. Then I realize I need someone to go with me. I called up my friend @CAPS4 and asked her if she wanted to go see the movie I wanted to see. Ended up she wanted to see it too so, she said yes. After that I got something to eat and relaxed. All over a sudden, it was time to leave. I was running behind. I got ready really quickly and went to pick up @CAPS4. Unlike me, she was calm and patient. In her place, I wouldnít have been. Thatís one of the reasons why I like @CAPS4 as a friend.
1115	19070	7	3	I have very patient. I will wait for anything for long. Where you have patient you have to wait on what you wait, or need. I believe that patience is a virtue that can lead to great outcomes in life. It teaches us to wait for the right moment and not rush into things. With patience, we can achieve our goals and overcome obstacles that come our way. Patience is a valuable quality that can bring peace and success in our lives.
1116	19071	7	3	A time when patient was when I went to the glasses place, And I had to get approved to get glass. So the next day my grandma call and ask did @PERSON1 get approved and they said ì@CAPS1î, my grandma asks how long do I have to wait and they said four weeks so a week went by and they called and said my glasses are done. So the next day we went and got them and that was a time I was patient. The process of waiting for my glasses to be approved and then finally getting them tested my patience, but in the end, it was worth it to have clear vision again.
1117	19072	7	3	I fell on my butt, again. I was trying to throw a front-full for cheer. A front-full is a big twisty thing in the air. I almost had it, I just couldnít land it. My gymnasticsí coach has been very patient with me, he has been working with me for about a month, on this one trick. I wanted to make him proud, he is like a brother to me. His name is @LOCATION1, I have known him since third grade. Whenever he seeís me he says ìmy baby!î and gives me a hug and kiss on the forehead. @PERSON1 can do many amazing things, he has competed many times. He taught me my back handspring, the first trick I had. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesnít. I am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient. Sometimes I would rather have him push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad. I always give it my all when I feel like that. It is an amazing feeling when you get it for him. ì@CAPS1î I feel on my but, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic ìtry againî, it was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped everything was good. I did the trick, and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me, @PERSON1 came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didnít stick it. We kept working and eventually I got it! I was really happy to tell my cheer coach, but even happier that I did it for @PERSON1.
1118	19073	7	3	Last summer, my mom ordered a new video game for me, and I had to be patient for an entire season - one summer, few months, four months, and five months to be exact. Why? Well, the game was set to release this fall, on October 1st, and I had to wait for it to arrive. How did I pass the time? Simple, I tried not to think or talk about the game and only marked the release date on my calendar. Even though I managed to beat the game thirty-two times on every difficulty level without any assistance (heh, heh!), I still have to wait for another month or so for the DLC to be released. This wait is frustrating because now I can't seem to get my mind off it.
1119	19076	7	3	Everyone should have patience. Living patience will help you because you're going to have to be patient sometimes. Sometimes some people can be patient and some people can't be patient, and I am one of those people. Quite sometimes I can be patient and can't be patient. Being patient was a hard thing for me to overcome, but I didn't give up. There was one time when I was patient in my life. That time was when a lot of elderly people were coming through the door, and I finally held the door for all of them. It wasn't easy because I had to be at an appointment in about 10 minutes, and there were a lot of them. It took almost 5 minutes to wait for all of them to get through the door. But I still continued holding the door even though I was late for my appointment. It was a small act of kindness that made a big difference in their day. In the end, being patient and kind is always worth it.
1120	19077	7	3	One time I was patient was last year when I was at an amusement park in a location called Cedar Point. I was standing in line to get on an amazing rollercoaster called the Steel Vengeance. It was a very thrilling ride and highly popular, but the wait was ten hours long. Standing in the hot sun for that long was tough, but the anticipation of experiencing the ride kept me going. Finally, when it was my turn to board the rollercoaster, all the patience paid off as I had an exhilarating and unforgettable experience. This taught me that sometimes being patient can lead to great rewards and memorable moments.
1121	19078	7	3	When I went to get my new phone, I had to be patient because my grandma likes to work with a specific person. The man named @CAPS1 who my grandma and I were waiting for finally came to us, and we went to the phase I wanted. He talked for a long time, but my grandma said if I wasn't patient, I wouldn't get my new phone that day. We made it up to the counter, and he showed things about the phone. I wanted to get out of there so I could look at it myself. My grandma and I finally left, and I had my new phone with me, and I liked it. I was patient during the entire process, and in the end, I got the phone I wanted.
1122	19079	7	3	A time when I was patient was at the doctors. The doctor took too long and I was patient for the doctor to come back to the room. I was at the doctor's office with my mom for an appointment. After the doctor finally came back, we had a discussion about my diet and exercise habits. Despite the wait, I remained patient and cooperative. The doctor apologized for the delay and handed my mom some papers before we headed downstairs for a blood test. Despite the crowded lab, I patiently waited for my turn and successfully completed the procedure. It was a test of my patience, but I managed to stay calm and composed throughout the entire doctor's visit with my mom.
1123	19080	7	3	Weíll Iím patient and Iím in the middle patience is all about waiting or juss sitting with someon you donít like. One time when I was little I was not very patient. My mom wants say had on a couple of seconds and I would say @NUM1. But when I got older I was more patient. Like, I was patient with teachers and peers and parents but there are times that I still have a unpatient side, I will try not to get unpatient but sometimes it juss happens. I love having someone to talk to but some times I canít talk to them because Iím unpatient. My friends are really good about it first though some time they donít my mom is really patient but my dad is not so maybe get it from him I donít really talk to my dad though although Iím unpatient Iím really out going and funny. I have a lot of friends because Iím outgoing sometimes I get in trouble because Iím outgoing and that has a blown side. I love talking and having fun maybe if I was more patient it would be more fun. I working on my patience. I think I can do much better than what I have been doing and maybe if I get more patient I will get better in school but I know I will try my hardest in the patience defortment. In conclusion I need more patience but patiuence is a thing I can defiatly work on. As I continue to grow and learn, I am determined to improve my patience and strive towards being more understanding and calm in all situations.
1124	19081	7	3	Patience is a virtue that is essential for everyone in today's fast-paced world. It is the ability to remain calm and understanding in difficult situations, without complaining. Patience allows us to wait for things to happen in their own time, without rushing or becoming frustrated. While it may not always come naturally, practicing patience is important for personal growth and happiness. So, next time you find yourself feeling impatient, remember the value of patience and try to cultivate this important quality in your own life.
1125	19082	7	3	A time I have to have patience is in class, especially during @NUM1 block, which is math. In this class, @PERSON1 can be quite challenging to deal with as @PERSON2 tends to talk excessively, often delaying the start of our work until close to lunchtime. Despite not being naturally patient, I find myself waiting calmly for @PERSON2 to finally give us our assignments. This experience has taught me the importance of patience, especially in a classroom setting where it is necessary to remain composed and focused. Patience may not come easily to me, but in class, I have learned to exercise it when needed.
1126	19083	7	3	ì@CAPS1 were gonna be late!î yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on. She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily. ì@CAPS1 were gonna be late!î yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat and cute red boots on. She began to jump around and it made me laugh easily.You see, I was going on a skiing trip with my parmls, my cousin @PERSON1, and her parents. I was estaric. My parents were spending a lot of time talking to @PERSON1ís parents before we left, so @PERSON1 was a little whiny about not going right away. I tried to ???? ì@PERSON1, do you want to play @CAPS3? I asked safely, tapping her shoulder. When I said that, her eyes seamed to grow twice their size. ì@CAPS4! @CAPS4! @CAPS4!  Madison yeah! I wanna play, I wanna play!î @PERSON1 yelled??? . Though she made it sound like ì???î I smilled and we began tro play. She would guess??? I would let her win. ??? was so ??? and I think I made her more patoient to leave by helping her play a game.Finally my parents walked outside and we began our skitrip. Patience had payed off. As we hit the slopes, the crisp air and stunning views enveloped us in a sense of adventure and joy. The laughter of @PERSON1 echoed through the mountains, and I couldn't help but feel grateful for this moment shared with my family.
1127	19084	7	3	One time I was patient when my little brother was taking a shower and I had to go to the bathroom. So I waited and of course he locked the door so I tried to pick it with a toothpick, it didnít work. Then I told my dad and he said ìbe a man you can hold it inî so that didn't work either. I was just about to take the door off the hinges when he walked right out and smiled at me. I finally went in the bathroom, only to find it soaked in water. I couldn't help but yell at him for the mess. Despite my frustration, that experience taught me the importance of being patient and handling situations calmly.
1128	19085	7	3	Iím always having to be patient because of my older brother and sister. My brother takes forever to do what heís told, like cleaning the bathroom. He procrastinates, making me wait even longer to use it. On the other hand, my sister is always on the phone, so I rarely get a chance to use it myself. I have to wait until my parents come home and tell her to get off. These situations have taught me to be patient in dealing with delays and interruptions caused by others in my family.
1129	19086	7	3	It was @DATE1 and I could see the snow pouring down as I drank hot chocolate. I saw our @DATE1 tree is was full of presents, I couldnít wait till I could open them. Iíve been wanting a wii since @DATE1 but I never got one. But that didnít stop me from hoping. So I wish I got one this year. After a while my parents said @CAPS2 can open our gifts. ì@CAPS1î I screamed, I quickly tore the paper off the presents and saw that I got a makeup set, a digital camera, and many more. But not a wii. I was frustrated. So I asked my mom if @CAPS2 could buy the wii tomorrow. But she replied ì@CAPS2 canít afford it. @CAPS2 will buy it when @CAPS2 get enough money. Well I was very patient so I guess I could wait. As @CAPS2 all enjoyed our @DATE1 @CAPS2 watched tv. Then after a week or so my parents got their paycheck, so my mom said @CAPS2 could go out and buy the wii. ì@CAPS3î thank you ìmomî I screamed. When @CAPS2 arrived at the store, I got the wii and it cost @MONEY1. I couldnít believe it, my patient finally paid off. Now I got my new wii, and I'm enjoying every second of it.
1130	19087	7	3	A lot of people in the world are patient. However I think that my @CAPS1 is the most patient person in the world. I think this because she was born in the dimension she had to be patient for food, money, and water. She couldnít just go out and buy food at the grocer store. She had to be patient to go and make her own food. If she wanted popcorn she would get some corn shells then put them into a pan then start a fire and who knows how long that could take. Then finally wait for the shells to pop. That is war hinder then putting a bag in the mircowave and pushing a button. That is how she is also fooled with ??? even with me. That is why I think she is the most patient person in the world.
1131	19089	7	3	Being patient is essential in life as it demonstrates politeness, understanding, and consideration towards others. When we exhibit patience, we show that we are willing to wait without complaining, even in challenging situations. For example, waiting in line for food showcases our ability to be considerate and respectful of others' time and space. By practicing patience, we set a positive example for those around us, especially younger individuals who may look up to us. Overall, being patient is a valuable trait that promotes harmony and good manners in our interactions with others.
1132	19090	7	3	Me and my brother have been asking for a dog for a while, every month mom and dad said we were going to get one, but every month we ended up with a fish instead. Mom would look online for dogs, and dad would search through the paper. Colin and I would constantly remind them that we would take care of the dog, feeding it, walking it, and making sure it had water.  Finally, the month of my birthday arrived, and a few days before the big day, mom and dad surprised us by saying that we were getting a dog the next day! We were so excited that we couldn't sleep that night. The next morning, bright and early at 4 o'clock, we all got into the car. Mom mentioned that the place was in Howell, so it wouldn't be too far of a drive.  When we arrived at the house, we were greeted by five small, fluffy dogs. They were all adorable, but one white and black dog caught my eye. I told my mom that I wanted her, and she said it was up to dad. Luckily, dad loved her too, so our new family member was chosen.  We named her Patience, and even though our excitement wore off after a while, having her in our lives was definitely worth it. Patience brought so much joy and love into our home, and we were grateful to finally have a dog to call our own.
1133	19091	7	3	An warrior named @PERSON1 was waiting patiently for his sword, he was waiting for an hour. He just sat quietly while every one was yelling. He was happy. All he could think of was his @CAPS1. He loved swords so much. He had @NUM1 as swords. So he was patiently to get his sword. Then he battled ninjas. He went after the ninjas because they to a boy named @PERSON2. Then he turned them to dust. The sword was made of magic. Then the warrior and @PERSON2 went to school. The warrior was the teacher and @PERSON2 was the student. They practiced sword fighting in the schoolyard, with the warrior imparting his knowledge and skills to @PERSON2. The bond between them grew stronger as they trained together, preparing for whatever challenges may come their way. And so, with their swords in hand, they faced the future with courage and determination, ready to conquer whatever obstacles lay ahead.
1134	19092	7	3	My story of when I was patient was when me and my family were going to the monster jam. It was one of the most exciting things of my life. But the trip there was almost unbearable, with traffic causing delays and frustrations. It took half an hour to find a place to park, testing our patience even further. Then, we had to wait at least 20 minutes for my mom's friends to show up, making us anxious to get inside. Finally, after an hour in line, we were able to enter the venue and locate our seats, which took an additional 30 minutes. Despite the long wait and challenges, the excitement of the event made it all worth it. Thank you for listening to my report about patience and sitting through it!
1135	19093	7	3	"There was a time when I really wanted to go somewhere, and my mom said, ""not tonight,"" because it was a school night. So I said, ""okay, I know it's a school night,"" at least I said it with manners and loyalty! Another time when I was loyal to someone was when my best friend was in a fight with another girl. I went up to my friend's ""enemy"" and told her to leave my friend alone. Despite some backtalk, we eventually managed to ignore her until she left. That's a time when I stood up for my best friend during a fight."
1136	19094	7	3	When I had to go to the doctor, I thought I would be in front of the line. However, there were over @NUM1 people ahead of us when we arrived, with more still coming. I needed to get my shots, so we had to wait patiently. My mom, on the other hand, couldn't wait due to the long line. I ended up falling asleep while she continued to walk around, growing more impatient as time passed. When I woke up, five more people had already been called in ahead of us. Despite her initial restlessness, my mom eventually calmed down and became more patient. She realized that being pushy wouldn't help our situation, especially when they threatened to remove her from the line. Witnessing her newfound patience was truly surprising and almost unbelievable.
1137	19095	7	3	When I was in the sub line and in 5th grade, I waited patiently. If you cut in front of me, I would not care. Then when I waited for 10 minutes and the line was still big. My patience meter went down after 15 minutes I finally got to get a sub. I waited 20 minutes for a sub that is like waiting to get pizza. Once I got to the check-out center I had no money in my account, so I was really angry, angry as in you not being paid any money for a year. It was a frustrating experience that tested my patience to the limit.
1138	19096	7	3	One time I was patient was when my brother broke his arm. I was playing outside on the playground during lunch recess when he fell from the monkey bars and injured himself. The school staff quickly took him to the office and contacted our parents. After my parents arrived, we rushed to the hospital for x-rays to assess the extent of his injury. Despite the long wait at the hospital, I remained calm and composed, sitting quietly for hours. My parents later expressed their gratitude for my patience during a stressful and worrying time. It was a challenging experience, but I was able to stay strong and supportive for my brother when he needed me the most.
1139	19097	7	3	My story in my own way about being patient is when there is a long line at a center point with many people in front of you. Being patient in lines is important because you need to wait your turn, as those who arrived before you deserve to be served first. Cutting in line is not acceptable and can result in being asked to leave, which is something you want to avoid. Whether you are waiting to order food or get on a ride, it is essential to be patient and wait your turn to avoid any repercussions. Remember, patience is key in these situations to ensure a smooth and respectful experience for everyone involved.
1140	19098	7	3	"A time when I was patient was fishing with my grandpa up north and we were siting out there all day and we had to have trolled up and down the channel at least a dozen times. And each time we got bites but we never caught any fish. We tried our usual routine but that wasn't working out so well, so I decided to change it up a bit. I gave my grandpa the idea of turning the boat around and heading towards a single bay. He agreed but the only problem was there were a lot of rocks where we were going, and that's the last thing we need is for the prop to get broken off. But we took our chances and motored our way to where I directed him to go, and as soon as we entered the bay, bam! We saw the pole bend down so far it was hard to believe it was a fish. I got the net, and my grandpa grabbed the pole and started to reel. We eventually got it to the surface, and it was a massive 22-inch walleye. We smiled and said, ""Looks like we're having fish tonight."" This is the story of when my patience was tested by fish, and then I caught the biggest one in the lake!"
1141	19099	7	3	"""Come on!"" I said as we sat in the waiting room of my dad's doctor's office. My dad goes to a special doctor, and it was a very boring experience. To pass the time, my sister and I checked out the rummage sale that was going on while my dad read a book. We ended up spending almost the entire morning at the doctor's office, which made it feel like the longest day of my life. The doctors were slow and not very helpful, but we made the best of it by exploring the rummage sale. We found all sorts of things like dishes, food, jewelry, and even a diary. I treated myself to a crispy rice treat, and my sister got a cool hat. I also picked out a colorful and sparkly bracelet. Finally, when they called my dad, we found out that he was healthy and just needed a prescription filled. It was a reminder to be patient with others, as patience is a virtue. I always try to be patient with people, and I hope others will do the same."
1142	19100	7	3	One day in the beginning of fall, @PERSON1 was watching @CAPS1.V. As she was watching, a commercial comes on and says that the final movie, of a very popular series, is coming to theaters tomorrow night. The next day of school, everyone was excited. They all couldn't wait to see the movie that night. Finally, the time came to go get the tickets. When @PERSON1 got there, a huge line was already formed. @PERSON1 was waiting, then she realized her best friend, @PERSON2, was in front of her. Then the rich popular girl showed up her line. Her name was @CAPS2. She walked up to the ticket booth and cut everyone in line. She tried to pay extra money for a better seat and because she cut people in line. The ticket seller said that she would just have to get in line like everybody else. That made @CAPS2 mad, and because she didn't get in line when she got there, more people got in line. But all that time @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were talking. Since they were patient, time flew by and the next thing they knew they were buying tickets. But @CAPS2 thought it took forever to get her tickets because she was not patient. In the end, patience paid off for @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, as they were able to enjoy the movie without any hassle, unlike @CAPS2 who learned that cutting in line doesn't always work in your favor.
1143	19101	7	3	I was patient when I went to Cedar Point. I had to wait in line for a long time for a princess-themed roller coaster. There were a lot of people at the park, making the lines quite long. The longest wait was for the Dragster ride. I had to wait almost an hour for a ride that only lasted a few seconds, but the adrenaline rush was worth it. Despite the long wait times, the thrill of the rides made the experience unforgettable.
1144	19102	7	3	One day my family and I all went to @CAPS1 point. I was so excited. When we arrived I rushed out the car. We got our ticket and a map then we decided what ride we wanted to go on.

The roller coaster was about a couple minutes long it was worth the wait. That was the time is was patient.

It was definitely a memorable day at the amusement park, and I learned the value of patience while waiting for something so exciting.
1145	19103	7	3	One day, I was at the locked creem store Frasty's. The line was huge, with over 20 people waiting in front of me. I patiently sat there, thinking about what I was going to order. As each person ahead of me took their turn, the line slowly moved forward. However, my patience was put to the test when a group of individuals suddenly appeared, claiming they were holding a place in line for someone. They caused quite a commotion, yelling and arguing with the staff.  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I was next in line. Just when I thought I could finally place my order, a sweet old lady approached me and asked if she could cut in front of me. Despite my eagerness to get my treat, I couldn't say no to her request. It was a lesson in patience and kindness, reminding me that sometimes, it's important to be understanding and considerate of others.  In the end, I eventually got my order and left the store with a sense of fulfillment, knowing that my small act of patience had made a difference in someone else's day. It was a valuable reminder that a little patience can go a long way in making the world a better place.
1146	19104	7	3	My brother Matt has never been the patient type of guy. He always gets very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long. We always have to have patience with Matt but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, Matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. While we were there and waiting in line, I made a bet with Mattís girlfriend. The bet was however many impatient comments he said, she would owe me two dollars for each one. If he did not say any impatient comments I would owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left we all started talking. The adults talked about work and other things, while me and my nephew, talked about school and other things as well. That took up at least a couple of minutes. In the last couple of minutes, we watched the football game that was going on. During those couple of minutes, including the time when we were talking, I did not hear Matt make one impatient comment. I was really impressed. I was upset that I owed Mattís girlfriend two dollars.
1147	19105	7	3	One time when I was patient, I went hunting with my mom. You have to have a lot of patience to do that. When my mom and I were sitting in the deer blind, she was getting her crossbow ready for when a deer came. But we were sitting there for about two hours. I was about to lose my patience, but then some deer came in - a mother deer and her fawn. My mom didnít want to shoot the mother or the fawn, because then the fawn would be all alone. So we waited for more deer to come in, but none did. But I still had my patience in me. When it started to get cold and dark out, we thought no more deer were going to come in, so we just went home - plus my mom was starting to lose patience a little bit. But thatís the time I was patient for a little while.
1148	19106	7	3	When I think about patience, I usually think of my mom, and how tolerant and understanding she is. Even when she has explained something to me about countless times and I still donít understand, she helps me without complaining. A good example of this is when she and my dad taught me how to ride a bike. It was a sunny day, and I was about five years old. My dad was at work, and my mom and I were looking for something to do. That's when she got the idea to teach me how to ride my new bike. My dad had emphasized the importance of turning the handlebars to avoid crashing, but no matter how many times my mom reminded me, I kept forgetting and falling down. Feeling frustrated, I almost gave up. However, my mom's patience and gentle encouragement motivated me to try again. Holding onto the bike, she instructed me to pedal and then let go, shouting, ìturn! Turn!î as I tried to balance. Despite my repeated falls, she never once scolded me, always offering a kind word of encouragement. On my final attempt before heading back inside, I finally managed to ride the bike all by myself. As I joyfully rode around the corner and back, my mom cheered me on, celebrating my achievement. This experience taught me the value of patience and perseverance, and it was all thanks to my mom's unwavering support.
1149	19107	7	3	You got to try to be patient with homework. One time when I was doing my homework I started to be impatient because I was having trouble. But then my dad said he was going to help me. He told me to be patient. I sat there and stayed patient as long as I could, then he finally helped me. I usually get impatient when it comes to homework or something like that. You need to try your hardest to be patient. Remember, patience is key when it comes to overcoming challenges and achieving success in your academic endeavors.
1150	19108	7	3	I remember a time when my brother and I had a project to work on that required us to use the only computer in the house. Despite my eagerness to start, I decided to let my brother go first, knowing that he was a slow typer. As the hours passed by, I realized that he was taking longer than expected to finish his part of the project. However, instead of getting frustrated, I reminded myself that patience was key in this situation.  The next day, my brother finally completed his portion of the project. I didn't mind waiting because I had ample time to work on my part. This experience taught me the importance of being patient and understanding, especially when sharing resources with others. In the end, our project turned out great, and I was glad that I chose to be patient rather than rushing through the process.
1151	19109	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I went to camp. I had to wait hours till we got to camp. I mostly slept and ate, we also watched movies on a portable DVD player. We finally got there, but I had to wait some more for registration and I had to wait till the rain stopped so I could get my stuff in our cabin. Next we waited for chapel to start, but there was more to do there like tennis, volleyball, or sit by the lunch room and talk to friends, or last read in your cabin. When the bell rang we all went into the program center and waited for chapel to end. We had a lot of patients by the end of the week. Ohh at lunch we had to wait for seconds because their food was really good. Finally, I had to wait hours on our way back home. This is a time I had patience. (A whole lot of it). It was a test of patience, but the experiences and memories made it all worth it in the end.

1153	19111	7	3	One day after school, I was told I had a doctor's appointment. When I asked when it was, my mom informed me that it was at 3 o'clock. However, I had a dance event scheduled to start at 2 o'clock. I expressed my frustration, but my mom insisted that I needed to go to the doctor first.  Reluctantly, I got into the car, and we spent an hour waiting in the doctor's office. By the time we finished and headed home to get ready for the dance, I had already missed half of the event. Despite my initial disappointment, I ended up having a great time at the dance and made the most of the remaining time.  In the end, although the day didn't go as planned, I learned to go with the flow and enjoy the moments as they come.
1154	19112	7	3	Patience is crucial in various aspects of life. It can prevent accidents, lead to unexpected rewards, and even help catch criminals. In a situation where impatience led to a serious accident, a girl impatiently crossed the road without looking both ways, resulting in a collision with a car that left her injured and in need of medical attention. On the other hand, exercising patience can also yield positive outcomes. For example, waiting in a car as instructed led to the observation of suspicious individuals attempting to break into another vehicle. By calling for help and remaining patient, the perpetrators were apprehended, leading to the capture of wanted criminals and a monetary reward. These contrasting scenarios emphasize the importance of patience in different circumstances. Patience can not only prevent harm but also result in unexpected benefits, underscoring its value in various situations. It is essential to cultivate patience to navigate life's challenges effectively and potentially turn adverse situations into opportunities.
1155	19113	7	3	One person I know was very patient one time I was associating with them. That one person was waiting for a call or e-mail that was promised to happen. The call or e-mail was about a basketball team that was very dominant in the state. The person who was calling or e-mailing the person I was with was coach of that team. He saw the person I was with, which was my brother, play in a tournament downstate in @LOCATION1. The coach was there to recruit players for his @CAPS1 team. He watched one of my brother's game and approached him after the game. They talked about the team and he told him that he would be a great asset to the team. My brother said he would love to play for him and so he gave the coach our phone number and his e-mail address. The coach said he would contact him in @NUM1 days maximum. On our drive home my brother kept checking his e-mail because it took us @NUM1 days to get home. The @CAPS2 day the coach never called or e-mailed him. The second day still nothing. My brother was very patient for it to come and he never stressed out over it not coming. The third day on our trip back home my brother was very understanding when my mother told him that it might not happen. So we get home at @NUM3 o'clock and I am starting to doubt that my brother brother made the team. Then the phone rings. My brother talked for while then hung up and said he made the team. That is one time my brother was patient.   My brother's patience and understanding paid off in the end, as he received the call informing him that he had indeed made the team. This experience taught him the importance of staying calm and trusting the process, even when things may not go as planned initially. His perseverance and positive attitude ultimately led to a successful outcome, highlighting the value of patience in achieving one's goals.
1156	19114	7	3	"A wise man once said patience is a virtue. Let's find out if that wise man is right. I'm going back 10 years. I had just talked to my parents and asked, ""Can you buy me this Lego set for my birthday?"" My mom replied, ""Sure,"" and asked me to move out of her way. She ordered it, and when I asked her a week before my birthday if the Lego set was on its way, she said it should arrive before or after my birthday. I patiently waited, checking the mail a week before my birthday and then again on the day, but there was no sign of the package. A week after my birthday, the mailman finally delivered the package. It turns out the wise man was right - patience is indeed a virtue. This experience taught me the value of waiting for things instead of rushing."
1157	19116	7	3	One day my mom and dad were looking up vacations on the internet. They came across a vacation to a place just outside Traverse City. We decided to go for five days, starting next month. I was excited to go, but I still had enough patience to wait for the confirmation from the reservation. When the day finally came, I was really excited. We got everything packed and ready to go, even the dogs were prepared. After dropping off the dogs at my grandma's place, we started our four-hour drive to our destination.   About an hour into the drive, my sister grew impatient and kept asking if we were there yet, but I just gazed out the window. We made a pit stop to grab water and drinks. My parents wanted coffee, but the machine wasn't working, causing a slight delay. Eventually, they got their coffee, and we continued the journey to our destination with patience.  Overall, our road trip to Traverse City was filled with excitement and anticipation. Despite minor delays and impatience along the way, we made it to our destination safely and ready to enjoy our vacation.

So I woke up on Christmas Eve couldn't wait till tomorrow. I told myself that all day. I went outside to try and waste some time but that didn't help because it was freezing outside. So I had to come right back in the house. I didn't have anything to do. So I just kept waiting, then my brother got up and I just played with him the whole day until we had to go to sleep. Then it was time to go to bed and I ran straight up to my bedroom and got right to bed and woke up the next morning and I was so happy that I didn't have to wait anymore. I had to wait forever I was so happy that day but now I'm thirteen and I really don't care anymore but I would still love to hear about your step to someday.
1159	19118	7	3	I was at @ORGANIZATION1, waiting in line for a ride that I really wanted to go on. It was a huge line, like a big line of domminus. I do not like waiting in big lines, but like most kids, I don't whine and fuss about it. In my head, I'm just thinking about when I will finally get to go on the ride. I try to stand still and wait patiently, even though the minutes feel like hours. Tic tac tic tac, the seconds pass by slowly as I wait for the line to get shorter and smaller. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, it's my turn to go on the rollercoaster. I am so excited! The ride is fantastic, even though it only lasts a minute. Despite the long wait, the thrill of the rollercoaster makes it all worth it in the end.
1160	19119	7	3	On @DATE1 me and my two friends were all laughing out but then I had remembered that in @NUM1 min I had to eat dinner. So I walked inside and my friends were being so patient. They didn't leave me and so I hurried as fast as I could so I didn't keep them waiting. After I got done we went back up to the park and swang on the swing. Then we walked back to my home because they had to leave and go home. That was my @DATE1. It was a fun one. Later that night, as I reflected on the day, I realized how lucky I was to have friends who were so understanding and supportive. It was a simple yet memorable evening that highlighted the importance of friendship and being there for one another.

1162	19122	7	3	One time I was patient when I wanted an iPod Touch. My grandma was bidding on one, and although it took a long time to secure the purchase, we eventually emerged as the winning bidders.

1163	19123	7	3	If you were someone sitting next to me on a bus on the way to @LOCATION2, you would call me patient. Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before you took me to @LOCATION1ís @CAPS1, thatís a different story. Iíll tell it to you anyway though. My best friend @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me over. And if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1ís @CAPS1 the next @DATE1! Of course. I said yes, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that @DATE3 @TIME1 came. @PERSON1 called and said that I probably wouldnít be able to spend the @TIME2, but we were still planned to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1. I said I was okay with it, but I was still uber bummed. @DATE2 came and it was complete torture. I babysat my brothers, but there was nothing to keep any of us occupied. We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @CAPS5 to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldnít get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didnít help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep that was needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet @DATE4 day of @LOCATION1ís @CAPS1. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing.  We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at parts. Now you know that for me, if Iím very impatient, but if its somethings smaller, I can wait.
1164	19124	7	3	I was patient when I was in school when my teacher left the room. The kids started going crazy and they were standing on tables. Throwing paper airplanes and paper in the classroom. The kids were screaming and I was just sitting there watching as the teacher comes in and sees what is happening. I am amazed at how stupid they are acting. Then I watch them get in trouble and get calls home. I am thinking good thing I was not part of it because I might get kicked from the cross country team. The kids are getting suspended for lunch. I hope that this never happens to me again because I was just a witness that can get the kids in even more trouble. It was a chaotic situation that I was fortunate enough to stay out of, and I hope to avoid such incidents in the future.

1174	19136	7	3	"Playing hockey is important to me. I am a goaltender playing for Farmington Hills. Playing goal takes skill, having thick skin, and most importantly, being patient. Every game day, my dad tells me to ""be cool, calm, and collected"" - the three Cs, as I call it. I step on the ice and wait patiently for the puck to come my way. Once it does, I am in action. The period ends, and I wait patiently for the next one to begin.   As the second period starts, I stand ready, hoping we score. And we do! Thanks to my patience, we take the lead. The third period comes around, and I make a big save. Another goal! We win against the opposing team. After the game, we all gather at my teammate's house to celebrate the big win. We have a great time, enjoying the victory together. Playing hockey not only requires skill but also the ability to stay patient and focused, which ultimately leads to success on the ice."

If someone is being disrespectful to you, remind them to be patient and then walk away. It's important to be respectful in all situations.

I wish I could've cut all the people in line but I knew I had to wait. When I got off I knew that it was so worth it. At the end of the day, I begged to go on one more ride. Again I had to wait 30 minutes to go on. The ride showed boring history of Disneyland. Then at the end, it gave us a screen and we picked the future and showed a funny cartoon with our faces on it.
1182	19145	7	3	Have you ever babysitted little kids? If you have, then you know how much patience it requires. It was my little cousinís third birthday party, and as the oldest child, it was my responsibility to watch the younger kids. At first, everything was going fine. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen, offering me fake food. Then one of them started to play with the ball popper. Of course, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately stop what theyíre doing and go play with the toy, too. So all of the little kids gathered around the ball pepper, giggling with delight as the machine spot plastic balls out into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball from the air, causing the other kids to fight over the balls and scream. I yelled at them to stop, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized that this would require a lot of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down. Thankfully, my little cousins stopped fighting and were able to play with the ball pepper quietly. I learned an important lesson from my cousinís birthday party ñ babysitting requires a lot of patience!
1183	19146	7	3	"I had another math homework assignment due tomorrow and I was tired of math already. Every day my fourth-grade teacher would give us math homework that was really long and hard. Some days I would come home and cry because it was really hard. My mom and dad always told me to be patient and stay calm. I never wanted to be patient because it never worked for me. Every day I would come home, sit down at the table, and take my time, and doing work. 10 problems a day was hard for a fourth-grader. Whenever math started, I would get out my homework and wait to check it. I never did terrible. I was always proud of my work. But when it came to getting my homework assignment, I was never happy. A new lesson every day was also challenging. I had to be patient and take my time. One day my teacher gave us an easy lesson, and I felt confident I could finish it at school. I came to a hard problem every once in a while, and I would stress out. But I remembered what my mom said, ""be patient and stay calm,"" so I did. I was patient and I worked through the problem. Now to this day, I remember to be patient. Math is what helped me become a more patient person inside and out. Being patient is a valuable lesson that I have learned from my struggles with math homework."
1184	19147	7	3	This one time my brother and I were coming back from a trip. Everything was fine until the car broke down on the freeway. So we called our parents to come get us. Well, when they got there, they forgot the cables. So just as they were getting to us, they left. So hours went by, then finally they returned. I asked if they remembered to get everything, and they nodded. They hooked up the car, and off we went.
1185	19148	7	3	"One time @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was sitting watching TV and having a fun time when his brother, or step brother @PERSON1 came into the room and said, ""Hey @CAPS2, we have to go to my interview, or you're going to be grounded."" ""How long is it?"" @CAPS2 asked. ""About an hour long,"" replied @PERSON1. ""But Itchy and Scratchy is going to be on, and it's a one-time only,"" said @CAPS2. ""That pointless kid show that was on the @CAPS7 and then they made it into a real show."" ""Where is it at?"" @CAPS2 inquired. ""It's at @ORGANIZATION1,"" @PERSON1 replied. ""Be there, we leave in an hour, so make a science experiment or something."" @CAPS2 never liked the @CAPS9-@CAPS13 man after the incident that happened on @DATE1. He decided to plot revenge on the @CAPS9-@CAPS13 man. After waiting for the experiment to finish, they left for the three-hour drive. @CAPS2 was patient, waiting for his favorite show, which he taped. Upon arrival, he searched for the @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man, only to find him waiting. With a bonney ball in hand, @CAPS2 took his revenge. He had been patient for more than @NUM3 hours to watch Itchy and almost @DATE2 @DATE1 to get back at the @CAPS9-@CAPS10 man. And with that, @CAPS2's revenge was complete. The end."
1186	19149	7	3	Usually I have very little patience (and yes I do know that patience is a virtue), but on my birthday a few years ago, I had to stay in a hospital room with my dad to spend time with my mom. It was very boring, but somehow I managed to go the whole day without being bored to tears. I was finally allowed to watch T.V. in the room, which made the day a little more bearable.
1187	19150	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went school shopping with my parents. The store was extremely crowded, with over a hundred people making it difficult to navigate the aisles. Despite the long lines and wait times, I remained patient as my mom was becoming frustrated. We waited in line for over an hour and a half, only to have the cash register break down when it was finally our turn. Disappointed, we left without purchasing anything that day. However, we returned the following week to finally get the clothes we needed. Patience paid off in the end, and we were able to successfully complete our shopping trip.
1188	19151	7	3	"I was patient when we were on the bus, we had just arrived at school the kids were loud and noisy in the day. There were a lot to get off the bus when someone jumped in front of me, then I fell back into my seat, there were about 20 kids getting off the bus. So I waited for all the kids to pass me then I got up and walked down the aisle to the door, then the bus driver said ""thanks for waiting"". Then I left."
1189	19152	7	3	It was @DATE1, @CAPS1 my friends were talking about how cool xbox was. They were saying how if you get xbox live then you can play with people around the world. They were also talking about the new game that was about to come out, that was called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1. I had searched it up online. And it was voted to be a ranking of @NUM2 stars. Now thats a good game. I had asked my mom and my dad if I could get it. They both and always say will see. After another month I had asked my mom again and she said why donít you wait till @CAPS6. And once I went to my dadís house he said @CAPS6 is just around the corner. But I said that everyone has it canít I just get it now. My dad said no, so then after that I had waited @NUM1 months thinking could he have his answer or maybe he changed his answer. And again he said no. So I went to my momís house and asked her she said that I should be able to wait and she also said if I ask again I wonít get it. And so @CAPS6 came and for my last present from my mom and my dad I had gotten an xbox with my favorite game I was sooo happy. And know I know if you have pacience and you wait long enough youíll get what you want.
1190	19153	7	3	I am always patient, but the time when I am truly patient is when I am getting my hair cut. The salon is always bustling with people, some in a hurry for a party or church service, needing their hair done quickly. I willingly wait my turn, content in the knowledge that I am helping others by being patient. It brings me joy to be understanding and accommodating, knowing that if I were in their shoes, I would appreciate the same level of patience from others. In the end, being patient at the salon not only benefits those around me but also allows me to practice kindness and empathy in a small yet meaningful way.
1191	19154	7	3	"This is about a time I was patient, babysitting my cousins. Their names are @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. They had to be kept out of the way because the adults were rearranging things upstairs, so we sat downstairs. Next, @PERSON1 and I watched a movie. I was called ""tiches"" too, as they did not sit still. It took a lot to not yell at them to sit down and watch the movie. It was at the beginning, and I wanted to play with @CAPS1, who was sitting in her crib. Finally, they were almost done upstairs. The couch was moved, and the chair, so it was more roomy upstairs. That was the time I was patient."
1192	19155	7	3	I used patience when I went to Cedar Point. I used it while playing video games. As I was packing, I grabbed my PSP and put it in my bag. Halfway down there, I got bored, so I grabbed my PSP and lost track of time. When we arrived at the hostel close to the park, I almost lost my patience. Waiting in line seemed to take forever, but my PSP helped me stay patient. I used my PSP to distract myself and test my mind while waiting. It made the experience more bearable and helped me stay calm throughout the wait.
1193	19156	7	3	Patience can be both a blessing and a curse in various situations. Waiting for important events such as medical results or vaccinations can be incredibly stressful, testing one's patience to its limits. To combat the restlessness that often accompanies waiting, engaging in activities like schoolwork or listening to music can help pass the time more quickly. Patience is a virtue that is tested in many aspects of life, from long car rides and tedious birthday parties to eagerly anticipating the end of the school day or waiting for a table at a busy restaurant. The feeling of impatience is universal and can manifest itself in a multitude of scenarios. Whether it's the excitement of upcoming holidays or the anticipation of a long-awaited vacation, practicing patience is a constant challenge for many individuals. In essence, patience is a valuable skill that can be difficult to master, but learning to navigate through moments of waiting can lead to a greater sense of inner peace and resilience in the face of life's uncertainties.
1194	19158	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting at the dentist for my brother. My brother name is @CAPS1 and he is sixteen. One day we went to the dentist. My brother had to get his wisdom teeth pulled. My grandma and @CAPS2 waiting for hours. After a while, she went to the backroom with my brother. So I was sitting in the waiting room alone. Thankfully I had my @CAPS3 so I watched a few cartoons and listened to music. A few minutes later I went to the bathroom. When I got out a nurse told me to come with her, she lead me to the backroom with my brother and my grandma. I learned that the doctor didnít even start yet! At least I could talk to my brother. So for what seemed like days the doctor finally showed up. After a hour or so the operation was over. Then we had to sit and wait for the amnesia to wear off. My brother was acting loopy and crazy. It was actually funny. Finally we left and I didnít lose my patience.
1195	19159	7	3	When I was really patient when I wanted my parents to cook me some lasagna. I did not have any of it since my mother passed away on my first birthday. My mother had my aunt to cook lasagna on my first birthday party. When she cooked some for my first birthday party, it was all gone. My mother cooked two pans of it. It was so good that it was gone as soon as she had put it out. I turned two years old. My mother did it big for my birthday party. My mom died from open heart surgery at the age of 53. She had a lot of friends at her funeral. The funeral was very nice.   In 2021, I asked my aunt to cook me some lasagna. She said it cost too much to make it. I offered to give her money to cook the food for me, but she refused. I kept my money and moved on. Eventually, in October 2021, she cooked me some lasagna. It was a special day. My aunts, brother, sister, and parents all enjoyed it. I watched them all get some, and I made sure to save some for myself since I lived with them. The lasagna only lasted for three days, but it was worth it. I even brought some to school for my lunch. It was a delicious treat that brought back memories of my mother's cooking.
1196	19160	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I was in the end of the year in fourth grade and Iíd just signed up for football. I had to wait from that moment. When I got my football pads, I was so excited for football I put them on about four times before football started. Time passed by and it was already summer break. In the summer, I show cows so that made the days zip by really fast. Finally, it was time for school to start again. I only had to wait eleven days until the day of my first practice. When the day came, it went by super fast and six p.m. came quickly. Then it was time to go. I enjoyed playing football that year, and it became a passion of mine ever since. It took patience to wait for football. Two months may not seem long, but for a ten-year-old, it is hard to wait that long.
1197	19161	7	3	"The time I had to be patient was when my brother was going to get me a present when it wasn't even my birthday yet. This is how this whole story began. It was a hot day and I had been doing my chores which included raking, mowing, and a lot more yard work. Mom and dad and my brother Travis had been talking a lot. When I was just sitting downstairs, they would tell me to do my chores, then I could see them talking. It bothered me a lot that I couldn't hear what they were saying. I finally carried on doing my chores, and I just got done mowing, which took two hours. I went inside and started to watch TV. Suddenly, I heard a series of noises, followed by my brother Travis yelling, ""hey, get back here."" Curious, I went to our fourteen curly stairs and was greeted by a six-month-old puppy named Max. Travis had given him to me as a present for my hard work. Max is now a happy three-year-old mutt, and I adore him. That moment taught me the importance of patience and how it can lead to wonderful surprises."
1198	19162	7	3	One time when I waited game but I couldn't get yet. So I asked my mom if she can buy me a new game, how much does it cost? It was @NUM1 dollars, then she said I have to wait for some days. The @NUM2 days went by, and I finally asked my mom if she can buy it for me. She said yes. I thanked her, and the next morning, we went to the game store. When I saw the game I wanted, I told my mom, and we went to the counter to buy it.
1199	19163	7	3	The doctor appointment. Oct @NUM1 @DATE1 me and my mom were getting ready to go to the doctors. Once we got there, it was so crowded. I felt like we had been there for weeks, days even @CAPS1 there were a lot of kids crying and playing. I was so exhausted. I was still waiting for my turn to see the doctor @NUM2 mins later, still not my turn. I was trying my hard to be patient, but it didn't help at all with all the noise of the kids running around. I walked up to the register and that's where I found out my appointment wasn't until @NUM3 o'clock and it was only @NUM4. I was frustrated, but I decided to reschedule my appointment and come back later. The waiting room was just too chaotic for me to handle at that moment.
1200	19164	7	3	One day my dad and I had a doctorís appointment at @NUM1 pm so we went there on time. Then my dad and I sat there for a while. We thought it would take a few more minutes. So we waited for @NUM2 minutes. Then my dad went and asked other doctors how long is it going to take. The doctors said about @NUM2 more minutes so we waited for @NUM2 more minutes. The doctor still didnít come out. We waited for @NUM5 minutes. My dad went to the doctor again. They said few more minutes we waited for @NUM2 more minutes there the doctor called us. So the doctor was @NUM7 minutes late. When we went in the room the doctor said sorry! because he was late. Thatís how me and my dad were patient.  My dad and I showed patience and understanding while waiting for the doctor, even though there was a delay in our appointment. It's important to remain calm and composed in such situations, as delays can happen in a busy medical setting. In the end, the doctor apologized for the delay, showing that our time was valued. It's a good reminder that sometimes, unexpected circumstances can occur, and it's best to handle them with patience and grace.
1201	19165	7	3	Being patient is indeed a challenging task, as I experienced one day while accompanying my mom in the quest for a pawn shop in @LOCATION1. Our journey was hindered by numerous red lights, causing delays at each stop. Despite the inconvenience, neither of us voiced any complaints. As we approached a particular red light, an elderly lady with a walker appeared before us, prompting us to wait for @NUM1 minutes for her to safely cross the road. Surprisingly, even then, there was no hint of impatience from either of us. This incident served as a reminder of the importance of practicing patience in our daily lives, even in situations where delays may test our tolerance. In the end, our ability to remain calm and composed in the face of unexpected obstacles not only benefits ourselves but also demonstrates respect and empathy towards others.
1202	19166	7	3	"When you hear the word patience what do you think of. I think about a person standing in line at a store when there are many people standing in front of you. In 2nd grade my sister and I played the patient game. It was about who could go the longest without food and all you could drink is water, and the winner gets a whole box of Dunkin' Donuts to themselves. Day 3 I had about 4 bottles of water but my sister was still hanging in there. Day 5 I had about 6 bottles of water and all day my stomach groaned, somewhat with my sister. Day 7, with all the groaning and growling, my sister was still holding on, and so was I, until I broke and drank water. Day 8, I couldn't hold on any longer and had so much food that my whole pantry was emptied. My sister was cheering, and she said, ""Don't worry, I'll let you have one of my 9 chocolate doughnuts,"" and she kept her word. In my opinion, that was patience."
1203	19167	7	3	"One of the worst feelings in the world is that your flight has been canceled. This has happened to many people but only one family in my family. My cousins were going to come to @LOCATION1 for Christmas. Cara and I were texting and e-mailing each other about what we were going to do while they were in @LOCATION1. They had been planning this since @DATE1, but now their flight was canceled! We were so mad! My cousin's family had to be so patient because they did not know if they would be coming to see us or not. My grandma kept calling my uncle @LOCATION2. My grandma had a good idea for them - to get on the next flight. The only problem was that the next flight was at @NUM1 and it would take them two hours to get here. When they got here, I was at the airport waiting. When I saw my cousin, she said, ""Everyone was so patient but me!"" I expected the exact opposite, but no! I thought that my cousin, Cara, would be the patient one, but I was wrong. But at least someone was patient."
1204	19168	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my dad and I went to leslie, to go hunting we wake up early in the morning and get there before sunrise. We stayed in the hunting ground patiently until midday, hoping to spot some game. My dad finally got a shot at a doe during the early hours of the day, hitting it perfectly. Later on, he managed to shoot another doe in the afternoon, adding to our successful hunt. With two big does in the back of my dad's truck, we left the hunting ground feeling accomplished and satisfied. It was a test of patience that paid off well in the end.
1205	19169	7	3	One time I was patient when I went to the dentist. When I went to the dentist I had to be patient because when we got there we got checked in and there were a lot of people there so we had to wait a long time. When I was waiting, I was sitting on the ground being really bored. I kept asking my mom if it was almost my turn, and she kept saying she didnít know. Finally, the doctor called my name. I went in, and then the nurse got me ready for the real doctor. After she was done, I had to wait even more for my dentist to come in because he was working with a different patient. But eventually, he finally came, and then I was all done! That is a time when I had to be really patient.
1206	19170	7	3	Patience was shown to me by a teacher during a math lesson on positive and negative integers. I was struggling with understanding how to order them from least to greatest. The teacher kindly offered to help and spent about 10 minutes patiently explaining and showing me how to do it. Throughout this time, the rest of the class remained quiet and focused on their own work. This experience taught me the importance of patience and understanding when helping others who may be struggling. It was a valuable lesson in empathy and support within a learning environment.
1207	19171	7	3	Where do I begin there wasnít ever a time when I was patient. I was always rushing people to do something and getting mad because they wouldnít do it fast enough or go fast enough for me. I would just get attitude. That's why I can't be patient, and now you know why. The end.
1208	19172	7	3	Having a meltdown can happen to anyone, as I experienced in the past. I recall a specific incident from my time in the first grade at Cross Creeds Christmas School. It was a day when my mother was running late to pick me up, and my patience was wearing thin. Within a few minutes, my frustration escalated into a full-blown tantrum, causing me to cry and lose control of my emotions. Looking back, I realize now that getting upset over such a trivial matter was a mistake. I have learned from that experience and understand the importance of patience and resilience. It is crucial not to let small inconveniences dictate our reactions and to keep a level head in challenging situations. Let my past misstep serve as a reminder to always approach difficulties with a calm and rational mindset.
1209	19173	7	3	Iím going to tell you about a time when I showed patience. When my family and my mom's boyfriend went on vacation to @ORGANIZATION1, we encountered a long line for a popular ride. Despite the initial excitement, the wait turned out to be much longer than expected. As the sun beat down on us, my patience was tested. However, finding a spot in the shade provided some relief. Finally, after what felt like hours, we reached the front of the line and enjoyed a brief but thrilling ride. It was a lesson in patience and perseverance, as we waited for what seemed like an eternity for a short moment of excitement.
1210	19174	7	3	Patience is a valuable trait that helps individuals navigate through the challenges of daily life. While some people possess a higher level of patience than others, it is essential to cultivate this quality to maintain understanding and tolerance in various situations. In my family of five children, patience is often put to the test, especially with my brother, @CAPS4, who struggles to remain patient when dealing with our antics.  Despite our tendency to be annoying and obnoxious, @CAPS4 usually manages to keep his cool and handle our behavior with a certain level of tolerance. However, there was a particular incident that pushed him to his limits. One day, as we were all at home, my siblings and I were being particularly rowdy, provoking @CAPS4 in ways that would typically trigger a reaction from him. Surprisingly, @CAPS4 remained unfazed, refusing to engage in our usual back-and-forth banter.  Feeling concerned about @CAPS4's uncharacteristic behavior, I decided to test his patience further by smacking him on the face. To my surprise, @CAPS4 retaliated swiftly, leaving me on the floor in tears. Realizing the severity of the situation, I sought help from our father, who reprimanded @CAPS4 for his actions. Despite his usual patience, @CAPS4's breaking point had been reached, leading to consequences for both him and myself.  In the end, the incident served as a reminder of the importance of patience and understanding in maintaining harmony within a family. While @CAPS4 may have faltered in that moment, it highlighted the need for all of us to appreciate and respect each other's boundaries to avoid escalation and conflict. Patience may be tested, but it is crucial in fostering healthy relationships and peaceful interactions.
1211	19175	7	3	When hunting in the woods, patience is key. Waiting for deer can be a test of patience, as they may not always appear right away. Sometimes, you may only see fawns or does before a buck shows up. When a buck finally does appear, the waiting game intensifies. You must wait for the right moment to take your shot, being patient as you bring up your gun and aim. After the shot, patience is still required as you wait for the deer to succumb to its injuries. If you can't find the deer immediately, persistence is necessary. Patience is truly a virtue in the woods while hunting.
1212	19176	7	3	One time my volleyball team went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was one of the last people off our bus which means I was one of the last to order. I stayed there very patiently as everyone ordered. I talked to my friends as they waited too. Next I figured out, what I was going to eat, (@CAPS1 cheese, burger, @CAPS2 fry, and a large drink). “@CAPS3 @CAPS4, @CAPS3 @CAPS4” as I watched the clock my eyes got droppy “@CAPS7, @NUM1” the lady said. “@CAPS8 @MONTH1 I take your order,” she said. I told her what I wanted and she put it on her register and I began to wait. A couple minutes later I got my order. Finally after being patient I got my food. That was the time I was patient at @ORGANIZATION1’s.
1213	19177	7	3	People with patience are truly exceptional teachers, and my mother exemplifies this quality perfectly. She handles her numerous responsibilities with grace and a calm demeanor, never losing her temper even when faced with repeated requests or a long day at work. Her ability to remain composed and kind in all situations makes her not only a great teacher but also a wonderful leader for our family. Whether it's waking up early to take us to school with a smile on her face or coming home after a tiring day at work, she never complains and always tackles the day's challenges head-on. I am grateful for everything she does for me, my brother, and my dad. My mom's patience, positivity, and unwavering dedication are truly inspiring, and I am lucky to have her as a role model in my life.
1214	19178	7	3	I was eager to get a PSP, so I asked my parents for it. They told me I had to wait until my birthday, which felt like a long time away. Despite my impatience, I decided to wait patiently. Finally, on my birthday, I received the PSP I had been longing for. My patience paid off, and I was able to enjoy my new gaming device to the fullest.
1215	19179	7	3	"I remember I had to use my sister's old phone, the BlackBerry Pearl. It was really slow, dropped calls, and was overall horrible. My birthday was coming up, and I really needed a new phone. I asked my mom if I was going to get one for my birthday, and she told me to be patient. Despite her initial response, I persisted in asking, eager to know if I would receive a new phone. On the morning of my birthday, I found presents on the kitchen table. As I opened them one by one, I finally reached a large box that contained a series of progressively smaller boxes. At last, in the smallest box, I uncovered an iPhone. I was overjoyed with my new gift and my mom remarked, ""That's what you get for being patient."" I was thrilled with my new iPhone and grateful for my mom's surprise."
1216	19180	7	3	Patient, one time I was really patient. I was invited to a sleepover, and when I got there, we went to the store to get some soda.
1217	19181	7	3	Being patient means to wait for something that may take a long time but you understand and wait without being rude. An example is waiting for a toy that just came out. Everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town, but your parents can't afford it at the moment. When you understand that money is tight and refrain from constantly begging for the toy, you are being patient. It's important to consider other people's situations, understand why there may be a delay, and practice patience instead of being pushy or demanding.
1218	19183	7	3	Iím writing a story about patience. Patience can be seen when someone is waiting for another person to finish what they are doing. For example, @CAPS1 has been patiently waiting for the kids to quiet down in class. Even though she is starting to feel frustrated, she continues to be patient with us instead of kicking us out of the class. She keeps giving us chances because she wants us to behave and stay in class. This shows that patience is important in helping others improve and succeed.
1219	19184	7	3	My sister's patience knows no bounds, especially when compared to my own lack thereof. Whether we're heading out somewhere or waiting for something to happen, she remains calm and composed while I find myself growing increasingly restless. Her ability to simply sit and wait without any signs of agitation is truly admirable. It's clear that patience is a virtue she possesses in abundance, making her a role model for me in this aspect. I can only hope to one day reach the level of patience that she effortlessly demonstrates in all situations.
1220	19185	7	3	One rainy afternoon on a Saturday, my little brother's friend's mom called and asked me to babysit. She and my mom were going to a show and wouldn't be back until nine p.m., so she needed me to come over. My mom dropped me off at seven p.m. and gave me a quick rundown of what to do in case of an emergency.   After they left, I played with the kids, watching TV and wrestling with them. We had a lot of fun running around and talking, with them mostly tackling me. I even lifted them upside down, much to their delight. When it was time for bed, I helped them brush their teeth and tucked them in. I read my book downstairs while they fell asleep.   As the night went on, I started to feel a bit anxious, worried that my mom might forget to pick me up. I turned on the TV for some distraction and tried to be patient. Thankfully, my mom arrived on time to take me home. It was a tiring but rewarding experience, and I was glad I could help out.
1221	19186	7	3	There is a time in everyone's life when they have to be patient. For me, that time came when I was helping my brother learn how to tie his shoes. It may sound like an easy task, but it proved to be quite challenging for him. Time after time, my brother attempted to tie his shoes, but he just couldn't seem to get it right.   I decided to step in and teach him. However, what I thought would only take five minutes turned into a long and frustrating process. He struggled to make the bunny ears, and even when he did, he would get too excited and pull the knot too hard, causing the laces to fall to the floor. Despite my growing impatience, I knew I had to stay calm and continue to help him.  After an hour of trying, he finally managed to tie his shoes, albeit not perfectly. I praised his efforts and thought we were done. But then he asked about the double knot. I explained it to him repeatedly, but he just couldn't grasp it. Despite my frustration, I persevered and continued to show him how to do it.  Finally, after much persistence and determination, my brother was able to successfully tie his shoes with a double knot. His smile was priceless, and he held up his shoe proudly. It was a lesson in patience for both of us, but in the end, it was worth it to see him achieve his goal.
1222	19187	7	3	At time I was very patient when I had to do a project on birds, which included a life size scale model. On the model I had to glue parts on everyday. But the glue took hours to dry. So I had to redo it three times, which made it a day project instead of a seven. I worked harder than others, but I kept breaking my wonderful creation. The wings would break, and I patiently had to glue them back on. I finally completed it, though it took way longer than I wanted to. I used patience, carefulness, and a steady hand to finally succeed!
1223	19188	7	3	"A time when I was patient was during a time I was with my mom and she decided to make some cookies. We got all the cookies ready. They looked so good even though they weren't cooked. My mom just said, ""Go to the oven for 10 minutes!"" I did not want to wait that long for my cookies. As they started to take their shape of big, dark brown, round, and soft, my mouth watered. I wanted them now. The timer buzzed. My mom snarled, ""They need to cool down."" She set the timer for 12 minutes. I did not think I could wait that long. Every minute seemed like an hour. Then the timer buzzed. I sprinted over there, grabbed a plate, tossed three of the biggest cookies on the plate, and burned my hand in the process. But I did not care. I took a bite out of a cookie. My patience paid off in the end. It was so worth it for the cookies I got."
1224	19189	7	3	School can be a place where patience is constantly tested. Throughout the day, it can be challenging to maintain patience, especially when waiting for essential things like lunch and bathroom breaks. Despite the fun moments, it's crucial to remain patient and tolerate the daily routines. Whether it's waiting for a turn in the bathroom or eagerly anticipating lunchtime, practicing patience is a constant requirement. By enduring these moments with patience, it's possible to navigate through the school week smoothly. In the end, being patient is a valuable skill that helps in handling the various challenges that come one's way.
1225	19190	7	3	One time I was patient was in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Guess @NUM1ís @CAPS3!) @CAPS4 was the @DATE1. When we pulled up to the ticket booth the man in the little booth said ìticket please.î @CAPS5 we pulled up to get a parking spot. Then we got out & ran for the gates. But just then @CAPS8 sister forgot her towel. @CAPS5 I ran back to the truck & got @CAPS4. Then we got into our bathing suits. Then we went to the water. The first ride I did was the ì@CAPS6 of @CAPS7!î @MONTH1 I mind you @CAPS4 was very scary. But I said, ìdoes anyone want to go with me?î @CAPS8 dad & @CAPS8 momís friend from work said yes! @CAPS5 we got in the line. The line was like @NUM2 to @NUM3 people in the line. @CAPS5 the wait was around @NUM4 hours! But I did not complain one bit. But then we heard a blood-curdling scream from the ride. Then a man, woman & @NUM4 young kids got spit out into the pool. Then we got their tube & went up the stairs. We got up to the huge opening to where you could see the @NUM6 foot drop-off then the bright pink & yellow funnel. About @NUM7 minutes later we were at the port where you get on your tube. @CAPS5 we went down. @CAPS8 momís friend (@PERSON1) went down backwards. I said ìyes,î you go to go down backwards. Hoorah! @CAPS5 we started going down & then we just dropped (well we free-fell) but we were going like @NUM8 mph. @CAPS4 was scary. Then we got spit out. Then I fell into the pool & got out. I saw @CAPS8 mom & her two sisters. They laughed at @PERSON1 because she was crying. Then she said she didnít feel good. @CAPS5 she went to the truck & took a nap. Then I rode rides the rest of the @TIME1. That is a time I was patient.
1226	19191	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the mall. I said to whoever was behind me that my mama and I had come to the mall to get some clothes. That mall was crowded, and nobody could get in where I was waiting. I had to be patient and understand. As a white family walked by and accidentally bumped into me, I remained patient and waited in line. I was tempted to get upset, but I held my composure. Finally, when it was our turn, I was proud of myself for staying patient in a challenging situation. That experience taught me the value of patience and self-control.
1227	19192	7	3	As the youngest bird grew stronger, it finally spread its wings and took flight, joining its siblings in the sky. The momma bird watched proudly, knowing that her patience had paid off. She realized that good things truly come to those who wait. The birds soared high above, a beautiful sight to behold. And the momma bird knew that the long wait was worth it, as she saw her beloved babies flying freely in the vast sky. Patience truly is a virtue, and she was grateful for the lesson learned through the journey of waiting for her eggs to hatch. In the end, the momma bird's patience had been rewarded with the joy of watching her babies take flight and begin their own adventures in the world.
1228	19193	7	3	I was excited to get my first iPad. But, there was a very long line. My mom kept on telling me to be patient, so I just stood there quietly. Finally, when we got closer, I couldn't contain my excitement. When we reached the beginning of the line, my dad asked me what kind I wanted, and I eagerly chose the big one. We then loaded it with lots of cool songs and went home to enjoy it. I spent the whole day listening to music until my mom told me to stop and take a break. After dinner, we took a car ride in my dad's new car before heading back home. I put away all my new items from the store, watched TV, ate some popcorn, and eventually went to bed. That day taught me the value of patience, and I was grateful for my new iPad.
1229	19194	7	3	"When I was patient, we were on our way to a theme park with my friend, her mom and dad, and her brother. We were driving to get there. It took us three hours to reach our destination. My friend and I were very patient as we waited eagerly to arrive. When we finally reached the park, we all stood in line to experience a variety of thrilling roller coasters. Each ride had a waiting time of approximately two hours due to the high number of visitors that day. My friend and I were determined to ride the tallest roller coaster in the park, known as the ""Sky Tower."" This roller coaster stood at a towering height of 300 feet, making it the tallest ride in the park. Despite the five-hour wait to board the ride, we remained patient. When our turn finally arrived, the exhilarating experience of riding the ""Sky Tower"" made the long wait entirely worthwhile."
1230	19195	7	3	Click, ìok, cool grandma thanks.î I say ìyour welcome.î @CAPS1 says. ìWhen will they be here?î I ask. ìI donít know,î @CAPS2 replies.  I had been eagerly waiting for the arrival of the shoes I ordered online, called @CAPS4. Every day, I would inquire if they had arrived, growing more impatient with each negative response. One day, I spotted a delivery truck and hoped it carried my coveted shoes. I rushed home, but to my disappointment, the package was not there.  Determined to track down my shoes, I checked online and discovered they were en route to @PERSON1, MI. Excitedly, I waited for their arrival, the anticipation building with each passing moment. However, even after a day of waiting, the shoes remained elusive.  An outing with my mom momentarily distracted me from the anticipation, but upon returning home, I noticed the brown box containing my shoes on the front porch. Hastily, I tore open the box and beheld the magnificent @CAPS6 shoes. Trying them on, I was overjoyed by how perfect they were.  Grateful to my grandma for the gift and relieved that the long wait was finally over, I basked in the happiness of finally owning the shoes I had been yearning for.
1231	19196	7	3	A time that I had to be patient was at cedar point in Sandusky, Ohio. My grandfather, my sister, and a friend were spending the night at cedar point. My grandfather stayed at the motorhome while my sister and I were spending the evening going on roller coasters. After about six hours, my sister and I went on all but one or two of the roller coasters. My grandfather, being old, did not really enjoy roller coasters, so it was just my sister and I. After all the fun, my sister and my grandfather were going back to the motorhome, but I wanted to go on just one more before heading back. I asked if I could, and my sister said yes. I told my grandfather that I would be back hopefully in half an hour. The roller coaster was the second biggest by the park. As I waited in line, it felt like it would take forever. I have ADHD, so I could hardly stand still. I had to try very hard, but eventually, I got on the ride, and then it was good again. The ride was extremely amazing. I finally made my way back to the motorhome, feeling content after the thrilling experience. Patience paid off, and I was able to enjoy the roller coaster before heading home.
1232	19197	7	3	"@PERSON1 was the guy I was in love with during middle school. I remember how time seemed to drag on endlessly, especially in classes like social studies, where I had the opportunity to sit behind him and admire his perfect head. The moment of truth came when the girls' choice dance was approaching, and I mustered up the courage to write him a note expressing my feelings. Through a series of intermediaries, the note eventually reached him, and I nervously awaited his response. As the day of the dance arrived, I left a note on my locker asking him to give me his phone number. The anticipation was excruciating as I waited for his call, feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety. When the phone finally rang, my patience was rewarded with a simple yet meaningful word from him - ""Yes!"" All the waiting and uncertainty had led to this moment, making it all worth it in the end."
1233	19198	7	3	Have you ever wanted something to be done and your parents told you to be patient? Recently, I've been patient. My family got a new microwave that was too big for our counter, so we had to put it above our stove. However, there wasn't enough space above the stove, so my parents decided to remodel the whole kitchen.   My stepmom took everything out of the kitchen and placed it all over the dining room, making it difficult to even walk in there. As a result, we started eating in our living room, which I found to be a bit unpleasant. Luckily, we also had the option to eat outside on our porch, which was a nice alternative.   Despite the inconvenience, I knew I had to be patient. Finally, my dad made a new shelf for the microwave, finished painting, and put our stove back in place. My stepmom then organized everything back into the kitchen, and we were back to normal.   After being patient, it became clear that it truly pays off. It's a good reminder that patience is key, especially when dealing with home renovations.
1234	19199	7	3	It was a nice warm sunny day when we decided to go to the Genesee County Farm with my family. We picked up my step brother, step sister, real brother, step mom, and my dad before heading out. As we arrived and started walking around, we were hopeful that the weather would hold up. However, our hopes were dashed when it started pouring rain, forcing us to seek shelter in a metal barn that soon began to flood. To make matters worse, we received news of tornadoes in the area. When the rain finally stopped, we went back outside, only for it to start raining again as soon as the rides resumed. Soaking wet, we decided to abandon our plans for the fair and opted for a meal at Taco Bell and Burger King instead. Despite the chaotic turn of events, we made the best of the situation and enjoyed a meal together as a family.
1235	19200	7	3	"One day my grandfather and I went fishing. My grandfather always says it is important to always wait. When we got to our fishing zone, I said I wanted to catch a turtle. My grandfather said, ""That will take forever, just catch some fish."" I insisted on catching a turtle, and that was final. As I was fishing, I caught a small white bass, followed by a big one. Despite my growing frustration at not catching a turtle, I continued. Finally, as I was enjoying a break and eating a sandwich, my fishing rod tugged again. I quickly grabbed it and reeled in what turned out to be a baby turtle. I had achieved my goal, and the day of fishing turned out to be a memorable one with a mix of fish and a surprise turtle catch."
1236	19201	7	3	"In @CAPS1 middle school, in @PERSON2's dirty and muddy science classroom, a boy named @CAPS2 and another named @CAPS3 were cleaning the mess @CAPS7 made earlier, from their mudball fight. For years, @PERSON2 was trying to @CAPS6 patient with the twins, trying to @CAPS6 patient with the twins, trying to figure out what could calm them down. @CAPS7 DO have @CAPS4 thoughÖ  @CAPS5 @PERSON2. Often she wondered what went though their minds when @CAPS7 got angry. When teaching them science, @CAPS7 never understood. When @CAPS7 did wrong things, @CAPS7 didn't know it was wrong. @CAPS7 progressed @CAPS8 by @CAPS8 in her class, understanding little. But it was as the principal said, ""@CAPS6 patient, @PERSON1; @CAPS7 will learn eventually."" @CAPS8 by @CAPS8 as the months passed, @PERSON1 believed her husband more and more. By being patient with them and not getting angry at them when @CAPS7 did something wrong, their grades started picking up soon, by the end of the year, @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 were @CAPS11- plus students. @CAPS7 had passed @PERSON1's class. On the last day of school, @PERSON1 went to her husbands office. She @CAPS12 him that his advice worked and that he was a great principal. All @PERSON3 replied was "" @CAPS12 you so!"" Ultimately, through patience and understanding, the twins flourished academically, proving that sometimes, all it takes is a little time and care to help students reach their full potential."
1237	19202	7	3	I am patient. Even though I hate being patient, I can usually tolerate it. Like when I was @NUM1 and there was no school because of so much snow, my mom had to go to a meeting out of town so she took me to my dadís house. She forgot that he had to work @DATE1 from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm. It was too late. I had to go to work with my dad. He was and still is the manager of autozone. So I stayed back in this little office (which I @MONTH1 add has never changed, even @NUM4 years later.) and I was going to have to be patient. REALLY patient. My mom had brought this doodle thing so I could draw, which only kept me occupied for an hour. Then I had to just walk around doing nothing. that is until I found @NUM5 employees doing inventory. Hehe, they had these carts that had a top surface and a bottom surface. I shuck onto the bottom surface and held on. They pushed me around the store without even knowing it! I did that for about @NUM5 hours and still had almost @NUM1 hours to kill. I found this old coloring book lying in the girls bathroom. If it were me now I would @CAPS1 have touched it. But I did. I was only @NUM1! I donít really remember all I did after that but I know that it was so boring because itís implanted to my brain. Is there ever a time when patience is fun?   During that time, I had to find ways to entertain myself. I stumbled upon employees doing inventory and hitched a ride on their carts without them noticing. It was a thrilling experience that helped pass the time. Additionally, I discovered an old coloring book in the girls' bathroom, which kept me occupied for a while. Despite the boredom, these small activities made the day more bearable. Patience may not always be fun, but finding creative ways to pass the time can make it a bit more enjoyable.
1238	19203	7	3	Being patient can be challenging, especially when waiting for someone like a parent who takes a long time shopping. It's easy to feel frustrated and want to rush them. However, learning to be patient is important, as it shows respect and understanding towards others. In the end, it's crucial to remember that patience is a virtue that can strengthen relationships and lead to better communication.
1239	19204	7	3	"Every year I go to my dad's. He lives in @LOCATION1 so we stop at the border. The border takes @CAPS1! So my family has to be patient, with them. On our way to @LOCATION1 one time the border was packed. Our family had to be patient, or there were going to be some arguing. With four kids it is bound to happen. After an hour, everyone's patience was running low, so my dad kept repeating ""keep patient, keep patient"" over and over. We finally passed the border and everyone cheered. So keeping patience is not the easiest thing to do. We all need to learn just a little more about how to keep it.  It's natural for patience to wear thin, especially in challenging situations like waiting at the border. However, by reminding ourselves to stay calm and composed, we can navigate through these moments with grace. Patience truly is a virtue that can help us overcome obstacles and maintain harmony within ourselves and with those around us."
1240	19205	7	3	Are you a patient person? Well Iím not! Well, I can be patient I just wonít like to be. A few years ago my family got a gordon setter puppy. Since theyíre kind of rare in @LOCATION1 we had to go all the way out of @LOCATION2. A couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks. My dog had a tough time with them annoying her, but she lasted. Two particular puppies were trouble! Patience was needed to handle them. itís hard to handle on puppy jumping in our pond and swimming across the deep end and another climbing chain link fences. We kept an eye on them @NUM1! They barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence. The fence climber left our home first. I was so sad. When there was two puppies left (waterdog and his sister) they ran around the house like maniacs. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then all of a sudden, they transformed into sweet little puppies. I didnít want to get rid of them, but we had to. Our puppies showed me patience always pays off no matter how hard the work is. My experience with these puppies taught me that patience can lead to positive outcomes, even in challenging situations.
1241	19206	7	3	The bell had finally rung, signaling the start of lunch. Eager to escape the endless math class, I hurried to the cafeteria without stopping at my locker. Upon arrival, I was met with a seemingly never-ending line that snaked through the lunchroom. Despite the frustration of the long wait, I recognized the busy lunch day and resigned myself to being patient.  As minutes passed like hours, inching closer to the front of the line, a group of seven girls brazenly cut in ahead of me, courtesy of a friend saving their spots. Though this blatant disregard for the queue irked me, I chose to remain composed and patient. Eventually, my turn came, and I obtained my lunch without complaint.  In retrospect, that moment served as a test of my patience. By maintaining my composure and understanding the circumstances, I navigated the situation without causing a scene. It was a lesson in tolerance and forbearance, highlighting the importance of remaining calm in the face of adversity.
1242	19207	7	3	"During the summer between forth and fifth grade, my family and I went to the amusement park at Six Flags! Many of the rides had lines, but none of them compared to the roller coaster. The line was massive! As my brothers, their best friend, and I approached the roller coaster, I thought we would never get on. My dad reassured me to be patient, but I couldn't see the point. When we were about halfway through the line, an employee shouted, ""Just 10 more minutes!"" and I started to get more excited. Finally, I made it to the front of the line, only to be told that the rides had to stop due to a thunderstorm for safety reasons. I was disappointed, but I decided to wait it out. I talked and played games with other kids in line under the pavilion. After the storm passed, we were allowed back on the ride! It was such a thrilling experience with the wind in my hair and a sense of accomplishment for enduring the wait. My dad even thanked me for being patient and staying in line."
1243	19208	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was getting my dog. I had gone to a jazz festival with my mom, my sister, and her friend. We were walking past a last chance rescue and we went to see the puppies. My mom didnít want another dog but when she saw our future dog, a blue heeler mix named Boxter, she gave in. He had grey fur with black spots and a black line running down his forehead. We asked the lady at the rescue if we could adopt him, but she said they were going to a special event where we could purchase him. We drove to the event, filled out the necessary forms, and played with Boxter in the store. After spending some time downtown with him on a leash, we enjoyed some ice cream before heading home with our new furry family member.
1244	19209	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I had pink eye. I was patient because my family went on vacation to @CAPS1. The first night we got there my eye was starting to itch and became all red. So we decided the next morning that we would take me to the doctor's office but there wasn't one around but we found an urgent care. So we went there. We waited in the waiting room. Finally, the nurse called out @ORGANIZATION1. So we went into the room. We told her we needed eye drops for me. She said ok I'll be right back. Then me and my mom and I were waiting and waiting for the nurse to come back. An hour went by and we were still waiting. I was getting really impatient. Then finally she came back and told us that she was working on another patient and told us once again she will be right back and told us the doctor would be in there soon. We said ok. Once again two hours went by and we were still waiting. Finally the doctor came with us and told us he was gonna bring my prescription. Then yes he did come right back. Then my family and I left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff to go to the campground. So that was a waste of @NUM1 hours of my vacation. That's a time where I was patient.
1245	19210	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient. It was at my cousin's house, and I felt lonely and left out as everyone else was having fun on four-wheelers. My dad noticed my feelings and offered me a turn on one of the vehicles. I hesitantly accepted and soon found myself enjoying the thrill of the ride, feeling the wind on my face and experiencing pure joy. Despite my initial boredom and loneliness, being patient paid off as I ended up having an unforgettable and exhilarating experience that I wished would never end. It taught me that sometimes, waiting for the right moment can lead to unexpected and rewarding outcomes.
1246	19211	7	3	"Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana! @PERSON3 is hurt!"" I yelled. ""@CAPS1? How? """"@CAPS2 bleeding by the highway at the corner as the fence @PERSON1's with him. ""@CAPS3 replied ""papa! Call @PERSON4 @CAPS4!"" nana yelled ""@CAPS5 get @PERSON1 and come inside!"" nana exclaimed. ""@LOCATION1, @CAPS6 we @CAPS7 leo!"" @LOCATION1, @CAPS6, nana, and popous carried @PERSON3 (@PERSON3 is a horse) to the car port and took a look at him. Hours later of trying to keep him warm @PERSON4 arrived. They got @PERSON3 on a talk. And started to bandage him up. They tried to get him to stand up but @CAPS11 wouldn't. @PERSON1 and I were wating in the house trying to wait and see if @CAPS11 was going to live. @PERSON1 decided that she was going to help out with her hourse. They carried the table with @PERSON3 on it to @CAPS8 his mom. @PERSON1 was behind @CAPS8 when she set the table down. And @CAPS8 kicks @PERSON1 to the tree. The next day @PERSON2 and I were putting a tent up in the back yard. So the horses could cool down. Nana called the vet to see @CAPS1 they could do. They got their @NUM1 minutes later they said that they will stich him up. And see @CAPS1 else they could do. They stitched him up for three hours. They said to watch him and see if any wounds would come out of their stitches. They also said they were going to check up on him the folowing @DATE2. That @DATE2 came and they took him to the statules and took care of him for a while @CAPS11 eventuly got belter. That's how I showed patince in the @DATE1.  The vet's care and attention, along with the family's support and patience, played a crucial role in @PERSON3's recovery. It was a challenging time, but with everyone coming together and providing the necessary help, @PERSON3 was able to heal and get better. It was a lesson in resilience, teamwork, and the importance of never giving up on those we care about."
1247	19212	7	3	There has been many times I have been patient in my life before. But I think this one will interest you most. Finally we get to go to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is this big indoor water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I have been wanting to go here for years. When we get there my first thought is ìparadiseî little did I know that there was the biggest lines I have ever seen. And the lines were not just for the rides they were for every thing. In two days of fun it is already our last day at @CAPS1. So I wanted to ride all the rides one more time. my mom told me to go get my swimsuit on so we can go to the park. So I did. When we got to the park the shortest line I saw was probably an hour long. I was so disappointed I only got to go on like @NUM1 rides. But I knew it was time to go and leave ìparadiseî. We left around @NUM2 thinking we would be home by about @NUM3. And we were on our way back home. I was so bored it felt like it has been @NUM4 but really it has only been one hour. It was taking us so long to get home because it was snowing really badly. I asked my mum when we were going to get home she said just be patient. So I just went along with it and sucked it up. ì @CAPS3 we are homeî. I say running inside. In my head I am thinking that was the longest ride ever. I look over at the clock it was @NUM5. @NUM6 longer than we thought. But I had to go to bed right then (dans it no video games). That is a time I displayed patience.
1248	19213	7	3	I believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry of frustrated. For example if you were in a crowded amusement park waiting in line to ride a popular roller coaster, if you're patient you would wait your turn, but if you're not, you might leave the line and miss out on the experience. People around you will notice when you are patient and appreciate it. Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait. They may make others feel uncomfortable or rushed, which is not nice. In conclusion, I believe that being patient is very important in life.
1249	19214	7	3	I have been patient a lot of times, but right now my friends and I are saving up to meet @PERSON1! It's a lot of patience just for one ticket, which costs @MONEY1! So, just imagine how long you have to wait to save that much money! It's hard being patient, especially when you are going to meet a celebrity that you have the biggest crush on! During this process of saving up money, I have been patient. No matter how hard it's going to be, I can do it with patience. My friends and I have been patient and are still waiting. Could you stay patient if you were going to meet your favorite celebrity? It's not that easy. It takes a lot of patience to do chores, take care of your animals, count how much money you have, and deal with people borrowing money from you, which sets you back. But like I said, no matter what, we are going to save up @MONEY1 plus tax to meet him, and we are going to be patient the whole time we save up. It is a lot of fun because you get to learn a few lessons and see how to become patient. Overall, patience is everywhere, and you use patience in many different things in life.
1250	19215	7	3	I had a friend who was my best friend since first grade, but she had to move to a different location in second grade. Despite the distance, we kept in touch through phone calls, often talking for hours. However, one day when she called, I got distracted by guests at my house and unintentionally kept her waiting for a long time. It wasn't until I realized that I had forgotten about her that I hurried back to the phone to continue our conversation. She patiently waited for me, showing the true meaning of friendship. From that day on, I made sure to never forget about her again, cherishing our bond and the memories we shared.
1251	19216	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I know it is hard for me to be patient! I usually am not patient because I really like things done right then and there, I donít really like to wait. I can be patient! I can be patient when I am waiting short periods of time. Usually I like to rush, not on my work, but socially, I rush! Being patient means to wait, usually without complaining or moaning. An example of patience is when you are going to a party at @TIME1 and it is @NUM1, you have to wait for a long time! Usually the time seems to go slow! Patience is a quality that is important. That is why I am working hard to try to be patient. You should too!
1252	19217	7	3	Last year, on my birthday, I told my parents what I wanted for my gift, and I specifically requested a gaming console. On the day we went to purchase it, we arrived at the store at 3 in the morning, only to find a large crowd already there. Despite the long line and the wait that felt like hours, I remained patient. This experience taught me the importance of patience in all situations. When we finally got home, it was a reminder that patience can lead to better outcomes and more positive interactions with others.
1253	19219	7	3	One day my dad and I decided we would go fishing. He kept saying five more minutes, so I just sat there in the car. Finally I got out to find him asleep with a note saying @NUM1 more min. I chuckled at his sense of humor and gently woke him up. We laughed about his nap and headed to the lake to enjoy a relaxing day of fishing together. It turned out to be a memorable trip filled with laughter and bonding, making me grateful for moments like these with my dad.
1254	19220	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I was at home watching my baby brother for my mama so she could go grocery shopping. My brother was crying because he was sleepy and hungry, so I put him to bed. I had to be patient because he was just a baby, and my mama was gone for a long time taking care of other things like shopping for clothes and shoes. When my brother woke up, he was still crying, and I couldn't seem to calm him down. But as soon as my mama pulled up, he stopped crying and started laughing. That's a time when I had to be patient and stay calm for my little brother.
1255	19221	7	3	When I went to the event, I was in the back row and the view was very obstructed. The show tested my patience as I was not able to see much, so I politely asked someone to let me sit in front of everyone and I was able to move to the front row.
1256	19222	7	3	I am writing about a time when someone I knew was extremely patient. He was having to be patient with one thing: teaching me how to swim. When I was very young, once at a hotel pool, I had almost drowned. Since then, I was afraid to swim. So, my patient friend taught me how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about though was getting me into the deep water of the pool. He wanted me to go to the deep end of the pool, but I was too afraid I would drown. So, he decided he needed to get me into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. He just told me to jump in, but he should've realized I wouldn't just jump in. He did eventually get me into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So, after that, I just got out, and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though and kept working with me. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on me. I told him if he stayed, I'd go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn't so bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in the deep ends. That's how my friend's hard work and patience paid off for both me and him.
1257	19223	7	3	"It was the summer of 2021 and I, Emma, had applied for a scholarship from the University of California. I had submitted my application in May and was eagerly awaiting a response addressed to Miss Emma from UC Berkeley. Since the beginning of June, I checked the mailbox religiously every day, hoping that today would be the day the letter would finally arrive. As the days passed and July came around, my anxiety grew as each day passed without any news.   One sunny day in mid-July, I was sitting down to have lunch when I heard the familiar sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mailbox. I leaped up from the table and rushed to the door to meet the mail lady, who had seen my disappointed face far too many times. She handed me the mail with a knowing smile and said, ""Today is the day, Emma.""  Patience had never been my strong suit, but in that summer of waiting, I had learned to be patient. And as I tore open the envelope and read the contents, a wave of relief washed over me as I saw the words, ""Congratulations, Miss Emma, you have been awarded the scholarship."" The wait was finally over, and all the days of checking the mailbox had paid off."
1258	19224	7	3	A time I was patient was when I really wanted a game called X-Men: Wolverine and my mom said I had to wait until Christmas came around. I can understand why she said that because we were a little short on cash at that time, so we had to make the rest of what we had last a little longer.   After a few weeks had passed, I forgot all about the game. Then, on Christmas day, my sister and I raced downstairs to open our gifts. I noticed a present with my name on it and eagerly tore it open. To my delight, it was the X-Men: Wolverine game along with two other games that I had been wanting.   I quickly ran up to my room, grabbed my controller and headphones, popped in the X-Men game, and played it all day long. It was worth the wait, and I was grateful for my mom's decision to wait until Christmas to give it to me. Patience truly paid off in the end.
1259	19225	7	3	One day, I had to be patient because I asked my mother if I could go skate, but she told me to wait patiently. We waited until she finally gave me permission to go. However, our patience was tested when my mother had to leave to get money for my sister. Despite our frustration, we understood the importance of being patient.   Another time, my sister and I wanted to go to the movies with our friends, but we had to wait for an hour for our mom to come home from work and give us the money. It was difficult to be patient, but we knew that rushing or being impatient would not get us what we wanted.   In both situations, we learned that being patient is key to getting what we want in the end. It may be hard to wait, but it is worth it in the long run.
1260	19226	7	3	When my friend and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was very busy. We didn't have to wait a long time for my ride, but my friend had to wait a long time to get on the ride. My friend was very patient, while I kept complaining about the wait. Eventually, we got on the ride and had a blast. It was tough waiting, but it was worth it because the ride was the best in the whole wide world.
1261	19227	7	3	To write about a time I was patient is hard for me to do so since I am not a patient person, but I am going to try. Three days before the trip to cedar point can not wait for it to be here. I did try to make it rush by, but it didnít work. I had been off of school now for @NUM1 weeks and I had did everything I wanted to do. When me my mom, sister and friends go we always have a lot of fun (of corce). Every night since , I have known we are going to cedar point I would sit there and think one day when many kids would ask and complain to there mom saying, ì canít it come anymore,î but me never, not one I know that no one could make time go by faster. So I waited did my chores, packed and watched tv. Trust me it was very long, very boring and is itching at me to complain but I didnít. I took a deep breath every time, this would happen to me. And say only a little wait compared to other things. I would also think about how lucky I am to be going to cedar point. I know I am a very impatient person and I am trying to fix it. This is what I try to do and do while waiting for cedar point to come along. This is what patient is to me, and in my life. This is also a time in my life when I was patient.
1262	19228	7	3	Being patient. Well, I have a baby cousin coming from Italy, and she was adopted from a local shelter, so I have never seen her before. I have only seen her in the videos and photos that my aunt and uncle have shared with me. Her voice, which I heard on the phone, sounds incredibly cute. I'm also missing my aunt and uncle a lot; I haven't seen them in five years. Despite the anticipation, I am still patiently waiting for them to arrive tomorrow or possibly even today. The excitement of their surprise visit keeps me eager and patient at the same time.
1263	19229	7	3	It was a cool morning on a snowy day in the upper peninsula of Michigan. I settled into my box blind, hoping to spot a monster ten-point buck with my new rifle. As the sun rose, I waited patiently, only seeing a squirrel for a while. Suddenly, I heard the familiar sound of a deer approaching. With my heart racing, I raised my gun and focused on the target. However, to my surprise, it was just a grouse enjoying some corn. I took a break for lunch, munching on an apple while scanning the surroundings. Then, I noticed a large brown figure in the distance. It was the magnificent buck I had been waiting for, with massive horns and a powerful presence. With precision and calmness, I took the shot and successfully bagged the impressive deer. Later, I had him mounted as a trophy of that memorable hunt.
1264	19230	7	3	I was patient when I had to wait in line for two hours just to ride the roller coaster. Then I got on it and it took off at 60 miles per hour. I was stuck to it for five minutes, then it went down at 40 miles per hour. I got off and rode it with a maximum force, and I was thrilled by the drop. The ride was ten minutes long and could accommodate five people. I went on the power hour, and it was exhilarating. My highlight was the replay; it was so much fun. I came home by the designated time and woke up the next day to eat breakfast. The whole time, I waited patiently alongside everyone else.
1265	19231	7	3	The time when I was patient I was about 7 years old because I was in 2nd grade. I'm 10 now but back to what I was saying, I was saying that I was seven in the 2nd grade and I was standing in the lunch line and these kids just kept on cutting me in line just for some lunch and I just sat there, being patient and myself. But I just stood there so when we did something else I was patient when we got up there I was ok it was ok because I still got to eat. I learned the value of patience that day and how sometimes, staying calm can lead to a positive outcome.
1266	19232	7	3	One day when I was patient is when I was waiting was waiting for my brother to come out of game stop. One day until my brother came out I kept looking at the signs of the game and I said “it must be a good game”. So instead of waiting at game stop, I went home and played football on my Xbox. Then I got tired and fell asleep on my gaming chair until the morning. My older brother woke up and said “let's go to gamestop to get the game”. So we went to game stop and waited in a long line for like an hour and thirty minutes until it was our turn to buy the game. It cost like a lot of money. I had my brother's share of the money because he didn't want to put in any money. So we bought the game and played it until we beat it.
1267	19233	7	3	Being patient can be a challenging task, especially when we are eagerly awaiting something special. In my case, it was my birthday, and all I could think about was receiving money as a present. Each gift I opened brought anticipation, hoping to find money inside. It took months of waiting until I finally received the last present with money in it. The wait was worth it, as it brought me immense joy and satisfaction. This experience taught me the value of patience, as it may be difficult to wait, but the rewards are often greater in the end.
1268	19234	7	3	Tick, tock, tick, tock. Every muscle in my body urged me to run and look for my dad. Tick, tock, tick, tock. But I stayed put, my eyes scanning the crowds. Tick, tock, tick, tock. And then I saw him. Tick, tock, tick, tock. I ran forward and gave him a giant hug. The clock in my head stopped ticking.  Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about a time I was patient. I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting at the airport for my dad to come and pick me up, and I was so excited! You see, I had been gone for two weeks, and I was really homesick. It took everything I had to not go looking for him, but I knew I couldn't just go running off; I had to be very patient. In the end, it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had gone looking for him.   As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad at the airport. Thank you for listening.
1269	19236	7	3	This a story about a time when I was patient. It was the day we were on the plane about to go on a cruise, when we got to the ship I was so excited I was thinking how much fun I was gonna have, think what my room would look like, and going to all these cool new places. So we got on the dock and there was a line and I was patient an waited to get on, there was another line to check your passport, so I was patient and waited. There was another line. It was to get our room keys, but I was patient and waited again and just stood there for a little bit and it was done, but wait you would never guess, there was another line. So like all the other lines I stood there on my iPod listening to music. They my dad said ìreadyî, I said ready for what another line he said ìnoî to look at your ìroom and relax .ì I was so excited. Finally we where done with the lines no more for a white. So I open my door with my very special key that we had to wait in line for and looked at my room it was amazing. But the bath room was a little small but it was great. I was so happy to final done with the lines no more! That is a time when I was patient.
1270	19237	7	3	One time I was going to see my friend that lived at the end of the street. I walked there, taking in the scene of the sun going down and the young ones playing and laughing carelessly. A boarder waved at me but I didn't trust him enough to wave back since he seemed like a weird o. not to be mean or anything. I finally got there and knocked on the door. She answered about 10 seconds afterward ''oh, hi!'' she exclaimed and smiled kindly. ''I have to finish my homework and eat.'' I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and swang back and forth. An hour went by. I patiently sat there. I didn't know if she was coming out and decided maybe I should go home. It was getting dark. When I got up she was outside. I told her I had to go home because it was late I could come back tomorrow, though. That was a time I was patient.
1271	19238	7	3	One day, I was very patient when our flight got delayed. We were going to a tropical destination that day when all of a sudden the delay sign came up on the departure screen. I was a bit frustrated but I reminded myself to be patient. Our flight was delayed for a few hours. So while we were waiting, we decided to explore the airport. First, we went to eat in the food court and opted for a meal at Chili's. We had to wait for our food, but it was worth it as we enjoyed some tasty dishes. After eating, we visited the airport gift shop where I bought keychains for my friends and picked up some magazines and a book to read during the flight. I also grabbed some snacks for the journey. We then took a leisurely walk around the airport before finding a comfortable spot to relax for a couple of hours. I even managed to take a short nap. When I woke up, it was time to board our flight. I was relieved and excited to finally reach our destination and bask in the warm weather. This experience taught me the importance of patience in unexpected situations, and how making the best of a delay can lead to unexpected enjoyment.
1272	19239	7	3	Being patient is a valuable skill to learn. It requires being quiet, not complaining, and waiting when necessary. During a hunting trip with my mom and stepdad, we had to remain quiet for a deer to approach. Despite the discomfort of the cold and the urge to speak up, we stayed silent and patient. Finally, a ten-pointer buck appeared, and after a well-aimed shot, we successfully tracked it down. Being patient, staying quiet, refraining from complaints, and waiting when needed paid off in the end. Patience is indeed a virtue worth cultivating.
1273	19240	7	3	Being patient is a very hand thing for me but one day I learned my lesson. It was a @DATE1 and my mom woked me up at @NUM1 she say we had a lot to do. When we got in the car I didnít know that I was going to have to be paitent the whole day. First on our way to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we got stuck in a traffic jam for about @NUM2 mins to an hour. When we finally made it to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we had to stand in line for about @NUM3 mins. I told my mum Iím ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being inpatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name. then it take another @NUM4 to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to work on being patient because it is a part of life.   In conclusion, my day of learning the importance of patience was filled with challenges and waiting. Despite the frustrating moments, I realized that being patient is essential in navigating through life's unexpected delays and obstacles. This experience taught me the value of perseverance and the importance of maintaining composure in difficult situations. Patience truly is a virtue that can lead to a more peaceful and fulfilling life.
1274	19241	7	3	At one point in life, being patient was crucial. I remember the time when my friends and I eagerly waited in line for the thrilling roller coaster at the amusement park. The excitement was palpable as we anticipated the adrenaline rush of the ride. Despite the long wait, I encouraged my friends to remain patient and enjoy the moment. Finally, after hours of waiting, our turn arrived, and we embarked on the exhilarating adventure. The brief yet exhilarating experience on the roller coaster taught me the value of patience. It showed me that good things come to those who wait, and that the reward is often worth the wait. In any situation, whether it be waiting in line for a ride or facing challenges in life, patience is a virtue that can lead to positive outcomes. It is a valuable lesson that I will always carry with me.
1275	19242	7	3	"I remember one time I was impatient, it was when my mom called and said she was going to send me money. I asked her when she was going to send it and she said in two days. Today was the next day, so that meant I had to wait one more day. The following day arrived, and the mail truck came by. I thought I had money, but it wasn't the scheduled day yet. Frustrated, I muttered to myself. Another day passed, and I was still waiting anxiously. Trying to distract myself, I went to a store where my favorite game, ""The Bully,"" was on sale with a discounted price and no tax. Despite my excitement, I couldn't purchase it without the money from my mom. Disappointed, I returned home. The next morning, my dad woke me up and informed me that it was finally the day my mom had promised to send the money. I quickly got ready, had breakfast, checked the mail, and to my delight, found the much-awaited envelope containing the money. Overjoyed, I bought myself some ice cream and finally acquired my favorite game, ""Bully."" That experience taught me the value of patience."
1276	19243	7	3	Patience is essential in sports, as it requires understanding and tolerance. Being patient is crucial when playing on a team, even when you may not always be the one making the plays. I experienced a moment of patience during a basketball game against Flushing. Despite a player from the opposing team taking an unusually long time to shoot her free throws, I remained calm and composed. I refrained from reacting or getting frustrated, and my patience paid off. Not only did I secure the rebound and assist my teammate in scoring, but I also demonstrated good sportsmanship by acknowledging the opponent's efforts. This experience taught me the value of patience in sports and how it can lead to positive outcomes both on and off the court.
1277	19244	7	3	It was my first game. I was pumped and ready to go in, coach yelled big guy and I was by his side. Then he said next play you're going in. Then the assistant said no I wasn't allowed to. The whole time I didn't complain. I never said one word to anyone. I helped other people. It was still fun. The whole time at least I didn't complain and make it worse for everyone else. The whole time I was on the sidelines. I never went in not once. I was very patient. Not to say I wasn't mad. At least I got some exercise standing there. The whole time I supported my teammates. I encouraged. I helped in any way, shape or form. I listened to them complain. But I did give support. There I was so mad I could have killed. I was ready, but my coach said no. It wasn't my time to shine. That one stupid word stood in my way, no. But at least I learned something. I learned the importance of patience, support, and teamwork.
1278	19245	7	3	Hunting when you are turkey hunting you need to be extremely still and quiet as you have to have a lot of patience. If you move even a muscle all the turkeys will run away. Sometimes you will be sitting for hours and hours just waiting on the one shot. I remember when I was hunting with my dad sitting under a tree for probably three hours and finally, a turkey came, unfortunately just about when I had a shot, my dad scared them all away, but I still had the patience to stay out there for another few hours. That is my example of patience.
1279	19246	7	3	One day, two years ago, I was going to visit the @ORGANIZATION1 train. @CAPS1 was a @NUM1-hour wait. Once we got to the front of the line, we had to go back to the end because my mom forgot the tickets. So, we had to wait 2.5 hours to get to the beginning. Once we got there, the guy told us that we could have told him our name, and he could have found our tickets online. My mom got really mad, but we got to go on the @ORGANIZATION1 train, which was really fun. That's the time I had to be patient for over 2.5 hours, enduring extreme heat.
1280	19247	7	3	In my opinion, having patience is a valuable trait in life. It is about waiting for your turn and not rushing through things. Patience allows you to take your time and do things correctly without making mistakes. I was raised to understand the importance of patience, as it can lead to better outcomes and overall happiness. People who lack patience often struggle to find contentment. It is essential to find a balance in your pace to achieve your goals effectively. Remember, patience is a virtue that can bring peace and success in various aspects of life.
1281	19248	7	3	Have you ever had to be patient before? I have and this story will tell you all about it. Last year on my birthday my uncle promised me a phone but I had to wait for him to get the money. I had to be patient. So I waited and then more months passed and I still hadn't heard from my uncle. I began to become frustrated with him because he promised me that phone. I told my mom and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience. Then on my uncle came over for my family reunion. He told me he knows that I thought he forgot about the phone. He presented the phone to me. He told me that whenever he promised me something he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth it. So whenever your patience is being tested keep your cool, it will all come to you soon. Patience is important to have because without it you will never be able to wait for anything in life.
1282	19249	7	3	You will say that you are bored very fast. Most people are bored because when you get out in the woods there's nothing you can do except watch and wait. If you make one noise, you will see nothing your whole hunt. Hunting is all about patience, but it is a great reward when that doe, buck, or whatever you're hunting is right in your sight. There are times that I have been impatient and times that I have been patient. When I was younger, I was very impatient; I would get up and walk around. But as I got older, I became more patient. Like when I got my first deer, it was an eight-point. Hunting takes patience, but I like it and it's fun.
1283	19250	7	3	One time I was patient was when I had to get some work done and my mom was on the computer. I needed the computer for my work. She told me she would be only a few minutes. So I waited, I decided to watch an episode of spongebob while I waited. As the episode ended I went back to the computer. She still wasnít done! So I made some bagel bites which are pizza on a mini bagel. I ate one... and so on I got to five and I started getting full. But I kept eating. I ate and ate. I was really hungry. I finally got stuffed, so I decided to stop. I went to check to see if mom was finally done yet, but yet she wasnít. I went outside to go play some sports with my friends. We were out there for about an hour got tired and eventually we all went home. As I walked in the door I looked at the computer it was still in use. I went to go take a bath because baths are soothing. I took a while in there because it was so warm and soothing. I got out. I went upstairs to change. I came downstairs and surprisingly my mom was off! I went to get on but she came in and said time for bed, so I woke up early to do my work. This took a lot of patience because it was hard to wait so long.
1284	19251	7	3	One time, I was in a car with my family on our way to see a patient. We were all in one car and a van, with me in the van and my mom and sister in the car. It was a three-hour drive, and I was feeling impatient. After about an hour, I was getting restless and just wanted to arrive at our destination. My mom kept telling me to be patient and that we would get there eventually. We made a stop to grab some food, and finally, we reached our destination.
1285	19253	7	3	One time I had to use patience when we were driving to Cape Cod. It was in a minivan with my mom, dad, baby sister (6 months), and my aunt. We were in the van for about 2 to 3 hours. By the time we got to the hotel it was 8 o'clock Cape Cod time and, in New York, it was 7 or 8 am. I was very tired of being patient, Iím not a very patient person so my mom was very proud on how great I did with the baby crying and being stuck in one place for hours. It was very difficult but the outcome was great!
1286	19254	7	3	"Being patient is challenging for many people, myself included. I struggle with waiting for things like upcoming events, deliveries, or even people. Patience requires effort that I often find myself lacking. My mom claims to be patient, but I know she struggles with it too. The phrase ""be patient"" is one that can instantly make me feel tense and frustrated. I try to be patient when necessary, but it's a constant battle. Sometimes, I find myself wanting to call someone repeatedly when I'm waiting for them to respond. It's a struggle to stay calm and composed when impatience kicks in, especially when I'm eager for something to happen. In those moments, time seems to drag on, and waiting feels unbearable. Despite my efforts, patience is a virtue that continues to elude me."
1287	19255	7	3	When I was 10 years old, my mom started making my birthday present. She was going to make a blanket. Sadly, she didnít finish the blanket. I had to be patient. As time passed and it wasnít done, I started to wonder if it would ever be completed. My birthday was almost two months ago now. However, just recently, she finally found the time to work on the blanket that she had promised me. I have been patient all this time, and every year on my birthday and on Christmas, I ask if it is finished yet, but it never was. Now, I see that patience is a virtue, and I can wait a little while longer for this special gift.
1288	19256	7	3	"One time when I was patient was when I was fishing. We were fishing on a cold night and no fish were biting. I was just there being patient, eating sunflower seeds and listening to the backward Celtics game. We were only catching little fish that night, nothing to eat or keep. We left at around one in the morning and went to get the boat on the trailer. It was pitch black and cold, but I remained patient. Eventually, I had to get in the water and put the boat on and strap it down.  On the way home, about five miles away from home, one bent trailer tire popped. Even though we didn't have a spare, I remained patient while my dad was getting frustrated. We drove home on the rim, and that was the most patient I have ever been.  To improve this writing sample, the writer could explain what a millennium is for clarity. Additionally, reducing the use of ""I"" to start most sentences and using proper grammar, such as ""was"" instead of ""were,"" would enhance the overall quality of the writing. Clarifying whether it was a.m. or p.m. in the second paragraph would also make the story more coherent. By addressing these issues, the writer could create a stronger piece of writing."
1289	19257	7	3	When I was patient I was sitting at a restaurant. And I ordered my drink and Mike was the first one. Then when we got our food they said it will take about five more minutes so I sat there it was fifteen minutes later when she came back and made the wrong food so I was losing my patience. so then I just relaxed. She came back with my meal this time it was. The right one so I was very happy. And I was really hungry so I ate it very fast so when I was done they gave me a free discount because of the mix-up they had with my meal. And my mom bought me something from a store for such great patience I had. And that's when I was very patient.
1290	19258	7	3	"We were going to Cedar Point. Me and my cousins were so excited! We were waiting in line to ride the skyline. After we ate, me, my cousins, and my younger sister headed for the skyline. The skyline gave you the whole view of Cedar Point. ""I'm so excited,"" said one of my sisters. ""Yaa, me too!"" said the other. We were walking towards it, and it took a really long time. When we saw the line, we groaned. ""This will take so long,"" said my sister. I was surprised that my 4-year-old cousin held her patience. ""Wow, it looks really high,"" said my cousin. ""Don't worry, we have Sarah with us. She'll take care of us,"" said my younger sister. Finally, it was our turn. There were two small kids behind us wanting to go on so badly. ""Why don't you go ahead?"" said my cousin. I was shocked that my cousin had so much patience since she usually wants to go first for everything. I was proud of her. We had a great time there, and I hope we come back again soon!"
1291	19259	7	3	Patience is a virtue that can be challenging to maintain, but it often leads to rewarding outcomes. I once made a bet with my band teacher to receive a reward if he failed to provide us with our report cards, a task he consistently forgot. After waiting patiently for months, the school year ended without him fulfilling his promise. However, when he finally delivered on his agreement halfway through the following year, he not only provided me with the agreed-upon treat but also added an extra pack of sweets to acknowledge my patience. This experience taught me the value of being patient and how it can ultimately lead to unexpected rewards.
1292	19260	7	3	Patience is a valuable virtue that not everyone possesses. It requires a great deal of self-control and understanding to wait calmly for something without becoming frustrated. In the case of the writer, they demonstrate patience by attending basketball practice despite not being able to participate due to a recent injury. It can be challenging to sit on the sidelines and watch others engage in activities that you love, but true patience lies in being able to do so without complaint. By showing patience in this situation, the writer is setting themselves up for success in the future when they will be able to join their friends on the court once again. Patience is not just about waiting; it is about maintaining a positive attitude and a sense of calm during the process. It is a valuable quality that can help in various aspects of life, from sports to relationships to personal growth. So, next time you find yourself in a situation that requires patience, remember the writer's example and strive to approach it with grace and understanding.
1293	19261	7	3	The one time when I was patient was on the day of the test last year. Some of the reasons I was patient included keeping to myself and being quiet. Patience is crucial during tests, as rushing can lead to mistakes. When the test is over, it's important to wait patiently for others to finish. During this time, one can review their work or engage in a quiet activity like reading a book. Patience is essential because timed tests require careful attention to detail. By remaining patient, students can create a calm and focused environment for everyone in the classroom. Having patience during tests not only benefits oneself but also contributes to a positive testing environment for all students. In the end, patience is a key factor in achieving success in academics.
1294	19262	7	3	"Oneday at school @PERSON2 was waiting in line to get his lunch when out of the blue @NUM1 kids popped right in front of him. @PERSON1 said to the kid that they have to go to the back of the line. ""We don't,"" said the kid. Later, @PERSON4, whom @PERSON2 likes, was going to the back of the line, but @PERSON2 allowed her to cut in front of him. After getting their food, @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 waited to pay when a new student, @NUM2, couldn't remember his student number. They had to make him a student number before he could pay for his food.   @PERSON4 sat with her friends, but @PERSON3 didn't have a place to sit as his friends were outside. Seeing him alone, @PERSON4 invited @PERSON3 to sit with her and her friends. Eventually, they finished eating, and @PERSON4 asked @PERSON1 to hang out at recess, which he agreed to. They had to wait for one of @CAPS3's friends to finish eating before they could go outside. As they finally went outside, the bell rang, signaling the end of the break. Though @PERSON1 was disappointed, he enjoyed hanging out with @PERSON4 the whole time."
1295	19263	7	3	Last weekend, while I was up at my family's cabin, my stepdad taught my brothers, friends, and me how to waterski. Despite being a bit fearful, I decided to give it a try and surprisingly, I was the first one to succeed. Following my stepdad's instructions and remaining patient with myself, I managed to get up on the skis and glide smoothly on the water, just like a pro. As the day went on, I became more confident in my skills and even managed to make some impressive turns. When it was time to head back to the cabin, I was eager to get back out on the lake.   However, when my friend hesitated about trying waterskiing, I didn't pressure her into it. I sat with her patiently as she contemplated her decision, ultimately deciding not to give it a try. Although I believed she was missing out on a great experience, I respected her choice and didn't push her. Looking back on that day, I am proud of myself for showing understanding and not forcing my friend into something she wasn't comfortable with. It was a valuable lesson in patience and respect that I will carry with me.
1296	19264	7	3	When I was a child, my mom always seemed impatient and easily annoyed. However, one day, as she was about to take a shower, she surprisingly exhibited patience when someone kept delaying her. I witnessed her calm demeanor from my hiding spot, amazed by her unexpected behavior. When the opportunity arose, I informed her of the situation, prompting her to finally take her shower. Afterward, she expressed how good it felt, showing that a little patience can go a long way.
1297	19265	7	3	When I was about seven And my mom was pregnant with my @NUM1 sister. It was the night before she had her. We were all asleep. When my mom started to scream we all went into her room my dad asked her what was going on she said ìshe comingî my dad raced to the car put it in to gear and left without us and my mom who was about to have a baby. Then when my dad relized he forgot us. So when he got home to pick us up. It was already morning they took us to a room. They prepared my mom up. Me amd my little sister were waiting in the seats next to her. Then when they took her to get an ultrasound we had to wait. It was finally time to deliver her. Me and my sister and grandma had to wait outside the deveiring room we were so paitient it took over an hour to get her out. when they were stiching my mom up the brought my little sister to get all cleand up. When we could see her through the window. I had to see her get her first bath, shots And when the put those patches on her I had thought she was an @CAPS1. But when they brought her to our room my mom looked dead and my @CAPS2 baby sister was so beautiful. My mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister. My mom said she would name her @PERSON1. And we all liked that name. I was so @CAPS3 that day. My little sister brought so much joy and happiness to our family, and I will always remember the day she was born with love and fondness.
1298	19266	7	3	Patience is a virtue that not many possess, but it is crucial in overcoming challenges. Personally, I have struggled with patience, but there was a particular instance that tested my limits. Every year, my family goes to the Labor Day walk at a popular location. The reward for not complaining during the walk is a delicious treat of fudge. Despite facing physical discomfort from pulled muscles and burns, I knew that patience was key to earning that fudge. As we embarked on the challenging walk, I reminded myself to be understanding and tolerant of the pain. Pushing through the discomfort, I set a faster pace than expected, determined to beat our previous record. Despite the excruciating pain in my legs, I persevered, not giving in to the urge to complain. In the end, my patience paid off as we not only achieved our goal but also savored the sweet taste of victory in the form of fudge. This experience taught me the importance of patience in enduring hardships and achieving success.
1299	19267	7	3	"A time I was patient! Being patient is all about being tolerant and understanding. Sometimes when someone is in a bad mood I have to be patient when someone asks me a dumb question or gets on my nerves. One day (last year) I was feeling sick and upset during my vacation and my little sister wanted some ice cream, but not from the ice cream truck that passed by every twenty minutes from the ice cream shop which was about seven to ten blocks away. I was bundled in my blanket when she jumped on my bed. ""I want to go get ice cream,"" she said. I snapped at her in a mean voice, not realizing how young she was and that she didn't quite understand that I was feeling unwell. Tears welled up in her eyes, and I quickly realized my mistake. I apologized and explained that I was sick. She ran out of the room, only to return ten minutes later with a cup of tea that she had made for me. After drinking the tea, she asked if I felt better. I felt a little better, and she climbed onto my bed, bouncing around. I was patient with her, knowing she didn't fully comprehend the situation. I took her to the ice cream shop to get some ice cream, and seeing her happy made me happy. I felt proud of myself for being patient with her, even when she got on my nerves initially. In the end, patience and understanding prevailed, strengthening our bond."
1300	19268	7	3	It was a sunny Saturday morning, and we were all gathered at the marina. We were eager to go out on the boat and enjoy some tubing. As we prepared to set off, we encountered a problem – the boat wouldn't start. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the bilge pump had malfunctioned due to a wiring issue. Despite the initial frustration, our step-dad swiftly re-wired the boat, but to our dismay, it still wouldn't start.  The kids were getting restless, but the adults urged us to be patient. After a moment of disappointment, we walked away from the boat. Suddenly, the sound of a boat engine starting caught our attention. Excitedly, we rushed back to the boat, and to our delight, it was finally up and running. We all hopped on board, and soon enough, we were speeding down the river, enjoying an exhilarating tubing session.  Reflecting on the day's events, my mom reminded me that patience is indeed a virtue. Despite the initial setback, our perseverance and patience paid off, allowing us to have a memorable and enjoyable day on the water.
1301	19270	7	3	Iím constantly patient mostly because of my younger sister. Sometimes its easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time Iím able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly day I was in my mother's room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked ìhow did you get so good at putting make-up?î She responded ìwith patience and years of practice.î The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom if we could go to the store later. She asked why, and I said I wanted to get some make-up to practice with. She agreed. When we got to the store, there were so many choices to choose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones. After we checked out, it was time to go home and practice! Sadly, my first lesson in make-up didnít go so well, but I asked my mom for some help and she said ìdon't worry, I know you'll catch on soon!î I wondered out loud why she was so patient with me, and she almost whispered, ìbecause anyone can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patience to learn it themselves.î
1302	19271	7	3	When my sister and I got into the checkout line at the grocery store, we heard impatient groans and sighs around us. Almost every line was extremely long and the whole store was packed. I groaned along with everybody else, annoyed at the long wait. My sister continued her cheerful whistling, and didnít seem to notice. ìSis, this is going to take forever!î I whined. ìDonít be so negative. Itís not that long,î she replied. I shot her a glare in response, but she just chuckled. ìHow about we play a game?î she suggested. We played eye spy for a few minutes as the line slowly progressed. After we finished our game, my sister made small talk and checked her list to make sure we had everything while I played a game on her phone. Soon, we were up next and I smiled in relief, realizing that it was a good thing my sister kept us occupied. As we walked out of the store, my sister said, ìSee, when youíre patient, you get food!î We both laughed and drove home.
1303	19272	7	3	Every year me and my entire family take a trip to the beautiful @LOCATION2 to the @LOCATION1 beach. Everyone in my family that goes is me, my mom and my dad, my little sister, my three cousins, my aunt and uncle and my grandparents. We all stay in one big hotel together, which usually has @NUM1 bedrooms. Out of the whole year we only stay for two weeks. So I have to be very patient the other three hundred and fifty one days. While we are there we fish for sharks and sting rays, hang out on the beach and swim in the ocean or the pool. So it is absolutely worth the wait. I always have a great time and now I wait patiently for next year.
1304	19273	7	3	I remember it all clear as glass ice. It was two summers ago when my mom, two brothers, and I went to @PERSON1 point. The car ride was about an hour and a half, maybe two hours. I was really excited about going on the new ride at @CAPS1 point- the @CAPS5. With nothing to do but listen to music and stare out the window, this car ride was turning into forever. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work back, doing things in order. This I didnít mind since we went on mostly big roller coasters with a few exceptions for rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how mad, fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the @CAPS5 since the line was nearly an hour and a half long. I guess that the line was to be expected considering that it was a new ride. After waiting for so long we finally got to the ride it. The @CAPS5 was amazingly epic. Finally, all of my patience had paid off, and I had a great day. The thrill of the @CAPS5 was worth the wait, and the memories made that day will last a lifetime.
1305	19274	7	3	Iím going to write about a time when my sister was being patient to go to the dentist. One day my mama said she was going to take my little sister to the dentist. My sister was so happy. Also my mama had to go to other places to. First, we went to costland mall to get me a homecoming dress. After that, we had to go to shoe depot get me some shoe. Third, I went to go get my hair done. Last, we were on our way home but I told my mama my little sister had to go to the dentist. When we got to the dentist, we had to wait @NUM1 min. I told my little sister @CAPS1.M.G this whole day you have been patient. I couldnít do that. My sister sat quietly, playing with the toys in the waiting room, and not once did she complain or get restless. It made me realize just how mature and understanding she was for her age. I was truly impressed by her ability to remain calm and composed throughout the long day of errands and appointments. Her patience at the dentist's office was the cherry on top, showing me that even the youngest members of our family can teach us valuable lessons in patience and grace.
1306	19275	7	3	Why wasnít my uncle there yet? I was waiting at his house to go hunting, but he was taking too long. Impatient, I headed to the tree stand alone. The ladder was old and rickety, but I climbed up anyway. As I aimed at a magnificent buck, I missed my shot and the gun fell, causing me to fall and get trapped under my back. I learned the hard way to be patient and wait for my uncle before acting impulsively. Patience is indeed a virtue, and rushing into things can lead to trouble.
1307	19276	7	3	So one day in fifth grade, I was running around playing tag on the playground when I got pushed off the slide. I fell and hurt my arm, causing me a lot of pain. My parents took me to the doctor's office, and after waiting for two hours, I finally got called in. The doctor informed me that my arm was broken, but they couldn't put a cast on it there. We had to go to another doctor across the street, where I waited for around 30 minutes before getting a blue cast.  About a month later, I had the cast removed, only to find out that I needed to have it put back on. This time, I got a red cast, and eventually, it was removed for good. That experience taught me the importance of being patient, even when faced with challenges.
1308	19277	7	3	The time I was patient was when I went to the FBI. My dad went there for training that lasted around three months. The ceremony for those who completed the program was quite crowded, and we had to dress up for the occasion. Sitting through the awards for people we didn't know, complete with long speeches, tested my patience. Finally, when my dad received his award, all the waiting was worth it. It was a proud moment, and we could finally leave after what felt like an eternity of waiting. That experience taught me the value of patience in achieving something worthwhile.
1309	19278	7	3	"Go! Coach yelled. The soccer team and I were running sprints to get warmed up for our game today. The day was planned, first soccer then my friend's birthday party. I could hardly wait. That's when I felt a raindrop pound down on my head. Before I knew it, I felt another, and another, and another! Suddenly, it had started pouring. The team and I rushed under a nearby awning. ""Oh no!"" The thunder nearly shook the ground. Finally, the refs came over and announced, ""the game has been delayed."" I sighed and slouched down on a picnic table. I knew now I would have to be patient if I wanted to get through today. There we sat under the awning as rain slammed down on the roof and thunder cracked. ""Would I make it to the party now?"" I thought. More thunder came. It had to go 30 minutes without thunder for the game to resume. We were already on minute 27. Even the slightest bit of thunder and we would need to start back at 30. We were now at minute 29. We listened closely until we heard a crack from far north. Frustrated, I said, ""Come on!"" The team began to count the minutes again. Finally, after the longest 30 minutes of my life, there was no sign of thunder or rain. The game was back on! The team and I sprinted onto the field. We played our hardest that game but, sadly, we lost 2-1. We walked off the field with our white socks and jerseys splattered with mud. Every one of us was sopping wet. My mom gave me the ""hurry up"" look and I quickly ran to the car. ""I will still make it to the party, but I will be just a few minutes late and I'll have to change in the car,"" I said to myself. As I sprinted through the wet grass, I heard my coach yell from behind me, ""Have fun at your party, and thanks for being so patient!"" I smiled and replied, ""Thanks, coach!"" That day, I realized that being patient is a good quality to have. Many people appreciate it when you are understanding and don't complain during difficult times."
1310	19280	7	3	On the way back home from the doctor's appointment, I was getting annoyed about being stuck in traffic. I did not want my mom to get even more annoyed, so I tried my best to be patient. Every once in a while, I would play with the buttons on the seat to pass the time. As more minutes passed, my impatience grew, but I still tried to stay calm. Finally, when we arrived home, I went straight to bed to relax and unwind after a long day.
1311	19281	7	3	A time I had to be patient was when my dad was waiting to get the money for our chiuahua. It was a frustrating situation as my dad had sold his guitar to his uncle to get the money, but it still hadn't come through. I had to go to swim practice and try to be patient while waiting for my dad to get the money. Finally, after a few days of waiting, my dad called to say he wouldn't get the money until a later date. Despite my frustration, I tried to remain patient. Eventually, the day arrived, and we finally got our chihuahua. It had been a week of waiting, but seeing the puppy made me realize that my patience had been worth it.
1312	19282	7	3	Being patient is crucial for success in various aspects of life, including school and relationships with parents. In school, patience is essential when dealing with teachers, as they play a vital role in educating and preparing students for the future. By being patient and understanding towards teachers, students can effectively learn and progress in their academic journey. Additionally, patience is necessary when interacting with parents, as they provide valuable guidance and support. By showing tolerance and listening to their advice, individuals can acquire important life lessons and skills that will benefit them in the long run. Ultimately, practicing patience in these relationships is key to personal growth and overall success in life.
1313	19283	7	3	Once I knew a girl named @ORGANIZATION1 and met another girl named @PERSON1. They had been inseparable until high school. @ORGANIZATION1 had gotten many more friends and started becoming very popular. @PERSON1 called @ORGANIZATION1 everyday to see how she was and if she wanted to hang out. @ORGANIZATION1 kept lying to @PERSON1, saying she was busy and always blowing her off. But one day, @ORGANIZATION1 had a very bad day and when she tried to tell her new friends about it, she apologized for how she had been acting. @ORGANIZATION1 learned that @PERSON1 was a true friend and was patient through the bad times. This shows that if you are truly patient, only good things can come.
1314	19285	7	3	"One time I got in trouble for getting a @CAPS1 on my report card and my mom said I was grounded. I asked her how long I would be grounded. So I went upstairs to read a book. An hour later I came down and asked. How long am I grounded? She said I don't know how many times do I have to ask you to tell. So I was bugging her all day. She said I am running out of patience. I said can you just tell me she said okay. She pulled out a sheet of paper. I said what is that? She said I counted how many times you asked me. Twelve times, ""yikes""! My mom said twelve days and that is final, I said okay. I think I learned a lesson today - don't bug your mom all day and do better in school!"
1315	19286	7	3	"One sunny day, I went out driving my car when suddenly my mom called out to me. She mentioned she was going to buy me something new in town, and instructed me to stay home. I waited patiently for her return, passing the time by playing PlayStation for a few hours. Later, I watched a movie called ""Assassin"" before returning to my game console for another hour. As I was engrossed in my game, I heard the familiar sound of my mom's car pulling up outside. Excitedly, I rushed out to greet her and was thrilled to see my new quad bike. I eagerly took it out for a long ride, enjoying the experience for several hours straight. In the end, I felt a sense of pride in my patience and was grateful for the new addition to my belongings."
1316	19287	7	3	Patient I have also practiced patience in various other situations, such as waiting for my turn to speak in a group discussion or patiently listening to others during a conversation. Patience has helped me maintain a calm and composed demeanor in challenging situations, allowing me to think rationally and make sound decisions. It has taught me the value of perseverance and endurance, enabling me to overcome obstacles with a positive attitude. Overall, patience has been a valuable trait that has benefited me in both personal and professional aspects of my life, and I will continue to cultivate this virtue to navigate through life's uncertainties with grace and resilience.
1317	19289	7	3	I am going to tell you all about a time when I had to use patience. I had to use patience when I was waiting for my friend to fix my x-box. My friend was taking forever when he tried to fix the x-box. All I did was sit in a chair and watch him. He finally got the x-box fixed after about seven or eight hours. Once me and my friend began to play the game it broke again. So then we had to take the game to a repair shop and have them look at it. I had to have patience because if I didn't I would have been really bored. Once the repair shop looked at the system they told us that they would have to take it and then look at it. It took them almost four days to fix the system and return it to me, so I had to have patience so the system could be delivered. Patience is a very necessary thing in life. Now you know all about a time in my life when I had to have patience.
1318	19290	7	3	ì@CAPS1 onî. Said my little brother. @CAPS2 line is tacking forever. ì@CAPS2 is the last time we are coming on @CAPS2 rideî. The ride that we were on was space mountain at @ORGANIZATION1 land in @LOCATION1. As we got into line at the ride there was a sign I have and @NUM1 min wait from @CAPS2 point. It was hot and it felt like I was walking a mile. The line would not go any faster. My older brother was happy for some reason. No one could understand we were standing in line in @NUM2 weather. I was being as patient as I could be; I just stood in line, wishing, hoping to somehow we could get on sooner. The first hour went by and another sign came up @NUM3 hour from @CAPS2 point. We all got mad. The walkway sounded silent. I know that everyone could hear a pin drop as a drop of sweat hit the ground. Everyone being patient. Finally, we waited @NUM4 hours to go on just @NUM3 ride. That was the first time I was that patient. After enduring the long wait, the exhilaration of the ride made it all worth it.
1319	19291	7	3	I decided to be patient and wait until we reached our destination before addressing my needs again. I occupied myself by looking out the window, playing with the dog, and listening to music. Despite feeling uncomfortable and hungry, I remained calm and composed throughout the journey. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, we arrived at @LOCATION1. My patience had paid off, and I was able to enjoy the rest of the trip without any further issues. It taught me the value of patience and how sometimes, waiting for the right moment is the best course of action.
1320	19292	7	3	One sunny afternoon, I was eagerly anticipating seeing my favorite band after school. My excitement was palpable as my mom picked me up from third grade. My dad dropped off my brother at my grandma's house, as he was too young to come along. I couldn't sit still in the car, constantly asking my mom when we would arrive.  After what felt like an endless journey, we finally reached the venue. Despite being a bit tired, I was determined not to miss a moment of the concert. As the band began to play, my exhaustion caught up with me, and I found myself struggling to stay awake. However, I had waited all day for this moment, and I wasn't going to let sleepiness get in the way of enjoying the music I loved.  In the end, my patience paid off, and I was able to see my favorite band perform live. It was a day filled with excitement and anticipation, and I was grateful for the experience, even if it meant battling sleepiness. The wait was worth it, and I cherished every moment of the concert.
1321	19293	7	3	I remember the time when I had to be so patient, it wasnít even funny. I had to be patient to get my new cell phone. My mom told me I was going to get one when the school year started. I waited and waited until the school year started but my mom told I would have to wait another week because she didnít have the money from all the school supply shopping she had done. So I waited another week. I was so excited when I remembered that my parents plan a trip to the beach that weekend, so I had to wait another week. It was on the following Friday when I was at my cousinís house and my mom came in and surprised me with my new phone and I was so happy that I finally got it. So I guess you can get cool things when you are patient.
1322	19294	7	3	One Christmas about a year or two ago, we drove up to my grandparents' house in Coldwater, which took about three hours. All my relatives on my dad's side were gathered there, and the excitement of opening presents filled the air. Despite my eagerness, I had to patiently wait for the adults to go first. They took their time, savoring each gift they unwrapped. Then, it was finally the kids' turn. My younger cousins fumbled with their gifts, taking their sweet time. When I finally got to open my presents, the wait was well worth it. I received an Xbox and a generous sum of money, making it a Christmas to remember. Patience truly paid off that day.
1323	19295	7	3	Patient is a valuable virtue that can sometimes be challenging to uphold. It is evident in individuals who wait their turn without complaint, displaying politeness and consideration for others. Those who lack patience often exhibit impatience, disrupting the flow for everyone else. On the contrary, patient individuals may appear quiet or reserved, not easily agitated by interruptions or raised voices. Cultivating patience can lead to stronger relationships, both with family and friends, fostering a harmonious environment. In essence, practicing patience contributes to a fulfilling and well-rounded life.
1324	19296	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the book store and I wanted a book called Taylor Swift: Back at the @LOCATION1 as a school girl. My mom told me to be patient, and if I waited, she would buy it for me. I was thrilled because I love Taylor Swift and her story. When I finally got the book, I couldn't wait to start reading it. I thanked my mom for buying it and she thanked me for being patient. Later on, I asked my mom if we could go to the book store again, but she said not today. I kept asking, and she eventually said maybe. When we went to the mall, there was a book store, and I asked if I could look around. My mom agreed, and I found the book I wanted. She bought it for me, and I was grateful for her patience with me. This experience taught me the importance of being patient and not constantly asking for things.
1325	19297	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went hunting. I know that at any moment, the opportunity of a lifetime could walk out within shooting range. I remember the first time I shot a deer with my dad. I sat there patiently, waiting for a deer to come within range. Then, I heard the leaves crunching, and there it was - the deer I was going to shoot. I drew back my bow and took the shot. I could feel the arrow gliding through the air as it hit the deer with a thud, causing it to take off. I remained in my tree stand, eagerly waiting for my prize. My dad and I tracked the deer for about half an hour before finally finding it. The excitement and satisfaction I felt at that moment were indescribable. It was a true testament to the power of patience and hard work in hunting. Thank you for reading my story, I hope you enjoyed it.
1326	19298	7	3	Patience is a virtue that can be quite challenging to maintain, especially in situations where others are intentionally trying to provoke a reaction. In a personal anecdote, the author describes a scenario where their sister was attempting to anger them, but they managed to stay calm and composed throughout the ordeal. Despite the sister's persistent attempts to annoy and upset them, the author chose to ignore the provocations and maintain their composure. This display of patience and self-control ultimately prevented a potentially volatile situation from escalating further. By choosing not to engage with their sister's attempts to incite a reaction, the author was able to diffuse the tension and avoid any unnecessary conflict. This story serves as a reminder of the power of patience in navigating difficult interpersonal relationships and diffusing potentially volatile situations.
1327	19300	7	3	"I am writing about when someone was patient. My mom was patient when she did not get her money that day. She wanted it to come, but it did not, so she was mad for a minute. The next day it arrived, and I told her, ""I told you mommy, it was coming today."" She had been patient by not calling the people and asking them where her money was. The next day, the money arrived, and we went to the mall. Everyone was happy, including me, my brothers, and sisters."
1328	19301	7	3	I remember when I went to visit my step-grandmother for a weekend and went fishing. I didnít really want to do it because I am a very impatient person. The creek we were going to fish in was right behind her house. I grabbed a fishing rod and went into the ëbackyardí. I flung my fishing line into the water and waited. After maybe 10 minutes of nothing (except my sister who caught most things), the line finally started to move. Excited, I jumped out of my seat, knocking it over, and grabbed the reel. Twisting and twisting the handle for what seemed like forever, I brought it up. The fish was small compared to what my sister caught seconds later. My step grandmother threw the fish back. After another 10 minutes, I became frustrated and went to swim. After an hour of swimming, I went back to my rod and decided to be more patient. I waited until my line started moving and I got up, and twisted the reel faster than before. Iíd caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat down and waited an entire hour for my line to move. I then caught another fish. Happy, I dropped my rod and told my step grandmother. My patience led me to catching the biggest fish of the day and learning something new.
1329	19302	7	3	Patience is the ability to wait without complaining or giving up easily. It is a virtue that shows respect for oneself and others. For example, standing in line for hours to get tickets to see a favorite band demonstrates patience. Without patience, the world would be chaotic, with everyone rushing and no one willing to wait their turn. It is essential for maintaining order and harmony in society. Therefore, it is important for everyone to practice patience in their daily lives.
1330	19303	7	3	I was patient when I had a doctor's appointment. My mom and I had been waiting almost an hour for them to call me. Twenty minutes later, the nurse calls me and apologizes for the wait, thanking me for being patient. Afterwards, my mom took me to get something to eat, and we waited at the drive-thru for another 15 minutes before they handed us our food. Again, we were thanked for our patience. It was a long day of waiting, but being patient paid off in the end.
1331	19304	7	3	This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 right then and there. My mom did not complain; she waited with patience. Patience does not mean you keep begging; it means that you are understanding and tolerant.   If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait for that pizza. When you have patience, people will have patience with you. For example, if you were watching TV and didn't want to get up yet, people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does not mean you keep asking.   For example, I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 begging my mom for candy. If I had patience and waited for her answer, I would have gotten the candy. But I didn't. This is my story and what patience means to me. Remember, having patience not only helps you, but it also fosters understanding and respect in your relationships with others. So, practice patience, and watch how it positively impacts your life.
1332	19305	7	3	A person I know that is patient was my old teacher named @PERSON1. He was a very patient man although we got on his nerves. It we didnít understand a question that he explained a million times he was still patient. Even when we got attitudes with @PERSON1 he was still a patient man. I think @PERSON1 was determined to be patient with us as he must of prayed because he was always patient with us through thick and thin. @PERSON1 was the most patient teacher and person Iíve ever met.
1333	19306	7	3	Patience, waiting, that's the main word that comes to mind when I hear it. I remember a time when I had to be extremely patient during meap testing. It was a day when we had to be completely silent, which was already difficult for me. To make it even harder, I was sitting next to my friends, and being a girl, we all know how hard it is to be quiet when we're together. I dreaded the meap writing portion the most, as writing was never my strong suit. However, I managed to stay patient and focused, completing the test and feeling a sense of accomplishment when it was over. My patience paid off, not only for myself but also for the rest of the students in the room. It was a challenging experience, but it taught me the value of patience in difficult situations.
1334	19307	7	3	Patient can be a very hard thing for me to have at times. For example, when I go to resturaunts when we wait for our food I get board very easially. On time when I had a sore ankle from an injury in soccer. A couple months later, it still hurt in the same spot. my mom set up an appointment with my doctor. When I did go to the doctor she felt for a lump or fracture in my ankle and said ìI donít think there is anything wrong, but we wonít be sure.î she sent my mom and me to the urgent case out on @NUM1 with a note that said I needed an x-ray. After about a twenty five minutes car ride, we were there. When the kind lady checked us in we waiting in the x-ray waiting room. My mom texted my sister saying we would be a while. I had to have patient because we were waiting there for a whole hour! Clearly, this was a time I had to have patience because I was already nervous about a possible broken ankle. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the results came in and fortunately, there was no fracture found. My patience was tested, but it paid off in the end as I was relieved to know that my ankle was okay.
1335	19308	7	3	Being patient is a wonderful thing to be. Here is an example of me being patient for my birthday. My birthday was coming and I was extremely happy. I would always backtrack of my days so I had a personal calendar for counting down to it. After that I made lots of birthday lists. I went to stores to see what they had. For an example, I saw this beautiful short that had a matching belt. @NUM1 days before my birthday I would not eat. I also went to @LOCATION1 and check out all the wonderful cakes. The day came and we went shopping for all the stuff I wanted. I conclude I was patient.
1336	19310	7	3	A time I was patient was when I had to be patient for having a difficult task without any help. It was so hard, as not even a college student could finish it within the given time frame of one hour. The task was from @ORGANIZATION1, the hardest math test I had ever encountered. I needed three hours to complete it, but I had no choice but to remain patient and work through the challenge. Despite the frustration and difficulty, I persevered and eventually managed to finish the test. This experience taught me the value of patience and determination in overcoming obstacles.
1337	19311	7	3	ì@CAPS1, how much longer.î I complained at the airport, ì@CAPS2 have been waiting for about two hours now.î ì@CAPS3 will only be a couple more minutes sweety.î replied my @CAPS1 in a stern voice. ì@CAPS3 better take only a few minutes because I really want to go to @CAPS5 world.î I complained again. As you might know now, @CAPS2 are in an airport full of people. @CAPS2 had to wait for six hours before our flight took off for @LOCATION1. @CAPS3 took a lot of patience that I thought I never had. In the first hour of waiting, I was really really bored. I had nothing to play with besides my gameboy @CAPS6. The gameboy @CAPS6 is a boxy looking object that folds open. There is a screen on the top and controls on the bottom half. That was my only fun that I could use to keep me busy and not fall asleep. I was very bored. But thankfully I found a @CAPS8.V. that they had at the airport. @CAPS2 went over to the @LOCATION2 to watch, but the only channel @CAPS2 could watch was the news. I did not like watching the news at all so I played my gameboy. I played that for about an hour. I didní@CAPS8 say anything to my @CAPS1 the past two hours or three hours. I didní@CAPS8 want to bug her so I left her alone. When the next hour passed,@CAPS2 boarded our plane finally. @CAPS2 waited a total of @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes. @CAPS3 was a painful but memoriable experience. When @CAPS2 boarded the plane and found our seats my @CAPS1 said to my brother and me that she was very proud of our patience. To this day I realize why my @CAPS1 and dad doní@CAPS8 like to fly to places any more.  After the long wait, we finally boarded the plane and embarked on our journey, leaving behind the hustle and bustle of the airport. The experience taught me the value of patience and the importance of making the most out of every situation, even when faced with boredom and delays. Despite the challenges, the memories created during the journey will always remain etched in my mind, serving as a reminder of the strength and resilience we possess when faced with adversity.
1338	19312	7	3	"@CAPS11 was @DATE1. @CAPS11 was almost time for @CAPS1 birthday. @PERSON1 was going to be six years old. He was helping his @CAPS6 made his birthday cake. After they were done making the cake mix, @CAPS1 @CAPS6 put @CAPS11 on into a cake pan. She put the pan into the oven for @NUM1 hours. I can't wait for my sufer yammy chocolate birthday cake to be done!' said @PERSON1. A 'few minutes later @PERSON1 asked if his cake was ready. '@CAPS3 @PERSON1 said @PERSON1 @CAPS6, '@CAPS4've  still got about @NUM2 hours and @NUM3 minutes you're your cakes done"" ""@CAPS5 that @CAPS4'll take for ever"" whined @PERSON1 ""You've got to use your patience @PERSON1 "" she said."" @CAPS6 whats patience?"" @PERSON1 asked ""patience is waiting for something without complaining @CAPS11"" explained @PERSON1 @CAPS6. ""@CAPS7 you can do something @CAPS9 the time passes by faster. Like play a game, ride your bite, play with your friends, or play in the sand boy. "" "" @CAPS8, "" said @PERSON1, "" I 'll go do something else.' @CAPS9 @PERSON1 went down stairs to play his video games. When he was done play his video games, he checked the oven to see how much time has gone by. There was two hour and thirty minutes left. @CAPS9 @PERSON1 decided to go out and ride his bike. He put on his helmet and got on his two wheeler bycicle. He went for a ride on the neighborhood trails. He saw his friend and joined them on their bike ride. After their bike ride @PERSON1 asked if them if they want to go play in the sand box. They all said yes. @CAPS9 they went to the backyard and played in the sand box. @PERSON1 and his friends all made this huge sand kingdom. @CAPS11 had big castles and @CAPS11 had a trench all around @CAPS11. @CAPS11 took up the entire sand box. @PERSON1 went inside to ask how much time was left on the oven."" @CAPS6 how much time is on the oven?""  asked @PERSON1 "" Only five more minutes ,"" said his @CAPS6, "" you should take that time to brush off all that sand. I see you and your friends are covered in @CAPS11. And when your done you can invite them in for a piece of cake. When @PERSON1 and his friends were done getting the sand off of them they all went inside and hold a piece of cake. After everyone finished their cake they all said,"" @CAPS11's the best cake ever!"""
1339	19313	7	3	"""Come on, let's go!"" I yelled excitedly as we entered my favorite amusement park, Cedar Point. ""Settle down, Sarah,"" my friend told me with a laugh. ""I'm coming,"" she added. The drive from our hometown of Cleveland to Cedar Point wasn't too long, but it always felt like a special trip.  After getting our tickets, we eagerly planned out our day. I couldn't wait to hit the roller coasters, especially the Top Thrill Dragster. The adrenaline rush from coasting through the sky always made my heart race.  As we made our way through the park, we tackled ride after ride. From the Mantis to the Millennium Force, we experienced the thrill of each one. But I was saving the best for last - the Top Thrill Dragster.  The line for the Top Thrill Dragster was long, but I knew it would be worth it. As we inched closer to the front after a four-hour wait, my excitement grew. Finally, it was our turn to buckle up and feel the rush of the wind as we soared through the sky. The wait may have been long, but the experience was unforgettable.  As we left Cedar Point at the end of the day, I couldn't help but smile. It was a day filled with laughter, excitement, and unforgettable memories. And even though the wait for the Top Thrill Dragster was long, it was absolutely worth it. Cedar Point will always hold a special place in my heart as my favorite amusement park in the world."
1340	19314	7	3	About midday, my family and I were on our way to a destination that remains unspecified. Despite the anticipation building up, I made sure to pack all my essentials and gear, eagerly looking forward to the adventure ahead. Once we were all set, we loaded everything into our trusty old car and hit the road. As the journey progressed, my impatience grew, and I couldn't help but inquire about our arrival time. However, my excitement soon gave way to exhaustion, and I drifted off to sleep. At one point, my brother mischievously tried to wake me from my slumber, but I remained oblivious to his antics. Eventually, we made a pit stop at a gas station, where my mom attended to some necessities, and I awoke to the realization that we were nearing our destination. Despite the delays, I remained optimistic about the adventures that awaited us at our final destination, eager to make the most of our time together as a family in the midst of our journey. Patience proved to be a virtue as we continued our travels, looking forward to the experiences that lay ahead.
1341	19315	7	3	I am going to write a story about patience. Patience is when you wait for somebody to do something. One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really waited them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inamate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to ruch it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, (which can happen it @MONTH1 end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, it @MONTH1 end up happening faster though. You might also waight for nature too, such as a sunny day. When it @MONTH1 have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during storm. It, for me, have really wanted the power to come back on during a storm because there is nothing to do!!! Patience is also about waiting for your ??? like when you are bored. Patience can be challenging, but it is a virtue that often leads to better outcomes in the end. So, next time you find yourself waiting for something or someone, remember that good things come to those who wait.
1342	19316	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I broke my thumb. I was patient because I wasn't complaining about it or crying. I really wasn't doing anything because I didn't think it was even broken. It didn't bother me much. Then I went to the doctor and got it checked. The doctor didn't think it was broken because I almost beat him in a thumb wrestle, but he x-rayed it just in case. When he came back with the x-rays, he said it was broken. He was very surprised, I was surprised, everyone was surprised.
1343	19317	7	3	This past weekend, my family and I went to Flagstaff. While we were there, we visited the ski slope. When we reached the top, I was scared of falling. Despite my fear of heights, I could see Flagstaff and the surrounding area from up there. The altitude made me feel dizzy, and I ended up throwing up. Going down the slope made me feel better temporarily, but I still felt queasy afterwards. Despite the unpleasant experience, I was grateful for my mom's support. The next day, we visited the organization and had a much better time. Overall, it was a challenging day, but I was able to enjoy the rest of the trip.
1344	19318	7	3	Sometimes it's hard to be patient, especially when you have to be tolerant of little kids. Well, I have to do that sometimes when I go to visit my eight-year-old cousin. She gets on my nerves with her dumb questions and silly behavior. I don't really like her at all. My mom always says that we will be best friends when we grow up, but I highly doubt that. However, for now, I have to deal with her and be patient. Maybe in the future, we might become friends, but who knows.
1345	19319	7	3	Once when I was patient, we experienced delays in Green Bay when trying to get into our accommodation. It took an incredibly long time, causing frustration when we finally gained access, only to realize it was already late according to our time. The following day, tensions rose at the toy store as my sister and mother disagreed on the choice of a new van. Despite my family's preference for a white van, my mother and sister opted for a silver one, resulting in a decision that left some of us dissatisfied. The process of obtaining the silver van further added to the displeasure, making the journey back home a frustrating experience overall.
1346	19320	7	3	Patience is the way to being an exceptional individual. Patience is waiting calmly for something, even if it takes a long time. If you can wait without becoming frustrated or angry, you possess the quality of patience. By cultivating this habit, you can lead a fulfilling and content life.
1347	19321	7	3	The first time I learned patience was when I was a child. My mom promised to buy me a toy that I really wanted, and I had to wait for it. I waited anxiously, day after day, until a whole month had passed with no sign of the toy. I felt frustrated and upset, but I continued to wait. Finally, after a long period of waiting, we went to the store, and my mom bought me the toy. I was overjoyed.  Later on, I asked for a more expensive gift, an Xbox. My mom told me to wait, and so I did. Months went by, and still, there was no sign of the Xbox. I started to feel angry and impatient, but I remembered the lesson I had learned before. I continued to wait, even when it felt like forever. After a year had passed, I finally received the Xbox. It was a moment of pure joy and satisfaction.  Through these experiences, I learned the value of patience and the rewards it can bring. Waiting may be difficult, but it teaches us important lessons and makes the eventual reward even sweeter. As I grew older, I realized that patience is a virtue that can lead to great things in life.
1348	19322	7	3	"Oh I have a great story about patience! One day, I was at my grandparents' house. There were my two brothers, my little sister, my grandparents, and myself present. My grandma was ready to serve up ice cream when suddenly, my brothers and sister started yelling, ""I'm going first, I'm going first!"" My grandma asked, ""Who's first?"" I responded by saying, ""I'm not being a part of this!"" I thought to myself how long is this going to go on since this was getting a little crazy. I said, ""Everyone get in line!"" They were like ok. So, patiently, everyone got in line and took their turn choosing what kind of ice cream they wanted. And what a choice we had - vanilla, strawberry, mint, or cookie dough ice cream. Everyone settled down and enjoyed their ice cream cone. It was a lesson in patience and everyone learned to wait their turn and enjoy the sweet treat together."
1349	19323	7	3	I was patient when I was going to the doctor's to get a check-up. I didnít complain about it. I had to wait for two hours. Then when I went in, they took a couple of X-rays. It took about another hour. After that, they conducted some tests. Finally, after a long wait, I was able to go home. That was the time I displayed patience.
1350	19324	7	3	One time I was going hunting. We got to the woods early in the morning. When we found a spot to sit on the ground, we planned to stay in the woods until dark or until we reached our limit of deer. As the hours passed, we remained still and quiet, waiting for the perfect opportunity.  As the sun began to set, we spotted a doe in the distance. We carefully aimed our gun, but it quickly fled before we could take the shot. Undeterred, we stayed patient, knowing that more deer would likely appear. Eventually, a group of small deer came into view, but we decided to let them pass, waiting for a bigger catch.  With only a few minutes left until dark, a larger doe emerged. Although it was initially out of range, we exercised patience and waited for it to come closer. Finally, the shot rang out, and the doe fell to the ground. Despite being wounded, it took some time before the deer succumbed to its injuries.  This hunting experience taught me the importance of patience and perseverance in the wild. By waiting for the right moment and remaining composed, we were able to achieve our goal successfully.
1351	19326	7	3	There are many ways to practice patience, such as waiting in line for lunch or patiently lining up to leave a room. One instance where I demonstrated patience was during a trip to go skating. Despite my eagerness to start skating right away, I remained patient as we went over the rules before entering the rink. I also waited calmly in line for skates without rushing or causing a commotion. By exercising patience throughout the outing, I was able to enjoy my time skating and leave feeling content with the experience.
1352	19327	7	3	Patience is a virtue that not everyone possesses. In a situation like waiting in a long lunch line at school, impatience can easily take over. However, learning to be patient can lead to positive outcomes. In this story, a friend's patience served as a reminder of the importance of waiting calmly. Eventually, the narrator was able to enjoy lunch with friends, realizing that patience pays off in the end. It's a valuable lesson to remember in moments of frustration – good things come to those who wait.
1353	19328	7	3	I was so bored during the flight that I decided to make the most of it. I was on a long-haul journey to an unknown destination, and time seemed to drag on endlessly. In an attempt to pass the time, I visited the bathroom multiple times, had lunch, played games on my phone, took a short nap, and before I knew it, we were about to land. Despite the initial boredom, the activities helped the journey go by faster than I had anticipated.
1354	19329	7	3	I was patient in gym class today for my skill test, and I did great by scoring the highest possible grade. There are three balls in my class, so the wait was quite long. When it was finally my turn, it took me half a minute to complete the test. We spent the entire class on the skill test, and I was looking forward to playing dodgeball afterwards. Unfortunately, we didn't get the chance to play dodgeball, so it felt like my time was wasted on the skill test. Despite this, I remained patient and focused. In the end, even though I missed out on dodgeball, I was proud of my performance on the skill test.
1355	19330	7	3	I had to be patient when I really wanted a new bike crank. To earn the money for it, I went to neighbors' houses picking leaves until I showed them I could shovel driveways. Over time, my hard work paid off, and I finally had enough money to buy the bike crank I had been dreaming of. It was tough to wait, but in the end, my patience and determination were rewarded.
1356	19331	7	3	"A day of dreadful patience - can we leave now @CAPS1? I'm so bored I complained. I waited for an answer but I guess he just resorted to ignoring me. We were here in @LOCATION1 waiting for these lazy people to load up his truck. Impatient guys. ""That's it, I'm gonna go talk to these guys and see what the whole holdup is. Wait here and don't touch anything,"" @CAPS1 said. So I sat here, cold, bored, and hangry, waiting for what seemed like hours. Finally, my @CAPS1 got back and told me it might be another @NUM1. The things impatient men resort to. We were sitting here and getting pretty impatient. We decided to just go and walk for a while. After we got some food, we went back to the truck. City slickers are just plain dumb. A forklift driver not somehow managed to get his forklift stuck in the trailer. That's when my @CAPS1 had it. He got out, and then all we heard were hollers and screams. Finally! After my @CAPS1 yelled a bit, we finally got back on the road. That day I learned that some thing I definitely don't have is patience."
1357	19332	7	3	The time I had to be patient was when I was at my first football game. I wanted to get in but I had to wait. I waited an hour to get in. The team was tied 14 to 14 and it was the fourth quarter and we were still winning. The coach had an injured player so he put me in. I ran so fast I tackled the guy with the ball, he tumbled, and I ran for the touchdown. If I wouldn't have been patient, I wouldn't have won the game because the coach wouldn't have put me in. That was the time I was patient.
1358	19333	7	3	One time I was patient was when I went to get my hair cut and the hairstylist told me to come at a certain time. However, when I arrived, there were several people ahead of me. Despite the delay, I remained calm and patient as I didn't have any other plans afterwards. I passed the time chatting with my best friend and texting our boyfriends. Eventually, the hairstylist apologized for the mix-up with the appointment time. Even though there were still a few people ahead of me, I continued to wait patiently. In the end, I was able to get my hair cut and the staff apologized for the inconvenience. Overall, it was a test of my patience, but I managed to stay composed throughout the wait.
1359	19334	7	3	To me, patience is one of the most important traits in a person. Being patient with others can lead to positive outcomes and rewards. I remember a time when my patience paid off when I needed a new hockey stick. After breaking my old one during a game, I visited the pro shop at the ice arena, only to find out they were out of stock. Determined to get the stick I wanted, I searched online and eventually ordered it. Despite the wait for delivery, which took a couple of weeks, I was thrilled when the new stick finally arrived. The satisfaction of obtaining what I wanted through patience made it all worthwhile. Patience truly does bring great things into our lives.
1360	19335	7	3	I have patient until @DATE1 vacation comes along. I try to do my best in school until @DATE1 arrives. For example, last year I was on the honor roll @NUM1 times. Over the @DATE1, if I have to do backlog work or show patience, then I will do it and I won't leave it until the last minute. Then, I'll wait until school starts again, which will be a fresh new year. I'll also wait until @DATE1 again. But in between, we have some breaks and days off. I think we already have enough assignments throughout the year, considering we go to school @NUM2 days a week. School can be really fun sometimes, for example, I look forward to field trips and school activities. However, we must be careful so that the principal doesn't take away our privileges. For instance, if our behavior is poor or we receive too many detentions, she'll revoke them. That means all of my patience will be for nothing. It wouldn't be fair because most of the time my classmates are the ones causing trouble.
1361	19336	7	3	A time when I was patient well it didnít just happened once it happends all the time. The time I am patient is when my mother is either talking or at the hair salon getting her hair done. Today I am going to talk about the time she goes shopping. When my mother goes shopping she brings all the females in my family my cousins, aunt, and grandmother. I either go in the mall with them, stay in the car or stay at home. I will talk about when go in the mall with them. They shop for at least eight hours max ten hours. They just donít go to one mall and stop they go to at least two mall three max. They go to a lot of strip malls too for exsample simply fashion and things like rainbow. They are going to a hundred place for at least eight hours my feet start to hurt and im getting hungry and tired but, I donít complain because I am being patient. Now we are in a mall I go to carry bags and go into a lot of females clothing stores like victoria @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2. Then shop for jewlery make up perfume and every woman item known to the world. Plus I get lost because they leave me. In conclusion I am very patient for my mother no matter what.   On these shopping trips, I find myself wandering through countless stores, carrying bags, and waiting patiently as my mother and the other women in my family browse through endless racks of clothing and accessories. Despite the fatigue and hunger that set in after hours of shopping, I never complain or rush them along. I simply stay by their side, offering my assistance and enduring the long hours with a smile. My patience during these shopping excursions is a testament to the love and respect I have for my mother and the other women in my family, making it a small sacrifice in exchange for quality time spent together.
1362	19337	7	3	Iím writing about a time when I was patient. Because I was about to go to a party in I had to be patient but I didnít  I had got angry in I just couldnít patients. In I also no someone who patient. They just couldnít wait they really couldnít  wait but I waited, waited, waited in I got mad I couldnít even wait no longer. I was actually was waiting on my aunt to come pick me up in she didnít @CAPS1 I called my mom in she said she was going to take me to the party In I was patient in she didnít come @CAPS1 I didnít go to the party in I was mad. Because my mama didnt come pick me up, @CAPS1 I calling my grandma and she came in pick up. That was the only time I was patient of learning. I learned that sometimes things don't go as planned, and it's important to be patient and flexible in those situations. Despite my initial frustration, I was able to adapt and find a solution, showing that patience can lead to positive outcomes in the end.
1363	19338	7	3	You have to be patient when you go on a trip. I was patient on my trip to Paris last summer. I had to be patient for six hours before me and my family arrived. The next day I had to be even more patient because we went to an amusement park. There I had to wait in very long lines, which is really hard to be patient. Is it hard for you to be patient? That's the story when I had patience.
1364	19339	7	3	"Itís about three o'clock the clock tells me, but I canít go to sleep because my friend and I are going fishing. So itís eight o'clock now, my friend was supposed to be here at seven, but my grandma kept saying heíll be here, so I believed her but I was a little worried. Now itís ten o'clock and Iím just furious, I am about to cry, but my grandma said heíll be here, and I said, ìMaybe he won'tî and went to my room. Then I realized he will be here, he will be here.   Then I heard the door open, I ran to it and it was him. I ran and said, ""You finally came!"" We ate, and then I looked outside and saw the boat. Thatís a time I should have patience."
1365	19340	7	3	I remember a time when I was young. It was Christmas morning, and I was the first one awake at home. I eagerly waited for everyone to come downstairs so we could start opening our presents. My brother and sister had a rule that the oldest would go first, so I had to be patient. Finally, it was my turn. Without even looking at the present, I excitedly ripped off the wrapping paper. That moment of pure joy and excitement is something I will always remember from my childhood. It was a time when I truly felt like a child.
1366	19341	7	3	Patients to me means trying your hardest to wait on someone or something. I remember one time when I was patient. Me and my organization went to the water park and we wanted to get on this water slide and it was a lot of kids and adults in line so we waited patiently. Then we finally were second in line. The kids in front of us offered to get in front of them but we turned them down. So we were waiting while the lifeguard was telling the boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slide. But the little boy fell off the tube thing, hit his head, and almost drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was scary, but we still went and had a great time. The experience taught me the importance of patience and how it can lead to positive outcomes, even in challenging situations.
1367	19342	7	3	"Clunk! I jolted in my seat as the rental car crashed into another pothole. ""Look who's awake,"" my mom remarked, sounding annoyingly cheerful. ""You slept for so long, I thought you might sleep until we got back home."" ""Where are we?"" I asked in a dreary voice. ""Ohio,"" replied my mom's friend. We were on our way to Florida for spring break, accompanied by my mom, her friend, and me. During our stay in Florida, we planned to visit my dad, who was working there. The trip promised to be memorable, but the car ride was already putting my patience to the test. It would take us a couple of days to reach our destination, with the third day being the most challenging as we drove through the mountains. I usually enjoy the scenery and twists and turns of mountain roads, but as we reached the peak, things took a chaotic turn. My sister began screaming in fear of the lack of guardrails, clutching my arm tightly, while I suddenly felt the urgent need to use the restroom. The combination of these events made the once pleasant ride feel like a never-ending rollercoaster. I thought to myself, ""I'm going to lose my mind, just make it stop."" Luckily, the chaos subsided as we pulled into a rest stop with bathrooms. If I hadn't remained patient during that mountain drive, I might have truly gone insane. The experience will forever be etched in my memory as a test of endurance and composure."
1368	19343	7	3	Today was the first day I was patient. I couldnít believe it. I was so proud of myself. This is how I was patient. I was in line waiting for ice cream and this teenage girl went up to the counter and said ì@CAPS1 you I have to be somewhere in ten minutes if you donít get this line moving then Iím going to have to talk to the waiterger. All the guy said ìIím so sorry but you will just have to waight until everybody that was in line in front of you gets there remain before youî. ì@CAPS2 are you kidding meî she yelled as she stopped way and thatís when I knew how ridiculous I looked when Iím inpatient so I waited in line until I got up to the counter and I said ìDo deal with a lot of people like that, because you handled the situation very calmly.î And he said yeah there are a lot of people that are like that around here it truly sad. So @CAPS2 would you like to order?î I told him my order and walked home as I walked home I felt so proud that Iím never gonna be inpatient again. I realized that being patient not only helps me but also makes things easier for others. It's a simple act that can make a big difference in how we interact with those around us. Patience truly is a virtue worth cultivating.
1369	19344	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my gymnastics meet to start. I had to wait two hours along with my team. We warmed up and stretched and were talking about who we thought would win the team trophy. We asked our coach if it was almost time to start. He said it was going to be another hour. So, we talked some more and practiced some skills for floor. We dida head-stand contest and did as much as we could to make the time go by. We asked our coach another half hour later and he told us it was going to be a half hour longer because they had to get another judge. Finally an hour later the judge got their and the coaches had their meeting and we started the meet. That is a time I was patient.
1370	19345	7	3	Iím going to write about when I was patience. One day I asked my mom if I could get a phone she said if I be patience I will be able to get a phone so I was patience. Time flew bye and family she sad yes see when I was patience to get a cell phone I got one. Have you ever been patience with your family? Tell me did it work out of did it go bad with your family if you are it probably will work for you.  And that is what happens when you are patience.  When we practice patience with our family members, it can lead to positive outcomes. By waiting for the right time and being understanding of others' perspectives, we can strengthen our relationships and achieve our goals. Patience is a valuable trait that can bring about harmony and understanding in our interactions with those we care about. So, next time you find yourself in a situation where patience is required, remember that it can lead to a more fulfilling and rewarding outcome for both you and your family.
1371	19346	7	3	ì@CAPS1 !Did it came yet!?î I yelled, sprinting home from the bus stop.  She was I n standing from the mail box, holding a thick wad of envelopes. One of these, I hoped was the letter. ì@CAPS2 yet honey,î she said ìbut thereís plenty of bills to go around.î I wanted to scream in exasperation, but I remembered what @CAPS3 said, ìjust wait long enough and youíll get what you want.î I trudged inside and plopped down on the couch. This letter meant so much to me. It said which advanced classes I would be in. It doesnít sound that important but only the elite could get in and this meant the world to me. I would be challenged, my parents would be so proud of me, and I would get @NUM1 bucks from grandma. See, you take a test at the end of school and wait the entire @DATE1 for results. Pretty good system, huh? No! Pretty soon, other things distracted me swim meets, tennis, book, and I learned that it helps to be patient, and time goes by a lot faster. @CAPS3 was right I guess. One @DATE2 @TIME1, on the @DATE1, I was on the porch reading. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the mailman. He shuffled around in his bag, and pulled out mail, put it in our mailbox and drove away. I leaped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox. I surveyed the mail quickly, until one envelope caught my eye. I ripped it open and sure enough, it read @PERSON1 has been selected for the following advanced classes: @CAPS4 studies @CAPS5 @CAPS6! My patience finally paid off!   I couldn't contain my excitement as I danced around the living room, waving the letter in the air. All the hard work and waiting had finally led to this moment. I couldn't wait to share the news with my family and friends. This was just the beginning of a new chapter filled with challenges and opportunities. I felt proud of myself for not giving up and persevering until the end. The letter was a validation of my efforts and a reminder that good things come to those who wait.
1372	19348	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was 7 years old on a snowy night. My parents were buying a new car, and it took a long time. Despite being hungry, I waited patiently while they talked to the car dealer. My siblings were playing nearby, keeping themselves entertained. Eventually, the car dealer brought us cookies and milk, which helped ease our hunger temporarily. My parents finally decided on a van with a DVD player inside, and we left the dealership. My father then took us to get something to eat at a fast-food restaurant.
1373	19349	7	3	I am always patient person until I sit for hours then I can oh patient person. My mom is patient too especially at the look were she workís. A lot of people we very rude to her. However, despite facing such challenges, she remains calm and composed, handling each situation with grace and professionalism. Her patience is truly admirable, and it serves as a reminder to me of the importance of remaining level-headed in difficult circumstances. I strive to emulate her patience in my own interactions, knowing that it is a valuable quality that can help me navigate through life's challenges with resilience and grace.
1374	19350	7	3	One day, just a few months ago, me, my brother, and my mom were waiting in line to buy school supplies. We were number @NUM1 and they had just called @NUM2. It was around @PERCENT1 out and we had to stand there. It was so long that the new battery I had just put in my calculator went dead. It took around @NUM4 hours just to get inside. Then, there were even more lines inside the store! We barely managed to get our things that day, but because we were patient, we did.
1375	19351	7	3	I didnít know where we were at. Then my dad told me, we were at this place called Buddies. Iíve never been there until that day. Then the waitress put us at a circular table. Then, she asked us if we would like anything to drink. I told our waitress I would like a diet Pepsi. My sister got a fruit punch. As always. My mom and dad got a Mountain Dew. My brother got cherry Pepsi. I donít know why we all got different drinks. It took a few minutes to get our drinks though. My dad wasnít so patient. He knew that the food will take forever. Finally our waitress came out with our drinks. She apologized for the wait. Then she took our order. The wait for that was a bit long. My dad was very impatient. I was the only patient one at our table. The restaurant wasnít even that busy. I told my dad to just be patient the food will be right out any minute. So we waited and waited. Finally, the food came out. We ate all the food, got the bill, then left. That was the time I was patient.
1376	19352	7	3	I am going to be writing about a time when I was patient. Me and my family were setting up decorations one day for my 10th birthday. I was so excited and jumpy. I was turning ten so it was a big deal for me. We already had the cake which was decorated in beautiful yellow and white frosting. It also had a picture of horses running on it. The party started at 2 pm. I was in my pretty pink flowered dress and putting streamers up. I kept asking what the time was, and my mom would just say to be patient. I had to wait. I was a very impatient girl. I was just so excited I couldn't wait. I then remembered that I was supposed to be patient so I was. I played games and read books while I was waiting for the guests. Then before I knew it, the doorbell rang and all my family came running in with presents and cards. I guess all that waiting really paid off. I also got some really cool presents. It was a wonderful birthday celebration that I will always remember.
1377	19353	7	3	Everyday at school, I have to wait patiently to get my food, like pizza, salad, sandwich, and milk. Sometimes the milk doesn't taste good, but I always check it before drinking. I also need to have patience when waiting to receive my lunch. It's not always easy, but being patient is important. Additionally, I have to be patient when it comes to getting my school supplies, like my pencil and notebook. Patience is a virtue that helps me throughout the school day, whether it's waiting for my food or waiting to use my school supplies. In the end, being patient makes everything run smoother and helps me stay focused on my studies.
1378	19354	7	3	Elkhorn Jr. High School, on @DATE1, @PERSON1 Colbonthorne was having a pretty bland day, feeling frustrated with being at school and longing to go home. His teacher reprimanded him to focus on his work, leading him to aimlessly flick eraser tops at the chalkboard to pass the time. After a series of eraser flicks, he checked the clock which showed @TIME1. @PERSON1 voiced his displeasure to the teacher, who warned him about the consequences of impatience.  Threatened with detention, @PERSON1 reluctantly settled down to complete his tasks for the day without further complaints. Finally, as the school day drew to a close, the teacher announced the end of the @ORGANIZATION1.
1379	19355	7	3	I waited patiently, my heart pounding with anticipation as I stood on the stage, surrounded by the bright lights that made it hard to see the audience. Beside me stood my best friend @CAPS1, while our competitors @PERSON2 and @CAPS2 stood on the other side. It all started when @PERSON1 announced a writing contest for the seventh grade, and @CAPS1 and I eagerly agreed to team up. We brainstormed ideas for our adventure story, and after days of hard work and collaboration, we had a ten-page masterpiece ready. The moment of truth arrived when the results were in, and to our delight, we tied for first place. The competition was fierce, but our perseverance paid off as we were declared the winners. As we accepted our trophy, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the journey that brought us to this moment. It was a reminder that hard work and patience can truly lead to great success.
1380	19356	7	3	One day I was patient of waiting for a game to arrive. I waited for years for it to come and then the day finally came. I started out the day like it was any other. However, as the day went on, the time seemed to drag by and the game still hadn't arrived. By the time evening came, I was so eager that I just sat on the front porch for the rest of the day, hoping it would show up. Unfortunately, it never came, so I just went to bed disappointed. The next day, I checked the mail again, but it was empty. Feeling dejected, I slumped onto the couch and watched TV. Suddenly, I glanced out the front window and saw a package lying there. It was my game! And that's the story of my patience.
1381	19357	7	3	Once I was at a @CAPS1 wings game waiting to get tickets. It was very long and boring. There were a lot of people in line that game. As much as I just wanted to go to the front of the line and get the tickets, I didnít because that would be rude. I felt that helped me develop my patience a little bit more. Plus I would not want people cutting in front of me in line. I learned that good things come to people who wait. Waiting in line not only taught me patience but also the importance of fairness and respect for others. It was a valuable lesson in self-control and consideration for those around me. Ultimately, the experience helped me grow as a person and understand the value of waiting for the right moment.
1382	19358	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was sitting at my house for hours waiting for my grandma to pick me up and go get my friend. I believe you should have a lot of patience so you get farther and wait for what you want. On that day, I resisted the urge to become frustrated as the minutes turned into hours. I occupied myself with activities to pass the time, knowing that my grandma would eventually arrive. Despite the delay, I remained calm and composed, understanding that patience is key in achieving my goals. Finally, when my grandma arrived, I was rewarded for my patience as I was able to enjoy a fun outing with my friend. This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of patience in achieving success and getting what you desire.
1383	19359	7	3	There were many times when I was patient. Maybe like waiting for a doctor appointment or waiting for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your homework. Maybe waiting days for your teachers to come and give your tests back. But today I am going to talk about when I had to be patient to get my first dog. It was last year when we went looking for a dog to adopt. We couldnít find the right one. It took weeks until we saw the cutest chihuahua. He was only one year old. We were rushing through the papers, scared someone else was planning to adopt him. When we turned them in, the lady said we had a back side too. After the paperwork, we had to wait another week because they had to fix him. My mom went shopping for dog supplies, and they told us we could pick him up on a specific date. We were so excited. Instead of that date, we thought we could pick him up earlier. On that day, we picked him up. It took years of patience for my sister and only a year for me. A year later, we went back to adopt or just look for another dog. We didnít find one, but we waited, and if you're patient, you will get something for that. We are still patient to maybe get another dog if our parents allow it.
1384	19360	7	3	I am patient at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teacher or someone else is busy, I will wait for however long I need to until they are available to help me. In any of my classes, I am patient most of the time. In art class, we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because I had to finish my project that was due the week before. When I started working on my box, I did as much as I could remember from the art teacherís demonstration.   When I needed help, I asked a friend who was done if they would help me get caught up, and they agreed. I waited patiently for them to assist me, even when someone else asked for help. It took the whole hour, but I remained patient. At the end of the hour, my friend wasn't finished, so she promised to help me the next few days. The following day, she helped me whenever she could, and I tried my best while waiting for her to assist me again.   Although my friend was almost done with her project, I continued to wait patiently for her help. When she finished, she assisted me with the rest of my box, and by the end of the hour, I completed it. The next day, we started a new project that was simpler. This was not the only time I demonstrated patience, but it was the longest instance where I remained patient with someone.
1385	19361	7	3	I canít really tell you about a time when Iíve been patient because that something I struggle with no matter how hard I try to be patient it just seems to be impossible but itís not, maybe. I just donít try hard enough, who knows. An example of how impatience I am is Iím at a store and I have five dollars and something I want is ten dollars I wonít save up for the ten dollar item. I will turn and most likely buy candys. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I canít spend it but I always end up finding it and spending it because it donít want to and until they give it back most the time that happened. I get grounded but item worth it because I get candy. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom say no I always sneak it and get in trouble.
1386	19362	7	3	Patience is the ability to wait for something, and it varies from person to person. Personally, I consider myself to be moderately patient. I have no issues waiting for the release of a pre-ordered game, which is scheduled to come out on @DATE1. However, I struggle with impatience when it comes to using the computer. Despite this, I was able to exercise patience when waiting to achieve my second-class rank. Overall, patience plays a significant role in various aspects of our lives, and it is essential to cultivate this virtue for personal growth and success.
1387	19363	7	3	A time I was patient was when I got my shots. It was just me and my dad. I had to get my shots because I was sick. It was still cold outside because it was in @DATE1. We went to the @ORGANIZATION1 for children. In the beginning, I was at home getting ready to go. I put on an orange turtle neck sweater and jeans with sneakers. I didnít want to go because it was after @CAPS1 and I had a lot of new games. It took us @NUM1 minutes to arrive. My dad filled out the information then we sat. In the middle, we start to watch television. I was really bored because it was nothing on but informercials. They had us waiting for over an hour. I start to get hungry and very upset. They finally called our name. In the end it was time to get my shot. The nice lady gave me a juice. Then she told me I was getting @NUM2 shots. I got my shots which took a very long time, I was frustrated, I got my shots, before we left they told me that I would be coming back for more shots. I was still hungry so we got @CAPS2.Donalds. In conclusion, I was very patient when going to get my shots. The information I got was just as painful as getting my shots. They had us wait for a very long time. I was sad to have to wait but happy it was over. Additionally, the experience taught me the value of patience and resilience in challenging situations.
1388	19364	7	3	I have experienced patients when I went to a medical conference in Chicago. It was a six-hour trip, we were in a small car and we were a little tired because we didnít sleep very well last night even though I brought a book & my Nintendo Switch game we were still pretty bored. All I did was watch trees after my battery died on my Nintendo Switch. Dad was concentrated on the road, mom was looking at license plates to pass the time. Once we got into Indiana, I started to drift asleep but my sister kept me up because she just finished a podcast and was explaining the whole thing. So I started reading my book. Even though you could hear mom, my sister, and my stomach growling, we didnít stop. We had to get to our hotel before 10 pm because that was when the hotel's front desk shut down. At 9 pm, we were cruising through the state of Indiana to then arrive at 9:45 pm at the hotel. We were so exhausted that we fell asleep within 15 minutes in the bed.
1389	19366	7	3	Being patient means being understanding and tolerant, even in difficult situations. I remember a time when I had to wait almost a week to go to a water park on my birthday. It was hard not to complain and be impatient, but I knew that being patient would make the experience even better. As the days passed slowly, I resisted the urge to voice my frustrations and instead focused on staying positive. Finally, when the day arrived, I had an amazing time at the water park. Being patient truly paid off in the end.
1390	19368	7	3	Being patient has its advantages, as it allows for good things to happen over time. I experienced this firsthand when I tried out for the dance team at my studio. Despite feeling nervous and unsure, I patiently waited for the results. When I finally received the call saying I had made the team, I was overjoyed and excited to start learning new dances and participating in competitions. Additionally, when I broke my arm, I had to exhibit patience during the healing process. By following the doctor's instructions and being careful, I eventually got the cast removed, and my arm healed properly. Patience truly does lead to positive outcomes, as seen in my experiences.
1391	19369	7	3	Once I went to @CAPS1 world and we were waiting for about @NUM1 hours to get on this stupid rude. I was they because I had my @ORGANIZATION1 so I played that but on to an hour I got bored. I picked on my sisters and it was on watching them get mad. Then I got bored with that so I just sat down on the road. As time dragged on, the anticipation for the ride waned, and boredom settled in. My initial excitement turned into restlessness, leading me to entertain myself by teasing my siblings. However, even that amusement soon lost its appeal, leaving me lethargic and disinterested. The hours seemed to stretch endlessly as I idled on the road, waiting for the ordeal to finally come to an end.
1392	19371	7	3	In my own words, patience involves maintaining a calm and quiet demeanor, rather than being hyper and annoying. It requires controlling oneself and not acting rudely or disrespectfully towards others. Patience is about being understanding and composed in challenging situations, allowing for better communication and problem-solving. It is a valuable quality that helps in building positive relationships and fostering harmony in various aspects of life. By practicing patience, individuals can navigate difficulties with grace and maturity, ultimately leading to more positive outcomes and personal growth.
1393	19372	7	3	One day at my sister's football game, my mom dropped us off since she had to go to work. She reminded me to bring money, but I had forgotten. As the game started, my hunger grew, and I searched my pockets, luckily finding some cash. However, the food line was incredibly long, almost extending into the street. I waited patiently, standing in line for about 20 minutes before finally getting my food. When my sister asked me to buy her fries, I hesitated due to the long line, but eventually gave in to her plea. Returning to the queue, I faced a slower-moving line and when I finally returned, my sister questioned my delay. I pointed to the never-ending line as my explanation. This experience taught me the value of patience in dealing with unexpected challenges.
1394	19373	7	3	I think patience is like somebody or someone is waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom then the other person can go to the bathroom. Like I am not in patience because I want to go a store now but they said wait your patience. My whole family is not in patience but my friends are. In such situations, it can be challenging to remain calm and composed while waiting for something or someone. It requires self-control and understanding to practice patience in various aspects of life. Ultimately, patience is essential for maintaining healthy relationships and achieving personal growth.
1395	19374	7	3	"A time when I was patience was on the car ride to my grandparents' house. It was a four-hour car ride but I stayed patient and didn't complain. Most kids would ask ""Are we there yet?"" repeatedly, but I remained calm and composed. Even when I started to feel hungry, I resisted the urge to whine or grumble. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, we arrived at our destination. That experience taught me the importance of patience and perseverance."
1396	19375	7	3	One day I was told we were going to @LOCATION1. We were getting there by this big fast boat called the jet express. So we had to wait in this big line. The boat was delayed so we were told it would be late. I shold of known I did not dress warmly and it was freezing. We were the first people in line so that was a good thing but I was being patient, I was not complaining or anything. When the boat finally arrived I was so relieved and my mom also thanked me for being patient and not complaining. That day turned out to be very nice and fun. As we boarded the boat, I couldn't contain my excitement for the adventure that awaited us at @LOCATION1. The breeze on the deck was refreshing, and the sights along the way were breathtaking. I was grateful for the experience and the lesson in patience that I learned that day.
1397	19376	7	3	When my friend was getting his meds, I waited patiently for him to get ready. Seated, I passed the time by scrolling through my phone, listening to the sound of @PERSON2's ping pong game in the background. I kept glancing around, searching for @PERSON1, anticipating his completion of the task at hand.
1398	19377	7	3	After enjoying the thrill rides, we decided to take a break and grab some lunch at one of the food stalls nearby. The hot sun beat down on us as we devoured our meals, replenishing our energy for more adventures. We explored the other attractions in the park, from the gentle carousel to the exciting water rides. As the day came to a close, we reflected on the fun we had and made plans to come back again soon. Spending time with my uncle at the amusement park was a day I would never forget.
1399	19378	7	3	Patience is indeed a virtue, as demonstrated in a recent visit to a fast food restaurant. Despite hunger pangs and frustration, the individual in the car exercised remarkable patience while waiting for their order. Even though the wait was excruciatingly long, lasting over two hours, they persevered and finally received their food. The reward for their patience came in the form of some free items, which helped alleviate the frustration of the extended wait. In the end, although the situation tested their patience, it ultimately paid off with a small reward.
1400	19379	7	3	It was a hot day when I decided to ride my dirt bike. I geared up and headed out, but my excitement turned into pain when I fell off the bike and injured my leg. My dad rushed me to the hospital, where we waited for hours before seeing the doctor. After an x-ray, it was determined that I had bruised my bone and needed to rest for a week. Back home, I relaxed on the couch, grateful for the care I received. That long day at the hospital taught me the importance of patience in times of need.
1401	19380	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I was awaiting to get into my basketball game I played for the destroyerís. So in all the gameís I always had to wait to the @DATE2. So in the @DATE1 game of the season I got in four times. In the first @DATE2 I got in for about one minute. the I got in for @NUM1 minutes in the @DATE1ís. I was happy but I still wasnít starting. then we got into the play offís I only got in two minutes throughout the whole entire game. At one point I was gonna quit but my teamateís came up to me and said donít worry your gonna your time to start everyone will. Over the next few monthís I waited patiently. Then we got in tournamentís then we split up the team with older people on one and the younger people on the other. Then I finally got in the starting lineup. I was so excited that I was in the playoffís then we lost at the championship game. That was a time I was patient.
1402	19381	7	3	Patient help is essential in navigating through life's challenges. My uncle learned this lesson firsthand when he had to wait patiently for a phone call for a month. Despite his initial frustrations, he eventually realized the importance of being patient. His perseverance paid off when he received the call informing him that he had been accepted into America's Next Top Model. This experience taught him the value of patience and how it can lead to positive outcomes in the end. It's a reminder that being patient is crucial in achieving our goals and finding success in life.
1403	19382	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didnít just count to ten, I counted a boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, it felt like an eternity. Counting bunch of coins wonít change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. I still remeber the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and l couldnít think l could make it because l admit to be a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I donít think that Iíll be able to count my coins again, but like they say, ìPatience is a virtue.î  Counting coins may seem like a trivial task, but the patience required to complete it is significant. It taught me the value of perseverance and the satisfaction that comes with seeing a task through to the end. Patience truly is a virtue that can lead to great rewards, no matter how small the accomplishment may seem.
1404	19383	7	3	"Sitting in the car waiting for @CAPS2 mom to get out of the house and into the car, I felt a sense of boredom creeping in. Once we were on our way to the party, the journey seemed to drag on endlessly. The constant screaming of @CAPS2 little sisters in the back only added to my frustration. As we made a stop at a gas station, I tried to maintain my patience, but it was wearing thin. Eventually, the girls fell asleep, providing a moment of relief. However, as they woke up asking, ""Are we there yet?"" my patience was tested once again. When we finally arrived at our destination, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. Despite trying to remain patient throughout the trip, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement when it was finally over. Next time, I hope for a smoother journey without the chaos that plagued this one."
1405	19384	7	3	Being patient is hard to be. First of all, it's like you're waiting in a long line that could take forever. Being patient at this line could take a long time, but it could go by fast if you had something to do. You could bring a book to read and pass the time while waiting in line or be patient and find ways to occupy yourself. Patience is indeed a virtue that can be challenging to practice, but with the right mindset and distractions, waiting can become more bearable. Ultimately, being patient is a skill that can be honed with practice and determination.
1406	19385	7	3	One time, when I was being patient, I got somewhere that I always like to go. This place is called @CAPS1 point. I always look forward to this place and once we get there, Iím very excited. One small downer to this place is called waiting. Another word would be being patient. Being patient is when you wait for someone or something. You have to be patient everywhere at @CAPS1 point like on the way there, getting a campsite, and also in lines. But in the end, itís all worth it because there is lots of fun after being patient. When we finally arrive at @CAPS1 point after patiently enduring the journey and waiting in line, the stunning scenery, thrilling activities, and joyful experiences make it all worthwhile. The excitement and enjoyment that follow being patient make the wait fade into the background, leaving only the happy memories of the time spent at this special place.
1407	19386	7	3	I remember the time when I went to the amusement park and I saw a little girl that was patient. When I got to the park I was so excited because it was my first time going there. It was so colorful and loud. I went on a few rides and then got hungry so me and my family went to go get some cotton-candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a little angle. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a millionth time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and oh no! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the ice cream stand and did the same exact thing! I couldnt watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her makes me amazed!
1408	19387	7	3	I know a time when I was patient. My friend @PERSON1 was coming back to the football field after we scored a grant @NUM1. We were gonna hang out. It was two and a half hours before he got there. When he arrived, we both exhibited patience in deciding what to do next. Despite the scorching sun and dry grass, we persevered through the day. Eventually, as the day progressed, we went our separate ways, knowing that we had exercised patience in our interactions. It was a testament to our friendship and ability to wait for each other.
1409	19388	7	3	"One time when I was patient my friend @PERSON1 went to the mall around @NUM1 am. @CAPS2 were supposed to be shopping for new school clothes. When @CAPS2 got there the sun was really bright up in the sky, the birds were chirping, and it was as hot as a @DATE1 day. When @CAPS2 both walked, hardly anybody was there, but @CAPS2 went to a store called ""Fashion Haven"", it was so full of people I thought I was at a concert. @CAPS2 had to wait in the longest line, it was so long people were almost at the doors. So @CAPS2 both waited and waited. Finally, @CAPS2 were at the front of the line and the cashier said, ""Hey, you have waited in the long line probably for about an hour. I will give you guys a 15% discount."" @CAPS2 went shopping and @CAPS2 got rewarded for being patient. They left the store feeling satisfied with their purchases and grateful for the discount they received."
1410	19389	7	3	A time that I was patience was last summer when I went to an amusement park. I was about to get in line to ride the roller coaster. I was at the beginning of the line and then I saw a sign that indicated a two-hour wait from that point. But I wasn’t that close to the sign, so for me, my family, and the others in the same spot as us, we most likely had to wait at least two and a half hours. It was a hot day, and I was wearing black, which probably wasn’t the smartest choice. I waited in line for about an hour, but I couldn't bear standing in that hot weather any longer. However, I really wanted to ride that roller coaster, so all I could do was wait for another hour and be patient. Eventually, I was about 10 minutes away from the ride, and the line seemed to move quicker as people ahead of me left. I was happy that I was patient enough to wait that long, and it was worth it in the end.
1411	19390	7	3	One day in the @CAPS1, I had to sit for two hours cause I had to come for taking out my stitches. And there a lot of people, we stay there a very long time, cause there were only @NUM1 docters and this lady took so long. So it was my turn to go in but I was scar that if hurts but then he was doing and it didnít hurt for nothing. And then I went home.  After waiting for what felt like an eternity, it was finally my turn to have my stitches removed. I was nervous about the process, fearing it might be painful. However, to my surprise, the doctor swiftly removed the stitches without causing me any discomfort. Relieved, I left the @CAPS1 feeling grateful for the quick and painless procedure.
1412	19391	7	3	"A while back, my best friend @PERSON1's grandpa died. They weren't blood related but they were really close. At the funeral, I saw @PERSON1 and her sister @CAPS1 force a smile toward us. @CAPS1 left to go talk to my parents. Then, @PERSON1 started crying, saying she wouldn't see her grandpa's gravestone because they were moving to @LOCATION1. She changed the subject to the good times she had with her grandpa. I laughed and smiled with @PERSON1. My parents later said we had to go to church. I hugged her and told her everything would be alright. She smiled, though it seemed forced. ""@PERSON1's eyes filled with tears,""I don't want to move to @LOCATION1."" Two weeks later, she did with her family. It was a difficult time for her, but I knew she would find a way to cope with the change."
1413	19392	7	3	My patient is saying that your patient is. When you wait in line for something, your patient is being patient. Waiting your turn demonstrates patience. One time, I exhibited patience by waiting on the bench to play, even though I didn't get to play until the fourth quarter. It's important to have patience in such situations. Many people possess patience, but some lack manners and may resort to yelling and screaming. It's crucial for pop stars and movie stars to have patience and not think they can cut in front of others just because they are rich. It's essential for everyone, regardless of status, to practice patience in all aspects of life.
1414	19393	7	3	I was patient when my mom went to the store. She would always grab a basket as soon as she entered the store, and then proceed to spend what felt like an eternity browsing through the aisles. I would watch as she carefully selected items to fill up the basket, taking her time to compare prices and read labels. Eventually, she would emerge from the store with a basket filled to the brim, and I would patiently wait as she repeated this process at another store. Despite the time it took, I knew that she was making thoughtful choices and that it was all part of her shopping routine. So, I remained patient, knowing that it was just her way of ensuring she got everything she needed.
1415	19394	7	3	Onece, when my family went to @LOCATION1, we all had to be patient. There is a water ride where you get in a log then you sit and it takes you up a hill. You wait until you get to the top, then you splash down a hill. Well, that was one of everyones favorite rides, so there was a long line. We had to wait for a half hour to ride it once. So, in order to do something, it takes time so you must be patient. If your not patient you probably want get to do what you wanted to do. Patience is key when faced with long lines and waiting times at popular attractions, as impatience can lead to missing out on enjoyable experiences.
1416	19395	7	3	Patience is a crucial skill for a spy, as demonstrated in a mundane undercover mission at a county fair. Despite the lack of action, the spy's patience pays off when a clue is discovered in the form of a computer chip with the subject's fingerprints. After a moment of waiting, the chip is successfully analyzed, leading the spy to a message instructing them to meet at the ice cream parlor. With keen observation and patience, the spy apprehends two accomplices of the main suspect, highlighting the importance of patience in espionage.
1417	19396	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient. I was so patient that the doctor gave me a sucker. I was being patient because the doctor was looking for a needle to stick in my arm. He told me to wait a second, but I wasn't waiting a second I was waiting for hours. My mom couldn't wait any longer, she was about to take me home. I told her to be patient and it would feel like time was going faster. She said she was going to try, but if it didn't work we were leaving. She waited patiently, and next thing you know the doctor came back into the room and said thanks for being patient. He was still looking for the needle, then he came back into the room and said he found it. It was in the other doctor's room above the sink on the dresser. After I got my shot, the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. After he thanked me, he gave me a sucker and shook my hand. My mom and I left and went to the store and got something to eat. We were grateful for the doctor's diligence and thanked him for his care and attention. Patience truly paid off in the end.
1418	19397	7	3	So you want a story about being patient well you're in luck. The story starts off with me at the doctor's office, waiting for my turn. Knowing I would be there for a few hours, I decided to pass the time by reading a book. As I immersed myself in the story, the sound of a child crying and a mother's frustrated voice filled the waiting room. Without getting angry, I approached them and managed to calm the child down, bringing relief to the mother. Just as I thought things were settling down, my sister suddenly appeared and startled me with a loud scream. Although I felt annoyed, I chose to remain patient. However, when my mom informed me that there would be another hour of waiting, I couldn't help but let out a frustrated scream. Despite my momentary outburst, I realized the importance of patience in such situations. Ultimately, I learned that patience is key in handling unexpected challenges and maintaining composure in difficult circumstances.
1419	19398	7	3	I was patient when we were going to lunch, standing there patiently until we finally received our meals. My friend, Avir, also displayed patience during our lunch outing. Another instance of patience I recall is when my friend and I were at the water fountain, and a group of girls approached to get some water. My friend waited patiently for them to finish before taking his turn. These examples highlight the importance of practicing patience in various everyday situations.

1421	19401	7	3	When I was patient, I remember writing an article at SeaWorld when I was very little. I didn't complain because I knew I would get those sometimes; my sister was complaining because she was in a bad mood. We stood in line for 20 minutes for a ride called Kraken's Drop, or something like that, I can't remember. Then there was a line at the exit for photos. We waited 15 minutes, plus the time for everyone to get out.
1422	19402	7	3	One time I had to be so patient for a plane to come in. We were up at the crack of dawn and had to wait for hours. Over winter break a few years ago, me and my family went to a beautiful location. We did lots of things while we were there. When we had to go home, we had to wait for a plane. We got up early so we could pack up and get to the airport. When we got there, we had to be patient while we returned the rental car and went through security. After passing through security, we had to wait for the plane to arrive. We sat for over an hour before the plane came in. When the plane arrived, we had to wait for it to be cleaned, passengers' passes to be checked, and for everyone to board. That was the time I had to be patient, and I was patient for a very long time.
1423	19403	7	3	"A while ago when I went on a trip to Cedar Point in Ohio, it was an hour and thirty-minute drive to get there. The reason why we went was because of my dad's work. I kept out of the car with my sister, waiting for my parents and the rest of our family. Waiting was all I did until we burst out running into the park. My dad pointed out the height limits - I was only 10 years old and 4 feet tall, so I wasn't tall enough for most of the rides. However, my dad saw that I was tall enough for the Ferris wheel. We walked around looking for the ride and, more importantly, the line. Finally, we found the ride, and my attention was drawn from the ride to the line. My mouth practically hit the ground when I saw the long line. My dad said, ""Good luck getting on that ride."" I looked for my mom and sister, who were over by the Ferris wheel. We got in line, enduring the scorching heat of nearly 90 degrees. After waiting for almost two hours, we finally reached the front of the line. We got into the chair, and a bar came over us. I remembered the instruction to set a quarter on my leg and watch gravity take hold of it. As the ride started, we plummeted down like a meteor, the quarter not floating as expected. In a split second, we were back on solid ground. The ride wasn't really worth the wait, but I wasn't a coward."
1424	19404	7	3	Over the weekend, my sister and I had plans to visit the Gnat Wolf Lodge with our cousin Grace and Uncle Rege. Unfortunately, Uncle Rege had to cancel last minute due to a delayed flight and car trouble. We ended up renting a car to make the trip. After picking up Uncle Rege, we hit the road but got pulled over for speeding, resulting in a ticket. Despite the setbacks, our time at the lodge turned out to be an unforgettable experience.
1425	19405	7	3	The story Iím about to tell you is about patience, where a boy and his father went fishing. The boy was not patient and kept complaining while they were fishing. One day, as they were fishing, the boy became restless and complained about not catching anything. When they returned home empty-handed, the boy's father told him that fishing was not just about catching fish, but about enjoying the experience. He emphasized the importance of patience in fishing.  The next day, they went fishing again, and this time the boy decided to be patient. He waited calmly and focused on the process rather than the outcome. To his surprise, he caught a large fish. The boy learned that patience is key in achieving success, and that good things come to those who wait.  In the end, the boy realized the value of patience and how it can lead to great rewards. He understood that rushing and impatience would not bring him the desired results, but patience and perseverance would eventually pay off. It was a valuable lesson that he would carry with him in all aspects of his life.

1428	19409	7	3	A time when I was patient was yesterday when I finished the assignment before a lot of people and was drawing for the next few minutes. I was patient throughout this time because if I wasn't, I might have been very loud and disrupted my fellow classmates. I started to draw or color as some might say because instead of drawing a smiley face, I colored in boxes on math graphing paper to make a sort of lime green and purple checkerboard. It took the entire time, and I am still not done with it. That is a time I remember when I was quite patient.
1429	19410	7	3	One time I was patient was at the doctor, cause when I was little and I was at the doctor I was running around and did not give a care.

That day my mom wasnít even breaking a sweat. I thought she would be ready to go and get her bags(which she packed the night before) and ready to have the baby. I most certainly was. One week and two days later my mom went into labor and was ready to have my little sister. I was patient for those nine days of waiting. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother until the nurse came out and said we could come inside of the room. When I saw my baby sistersí face I almost started to cry.

We were driving in a truck that fit five people, but we were squeezing @NUM2 people in it. I ended up in the back with all the gear, including a boat in someone's sea bag that was poking into my back. Despite the discomfort, I tried my best not to complain.  As we journeyed, @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 started singing a very annoying song, testing my patience even further. I managed to endure the ride until we finally arrived at port @LOCATION2. The challenge continued as we waited in line to check in, with @NUM3 people cutting in front of me. Although I felt my patience wearing thin, I stayed calm and waited for my turn.  Once it was my chance to check in, the officer at the desk spoke very slowly, making it difficult to understand him. Despite the frustration, I managed to maintain my composure. Throughout the training, my friend Logan tested my patience with his antics. Despite all these challenges, my patience remained strong and persevered.

We got out and drank pop and ate sandwiches because we had an hour or so before the concert started. After @NUM3 minutes, or maybe @NUM4 minutes, we bought our tickets and found a spot to sit on the hill. Once we sat down, time stopped I waited and waited until I thought about @NUM5 minutes had passed. I was expecting buddy to walk on stage any second, but @CAPS2 never did. After what seemed @NUM6 minutes, I bumped my dad with my elbow and asked ‚Äúhow long has @CAPS3 been since we sat down?‚Äù ‚Äúabout five minutes.‚Äù @CAPS2 replied. @CAPS2 must be lying to me, I thought so I tried again. ‚Äúhow long?‚Äù ‚Äúsix now.‚Äù @CAPS3 wouldn‚Äôt have been surprising if I died, right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but there was just too much noise. Minute after minute rolled by and someone stepped on stage. ‚ÄúThe performance will start in @NUM7 minutes.‚Äù @CAPS2 announced. @CAPS3 was heartbreaking. The wait was only half over. Finally after @NUM7 minutes of dying and waiting, @CAPS2 walked on stage. @CAPS3 was the best sight in the world. @CAPS3 was worth the long, long wait and I enjoyed @CAPS3 even more.

Eventually, we got our photos taken, and I won the bet. Being patient is essential in life, just like I was that day at the photo center.

Our family sent him care packages over. Eventually, he did come back. It was a hard time, but being patient got us through it.

I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three day field trip, my patience grew to the size of a spider monkey. And every time my patience would grow to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would be trying to find a way out so they could knock the idiot out. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being an idiot and not moving fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure to not let the spider monkey hit somebody where it hurts most."
1445	19428	7	3	One day, I was watching TV and feeling bored as there was nothing interesting to watch. Seeing this, my mom was using the computer. I politely asked her if I could use it after she was done, to which she agreed. I patiently waited for my turn, and when the time came, she told me I could go ahead.

1446	19429	7	3	One time when I was patient was a summer day when me and my friends decided to have an adventure! We spent most of the day by the water park, enjoying the sun and the water. My favorite part was lounging by the pool and going on the water slides - it was so much fun. As the day went on, we started to get tired of the water park and decided to head to the rides. We debated between going on the roller coaster or the Ferris wheel, and I chose the roller coaster. When we got to the ride, the line was so long that it would take an hour to get on. Despite the wait, we decided to stick it out and eventually got on the ride. Unfortunately, as we were riding, an announcement was made that the park was closing soon. It was disappointing, but we had such a great time at the water park that we didn't mind. I decided to be patient and told myself that we could always come back next year. I waited in line, reminiscing about the fun day we had, and promised myself to visit the park again soon.
1447	19430	7	3	One time I had to be patient was on my birthday. One year my grampa and grandma were late for my birthday. I had to wait a few hours. I sat down until they arrived. When they finally got here, we got to enjoy some delicious cake. After that, I eagerly opened my presents. It took them about an hour to get to my birthday celebration, but the wait was worth it. I learned the importance of patience that day, and it made the time spent with my loved ones even more special.
1448	19431	7	3	"Where here at Cedar Point, I was so excited I felt like I was going to go psycho. ""Can we go on the dragster first?"" I asked eagerly. ""Why not, it'll be fun,"" my friend replied. As we got in line, the estimated wait time was about an hour. ""Do you still want to ride the ride?"" my friend asked. ""Sure I do,"" I replied, knowing that patience would be key.  While we waited in the hot sun, time seemed to drag on. But I reminded myself that patience would pay off in the end. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, we were second in line for the dragster. The anticipation built as we watched the cars zoom by.  I hopped into a blue dragster car, feeling like it was meant for me. After a few more minutes of waiting, the ride began. As we ascended the hill, I felt like a meteorite hurtling towards Earth. The rush of adrenaline was exhilarating.  When the ride came to an end, I realized that my patience had indeed paid off. I will always remember the thrill of the Cedar Point dragster and the lesson in patience it taught me."
1449	19432	7	3	My patience paid off when the food finally arrived. It was delicious and worth the wait. I learned that sometimes, being patient is the key to a satisfying outcome. From that day on, I always remembered to stay patient, no matter how long the wait may be.
1450	19433	7	3	When I hurt my hand on the same day of meaping, I was patient, I was patient. I fell in the hall and I went to the office, I waited patiently for them to call my mom to pick me up. When my mom arrived, she said she was going to take me to the ER room. It took a while to find a parking spot when we got there, but I was patient even though my hand was hurting. Finally, we found a spot and went inside. My mom went to the front desk to inform them I was there. We waited for a little while until a nurse came out and guided us to a room to wait for an available bed for x-rays. After some time, a lady came for me and led us to the x-ray room. We waited for the results and then returned to the room to wait for the doctor. After about forty-five minutes, the doctor arrived, examined me, and confirmed that I didn't break anything. He provided me with a brace, and then we went home. Throughout the entire process, I remained patient.
1451	19434	7	3	I was patient when my birthday came. I am waiting for my party at my dad's house this Saturday. My birthday was on May 15th. I am getting a new bike from my dad for my birthday.
1452	19435	7	3	"Another few days and I'll be on my way to Cedar Point. I wonder what we'll do when we first get there? What will end up being my favorite ride? Maybe I can talk my mom into going on the trip a few days early? ""Mom,"" said Person1. ""Yes?"" said her mother. ""Can we go to Cedar Point now?"" ""Sweetie, our tickets are for in a few days, you're going to have to be patient."" ""Ok, I'll do my best."" ""Atta girl!"" As Person1 was on her way up to her room, she was thinking that maybe if she tried getting her mind off of it, she would forget. So, to do this, she called her friend to see if she wanted to come over. Her friend said yes. ""Do you want to go play in my room?"" asked Person1. ""Sure!"" replied her friend. That night, her friend went home and Person1 went to bed. Three days left. Only one more day to go! That night, Person1 went to bed early to get a good sleep before the trip. But, to her surprise, she woke up a couple of hours later. She was so excited she couldn't sleep! She finally fell asleep, and they left early the next morning."
1453	19436	7	3	Patience is indeed a valuable trait to possess in various situations. Whether it be waiting for medical results or for a loved one to meet you again, exercising patience can often lead to positive outcomes. In contrast, impatience in critical scenarios such as military operations can result in grave consequences. Overall, the benefits of practicing patience far outweigh the drawbacks. It can prevent hasty decisions that may harm others, help in not missing crucial opportunities, and allow for the enjoyment of various experiences without rushing through them. Therefore, cultivating patience is essential for navigating life's challenges effectively and responsibly.
1454	19437	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was waiting to get on the dragster the line was suppa long. We waited for @NUM1 hours long and we still was in line being patient. Finally we got up there and they said that the ride will be closed for a while that have to check something and it took them a whole hour for them to fix it. So we went to the other side of the park and we were waiting for the train to come and it came it took the train @NUM2 minutes and when we got to the other side of the park the ride I wanted to get on which was shoot the rapids the line was really long so we waited and waited and finally it was our turn we got on it was fun then when it was over we got back. On the train and went back to the other side. We went back to the dragster then the line was back long and we waited and waited and then it was our turn. That day was the worst day because I had to wait and wait that was my first day that I ever had to hold my patience that long I was about to lose my mind but we had don. And we are going back this @CAPS3. It was a challenging day, but I managed to keep my patience through the long lines and delays. In the end, the fun experiences and memories made it all worth it.
1455	19438	7	3	It was a time when I was patient when I went to a fair and had to wait in line for two hours. I was bored standing there, but I really wanted to go on the rides. I tried to be patient the whole time in line, even though my feet started to hurt from standing for so long. Finally, when I got to the front of the line to get my ticket, I was ecstatic. That moment taught me the value of patience and how it can lead to a rewarding experience in the end.
1456	19439	7	3	A time when I was patient is when my family, friends, or teachers are talking. I wait for them to finish before I speak. I am polite and wait my turn in class and at home. I am always nice to people and listen to what they have to say. Being patient also involves waiting in line or helping others who need assistance. These are the ways I practice patience in my daily life.
1457	19440	7	3	"Hi, I'm @PERSON1 And this is A time of when I was patient. My mom and my step dad were going to take me And my step sister to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. BUT!! There was A twist we couldn't ask ""Are we there yet"". So we had to wait A really long time. But when got there we got there it so worth the wait. We finally arrived at @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 after enduring the long journey without asking the dreaded question. The anticipation only made the destination more enjoyable, and the experience taught me the value of patience."
1458	19441	7	3	Patience is a virtue that can lead to great rewards, as illustrated in the story of the annual race in the animal kingdom. The fastest animal, known for always winning, was overconfident and rushed ahead, only to be distracted by his own hunger and need for rest. Meanwhile, the slow and steady animal continued on his path without giving up, eventually surpassing the sleeping champion and claiming victory. The moral of the story is clear - patience, perseverance, and steady progress can often lead to success, even when faced with seemingly unbeatable competition. So, next time you feel impatient or tempted to rush through life, remember the tale of the race and the valuable lesson it teaches.
1459	19442	7	3	"In my thirteen years of experience, I have ridden many roller coasters, and there is usually a two-hour wait for these thrilling rides. In the summer of 2021, I took my best friend Sarah to ""Cedar Point,"" and we decided to get in line for a ride called ""The Millennium Force."" When we reached the entrance, the sign displayed a forty-five-minute wait time, so we eagerly joined the line. However, our excitement was short-lived as the ride suddenly broke down, leaving us waiting for over three hours. After the maintenance team fixed the issue, the ride had to undergo another round of testing, adding an extra half an hour to our wait. Thankfully, since we were near the front of the line, the extended wait did not affect us much. Finally, we got to experience the thrilling ride, and it was truly worth the wait. Throughout the rest of the day, the lines for other rides were relatively short, ranging from thirty minutes to an hour. I just hope that the next time we visit, The Millennium Force does not break down again."
1460	19443	7	3	I remember a long time ago when I was patient for a long time. I was patient for about four months. I was waiting to get the video game system @CAPS1. And I was extremely patient for this. So basically what happened was that there was this new, high tech, amazing game system coming out. The @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 . Everyone was eager to get it. Including me. The only problem was that they were all sold out. So for christmas, my dad told me that he would get me one. I was so happy. But we both knew that it would be a long time before he could get one. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Then one night around @TIME1, my dad wake me up. He said that they were selling alot of @CAPS3. So we got in the car, drove to watiest, and waited in the line for a long time. Finally, it was our turn. We bought the @CAPS1, went home, and set it up. The next day, I finally played my @CAPS1: And thats a story about a time I have been patient. After the long wait and anticipation, finally getting my hands on the @CAPS1 game system was truly worth it. The excitement of playing my favorite games on this new console was unmatched, and it was a rewarding experience that taught me the value of patience.
1461	19444	7	3	My mom went to the doctors a couple weeks ago before school. We arrived at @NUM1 and didnít leave until @NUM2. My little sister and I entertained ourselves by watching TV, playing on our iPods, and telling stories. As time passed, we grew bored and just had to sit and wait. Eventually, a deer got up and walked towards our seats, but it turned out to be someone else. They sat down and fell asleep. Suddenly, I felt someone shaking me and saying my name repeatedly. It was my mom trying to wake us up. We then left the doctor's office and went to the mall for the rest of the day. And that was my story of being patient while waiting at the doctor's office.
1462	19445	7	3	"ì@CAPS1 can I get a puppy."" ì@CAPS2."" ì@CAPS3 @CAPS1 ì@CAPS4 in the @DATE1 just be patient."" ì@CAPS5."" @CAPS6 @CAPS7 made her way downstairs to sulk.

She ripped @CAPS9 then @CAPS10 and even @CAPS11 years. Before she knew it, it was @DATE1 the first. @CAPS7 sprang out of bed, ripped the last link off, and said, ""ì@CAPS1 can I have a puppy yet? I was patient."" ""ì@CAPS13 you see,"" said her @CAPS1. ""Your dad and I have been thinking, and it is a big responsibility, so @CAPS4 next @DATE1."" ""ì@CAPS14 Iíll be patient."" She responded."
1463	19446	7	3	"This is a story about a vampire named @CAPS1 who goes to a regular middle school. It was the first day of school and @CAPS1 was waiting in line for his schedule and later combination. And this line was really long. @CAPS1 was late on his first day and he had to get in the way back of the line. The person in front of him kept complaining and @CAPS1 was getting impatient. ""This will take forever!"" complained the person in front. ""Hey, shut up, man. I don't like this any more than you do but do you see me complaining?"" exclaimed @CAPS1. Everyone in the gymnasium stopped talking and looked in his direction. This was not a good sign. @CAPS1 stopped talking and just waited in line. After 10 long minutes of listening to music on his iPod, he was 2 people away from the front of the line. Then something bad happened. ""This isn't my schedule!"" said a blonde girl. The person who was giving out the schedules had to call everyone back up to see who had her schedule. So 5 more minutes passed until he finally got his schedule. If @CAPS1 hadn't had patience, he wouldn't have stood the 15 minutes in line! Good thing he brought his iPod!"
1464	19447	7	3	A time I was patient was waiting two whole months for my baby brother, who is four now. It felt like 2,000 years; it was so long I couldnít wait but I had to use patience to wait. He was due on June 15, but instead he was out on April 15. When I came to the hospital. Finally at 5 am on April 15 my brother was finally born after two long months. The moment I saw him, I knew it was worth the wait.
1465	19448	7	3	I remember when me, my brother, my dad, and my mom were at Cedar Point. I wanted to go on so many rides but they all had big lines. So we waited for the Raptor that took one hour just to get on the ride but when we got on it felt like it was even longer than the wait in line. We walked and saw the Wicked Twister; it had a thrilling look on it so we waited in line, which was much longer than the Raptor - it was like 3-4 hours. But when we got to the top of the stairs, we were up, and it was so much fun because we waited so long, and my brother stopped complaining because he was so excited. The ride was fun, but when we were done, we had to leave, which was like pulling teeth. We only waited on the rides, but it was fun and memorable. That was a time when I was patient.
1466	19449	7	3	"My friend and others showed loyalty in a play called ""Children's Day"". They come once every year. Everyone gets ready, learns their parts and we put on a show in a week. We showed loyalty by believing in each other. When you are on a stage in front of people you have to support each other. When someone forgot to enter on time, you would help them out by reminding them the next time. When someone forgot their line, you would help them out by saying it for them. We showed each other loyalty throughout 5 days. The play turns out great each and every year from supporting each other. In the end, our loyalty to one another made the performance a success."
1467	19450	7	3	I was patient when I was at the ER after I broke my finger a week ago. I calmly waited for the medical staff to attend to me, despite the pain and discomfort I was experiencing. My patience paid off as I received the necessary treatment and care for my injury. Waiting patiently during stressful situations can lead to better outcomes and smoother experiences overall. Being patient in times of distress can help us navigate challenges with a clear mind and a positive attitude. In the end, my patience at the ER helped me receive the help I needed and allowed me to start the healing process for my broken finger.
1468	19451	7	3	I am not a very patient person. However, there was a time in my life where I was extremely patient. I was in 7th grade and was helping out in Mrs. Bowos's 2nd-grade class. We would go down there regularly. As you probably know, 2nd graders are not very good readers but there was one girl who was struggling a lot. She needed extra help from everybody. I would sit down with her and encourage her to keep going even when she wanted to give up. Every time she stumbled on a word, I would help her sound it out. Slowly but surely, she began to improve. Eventually, she didn't need my help anymore, and I was proud of myself for being patient and persistent with her. It was a rewarding experience that taught me the value of patience and perseverance.
1469	19454	7	3	My own way of understanding patience is allowing others the time they need to complete tasks without rushing them. By being patient, we show respect to others and avoid causing them to make mistakes or errors. Patience is a crucial virtue that promotes harmony and understanding in our interactions with others.
1470	19455	7	3	There are many times I was patient, but this one was not too long ago. In fact, it was yesterday when I was taking the MEAP. I just sat there finished, just read and drew. It was absolutely boring, lame, and seconds felt like hours. It was terrible, but I didn't complain, I just sat there and did nothing. And that was probably the worst time when I wanted to talk but couldn't. It was a test of my patience and restraint, but I managed to stay calm and composed throughout the ordeal. Despite the boredom and frustration, I knew that complaining or causing a disturbance would not solve anything. So, I remained patient and focused on completing the task at hand. In the end, my patience paid off, and I was able to get through the situation without causing any unnecessary trouble. This experience taught me the importance of patience in challenging situations, and I will remember it the next time I find myself in a similar predicament.
1471	19456	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was in school. I was in math class, waiting for the bell to ring so I could go to my friend's house. As I waited, time seemed to drag on slowly. The clock was not moving, so I decided to start doing my classwork. Suddenly, the bell rang, signaling the end of the class. I realized there was only a short break because we had the MEAP test that day. With only a few minutes left, I hurried to finish my work. Finally, my friend and I met with just enough time to spare before the next class. Time flew by quickly, and before I knew it, the bell rang again. That's when I learned the value of patience and how time can seem to stretch or shrink depending on the situation.
1472	19457	7	3	Someone was in line for hot & ready pizza since they are hot and ready, a lot of people were in line and everybody was screaming and getting angry because they thought the pizza is supposed to hot and ready. Everybody was throwing tantrums. The kids were sitting quietly at the little benches they have and watching them doing tantrums. The people that work in cedses was trying because there a lot of people and everybody was leaving. Nobody showed any patience. They just cared about the pizza. The little kids that are hungry were showing patience than the angry adults. They were all whining and everybody said they don`t want to hear you so you had to shut up. After he was there patiently waiting in line with his mouth shut. He didn`t bother to speak. Everybody were back to normal and everybody had smile on their faces and even the little kids everybody got their pizza really fast. Always be patient.
1473	19458	7	3	I asked my mom for something to eat, but she didn't say anything. So, I waited and waited, growing hungrier by the minute. Eventually, I gave up and went upstairs to wait some more. Despite my hunger, I tried to be patient. This wasn't the first time I had to wait for food. On Thanksgiving, I remember waiting for the food to finish cooking. Our stomachs were growling, but we waited patiently until everything was ready to eat. I pride myself on being a patient person, especially when it comes to waiting for delicious food.
1474	19459	7	3	Patience is a quality that can truly define a person's character. It can be challenging to remain patient in certain situations, but it is a virtue that can bring about positive outcomes. For instance, waiting for food at a restaurant can test one's patience. However, finding ways to keep oneself occupied, such as engaging in conversation or activities, can make the wait more bearable. In the end, being patient often leads to rewarding experiences. It is important to remember that good things come to those who are willing to wait and maintain a sense of patience in various aspects of life. By practicing patience, individuals can cultivate a positive attitude and approach towards handling different circumstances.
1475	19460	7	3	"A time when I used patience was when I finished my book, ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Saints."" I eagerly awaited my turn for teacher talk, where I could share my thoughts on the books I had completed. Despite my anticipation, the teacher continuously chose other students before me, causing me to wait patiently for my chance. Each day, during both second and third hours, I hoped to be called upon, but it never happened. Determined to share my accomplishments, I added another finished book to my list and wrote my name on the board once more. Still, I remained unnoticed. It wasn't until a few days later that my patience paid off, and my name was finally called. Excitedly, I presented all five books I had read to the teacher and shared my enthusiasm for each one. I was elated to have the opportunity to discuss my literary journey and grateful for the chance to share my passion for reading."
1476	19462	7	3	I was patient at the dentist office. When I went to the dentist office, I was getting my braces put on. When I was sitting there they told me they had to get my brackets and wire. While they were getting the brackets and wire I got to pick out colors. I waited about 15 minutes. Without complaining. Next, they started putting the brackets on with glue. When they put one bracket on I felt so weird and it tasted like heated metal. After they had put on the brackets, they added colors. My mouth hurt like crazy! When it was all over I noticed it had been 2 hours! I was surprised because I didnít know I sat there for 2 hours, but I was very patient and waited that whole time! Thatís the time I was patient at the dentist office.
1477	19463	7	3	"A time when I was being very patient was when I went to Cedar Point. I went with my three aunties and four cousins. It was just the older girls going, as we knew we couldn't take the little ones into the haunted houses. The lines at the amusement park were ridiculously long, especially for the rollercoaster. Despite the long wait, I remained patient while my cousins started to get restless. We passed the time by talking and listening to music. Eventually, we reached the top floor of the coaster but had to wait even longer for maintenance checks. Although my cousins were getting frustrated, I stayed calm. Finally, we got on the ride called ""The Maverick"" and it was worth the wait. It was a thrilling experience with drops and jerky turns. While we may not have had enough patience to go back on the ride, the wait was definitely worth it in the end."
1478	19464	7	3	One day when I was buying a dirt bike helmet online it said three day shipping and to me it wasnít very long. When the third day came and I was waiting on my porch for my helmet to come, my mom broke the news to me that my helmet got stuck in @LOCATION1 and it wouldnít be here until next week. after she told me I figured that did just have to be patient, as for the next week I just went to work with my dad. after my week was up, and I was sitting on my porch waiting and I almost fell asleep when a @ORGANIZATION1 truck came and gave me my brand new helmet.
1479	19465	7	3	One time my friend was waiting for me for over an hour while I took my time in the bathroom. When I finally came out, he thanked me for waiting and I was surprised at her.
1480	19466	7	3	When it was Christmas Eve and I could not wait for Christmas Day, so I opened my gifts early. My parents gave my sisters and me money so we could buy things we liked. I remember buying a cute pair of boots and eagerly waiting to wear them on Christmas Day. I was bouncing up and down with excitement, asking if we could open one gift early, but my parents said no. The next morning, I woke up early, eagerly anticipating the moment my parents would wake up so we could open our gifts. Time seemed to drag on as I waited anxiously for the day to begin. It was a time when I simply could not wait for Christmas morning to arrive.
1481	19467	7	3	I think that patience is about waiting instead of rushing things. If you are patient, things will actually come faster than you think. For example, if you want something and you have to wait in line, instead of running off and finding something else, wait it out. Being patient with whatever you are doing, even if it's waiting in line at school, will always help in the long run. If you are waiting for a seat at a seminar, have patience and wait because it might save you from getting into trouble. Be patient with whatever you are doing, even if you are waiting for your turn. Stop rushing things and just be patient.
1482	19468	7	3	ì@CAPS1 on @CAPS2, where are you,î @PERSON1 said in a frustrated undertone. @CAPS2 was supposed to come over to his house. @PERSON1 had just gotten a new trampoline, and they were planning on bouncing all day after school. @PERSON1 was starting to get worried, but he waited. Finally, his mom came and told him that @CAPS2 wasnít coming. That's when the phone rang. @PERSON1 answered it and heard @CAPS2 on the other end. ì@CAPS5, @PERSON1,î @CAPS2 croaked. He didn't sound well. ì@CAPS2,î @PERSON1 shouted into the phone, ì@CAPS2, where are you?î ìI'm at my house, get over here.î @PERSON1's mom pulled up at @CAPS2's house and let him out. @PERSON1 didn't care about manners at this point, so he opened the door and marched to @CAPS2's room. @CAPS2 was laying in bed, looking up at the ceiling with his face looking very swollen. He turned to look at @PERSON1, held his gaze, then looked back at the ceiling. ì@CAPS2 wasn't at school that day either. He went skiing up at his family cottage. I wasn't patient when I was in the air. I got crushed, and none of it would have happened if I had waited.î @CAPS1 realized the importance of patience and understanding in situations, knowing that impatience can lead to unexpected consequences.
1483	19469	7	3	One time I was patient was at my dad's house. Our power had just gone out, so we figured we should wait for up to two minutes like it always happened. After a couple of days without power, I started to lose my patience. On day three, we decided to call the power company to see what was causing the issue. After some investigation, they discovered that there was a problem with the power lines outside our house. Once they fixed it, we were finally able to get our power back.
1484	19470	7	3	There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, than you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your @CAPS1 test early and you kept telling everyone else to burry up itís distracting. Now that youíve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they @MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return.  My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt. Letís say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten.
1485	19471	7	3	ì@CAPS1,@CAPS1 ,@CAPS1î the clock was counting down ì@CAPS1,@CAPS1,@CAPS1îso close come on I whispered as the clock kept going. My heart was beating like a race car engine. I could hear my heart boom, boom, my mind raced with what I was going to do: jump in the pool, watch, play a video game. So many options, what should I do? ì@CAPS1,@CAPS1 @CAPS1î I could almost hear a voice calling to me, ìswim, swim, swim.î What should I do? I looked at Mrs. Sprowl, then back at the clock, then Mrs. Sprowl, then back at the clock, and Mrs. Sprowl. My heart was almost jumping out of my body with so much anticipation. ì@CAPS1,@CAPS1,@CAPS1 ìalmost there,î I said as I stared at the second hand. ì@CAPS1,@CAPS1,@CAPS1î so close, I said, so close, just one second left, then I can swim in my pool. ì@NUM2î I almost jumped out of my seat and yelled, ì@NUM3î@CAPS2,@CAPS2,@CAPS2î we have some announcements,î said Mrs. White. I was happy; I ran outside to wait for my dad so I could have freedom.
1486	19472	7	3	I was patient throughout the entire time. Although I appeared happy on the outside, deep down, I wished I had received a better score.
1487	19473	7	3	As a child, my mom always emphasized the importance of being patient, a quality she embodies herself. I remember a time when I accidentally spilled grape soda on her new carpet, causing me to panic. Instead of getting mad, my mom calmly instructed me to clean it up, showing her unwavering patience. She even went the extra mile to help me, wetting a towel herself to tackle the stain. Despite my initial fear, she reassured me and comforted me, making me feel safe and loved. Even when I fell asleep on the couch, she took care of me, waking me up gently and preparing breakfast with a smile. My mom's patience, kindness, and love have always been a pillar of strength in my life, and I am grateful for her unwavering support. I cherish every moment with her and will always remember her calming presence in times of chaos.
1488	19474	7	3	"@CAPS7 year @CAPS4 went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was about two weeks before school started. That day schools by @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 just opened so there was no lines to wait in. @CAPS4 couldn't have picked a better day. Then @CAPS4 got to the mantice I didn't want to go on it, but @CAPS5 mom said, ""Will you go wrong, @CAPS2?"" I said, ""Fine, I'll go on to the ride."" @CAPS4 are about to take off going up the hill and right when @CAPS4 got to the top the ride stops. I was freaking out at first but then I got over it. So we have been up there for about @NUM1 min or @NUM2 and @CAPS4 had to be patient. @CAPS5 mom and dad are on the inside of them. @CAPS4 were sitting on bicycle seats which were not comfy. So then another @NUM3 min passed by and now @CAPS4 have been stuck at the top for @NUM4 mins. @CAPS7 is where @CAPS4 had to be completely quiet and patient. Then the ride started and @CAPS4 got down to the bottom and finished the ride. They gave us a pass for us to cut in line on the @CAPS8 force. That is all they gave us. So @CAPS4 had fun the rest of the day, but what I learned in life is that you have to have patience."
1489	19475	7	3	Once upon a time their was a princess named @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS1 was invited to a royal ball where @CAPS1 awaited her handsome prince. As her carriage arrived @CAPS1 stalked at the people before getting out. Finally @CAPS1 stepped out of the vehicle. @ORGANIZATION1 walked down the red carpet. As @CAPS1 arrived, the more noisy it got the princess finally approached the opened doors. The beautiful girl walked to her throne and watched the village people dance among her. @PERSON1 sat for two hours. @CAPS1 wandered ìwill he show up?î and ìwill he like me?î @CAPS1 doubted her luck. The princess grabbed the microphone, ì@CAPS2! @CAPS2! Does @CAPS3 know where my prince is?î ì@CAPS3?î a complete silence went over the crowd. Finally at the last minute. ë@CAPS4î an anonymous voice crossed. I am the prince!î A sigh of relief came over her. ì@CAPS5 Ií. Iím so late ??? fought a dragon and a thousand knights.

When we got there the parking lot was full I mean cars was so close you could hardly get in and out without scratching someones car. My mom parked across the streets the streets. When we got in there it was at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 people it parked. People were standing so close to each other you would know their body temperature. The bench was full of people and they were parked like dardine. It was hot and smelled like must. We picked a ticket with @NUM3 on and they were on @NUM4. We waited for two hours. My mum wanted to leave. When they got to our number I was sleep. Wile we was in there I lost ten pounds. When we finally got our birth certificate, it felt like a huge accomplishment and made the long wait worth it. This experience taught me the importance of patience and perseverance, even in the most challenging and uncomfortable situations.
1491	19477	7	3	Iím not a very patient person. I always whine and complain. If patient means you stay somewhere for a whole without complaining, then I guess there are some times when Iíve been patient, but only if there is a friend there to keep me busy. One time, my mom was at the hospital for a long time, about @NUM1 hours. My friend @PERSON1 was there, and we hung out together. It was actually a lot of fun. We ate in the cafeteria place. We stole some milk for no reason, and totally forgot that my mom was there. I didnít complaine once. Then we got yelled at and had to go back to the waiting room, but it still wasnít too bad. that was one of the few times Iíve been  patient, and donít know if it counts since I was with somebody.
1492	19478	7	3	ì@CAPS1!î I yaled as the ball came over the net right to me. ìThat was @CAPS1!î @CAPS2 said. ì@CAPS3 I was already there.î I responded. ì@CAPS4. @CAPS3 itís @CAPS1.î @CAPS13 argued. ì@CAPS5 I said @CAPS1, you moved and let me get it then wimp @CAPS6 me. And watch the ball drop.î I exclaimed. ì@CAPS7 I guess.î @CAPS2 apologized. This was at volleyball tryouts where I had to be patient and work together. ì@CAPS9 is @CAPS10 @CAPS11!î the A team coach demanded. ì@CAPS12 partner up in groups of three!î @CAPS13 said. My two best friends, Sam and @PERSON1, were already together with this new girl, who was pretty good. ìYou want to be partners with me and make?î @CAPS14 asked. ì@CAPS15,î I responded. When it was our turn on the court, we were going against @CAPS16, @PERSON1, who spiked it at us. Katie missed the ball totally. The new girl, @PERSON1, and @CAPS16 all cheered. ì@CAPS18! Very nice job ladies!î one of the coaches praised. It was the end of the second day of tryouts. There was only one more day left. It was hard for me, but I managed to keep it together, be patient, and stay focused. On the last day of tryouts, we got to know our teams. Me, @CAPS16, and @PERSON1, plus some other good girls, made the A-team! So, that's a time where I had to be really patient and stay determined, and I still came through and succeeded.
1493	19479	7	3	Once upon a time there was a boy named @PERSON1. He was at the secretary of state and patiently waited in line to get his paperwork done. After receiving the necessary forms, he sat down to fill them out. However, the process was slow, and he grew increasingly frustrated as time passed. Eventually, it was his turn, but just as he was about to be served, the person in front of him left to retrieve their secretary card. Finally, when his turn came, @PERSON1 greeted the lady behind the desk with a smile. She processed his paperwork, took his picture, and handed him his license. And so, @PERSON1's visit to the secretary of state came to a successful end.
1494	19480	7	3	I was patient when my dog had to go to the vet. He was really sick because he had heartworms. My mom and I waited for about two hours. I was not as patient as my mom because I kept asking her what was going on. After the operation was done, we had to wait even longer until we got my dog back, almost three hours. When the vet finally called us, we went and got my dog. The doctor said that he had to rest until he could be up and moving again. It was finally okay, and we played in the snow all afternoon. It was a relief to see my dog healthy again after such a difficult time.

We had a blast and it was all worth the wait!
1496	19482	7	3	Patience is crucial in various aspects of life, including achieving goals and gaining respect. When my cousin, a devoted fan of @PERSON1, couldn't secure tickets to his concert online, she displayed remarkable patience and determination. Despite the sold-out status, she learned about a ticket giveaway on the morning of the event. Arriving at the venue at @NUM1 am, she found herself among hundreds of eager fans ahead of her in line. Enduring several hours of waiting without complaint, she eventually reached the ticket booth and secured her coveted seats.  By exhibiting patience and resilience, my cousin not only obtained tickets but also scored fifth-row seats close to @PERSON1. Her experience serves as a testament to the power of patience in achieving positive outcomes. Witnessing her unwavering dedication has inspired me to embrace patience in my endeavors, knowing that it can lead to rewarding results. In a world where instant gratification often prevails, my cousin's story highlights the value of patience in attaining success and earning respect.
1497	19484	7	3	When I went to the game with @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and his mom and dad, @PERSON1, who has Down syndrome, showed his love for watching games and cheering on the players. He enjoys giving high fives to the athletes after they finish playing. Despite his unique way of talking about sports and cartoons, I respected him and did not laugh at him. He treats everyone as his friend and gets excited when his favorite team has the ball, but also gets upset when they are not doing well. I reminded him to be patient when he wanted to go onto the field to watch the game up close. After the game, his mom took us to @LOCATION1's house, where we chatted and laughed together, even during a long traffic jam. This experience taught me the value of patience in dealing with different situations.
1498	19485	7	3	Are you patient? Well, I am always patient. I am going to tell you a time when I was patient at school. One day I had to register for school, and it was very busy. I had to wait in every line for at least ten to fifteen minutes. When I finally got all my paperwork done, I had to take my ID picture. Unfortunately, when the picture came out, my eyes were closed. So, I had to wait in line again to take more pictures. After that, I went to get my other ID. I had to wait for about twenty minutes. When the second ID came out, it was messed up. The lady assured me that I would receive the correct one once I started school. That experience taught me the value of patience in overcoming obstacles and challenges.
1499	19488	7	3	A time when I patient was during last week. My friends and I were waiting in line to get an autograph of the Detroit Tigers first baseman Miguel Cabrera. It was going to be exciting to meet the players. We waited patiently for our turn and finally got to meet Cabrera and get his autograph. It was a memorable experience that was worth the wait.
1500	19489	7	3	I was patient when I went to the doctors. When I went to the doctors me and my mom wait patient for a long time.

1501	19490	7	3	On the day I was at a water park, eager to go on a water slide, I found myself waiting in a long line with many people ahead of me. The scorching heat made me realize the ground was too hot to stand on without flip flops. Despite the discomfort, my determination to experience the water slide kept me in line. As I stood there, I reminded myself to stay patient and hoped that the ride would be worth the wait. I was determined to have fun on this slide, no matter what.
1502	19491	7	3	I was patient last year when I was waiting for my homework to be completed, and it seemed like it was taking forever. I find being patient to be boring and frustrating. It feels like time is dragging on endlessly when you have to wait for something. Moreover, when you are patient, you often end up with a headache from the stress of waiting. Sometimes, being patient can even get you into trouble with your parents or teachers for being too talkative or restless. That's why I don't like being patient - it just leads to discomfort and trouble.
1503	19492	7	3	Patience is a valuable virtue that allows individuals to wait for extended periods without becoming frustrated or complaining. It is especially evident in situations such as waiting in line for hours, where patience is essential to maintaining composure. Patience is required in various aspects of life, including playing games, driving in traffic, waiting for meals, enduring long school days, and more. Developing patience can lead to better coping mechanisms and a more peaceful mindset in dealing with life's challenges.
1504	19493	7	3	every school year I wait patiently for summer vacation. It feels like an eternity waiting for summer vacation, but it is definitely worth it. The anticipation builds as the school year progresses, and finally, when summer vacation arrives, it is a time of relaxation and freedom. I look forward to the break from schoolwork and the chance to unwind and enjoy the sunny days. Summer vacation is a time to recharge and make memories that will last a lifetime.

1506	19495	7	3	One time when I was patient, I received a wonderful surprise. Last year, I asked for a special gift from a certain organization, and my parents said maybe. Despite not receiving an immediate answer, I remained patient throughout the year. I was confident that I would eventually get what I had asked for. When the day finally arrived, I was presented with a beautiful blue item from the organization, accompanied by five new accessories to go along with it. The anticipation and wait had been challenging, but the reward was well worth it. I cherished the gift even more because I had patiently waited for it.
1507	19496	7	3	@CAPS1 and @CAPS1 were on a mission to get a new book that @CAPS4 had been eagerly waiting for.

1509	19498	7	3	Patience, it's something that my family doesn't have. Here is the story. While I am doing the dishes, my little brother is crying because my little sister hit him. So, since he is crying, my little sister starts to cry too. Meanwhile, my stepdad is playing on his iPhone, oblivious to the chaos unfolding. Eventually, he yells at my little brother, escalating the situation. Trying to restore peace, I manage to calm down my little sister, but my little brother continues to cry. Frustrated, I call my older brother to intervene, who takes my little brother downstairs to calm him down. Finally, the chaos subsides, and I am able to soothe my little sister. Despite the lack of patience displayed by my stepdad, the rest of my family comes together to support each other in the end.

We werenít yelling, we were being very calm and patient. She was still screaming so we just left her alone to scream. Then, our mom came home. @PERSON3 and I told our mom what had happened. Then our mom told @PERSON2 she is grounded, no longer allowed to talk, text, or even talk to @PERSON1 at school. My mom also thanked @PERSON3 and I for being so patient. So that is my story about how I was patient. Iím not the most patient person, but I have my times, and so should everyone else. Life is so much better in the long run if you are patient!   Life can be challenging, especially when dealing with difficult situations and people. Being patient and remaining calm can help to navigate through tough times and resolve conflicts effectively.

1511	19500	7	3	A time when my father was patient was last week when I was late for school. Despite the pressure to rush, he remained calm and did not honk the car horn or drive aggressively. Another instance of his patience was when I was playing in a basketball game that went into overtime. He waited outside patiently until the game was over. Lastly, he showed patience when we were at a subway restaurant and my food took longer than expected. In conclusion, my father has demonstrated patience in various situations, showing his ability to remain composed and understanding.
1512	19501	7	3	"As we walked in, the smell of mouthwash filled our noses. We approached the front desk where a short, elderly lady with gray hair and glasses greeted us warmly. ""Please take a seat in our waiting area, and your dentist will be with you shortly,"" she said with a smile. We made our way to the waiting room, where my mom and brother settled on the couch, and I found a small chair in the corner. While my brother entertained himself with papers and crayons, I grew increasingly restless as time passed. Despite my constant inquiries, my mom only advised me to be patient. After what felt like an eternity, I could no longer contain my impatience and began pacing back and forth. Just as I was about to lose my composure, a dental assistant appeared at the doorway, calling my name for the appointment. Relieved that the wait was finally over, I eagerly followed her to the examination room."
1513	19502	7	3	Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to be patient for various things, such as enduring long lectures, waiting for birthdays, and sitting through orchestra concerts. Sometimes, despite your patience, the awaited event may not unfold as expected, leaving you disappointed. Long lectures can test your patience, especially when you're eager to leave. Birthdays often require waiting for the cake to be cut after the candles are blown out. In the case of orchestra concerts, there may be moments of boredom before the enjoyable parts, like the cheese cake sampling station, arrive. Enduring beginner performances and potential video recordings of mistakes can be trying, but the anticipation of the cheese cake makes it worthwhile.   As a member of the orchestra, the upcoming orchestra performance is conflicting with a cross-country meet on the same day. Balancing both events will require patience and resilience. Despite the hectic schedule, the determination to navigate through the day with patience remains strong. The culmination of school, the meet, and the orchestra performance will test your endurance, but the anticipation of a fulfilling day keeps you motivated. In the face of challenges and obstacles, the key is to remain patient and focused, knowing that the rewards will follow in due time. Patience truly is a virtue in navigating through life's various waiting games.
1514	19503	7	3	Even though you may not realize it, patience plays a role in many aspects of our lives. Whether it's waiting in line or working towards a goal, patience is always present. I remember a time when I had to exercise patience. One scorching day, my family and I decided to visit a water park. As we arrived, we eagerly rushed to the first pool, but I waited patiently for my dad to catch up. Later, we ventured to the park's main attraction, a massive water slide that required climbing several flights of stairs. Despite the long wait, the thrilling experience at the top made it all worth it in the end. Patience truly pays off in unexpected ways, teaching us valuable lessons along the journey.
1515	19504	7	3	My story is about a time when I was patient was in (@DATE1). I was waiting for ì@CAPS1î to come. I was being patient because we were going to @LOCATION2. I couldnít wait to go but I remembered to be ìpatientî. The less I thought about it the faster time passed by. Then it came, it was time to head to ì@LOCATION2î when were in the car on our way there I couldnít wait any longer! More and more roads passed by. We passed city to city; state to state. It was the next day already and I still couldnít wait. During the long ride I fell asleep when I had woke up, we were already there. I had to nare patience because riding in a car from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 is a long drive. While being patient I got to see many things and travelled through different states. As we finally arrived, the journey was worth the wait, and I learned the value of being patient and enjoying the journey as much as the destination.
1516	19505	7	3	Patience is a virtue that many people lack. In my personal experience, patience was crucial. A few years back, I found myself waiting in a hot car while my mom ran errands. Despite the discomfort and frustration, I made a conscious effort to remain patient. As the minutes turned into hours, I resisted the urge to become angry. Eventually, my mom returned, and I was grateful that I had maintained my composure. This incident taught me the importance of patience in challenging situations. It is a quality that can bring peace and understanding, even in moments of inconvenience. In the end, my decision to exercise patience proved to be the right choice.
1517	19506	7	3	Sometimes on days when my patience is running thin, I have to control myself from snapping at someone or saying something mean. For example, when my family goes camping at Lake location1, we always take a longer hike through the woods and over logs instead of the shorter, easier route. I often find myself getting frustrated and complaining the whole way there. However, after a refreshing swim in the cold water, my mood improves. Yet, when we return and dinner isn't ready, my impatience flares up again. Despite these moments of frustration, the time spent in nature and with my family always brings me joy in the end.
1518	19507	7	3	Two years ago, my two year old cousin @PERSON1 was adopted from @LOCATION3. My aunt, uncle and cousin had to wait three years before they could even see a picture of her and start doing paperwork. The people at the orphanage were not being very fair to them. They let almost @NUM1 people who had tried to adopt a child a year later after my aunt and uncle tried go first. They had to go all the way to @LOCATION3 from where they lived, which was @LOCATION1, and wait three days until they could just see her. The orphanage made them wait another week to adopt her. Finally, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. They went through more paper work, said that they would always take care of her, and then went home. After that, @PERSON1 didnít sleep at all the first week or so. Since @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2. She would sleep during the day and wakeup at night they eventually taught her to sleep during the night. That girl took a lot of patience but she was finally adopted.  After the initial adjustment period, @PERSON1 started to settle into her new life with her loving family. Over time, she became more comfortable and began to thrive in her new environment. Despite the challenges they faced in the adoption process, my aunt and uncle were overjoyed to have @PERSON1 as part of their family. The bond that they shared only grew stronger with each passing day, and they were grateful for the opportunity to provide her with a happy and stable home.
1519	19508	7	3	The time I was patient was last summer when we went to Cedar Point. There was a long line for the roller coaster we wanted to ride, but when we finally reached the front, the ride broke down. We had to move to another attraction, and although I really needed to use the bathroom, I knew I had to wait. I left the line briefly to relieve myself, but when I returned, the line had gotten even longer. Despite the frustration, I remained patient and waited my turn. In the end, my patience paid off, and I was able to enjoy the ride with my friends. It was a lesson in staying calm and composed in unexpected situations.
1520	19509	7	3	My dad @PERSON1 is patient everyday. He goes to work and canít wait to come home, but he doesnít go crazy like me because I wanna leave. No, he does his work and waits till @NUM1 when he can leave and go home. He always patiently waits till @NUM1. My dad has always been a patient person, and I look up to him because of that patience. His ability to stay calm and composed in any situation is truly admirable.
1521	19510	7	3	I was at the great wolf lodge and we could not go in because some kid poop in the pool and a big part of the pool was brown we could not go in for three hours and it was very boring then we went outside and there was a pool there the whole time. Despite the inconvenience of the situation, we were able to find an alternative and enjoy our time at the outdoor pool instead.
1522	19511	7	3	A time when I was patient, I have been patient plenty of times but one I mostly remember is when I was waiting for a friend to get home from school (I missed school) while waiting I did plenty of things. I played my Xbox and got on the computer. But while playing Xbox, I saw one of my friends come online. He lives in Moures. After he got online we played most of the day then I got off and watched TV because I was bored. Nothing was on so I got on the computer, still bored. So I tried to take a nap, didn't work. After that, I tried to play my Xbox but after another hour it got boring. I still played for about another half an hour till I just redid my account while listening to music and played some more till he got online. We played all day till night.
1523	19512	7	3	"My friend @PERSON1 was patient last week in the lunch line, he waited about @NUM1 minutes. I got to the cafeteria before many of the other students were in line. He was behind the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders. @PERSON1 was patient by not cutting in front of them and didn't complain. The line was longer because there was a presentation and then it was lunch, the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders didn't have lunch yet so that was why @PERSON1 had to wait. I thought he did a good job waiting. When many students were filling up the tables I saved @PERSON1 a seat next to me. @PERSON1 finally got his lunch and I saw him go over to the salad and milk cooler and grab an orange juice. I waved to him across the room and he saw me. When he came and sat down next to me I told him he did a good job being patient and waiting to get his lunch. I was almost done with my macaroni and cheese when @PERSON1 said, ""Thanks for saving a seat for me."" When we both finished we took care of our trays and walked down the hall to the gym. We were glad we didn't have to be in that loud, crowded cafeteria. In the gym, other kids were playing a small basketball game. @PERSON1 grabbed a basketball. I waited until the @NUM2 graders were done, I was patient, the teacher then told the younger students to go back to class, when I got the ball I asked @PERSON1 if he wanted to play around the world. It was one of @PERSON1's and my favorite games we played."
1524	19513	7	3	"Boom! Boom! I knew my cousins were at the door because they were all heavy-handed. So I ran downstairs and opened the door to find them waiting. We all piled into the van, eager for a day of fun as my mom reminded us to be patient. The drive was long and a bit boring, but we knew it would be worth it once we reached our destination in Ohio.  After a quick stop for some food, we continued on our journey. When we finally arrived at the park, we headed straight for the roller coasters. The lines were long, and we had to wait patiently for our turn on each ride. Despite the wait, we knew the thrill of the ride would be worth it.  As we rode more and more attractions, we found that the best one was the ""Diagster."" The adrenaline rush was incredible, and we all agreed it was the highlight of our day. When it was time to head back to the van, we reflected on the fun we had and how being patient had paid off in the end.  Overall, it was a day filled with excitement, thrills, and the importance of patience. We were all grateful for the memories made and the time spent together."
1525	19514	7	3	One day me and my friend @CAPS1 were going to @CAPS2 to Alabama. It was the most boring thing @CAPS3!

But we did get to count waffle haoes because the farther south you go the more people like waffles. Iím not kidding there was at least one waffle ???. And a kind of ??? was we werenít just going to Alabama, we were going to the @CAPS5 of Alabama. So when we finally ??? still had to wait @NUM2 more hours. But when we finally got there we had a blast! And I have to admit one good thing came from experience ??? rides donít bother us??? ??? We made some great memories and had a lot of fun once we reached our destination.
1526	19515	7	3	I am going to tell you about a time when I was patient. My cousin was at my house and needed help on math homework. Because no one else was home, I had to help him. We sat on the couch and I helped him. The reason I had to be patient was because he didnít know how to do any of it. So I had to sit there and teach him how to do it, and then explain how I got the answer. And did I mention that he had three pages to do. It was almost two hours before we were done with it all. And that was a time when I had to be patient.
1527	19516	7	3	@CAPS2 father's patience and perseverance in the face of unemployment is truly admirable. Despite the challenges he has faced in his job search, he has remained determined and hopeful. His upcoming job interview in San @CAPS1 is a glimmer of hope, and I am confident that his persistence will pay off. I am grateful to have such a resilient and patient role model in my life. No matter the outcome of his job search, I will always look up to @CAPS2 father for his unwavering strength and positivity. He will forever be my hero and beloved role model.
1528	19517	7	3	Patience is indeed a challenging virtue for some individuals. I recall a time when I found myself at a large party without any of my friends or cousins in attendance. Feeling bored and eager to leave, I requested to go home, only to be denied by my mother. Reluctantly, I settled down and patiently waited for what seemed like an eternity. Eventually, we departed and returned home. The following day, my mother arranged for me to spend the night at my cousin's house as a reward for my patience at the party. This experience taught me that exercising patience can lead to positive outcomes. By remaining patient, we may be rewarded with unexpected opportunities or rewards.
1529	19518	7	3	"Melay was a little girl, waiting for her parents in the bush. She didn't know why they were always so distressed now. It must be something she did, she thought. Her sister was not as patient as she was when waiting. Melay had to be doing something all the time. So when her parents didn't come and somebody else did, she wasn't happy. Boys came walking along the road, and they were carrying guns. Melay was thinking, ""These boys waiting along the street, are they crazy!"" If their parents told them to hide, it was always for a good reason. She sat there thinking about this when she heard a loud crack! ""What was that?"" she thought. She looked to where her sister was supposed to be, but she wasn't there. ""Where was she?"" she wondered. She looked out and saw the boy soldiers standing around laughing. ""What were they laughing at?"" she looked closer and saw that it was her sister. ""No!"" she cried out. ""Where are my parents? They should be here by now,"" she thought. The boy soldiers were walking towards her. That's when she saw another two lifeless bodies. She found out that they were her parents. She started running, running away from tragedy. She made it a mile before she had to hide in a bush. The boy soldiers were walking around looking for her. Suddenly, one of them cried out, ""There she is!"" They dragged her out of the bush and walked for what seemed to be forever. Finally, they reached a building. Melay was screaming at herself, ""If only I waited. If only I waited."" They took her into a room, and the boss raped her. Then, he quickly shot her to death and dragged her into a dumpster. If only she had waited."
1530	19519	7	3	I remember this hot day when I was on my way to the dentist. It was the second-to-last day of school, and I left about forty-five minutes early. My appointment was at four-thirty. There were about fifteen people ahead of me when I arrived at the dentist's office. As four-thirty approached, I decided to grab a quick snack across the street. After waiting for a while, I inquired about my appointment time with the front desk manager. She checked and informed me that I could go in right away. I was pleased with myself for being patient, and I even received a toothbrush as a reward for my patience.
1531	19520	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was when I needed help with my schoolwork. My dad is very smart so whenever I needed help, I usually ask him for help. Well, I get out of school at 3:00 PM, and my dad gets home at 6:00 PM. So, if I wanted his help, I would have to wait for him to come home. I remember one particular day when I had a difficult homework assignment that needed his assistance. I kept the homework that needed help in my backpack until my dad arrived. I focused on completing the other assignments that I could do on my own in the meantime.   After finishing all my other homework, I waited patiently for my dad to come home. As I sat down to eat dinner, I was eager for his help and guidance. Finally, when my dad arrived, he sat down with me and explained the challenging assignment. His guidance was invaluable, and with his help, I was able to understand the concept much better.   Through this experience, I learned the importance of patience and perseverance when seeking help. Waiting for my dad to come home and assist me taught me the value of being patient and not rushing through things. In the end, the wait was worth it, as I was able to grasp the concept with my dad's help. This experience taught me the importance of patience in learning and seeking help when needed.
1532	19521	7	3	Once there was a lonely puppy who decided to reach out by sending a letter to a random address. Patiently, he waited for a response, and after a few weeks, he received a reply from another puppy. They quickly formed a strong bond and became the best of friends. This heartwarming tale teaches us that sometimes, all it takes is a little patience for good things to come our way.
1533	19522	7	3	"On @DATE1 my friend @CAPS1 and I climbed on the bus headed for @PERSON1 at @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @CAPS1 and I were with our church group, and we were together till @NUM1 am. We had been riding all different rides all day and we got in line for the @CAPS4. The sign out front said ""wait from this @CAPS3 is @NUM2 hours,"" but we were going to wait it out. I was around @NUM3 then so that would put us on the ride around @NUM4. We soon found out that @PERSON1 also started at @NUM5 pm and lucky us we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around @NUM6 pm all of us were pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade. About every five minutes we would hear loud obnoxious screams, and we always heard mouths running like they were in a race. Then at about @NUM4 pm we got on the ride, and we all loved it. When we got off someone said ""let's go on the @CAPS6,"" all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over I could smell sweet treats and taste an elephant ear on my tongue. Little did we know that we would have to walk through @CAPS7. CarnEvil was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It was not a good idea given the fact that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the @LOCATION1 there was a giant line, but it was only going to take forty-five minutes. The ride was over and boy did my head hurt from hitting my head on my headrest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton more spooky attractions. We found out later that we had waited in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and headed home. That day I learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did."
1534	19523	7	3	A time when I was patient was when we were leaving on vacation. It seemed like I had been waiting forever to go to @LOCATION1, really it had only been about a month. I was so excited, but I had to be really patient. Sometimes its hard for me to be patient because I like things to be done right away, so waiting a month to go to @LOCATION1 was very hard for me. The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited I couldn’t sleep at all. The day we left I was so excited and I was running all around the house yelling. Finally we loaded up the car and left for @LOCATION1. We drove our car there so it took almost @NUM1 days. But it was worth it, @LOCATION1 was really fun and pretty. We also went to @ORGANIZATION1 and had an awesome time. I had to be patient at @ORGANIZATION1 since there were long lines for the rides, so we had to wait a while. I had a really fun time in @LOCATION1! Additionally, we explored the local cuisine and enjoyed delicious meals at various restaurants. The landscapes and scenery at @LOCATION1 were breathtaking, and I couldn't help but take countless photos to capture the beauty. Despite the long journey and waiting in lines, the overall experience was incredibly rewarding and unforgettable. I learned the value of patience and how it can lead to amazing adventures and memories. I can't wait to plan my next vacation and practice patience once again for another exciting trip.
1535	19524	7	3	Everybody uses patience in their life, and for me, it is a daily necessity in my basketball practice. One particular situation that requires patience is when my teammates don't pay attention. It can be frustrating when they goof off, leading our coach to intervene and discipline us. This lack of focus can also cause confusion among team members, especially those who take longer to catch on to the drills or plays. Furthermore, welcoming new members to the team halfway through the season can test my patience, especially when they struggle to perform well initially. Despite these challenges, I have learned the importance of patience over the years and understand how crucial it is for maintaining good sportsmanship. Without patience, I would not be able to effectively deal with these situations and continue to participate in sports teams and clubs.
1536	19525	7	3	"I remember a time when I was patient, it was kind of hard to just there waiting on the doctor to call my name. But I suffered through it. Instead of me getting mad about how the lady haven't called my name yet, after waiting like 30 minutes. I just turned my music player on and listened to my music while reading a magazine. Before I knew it, the nurse called my name, ""John"" she said with a smile on her face. So I got up and went to the room she directed me in. When I left the doctor's office and I was going on, I thought to myself ""maybe being patient isn't that bad after all!"""
1537	19526	7	3	Almost every time you need to be patient when you are at the doctors or in the hospital. What I do to pass time when Iím at the doctors is play I spy. I play it with my mom every time. There is usually a lot of people at the doctors when I go. There is magazines but I think they are boring. Therefore I play I spy to stay patient. Otherwise I would be very very bored.  Sometimes, the wait at the doctor's office can feel never-ending. However, playing games like I spy can make the time pass more quickly. It's a simple yet effective way to stay entertained while waiting for your appointment. Plus, it's a great way to bond with whoever you are with, whether it's a family member or a friend. So next time you find yourself stuck in the waiting room, give I spy a try - it might just make your visit to the doctor a little more enjoyable.
1538	19527	7	3	After waiting in the lobby filled with crying babies, I finally heard my name being called. Relief washed over me as I followed the nurse to the examination room. The doctor quickly assessed my condition and provided the necessary treatment. Despite the inconvenience of spending my birthday at the doctor's office, I was grateful for the care I received. Later, when I returned home, my family surprised me with a birthday cake and presents, making the day memorable despite the unexpected trip to the doctor.
1539	19528	7	3	"A time when someone was patient was when a guy named @PERSON2 was driving and a little girl named @PERSON1 was walking on the side walk and it was a red light. She yelled out loud ""go old man."" The old man went and she followed him to the store and she asked what was that and @PERSON2 said that was nothing. She accused him of trying to hit her and rushing her, but @PERSON2 told her to learn how to control her impatience. Patience is indeed a virtue that requires practice and self-control in challenging situations. It is important to remain calm and composed, even when faced with provocation or impatience from others. Through patience, we can avoid unnecessary conflicts and misunderstandings, leading to smoother interactions and better relationships with those around us."
1540	19529	7	3	ì@CAPS1!î @CAPS2 whined, her voice escalating into a wail. ìYou canít do this to me. Iím ten!î ì@CAPS2, calm down. I know you are ten, and at that, a very responsive ten year old. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 I have told you before, I canít leave you at the house all @DATE1. Your father and I have work honey!î ì@CAPS4 canít you just hire a babysitter? What about @PERSON3? @CAPS13 babysitted last year!î @CAPS2ís mother sighed. ìI know you liked @PERSON3, @CAPS4 @CAPS13 just wasnít fit to the requirements I was looking for. Besides, you @CAPS21 you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try and help at the @CAPS16?î @CAPS2 used her well practiced glare at her mother that @CAPS21 ì@CAPS7 if!î. This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the fullers. @CAPS12, @CAPS2ís mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 countyís only day care, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name made @CAPS2 want to gag. ì@CAPS12 remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you!î @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started to pull out of the driveway. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated ì@CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environmentî @CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @CAPS13 turned back to see if @CAPS13 could spot her motherís red, battered, @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. @CAPS4 all @CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, ì@CAPS12, why donít you play with little @PERSON4?î @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting ìlittleî @PERSON4 in her arms, actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when theyíve asked to play ìoneî for the billionth time. ì@CAPS2 we need to talk.î @CAPS21 the middle aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side,î honey, youíve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy were you an attention hog!î @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 regretted yelling. @CAPS13 smiled and went to find @PERSON4. Maybe heíd still be game for you. As @CAPS2 spent the day at the daycare, she learned the importance of patience and understanding when dealing with younger children. The experience helped her appreciate the efforts her parents put in to care for her while balancing work responsibilities.
1541	19530	7	3	"I was patient about getting my phone. I had to act extra special so my mom could decide when I would get my phone. It was a sunny morning and I had to go to school, but I was acting very patient so my mom would think it was time for me to have my new phone. When I got home, I was acting like a pleasant little angel. But she still didn't say it was time to get a phone. The next day, I acted the same way but better. I still didn't get it, and I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs. The following day, I cooked my mom some breakfast and was satisfied that it was the day to get my phone. She just hugged me and thanked me with a smirk on her face. She was waiting for me to burst out shouting, but I knew what she was trying to do, so I said ""you're welcome"" although I was feeling intense. The next day, I dressed very professionally and made my own breakfast to impress her. I ate and walked to school. When I got home, my mom was up and said, ""Come on, I have to take you to get something."" I smiled so hard that I felt like my mouth was going to fall out. We stopped at my friend's house, and my mom gave me my brown shoe that I left there. We got home, and I ran straight to my room to do my homework. The last day of the week, I mopped all day, still being patient. Then, I stayed at my friend's house for two days. On the fourth day, my mom was up when I got ready for school and said, ""You can have your phone now."" I hugged her tight and ran out the door eagerly to try it out."
1542	19533	7	3	A time when I was patient was on Christmas morning. I waited eagerly to open our presents at nine-thirty in the morning, and the anticipation felt like forever. To pass the time, I watched television for two hours until it was time to open the gifts. Despite thinking that the wait would be difficult, I managed to make it through. The day turned out to be even more enjoyable than I had expected. I prepared breakfast in bed for my family and gave thoughtful gifts, such as perfume for my mom and a bright orange sweatshirt for my dad. Although my mom may not use the perfume, I was happy to receive it myself. Overall, it was a memorable and joyous Christmas celebration filled with love and gratitude.
1543	19534	7	3	One time me and my family were at an amusement park over the weekend. My sister really wanted to go on all of the small kiddie rides with me but I didnít feel like it. I wanted to go on one of the fastest and tallest rides there, The Cyclone. It looked really cool so my dad and I ran over to the entrance, but when we got there the wait time on the board said one hour and forty-five minutes. I really wanted to go on this ride but it wasn't worth standing in that long line. So when the line started moving and we were halfway there, the signs said 45 minutes. I told my dad maybe we should do this another day. But my dad said that weíll be through soon and he told me to just watch the people on it go by and not talk. We moved up only a little and the time was at 30 minutes, so my dad said maybe we should do this another day and then we left the line to find my mom and sister.
1544	19535	7	3	Being patient can be a challenging task, especially for those who are not naturally inclined towards it. In my case, I had to learn to be patient while waiting for letters from my dad, who lived far away in a place called @LOCATION1. Despite my initial impatience, I found ways to occupy my time and distract myself, such as drawing, reading, and helping out with animals at my mother's house. However, even when my dad finally arrived, I had to wait a little longer for him to bring the promised milk on @DATE2. Through this experience, I realized that patience requires focus and perseverance, but the rewards can be well worth the wait.
1545	19536	7	3	I was patient one time, really patient but kinda went like this. It was @CAPS1 and my mom a I went shopping for presents. So my mom and I went to the mall and walked into Target, and I already knew what I was going to get my brother, the new game @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 it was perfect. But my mom wouldn't let me buy it so I just bought him a Target gift card for @MONEY1. I had to hide it for almost a month, but I really wanted to know what my mom got for my brother and me, but she wouldn't tell me so I had to be patient. And when @CAPS1 came, I was so surprised because my mom bought @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 for me and my brother.
1546	19537	7	3	Once my friend @PERSON1 was very patient, he waited @NUM1 months for the Xbox @NUM2 game @CAPS1 v.s @CAPS2. He quietly waited day after day for the game. But one day after school it arrived. Excitedly, he quickly unwrapped the package and inserted the game into his console. The hours flew by as he immersed himself in the virtual world, battling opponents and completing missions. The wait was worth it, as the game exceeded his expectations. His patience had finally paid off, and he was thrilled to finally experience the game he had been eagerly anticipating.
1547	19538	7	3	The patient player. Once when I was four and my sister was two, I was playing basketball and my sister always wanted what I had and we always fought over something, so my sister came up and grabed the ball from me and when we were in the middle of fighting my mom told me to just stand and let her have the ball sheíll just walk away. So then I stood there patiently and waited. My sister ended up getting so bored she just droped the ball and left, she did exactly as my mom had said, then when I was playing basketball again she ran up and took the ball, so I just went inside and played videogames.
1548	19539	7	3	When I had to go for my check-up with my asthma doctor, I found myself waiting in a waiting room filled with various activities to pass the time. I kept myself busy with crossword puzzles, observing the different kinds of fish in the tank, and delving into a book. The doctor eventually called my name, apologizing for the wait, but I assured him that it was fine. He commended me for being patient and kind, which made me strive to exhibit those qualities even more while waiting for others. Since then, every time I visit that same doctor, he always treats me with extra care and kindness. It has taught me that treating others well and being patient can lead to positive outcomes and compliments, making both parties feel good. I aim to continue embodying these qualities in my interactions with others, as it can make a significant impact on how we are perceived and the experiences we have.
1549	19540	7	3	When my mom, @PERSON1 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was really fun. @CAPS1 because I wanted a lot of stuff that my family couldnít afford, my mom was very patient. I guess sheís just naturally patient. I just donít know how she does it. Anyway, throughout the entire store, itís pretty big. Itís two stories tall! My mom got a little angry with me because I kept on getting mad at her. @CAPS1 even though she got really angry with me, she tried to do her best to not show how angry she was in the store. By the time we got home, I was so tired, I couldíve slept for a whole two to three days! We got everything that we needed that night when we went to @ORGANIZATION1.  The next day, we had to put up our nightstands. @CAPS1 I really wanted my dad to put up our new bunk bed. @CAPS1 my mom said that he might not get to it that day. I was almost literally hounding my dad to put up our bed. @CAPS1 when the time came, I was fed @CAPS1 my mom was mad at me because I wanted to sleep in my bed that night. Despite my impatience, my mom's understanding and patience helped us get through the day and complete our tasks. Her calm demeanor and ability to handle my frustrations with grace are qualities I truly admire. In the end, everything worked out, and I learned a valuable lesson about patience and gratitude.
1550	19541	7	3	A time when I was patient was when we drove to Six Flags. It was a long ride because we took a route that went the long way, making the journey to our hotel a day-long affair. Despite feeling tired and restless, I reminded myself to be patient throughout the drive. We encountered some delays and got lost in the area for almost an hour while trying to find our cousins who were joining us. I had the urge to get out of the car and move around, but I forced myself to stay calm and composed. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, we found our hotel. As I unpacked my belongings, I realized that I had managed to be patient for almost an entire day, which was a challenge I didn't think I could overcome in a car. This experience taught me the value of patience in difficult situations.
1551	19542	7	3	The slow service at the restaurant was frustrating, especially after a fun day at the pumpkin patch with my family. Despite our patience, the long wait times for the waitress and our food made the dining experience less enjoyable. It's disappointing when a simple meal outing turns into a test of endurance due to inefficiency. Hopefully, the next time we go out to eat, we'll encounter better service and be able to fully enjoy our time together as a family.
1552	19543	7	3	While waiting for my little sister on Father's Day morning in June, I could barely contain my excitement. I'm not usually a patient person, but this was a special occasion. When I finally got to hold her in my arms, the feeling was indescribable. It's always tough to say goodbye to her, especially when she's calling out my name as I leave. Coming home to her sweet voice is a rare joy, but I cherish every moment I get to spend with her. I eagerly look forward to the next time I can see her again, even though the wait can be difficult.
1553	19544	7	3	At the @CAPS1ís office, I had an @CAPS2 appointment. While waiting in the room for her to return, the @CAPS1 asked me and my foster mom questions. After a brief conversation with another @CAPS1, they returned with the necessary papers. My foster mom accepted them, and the @CAPS1 expressed gratitude for my patience. We exchanged goodbyes, looking forward to the next visit.
1554	19545	7	3	Patient people are the backbone of society, as they possess the ability to endure life's challenges with grace and resilience. Without patience, one may find themselves easily frustrated and unable to navigate the obstacles that come their way. I vividly recall a time from my childhood when I was tested on my patience. I was eager to leave the house to pursue something I desired, but a lengthy phone call unexpectedly delayed my plans. As each minute passed, my patience wore thin until I finally erupted in frustration. However, it was in that moment that I realized the importance of patience. My caregiver, recognizing the need for patience, calmly addressed the situation and prioritized the ongoing call over my impatience. This experience taught me that patience is a virtue that allows us to navigate life's interruptions and challenges with grace. It is a quality that enables us to persevere and thrive, even in the face of adversity. In essence, patience is the key to overcoming obstacles and achieving success in both our personal and professional lives.
1555	19546	7	3	In the @DATE1 time my mom had planned of trip for us to go to @LOCATION1 for two weeks. We were on our way is airport and there was heavy traffic trying to work through but we could not. So my mom starting yelling and I told her to just calm down, assuring her that we will make it. So finally we got to the airport and there were a lot of people, so we had to rush to the check-in counter. After a hectic start, we finally made it through security and boarded our flight to @LOCATION1. This experience taught my mom the importance of patience and how staying calm can help us reach our destination successfully. Ultimately, we made it to @LOCATION1 and enjoyed a wonderful vacation together.
1556	19547	7	3	"A time I was patient was when I was at a dentist office I had to get six teeth pulled. When we where waiting I keep asking my mom ""when are we going when are we going."" When the said ""@CAPS1"" i waked into the room. I asked if i was going to hurt and they said you won't fell a thing."" The doctor put a tube on my mouth and said close your eyes and breath. with out even knowing I fell asleep from the gas. I was asleep for two hours and when I wanted to get out of the chair they said ""no, no, no"" so I sat and sat until @NUM1 minutes later they let me out I was all loope and had to be put in a wheel chair. When I got to the front desk they let me take two toys and my mom gave me wresteler. When we where about to leave my mom talk to the doctor and they took for  ever. When we got in the car my mom took the wheel chair back and we where off. during the ride my mom told me I couldn't go to school that day cause of my teeth. She said not to look in the mirror but I did and it was grass. I had to wait three hours for food and drinks d so I was thirsty. When she said I could eat I was happy. I am still patient cause the doctor said that grawn up teeth would come in a few months but it has been two years and nothing so I am disappointed, but now I have to be patient and wait for my mom to take me to get bcacies which is gonna hurt really bad."
1557	19548	7	3	On a fine summer day I was heading toward the dentist's office. I wasn't thrilled about the visit, but it was necessary. As soon as we arrived, my mom went to the check-in desk while I took a seat. We waited patiently for about 15 minutes until the receptionist called us in. Once inside, a nurse came in to take my vital signs before leaving us to wait a bit longer. After a brief wait, the dentist finally came in to examine my teeth. Thankfully, the appointment went smoothly, and we were soon on our way home, relieved that we didn't have to visit the dentist again anytime soon.
1558	19549	7	3	When I was in the first grade, I had to set up a mobile project. However, as I started setting it up, it broke. We then decided to go to the park and wait for the shop. Eventually, we went to the ice rink and waited in line with others. After paying our money and getting our skates, we started ice skating. That was all we did that day. Later, we returned home to work on our mobile project both inside and outside the house.
1559	19550	7	3	My friend and I were excited to go on a new ride at CAPS1 theme park. The ride was called Shooting the Cat, and since it was a water ride, we were really looking forward to it. We waited for over an hour in line to get on the ride, which was quite boring. After finally experiencing the ride, we decided to try out the roller coaster next. The roller coaster was a lot of fun and made up for the long wait we had for the water ride. Overall, despite the initial disappointment, we ended up having a great time at the theme park.
1560	19553	7	3	One early morning in New York City for a national figure skating competition I completed. I was waiting to hear if I made it to the final round of the event. It was seven in the evening when we left the rink. We went to get a bite to eat and returned to the rink when we were finished. My best friend Sarah also competed in the same event. I knew she would make it to the final round, but I wasnít sure about my chances. After an endless wait, they started calling out the names of the skaters who made it. Sarah's name was called, but mine was not. I felt disappointed, but there was nothing I could do about it.
1561	19554	7	3	@CAPS1, @CAPS1 is a crucial aspect of life that helps shape our character and resilience. Facing challenges and obstacles is what builds our strength and determination. Having @CAPS1 is essential in accomplishing tasks that require patience and perseverance, such as sports or long processes that demand waiting. While adults may possess more @CAPS1 than teenagers, it is something that can be developed and improved over time. With guidance and practice, individuals can cultivate a strong sense of @CAPS1, enabling them to tackle challenges with maturity and determination. Ultimately, having @CAPS1 is a valuable trait that contributes to personal growth and success in various aspects of life.
1562	19555	7	3	To say really Iím not a very patient person, but once I was, I donít really know how. I was waiting in line to pay for some earphones. I loved those earphones they were blue my favorite color. So I was waiting @NUM1 minutes passed then @NUM2 then I lost track of time but I knew it was a long time. Then the cashiers were having trouble with the registers. So I waited longer and longer until some people were trying to fix it. Then I had to wait even longer. I guess I stayed in that line for more than an hour. I really loved those earphones but as much as I wanted them I just couldnít wait any longer. I ì@CAPS1î and put the earphones aside and left the store. I was really mad that day. Two weeks later we came back luckily the earphones were just where I put them. Yesss!!   However, my impatience almost cost me the opportunity to own those beloved earphones. It was a valuable lesson learned about the importance of patience and perseverance.
1563	19556	7	3	One day, my mom was really patient. We were outside this talking to each other. My grandma and grandpa called to see if we wanted to go to their house. Of course my mom said ìyesî. So I went and packed some things to take because they donít have anything. So when we hopped in the car, turned on the radio and was all fine. It was fine for five minutes until traffic was backed up in my sub. I was fine until I got a test saying my cousins were over there. I was so mad but my mom this kept her eyes on the road. I was keep on screaming and saying mom go faster, but she this ignored me. It was like it went through one ear out the other. Then I got a text saying were gonna be playing football in like @NUM1 min. he asked me when are you gonna be here? I said ìI donít knowî of course my brother was already over there because he spent the @TIME1. It was a bad @TIME1. I was still trying to tell mom to hurry up, but didnít listen. So I fell asleep at @NUM2. I thought I went for bed forever, but I woke up at @NUM3 in the same spot. I was devasted. I yelled out the window and said ìwhyî. Then I went to bed again. When I was sleeping I felt the car go faster. The traffic was all gone, until we turned the corner and got stuck, in traffic again. I asked my mom how much longer didnít reply. So I screamed it again and she yelled back ìhereî. I looked out the window and we were here. And I got to play football. Then I heard my mom laughing in the house. I donít know why she didnít talk. Maybe she this wanted to see her mom and dad. I never found out. That was the time my mom was patient.  As we reflect on that day, I realize now that my mom's patience was a display of her love and care for her family. Despite my impatience and frustration, she remained calm and focused, ensuring our safety on the road. It was a lesson for me to appreciate the moments spent with loved ones, even if it means facing unexpected delays. My mom's patience taught me the value of being present and enjoying the journey, no matter how bumpy the road may seem.
1564	19557	7	3	"Awhile back my friends and I made a game called ""hide and go seek"". I had just taken a great hiding spot. I had a great angle in all but one direction. The great thing about this spot was that everyone walked past it to get around in the woods, so usually it didn't require any patience. That's the part I was wrong about. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes until I saw one of the people that were playing. I aim my weapon and fired, according to the rules he was now on my team and under my command. We waited for a while before another player was seen walking close to us. Then my partner got up to fire his weapon at the other player and got shot. He didn't notice me when I crawled away from him, so I was safe. The only problem now was that I needed a new place to hide. I found one quick. Again I was waiting for over twenty minutes. Finally I saw another player and got ready to shoot. When I finally got my weapon from the ground the person was gone. This made me pretty mad since I waited so long and didn't have a single person on my team. I got up and went looking for someone for my team. I was losing my patience and getting frustrated. ""Is anyone even out here?"" I whispered. ""Hey, I got you!"" someone shouted from above. Then a person jumped down from a tree. He told me that the whole time he was watching me. He was waiting for me to get close enough to shoot. This whole time he was waiting with just enough patience to shoot every single person one by one."
1565	19558	7	3	One time I was getting a cool new game, and my mom said we would get it on Friday. However, she had to work late that day, so we had to wait until Saturday to go and buy it. I was a little frustrated at first, but in the end, I was grateful for her efforts in getting me the game. Patience paid off, and I was able to enjoy playing it soon enough.
1566	19559	7	3	A patient person in my life is my mom. My mom is patient because she always drives me to soccer events, practices, friend's homes, and other places if I need to go there. She spends money on our sports, hobbies, and other necessities, always ensuring that we have what we need. She is never short-tempered and is always kind when we are sad or angry, taking the time to comfort us. Additionally, whenever we face challenges in school, she helps us study and supports us in improving our grades. For example, she dedicates about an hour every day to driving me and my brother to various activities like cross country, soccer, and basketball. She also assists us with our homework, spending hours with us when needed. My mom encourages me to do better academically, even though she may feel disappointed when I struggle. She also supports my decision to be a vegetarian, even though it means preparing separate meals. In conclusion, my mom's patience and support make her one of the most caring individuals in my life.
1567	19561	7	3	A time when someone else I know was patient was when my mom was looking for a job. My mom is very very busy. She was the president of a club named @CAPS1-@CAPS2 for about one or two years. But now that she is not the president anymore, she is less busy but still has an important position that requires a lot of work. But with either position, she wasnít earning only money. So she decided that she would get a job. She started looking for jobs online and in the newspapers and things. She couldnít find a job that was right for her. She never complained about it even though she was having a hard time finding a job. She kept on looking and looking. She kept looking for about another year until, finally she found a job at @CAPS3.C.C. she now teaches a computer class for collage or older people. If she liked, she would have ended up with a job that didnít enjoy.  My mom's patience paid off in the end when she found a job that she enjoys at @CAPS3.C.C. Teaching a computer class for collage or older people has brought her fulfillment and satisfaction, showing that perseverance and dedication can lead to rewarding opportunities. I admire her patience and determination throughout the job search process, and I am proud of her for not giving up until she found the right fit for her skills and interests.
1568	19562	7	3	I hate weddings. I love when people get married, but I hate the ceremonies. Theyíre so boring. Especially the long weddings that take like two hours of people just standing there on the altar doing nothing. Iím not the most patient person, so thatís probably why I hate long weddings. ìDo we have to go?î I moaned to my mother. ìItís my cousinís wedding and itís important.î ìFine.î I had to surrender as I put on my new dress and got in the car. The wedding was all the way in the countryside. It usually takes only an hour to get there, but not this time. Our family was about a quarter of the way there when we hit a major traffic jam. ìCome on!î my sister yelled. I just kept quiet. Finally, when the traffic jam cleared up, a dramatic event unfolded. The road we had to go down was closed. So much for taking the short way. We had just entered the town next to the countryside when we got a call from my grandma. ìWhere are you? The ceremony just ended,î she said. ìOh no! We're in the neighboring town, why? Has the reception started yet?î ìNo, but I'm sure you'll make it in time to be there,î she replied. ìThat's good. Hold on.î And just like that, we reached the reception. I was so happy to be there, even if I do hate weddings. ìDid you have fun?î my mom asked as we arrived home. ìSurprisingly, I did, even the car ride was kind of fun,î I said. ìFun? You tend not to be the patient type.î ìI know, but I guess I can be patient when I really need to be,î I replied, feeling a sense of accomplishment.
1569	19563	7	3	A few weeks ago, we had a garage sale and a mom to mom sale. I had to be patient as we waited for customers to stop by our table. During the garage sale, I also set up a lemonade stand to attract more people. Despite making a good amount of money from both sales, we still had some items left over that we decided to donate. It was a bit tiring to go through all our belongings, price them, and then pack everything up at the end of the day. However, seeing people buy the items we no longer needed was satisfying. Overall, the experience of hosting both sales was enjoyable, even though it required a lot of effort. In the end, we were happy with the outcome and glad to have decluttered our home while making some extra money.
