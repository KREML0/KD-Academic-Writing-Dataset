1	20716	8	3	A long time ago when I was in third grade I had a friend @PERSON2 who's mom was in a bad mood. She never laughed and she never smiled. Every time I saw her I would smile at her and all she would do was frown and keep walking. At first I didn't know she was a grouch i just thought she didn't like me or something.When @PERSON2 told me his mom was a grouch I started to laugh and laugh. He asked me what was so funny i told him that i thought his mom didn't like me or something because every time I see his mom I would smile at her and all she will do is frown and walk away. That made my friend laugh we were cracking up so hard that we got in trouble in class. The next day @PERSON2 and I were eating lunch at school when he says to me <hey your pretty good at making people laugh>. I said <no I am not my jokesare horrible>. He said <@CAPS1 lets put them to the test go up to some one new to this school>. I said @CAPS1 so we went around the whole school looking for a new student unfortunately we couldn't find one we heard the bell ring and we ran to our class. We sat in the back of the classroom its only @PERSON2 and I and anempty seat between us. We were excited because our teacher @PERSON1 was going to show us a movie. @PERSON1 got the front of the room andclass today I have an announcement we have a new student in our class say hello to @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 walked through the door. @PERSON1 told @ORGANIZATION1 shecould sit in the back in between @PERSON2 and I. She sat down turned to the both of us and said hello. @PERSON2 gave me a look that said tell her the joke and @CAPS3 him a thumbs up. I turned to @LOCATION1 and said hi I'm @CAPS4 do you want to hear a joke. @ORGANIZATION1 said yeah sure. I started <@CAPS5 knockshe said <who's thereI said <booshe said <boo who?I said <oh don't cry I am right here>. At first she didn't laugh because she didn't get it but duringthe middle of the movie she said <ohhhh I get itand she started to laugh. @PERSON2 turned to me and said <I told you so>. @PERSON2 got this crazy idea that if I spent the night at his house that I could make his mom laugh or at least make her smile. I said <@CAPS1 sounds like a plan>. I asked mt mom if it was @CAPS1 if I could spend the night at @PERSON2 house she said <yeah just make sure its @CAPS1 with his mom>. @PERSON2 asked his mom she said it was @CAPS1. When I got to @PERSON2 house the first thing we did was play video games. When it was dinner time we all sat down at the table to eat @PERSON2 and I were on one side and his parents on the other. When we started eating @PERSON2 told me to tell the joke to his parents i said @CAPS1. So I said to them <@CAPS5 @CAPS5>they replied <who's thereI said <boothey said <boo who?I said <oh don't cry I am right here>. His parents started to laugh and laugh and they keptlaughing for like five minutes. @PERSON2 turned to me and yelled it worked his mom asked what worked. @PERSON2 explained everything to them. His mom told usthat her mom had recently died and that's why she was in a bad mood. After dinner we went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning when my mom came to pick me up she asked me how the sleep over went. I said it was fun I made people laugh. She said @CAPS1 but laughter isn't going to help you clean your roomall i could say was gosh darn it.

I love the physicality of the game, the sweat, and the camaraderie with teammates. The memories made on the field are what truly last a lifetime. I had been part of a local team, Hood Stars, for almost four years, where I had formed strong bonds with my teammates. However, as my fifth year approached, I faced a decision. Should I stay comfortable with my current team or challenge myself by trying out for a more competitive team?  After much contemplation, I decided to take a chance and try out for the new team. The nerves were overwhelming as I approached the field, but the warm welcome and friendly demeanor of the new teammates put me at ease. Laughter filled the air, and I knew instantly that I had made the right choice. The friendships I formed with this new team were invaluable, and I realized the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone to grow both as a player and as a person.  While I had cherished memories with my original team, softball is ultimately about building connections with others and enjoying the game together. I am grateful for the opportunity to have met these wonderful new friends and experienced the joy of playing softball with them. In the end, it's the laughter and camaraderie that make the sport truly special.

I will make fun of my self, do insanely stupid things, and sometimes hurt myself (not in any serious way). When I was little I didn't really understand laughter. For some odd reason I could never tell the difference if people were laughing at something or laughing with it. I was kind of ""special"" in some areas as a kid (I still am today). Still at the tender age of five I loved making people laugh, and being special I would do even crazier things for a laugh. Mind you I was kind of a spaz, and a really big spaz. I was the most hyperactive five year old you will ever meet. For example one time I hit myself in the head with a hammer, another time I was dancing around in class with a pencil in my hand, stabbed myself in the head with it, and needed stitches. One of the craziest times though was a couple days before I had to take pictures and I wanted to go play outside, my mom knowing how ""special"" I was (I got it from her) wouldn't allow me to. The expert persuasive kid I was back then convinced her to let me go outside. Before I could even reach the street I fell head first on to the corner of the sidewalk leaving a huge mark and completely ruining the pictures. Although that might make some people laugh, this is a story about laughter not me being a spaz.  Now that you know that I love making people laugh, I'm ""special"", and that I'm a complete spaz I can get on with the story. Well I was in kindergarten and I loved school because I got to hang out with my friends and play with blocks, that might sound stupid but I was in kindergarten. The only thing I didn't like about kindergarten was bully's. Surprisingly I have never had a bully except kindergarten, but this was a bad bully. He would give me wedgies at story time and the whole deal (which was the best time to do so because the teacher could couldn't see). I still know the bully too, but he's no bully anymore, he's a goody two shoes now which I think is odd. Anyways, kindergarten was a very good year for me except one day (and every day I got a wedgies). That day is what this whole story is about, it's why I told you I love making people laugh, why I told you I'm ""special"", and a spaz, everything in the story circles around this one day, *dramatic pause* in kindergarten. It started out like any other day in kindergarten. I woke up, did my daily routine, hopped in the car, and headed to school. When I got to school I grabbed my daily binder and patted the education sign like a mall cop would pat the observe and report sign. I did all my work and colored (which was basically all my work). It came around break so we ran around the play ground and got are little snack. When we finished getting the last few drops out of our juice boxes we headed over to story time. We were all in the little circle (which was more like a deformed oval) listening to the story, right when I would get into the story and lose my guard I would receive an excruciatingly painful (for a five year old) wedgie. The story was almost finished and our five year old attention spans were wearing thin and we were getting all excited. The story finally finished and we were standing up, and this is where my memory starts to fade. I cracked a really funny joke and the whole kindergarten class erupted into laughter, me being a ""special"" spaz that can't tell if people are laughing at me or with me burst into tears. I remember balling my eyes out at the drinking fountain trying to hide my tears. One of the teachers tried to help me by telling me that they were laughing at my joke. It took me a couple minutes to stop crying but a little longer to realize the were not laughing at me.  To this day I still get reminded by classmates about that day, of course I can laugh about it now but that was in kindergarten, I'm in ninth grade now and for people to remember that is kind of crazy to me. It was a negative experience then, but it turned into a blessing in disguise. It made me grow into a better person, I can tell the difference of laughter and also be okay when people do laugh at me (doing dumb things to make people laugh at me is actually my forte). So remember, being ""special"" could sometimes be the best thing about you, what makes you who you are, what makes you great, what makes you grow, what makes people laugh."
4	20719	8	3	I hang out with my friends, and the one thing we do best is laugh. Sometimes, we laugh for no reason at all. We find humor in running into trash cans, talking about our meals, or imagining funny scenarios like doing laundry in colorful aprons at a laundromat. One memorable incident involved my friend sliding into a trash can in the school hallway, creating hilarious sound effects that still make me chuckle. We also share inside jokes, like the idea of wearing rhinestone-studded aprons to do laundry together. Even discussing a disappointing frozen dinner can turn into a comedic moment. What I cherish most about my friends is our ability to have a great time together, no matter the circumstances. If we ever have a disagreement, we quickly make up because the reasons are usually trivial. For me, friendship is all about having fun, being silly, and sharing laughter with those who truly understand and appreciate your quirks. Looking back, these carefree moments spent with friends will always be cherished as the best days of my life.
5	20721	8	3	Well, I went downtown to meet someone one cold, dark night, feeling a bit lost along the way. After a confusing bus ride, I finally figured out I was downtown. When I called the person I was meeting, they laughed at me for getting lost. Later, when I went to the store, I ended up getting lost again, but my friend called to guide me back. Despite their teasing, we had a good time hanging out. The night was filled with laughter and jokes about me getting lost, but in the end, I realized the importance of having friends to rely on in unfamiliar situations.

I say to him, I'm bored, @CAPS1 do @CAPS18 want to do?"" @PERSON1 replies,""@CAPS2 go make a snowman."" @CAPS3 I agree that that would be fun. @CAPS34 starts reaching for a jacket @CAPS3 gloves, but I stop him @CAPS3 say,"" @CAPS1 are @CAPS18 getting those for?"" ""@CAPS5's not cold @CAPS20."" ""@CAPS6,"" replies @PERSON1. ""@CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18.""  We start our snowman by building the base (The biggest piece for the bottom). @CAPS3 after about @NUM1 minutes the base is almost done, but we notice that we're getting cold. ""@CAPS7 we should go inside?"" @PERSON1 says. ""@CAPS8, I @CAPS7 mom will even make us some hot chocolate."" @CAPS9 off we go back inside hoping for some delectably warm hot chocolate. I see @CAPS11 mom @CAPS3 ask, ""@CAPS10 we have some hot chocolate please?"" ""@CAPS11 @CAPS18 look cold, Of course I'll make @CAPS18 some."" @CAPS9 @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I sit downstairs waiting anxiously for our hot chocolate by the heater to get warm.  ""@CAPS5's ready!"" @CAPS11 mom calls from upstairs. We fly down the hall @CAPS3 rush up the stairs. @CAPS3 to our amazement we find not only hot chocolate but a bag of chips as @CAPS28. ""@CAPS14 mom!"" I say. ""@CAPS14 @CAPS16 @CAPS17!"" says @PERSON1. ""@CAPS18're welcome boys,"" says @CAPS11 mom. @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I sit down at the table @CAPS3 start drinking our hot chocolate, while @CAPS11 mom puts some chips on paper towels for us. I start eating the chips by the handfuls whereas @PERSON1 grabs one, just one. I ask him, ""@CAPS19 did @CAPS18 only grab one @PERSON1?"" @CAPS20 of the corner of his eye @CAPS34 looks at me @CAPS3 slowly brings the chip to his mouth @CAPS3 takes a bite. As @CAPS34 did that I fell @CAPS20 of @CAPS11 chair in a fit of hysterical laughter.  @CAPS11 mom hears the thump of me hitting the floor @CAPS3 runs upstairs to find me laughing. ""@CAPS1's @CAPS9 funny?"" she asks. I say to @PERSON1, ""@CAPS22 her."" @PERSON1 then complies @CAPS3 grabs another chip @CAPS3 while @CAPS34 looks at her from the corner of his eye, slowly brings @CAPS5 to his mouth @CAPS3 takes a bite. I start busting up laughing again, yet @CAPS11 mom doesn't see the humor. She simply asks,"" @CAPS23 is that @CAPS9 funny?"" @PERSON1 replies, ""I have no idea but @CAPS34 just about died from laughter. I start to stop laughing @CAPS3 I'm able to stand up again. I then tell @CAPS11 mom,"" @CAPS5's the way @CAPS34 looks at @CAPS18, @CAPS5 just makes @CAPS18 laugh.""  I then @CAPS35 to do the same thing, but with no effect to @PERSON1. ""@CAPS19 isn't @CAPS5 working?"" I ask. ""@CAPS26 I'm awesome like that @CAPS3 @CAPS18're @NUM2 says. ""@CAPS6, @CAPS28 I'm gonna keep at @CAPS5 until I get @CAPS5 right."" @CAPS9 I @CAPS35 to mimic everything I saw him do, but to no avail. All I made happen was I spilled @CAPS11 hot chocolate all over myself, which made him laugh, albeit not the way I wanted to. ""@CAPS18 want me to @CAPS22 @CAPS18?"" @PERSON1 says. ""@CAPS31!!!! Please!"" I beg. ""@CAPS6, @CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18."" @CAPS34 proceeds then to grab another chip @"
7	20723	8	3	"My best friend, @PERSON1 and I have been close ever since we were @NUM1. We met through @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lessons at our local dance studio. We've stayed close throughout the years because we've always done similar activities. We're very different from each other though. I'm more out going, I like to speak my mind and I'm more carefree. @CAPS4's the opposite. @CAPS4's very conservative and @CAPS4 can take things too seriously. But either way, we manage to even each other out. Finals week had just gotten over, and @LOCATION1 and I had been planning a sleepover all week. We just needed time to relax and have some time to ourselves. When I had gotten home from school, I gave her a quick call. ""@CAPS3?"" @CAPS4 answered. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS12 time did @CAPS16 wanna hang out?"" I asked. ""I was thinking @NUM2?"" ""@CAPS6 good!"" I quickly hung up the phone and gathered up my gear. I grabbed my toothbrush, pillow, pajamas, and my blanket. I put my shoes on and headed back out the door. My dad dropped me off with all of me gear. I had brought my pajamas, my pillow, and an extra blanket. I walked up her sidewalk to her door, knocked, and waited. Only seconds later did @CAPS4 answer it with a big smile across her face. @CAPS4 lead me down to her basement where @CAPS4 had all the junk food set out ready for us to attack. @CAPS4 had gone to the store earlier that day and had bought everything. @CAPS4 had set it all up on her old pool table that nobody used. There were chips, cookies, sodas, candy, chocolate, and pizza. I set my stuff down on the chair in the corner of the room and we feasted. Of course, we could eat all the food. We simply weren't big enough. After eating for almost an hour straight, we laid on her basement floor trying to gain composure. We started laughing at silly little things that came up on commercials on her big screen @CAPS7. Eventually, we got to talking about how each of our finals went. ""I did soo good on all of mine! I'm gonna get ALL A's"" @PERSON1 bragged. @CAPS4 has gotten straight A's every year since middle school. ""I think I did pretty @CAPS8 too, not so sure about a @NUM3 though."" I said as I was laying upside down on the floor. ""@CAPS8, we'll just see tomorrow!"" We finally decided to move ourselves over to the couch on the opposite side of the pool table, so we could face the @CAPS7. It was already @NUM4 in the @TIME1 and we were still on a sugar high. We switched back and forth from watching some old scary movie, and the top @NUM5 music videos of the week. That had passed some time and before we knew it, it was @NUM2 in the @TIME1. @PERSON1 and I were laying on opposite ends of each other. Occasionally, one of us would get some chips or candy from the table. We grew tired to the point where we couldn't keep our eyes open. No one even had enough energy to turn off the overhead light. We fell asleep fast. When I woke-up the next @TIME1, @PERSON1 wasn't laying across from me anymore. @CAPS4 was sitting in the corner chair where I had set my stuff. I looked at the clock, and it was already @NUM4:30 in the afternoon. I looked back and @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 seemed somewhat upset. I shifted around under my blanket so I could face her. ""@CAPS5..."" I grunted, while I was stretching. ""@TIME1."" @CAPS4 said abruptly. @CAPS4 was holding a folded piece of paper in her hand. ""@CAPS12's up?"" I asked, sitting up on the couch. @CAPS4 crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it at me. I picked it up from my lap and unfolded it. It was her report card. I scanned down the paper looking at all of her grades. @CAPS4 had received all A's... and one @CAPS13. @CAPS4 had gotten a @CAPS13 in her @CAPS15 class. I looked up from the paper to see her hands covering her face. I walked over to her kinda amused by how upset @CAPS4 was. ""@CAPS16 got a @CAPS13... and @CAPS16're crying?"" I asked."
8	20724	8	3	Laughter is essential in any relationship, whether it be with friends, loved ones, or colleagues. It helps to lighten the mood, relieve stress, and bring joy to those around you. Sometimes, all it takes is a good laugh to turn a bad day around. When someone is feeling down or struggling, a little bit of laughter can go a long way in cheering them up. It's important to make an effort to laugh every day, even when things seem tough.  Sharing a laugh with a friend or partner can strengthen your bond and create lasting memories. Seeing the people you care about smile and laugh can bring a sense of happiness and connection. Laughter can also help you cope with difficult situations and make life more enjoyable, even in the face of challenges.  In any relationship, laughter is a key ingredient for building a strong and positive connection. It can help you navigate through tough times and keep the bond between you and others strong. So, take a moment to chuckle, giggle, or laugh out loud - it's good for your soul and for those around you. Remember, a little laughter can go a long way in making life brighter and more enjoyable.
9	20725	8	3	I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness. The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth. @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard. My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness. Laughter truly is a universal language that brings people together, heals wounds, and spreads joy in the darkest of times. It is a gift that should be cherished and shared among all, for it is the essence of human connection and happiness.
10	20726	8	3	"Laughter, one of life's greatest gifts. Have you ever laughed so hard that you cried? What about laughed so hard you can't breath, or noise no longer escapes from your lips? I am the type of person that can laugh at something so stupid that when I get done laughing, I don't even know why I started laughing in the first place. I can laugh so hard that nothing comes out at all! It's amazing what laughter can do to a person's heart. The way it makes you feel, the way it makes you act. It's so contagious, and it happens all around us every day. You are never too old for laughter, it happens to the best of us, young or old, it doesn't matter. Laughter has no age limit. One time my friends and I stayed up until three in the morning. We were so delirious and kooky, we acted like crazy people. Now we have the type of relationship where we can laugh at almost anything. Literally almost anything... As we were staying up, we drank lots of soda and had sugary foods to fuel us for the night. We made up songs, we danced around the house, and it felt like we laughed for hours! I laughed until tears were flowing out of my eyes, and I couldn't get a breath out of my heaving lungs. When it gets to the silent laughing, it's even more funny because that person can't control it, and they look so hilarious rocking back and forth with a silly expression on their face, not making any noise at all. Have you ever just laughed for what feels like a lifetime? How did you feel after that ""lifetime"" of laughter? It almost feels like something as powerful as the sun just warms over your heart and soul. When I laugh, I feel all the happiness and emotion flow throughout my entire body. It's one of the greatest feelings in the world, I really can't think of a greater feeling than the warmth that laughter brings. It's so great when you and a friend, or group of friends can sit back and enjoy the laughter you share. Even when you're feeling down, maybe need some cheering up, you can always depend on a laugh to pull you through. No matter what mood I'm in, if I hear someone laughing, it's hard to not join in. Laughing is so contagious! It affects us in our everyday lives. I bet you that you cannot go one day without hearing someone laugh, or you not laughing yourself. I probably laugh about five hundred times a day, if not more. I love hearing people laugh, it brightens my mood and also my day. I would most definitely say laughter is very important and beneficial for a relationship. I mean imagine the world without laughter. Boring, right? My advice, laugh like you heard the funniest thing in the world. Laugh like there is no tomorrow. Who cares if people think it's dumb. You'll feel much better after you have that tear-induced, hard to breath, silent but oh-so therapeutic laugh. Laughter really is the shortest distance between people!"
11	20727	8	3	Laughter is a vital part of our daily lives, bringing joy and light-heartedness to our interactions with others. Whether it's sharing a joke with friends, enjoying the antics of our pets, or experiencing the simple pleasures of nature, laughter is a universal language that connects us all. One memorable moment of laughter for me was a day spent at the beach with my friend and our horses. As we galloped along the shore, feeling the wind in our hair and the salty sea breeze on our faces, we couldn't help but laugh at the sheer exhilaration of the moment. Even as the day came to a close and we prepared to head home, the memory of our laughter and the shared experiences with our horses stayed with me, reminding me of the importance of finding joy and humor in every day. Laughter truly is the best medicine, and I am grateful for the moments of lightness and happiness it brings to my life.
12	20728	8	3	"Starting a story out with two 5-year-old boys named Jack and Max can already be considered a comedy. Those are the names of my identical twin cousins Jack and Max. I can honestly admit that they are two of the funniest kids I know. My uncle isn't exactly the most intelligent human on earth, but by the way he named his children, it's apparent that his sense of humor is a little bit off, but he's a really hardworking man. Occasionally, my mom does him favors by taking the twins off his hands for a little while because they can be a handful. Weekends are specifically better to have them over because of my hateful stepsiblings who hate me, my brother, my sister, and even my mom. The amount of tension in the house isn't a healthy amount, so a couple of 5-year-olds running around livens it up a little and makes us all laugh together as a family.  It must have been a Saturday in July when my mom was home, and we were building onto our house when the twins came over. My mom was getting quite furious at their insanely high energy levels; she appeared to be on the verge of ripping out all her hair. My stepdad needed to go to the hardware store for nails and child locks, and I decided to tag along with him. I thought it would have been a great idea to take the twins with us just to relieve my mom of the loud mouths for a few minutes.  We loaded up the car, and I drove down the highway, amused with the twins in the backseat playing with the ponies and laughing at the people stopped at red lights. We all sang songs like ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" and the ABC's until we arrived in the hardware store's parking lot. Jack finds it pretty hilarious to run down the aisles and hide behind items on the lower shelves, while Max enjoys pretending he's a ninja and getting everyone confused.  Eventually, the twins were being too obnoxious, resulting in my stepdad and me catching them and holding them as captives in the seat belts of the shopping cart. It was helpful but didn't do as much justice as we had hoped. We continued along on our adventure in search of the child locks, and we found them down aisle 4.  There was a large man standing in front of our destination, and when I say large, I don't mean muscular or tall... I mean he probably has a few too many TV shows he watches daily and maybe a few too many favorite snacks. His hair was long and sandy blond, he wore a dark purple tie-dye shirt and slip-on sandals. Jack apparently hadn't realized how inappropriate it is to talk about a person in a rude fashion, especially when they can hear you. He said, ""Wow, look at that lady! She's so huge!"" and Max laughed outrageously and agreed. ""Yeah! She's as big as our whole car!"" I panicked a bit and tried to get them to be quiet; however, the twins paid no attention to me. They were much more excited to see the man on the tall ladder and were giggling and laughing along with him. They were quiet for a moment, then gasped and exclaimed, ""She's as big as a fire truck!"" The man turned around and glared at me; I apologized at least five times and started to take the boys out of the aisle when the man on the ladder hit a button to make the ladder move.  I was walking behind the larger man when the ladder made a ridiculously loud beeping sound, like that of a construction vehicle. The boys screamed in fear and shouted frantically, ""Run as fast as you can! Hurry! She's backing up, and she's going to squish you on the floor!"" The man laughed, even the man they were making fun of, but I was so embarrassed that I just took them to the car and waited for my stepdad. I tried to explain to the boys in the car that only big trucks beep when they are backing up, but unsurprisingly, they didn't listen to a word I said.  My stepdad only took approximately five more minutes before he came jogging out the door with the nails, the child locks, and a gigantic smile plastered on his face. I thought about what had happened in the store, and I chuckled quietly until my stepdad hopped into the truck, then I started laughing profusely. When I returned home, I told my mom what had happened; she laughed for a while, and I laughed even harder and quite a bit longer than I had before. I went to sleep with a fairly massive headache that night, but I think it was worth laughing all day for."
13	20732	8	3	When I meet new people, it's always an exciting opportunity to potentially form meaningful connections. Friends are important in life, and while some may come and go, true friends are the ones who stay by your side through thick and thin. I vividly remember the day I met a special girl named @PERSON1. From the moment we started talking, I felt a deep connection with her. It was as if fate had brought us together, and I knew that she was someone I wanted to share my life with.  As our relationship blossomed, I realized that my feelings for her were more than just friendship. I knew that I wanted to protect her, to cherish her, and to be there for her in every way possible. When I looked into her eyes, I could sense the pain she had experienced in the past, but I also saw a glimmer of hope and trust. I made a promise to her that I would always be there to mend her broken heart, to be her rock in times of need.  I reassured her that she was the one I had been searching for, the one who completed me in every sense. I pledged to stand by her side, to support her, and to love her unconditionally. She accepted my offer with joy and gratitude, knowing that I was different from anyone she had ever met before.  Our love grew stronger with each passing day, and I realized that she was not just a friend but a soulmate, a partner for life. Together, we faced challenges, celebrated joys, and built a bond that was unbreakable. She brought light into my life, turning my dark days into moments of happiness and warmth.  I made a vow to her that no matter what obstacles came our way, I would always be there for her, holding her hand and guiding her through the storm. Our love was like a beacon, shining bright in the darkest of times, reminding us of the strength we possessed together.  In her, I found my paradise, my world, my everything. She held the key to my heart, unlocking a love so deep and profound that I knew it would last a lifetime. Our love story was not just a tale of romance but a testament to the power of true love, of two souls finding each other in a chaotic world.  As we journeyed together, I realized that our love was a rare and precious gift, one that I would always cherish and protect. She was not just a friend – she was my angel, my shawty, my wifey, my everything. And as long as the stars shone in the sky, our love would continue to illuminate the darkness, a guiding light for each other's hearts.  In her, I found a love that was pure, genuine, and everlasting. And I knew, without a doubt, that she was the one I had been waiting for, the one who would always have my heart. Our love was a story of hope, of faith, and of unwavering devotion. And I was grateful every day that she had come into my life, bringing with her a love that was truly meant to be.
14	20733	8	3	"People always say laughter is a big part in a relationship. In my opinion, I am not so sure, but my grandmother says laughter is always a huge part in a relationship. Makes you feel good when you make your best friend, parents, boyfriend, or girlfriend laugh. It is the best feeling ever because you know how to put a smile on that person. Have you ever been walking around a store and you spot two couples laughing, having fun? I have and sometimes I feel like being in that same place. My grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandpa when they were young. She always says ""laughter plays a big part in our relationship."" She was 17 and he was 18 the first time they met. Everyone always said they were never going to last, but the only way they could find out is to wait and believe. She felt like singing every time she heard his name. She said she would walk into their shadows with him. She felt like all her problems would go away every time she had the chance to hang out with him. Every time she could think about him she would smile and laugh. That's how happy she felt about him. Can we call it love? I say it was, sometimes I wish I was in love like my grandmother is. She seems so happy every time she talks about him, but I still don't know if laughter is what kept them together for so long. I see a really huge smile on my grandmother every time she says, ""he didn't have the brightest head in the world, but he always knew how to put a smile on my face."" Because she says that he wasn't so smart but he knew how to make jokes and make her laugh. A question she asked me once ""do you think of two couples when you see them laughing, having a good time?"" The first thing that pops into your head is that they know how to have fun and don't let anything get in their ways of laughing and having a good time. My grandmother says that the thing that kept her and my grandpa together was laughter, because if you don't know how to make the other person laugh you don't know if you could have a good time with that person. When my grandparents are mad at each other it never lasts too long because my grandpa always knows how to make her laugh. Maybe if they didn't know how to make each other laugh than maybe they wouldn't be together still. I understand now my grandmother fell in love with my grandpa because of how he made her laugh. In a relationship you always have to know how to put a smile on the other person, because if you don't know then pretty sure things will not work out. My grandmother was right, laughter does play a big part in their relationship. They always know how to make everything better by making jokes or by doing something funny. I can never be mad at my grandparents because they know so many tricks to make myself laugh. That's what makes our family relationship stick together, and other families also. I finally get it, laughter is a big part in a relationship."
15	20734	8	3	"""Laughter is the best medicine."" The phrase almost everyone has heard before. But it's true! I've had days when all I could think about was how life sucked, or at least seemed to. The days when you feel like everything is going wrong, and nothing could make it worse... And that's when one of my best friends will make me laugh. I'll laugh so hard I'm on the verge of peeing my pants and my eyes water. I'll laugh so hard no sound comes out, my sides cramp and I fall on the floor. They make me laugh so hard, sometimes I think that even if I was in a coma, they'd say something so funny that I'd sit straight up in the hospital bed and laugh the huge belly laugh that sometimes escapes me.  There was this particular time when one of my friends and I were feeling more giggly than usual. It tends to happen a lot when we're together, but this time was way different than the others. We staggered to her house flushed and giddy at how funny everything was. You know how it is when you and your best friends get so tickled by each other? Those times when you glance at your friend and as you've begun to calm down, you see her pinched expression from trying not to laugh, and you lose it all over again. If you've ever had the pleasure of experiencing these silly moments, try imagining that feeling for hours at a time. I'm pretty sure I developed a whole new set of abdominal muscles that day, if that gives you any idea how hard we were laughing.  Anyway, we stumbled into her house, trying to get serious, since we did have to do at least some of our homework. Of course we were starving after all that laughing, so she told me and another friend that we could get some cereal. Just regular milk and cereal, right? There's nothing special about eating (besides that it's freaking delicious). But on that day, everything was out of the ordinary, especially the milk. It was the most amazing milk I'd ever tasted, and I love milk, so that had to mean something. ""This milk is so good! I love it!"" my friend exclaimed. I swear she was about to choke on her own spoon, she was eating so fast. ""Are you kidding me with this? What kind of milk do you buy?!"" I blurted out. For some reason that milk was really extraordinary, and it was seriously blowing my mind. ""Oh, I don't know. Two percent?"" she looked at us incredulously, a curious eyebrow raised at our inquiries. Her expression made us all fall apart in peals of laughter. Now whenever one of us brings it up, we still laugh like it just happened.  At one point, it happened. She peed her pants, and not just a little. It wasn't the idle threat rushed out, the ""I'm going to pee!"" squeal. No. She actually peed herself, and I still can't even remember what I said to make her laugh that hard. All I know is suddenly (scaring me half way to death), she yelled out, ""I love you guys! THERE's a lot of love and laughter happening here!"" I whipped around and saw her, red-faced and open-mouthed, supporting herself against the counter. She looked like the freaking queen of comedy all bent over like she was. Her eyes were closed tight, crinkling at the corners, a few stray tears escaping as she tried to hold in shrieks of (apparently) crippling laughter. It took me a second to realize what was going on, and then I was totally straight out laughing at her; pointing and laughing shoulder-shake laugh, and it only made her laugh harder. Still laughing, she did a penguin-type run down the hall to the bathroom, where my other friend was. She, in her wet jeans and with a red, tear streaked face, burst through the bathroom door, looking slightly bewildered and amused with what had happened. So naturally, we laughed at the sight of her, in her comically delirious state. Who wouldn't have?  The fact that we always laugh at each other and ourselves is why I love my friends. It's great when you have people that you can laugh about everything and nothing with. She is practically a walking ego boost because she laughs at every joke, and my other friend is pretty clever when it comes to thinking of them. Personally, I love laughing, especially with (and mostly at) my best friends."
16	20735	8	3	One time when I was skateboarding with my friend, I got really mad and wanted to stop skating. His mom tried to convince me to keep skateboarding. She laughed and said I will never be good enough to skate, but then she mentioned that I have improved more than some of the people she knows. That made me feel better, and I started skateboarding every day from then on. When I think about that day, I still laugh. Skating can be fun in many ways, and people can skate for fun or for competition. There are different ways of skating, and people have their own unique styles. There are many different kinds of skateboards, and the way people ride them varies. Some skaters make me laugh because of the way they skate. Despite that, I continue to enjoy skateboarding and appreciate the different styles people bring to the sport.
17	20736	8	3	"""Laughter"" A good relationship is built on trust, right? That's what I've heard my whole life, but as I've grown and really started thinking for myself, I came up with my own kind of survival guide, if you will, to good relationships for anyone. Sure, trust is important, but it isn't the only key factor. I've learned that laughter is just as important to not only starting a relationship but also keeping it full of life. One person in my life helped me really understand that and be able to have that relationship with them. My mom and I have such a great bond and way of understanding with each other, other girls I know don't always have that with their mothers, I am very fortunate.  Sure, we have hard times just like any family, but we are able to laugh it off with time and start anew. It helped me realize, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" Having a great bond with my mom is so important to me, we have not always run so smoothly though. From about age ten to thirteen, I was a bit troubled in the sense of not wanting to show my emotions, I just wanted to stay quiet. Then seeing my mom as someone who was strong and beautiful, I have to admit I was a bit worried she would think I was a disappointment. I guess I was afraid to show who I really was to her.  Whenever she would joke around with me I would take it all too seriously, and whenever we would fight about small things I thought she would hate me forever. I know now I was silly to think that, but I'm actually glad we went through that. I think that's part of what made us stronger, like how there would be no rainbow without the rain or how there would be no happy ending if all was well throughout your whole life. Little did I know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner.  One night after dinner, my mom had informed me that it was my night to do dishes, unlike usual I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. My mother came into my room upset and frustrated. She said, ""Why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now."" I jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen. She followed me into the small bright room, ""Are you alright, it's okay that you forgot. I'm not mad."" She exclaimed. Again not a word escaped my lips. I was afraid to say anything, the only sound that came from me was a sigh of relief when I turned back around and noted her absence. When I was finished with the dishes, she pulled me into my room. I tried reading her face, she looked worried. She explained to me the relationship between her and her mom that she so desperately wanted to have with me. She told me about how they would laugh together over silly things and how they promised each other that when they got into fights they would stop themselves, take a deep breath, then laugh. ""Laughter is the best cure for any sad feeling or bad day, as grandma would always say.""  She helped me experience that by tickling me and joking around. For the first time in my life, I wasn't nervous and I spoke my mind. As we sat there and chuckled ourselves to sleep I knew things would be different from here on out, and they were. We now have made that promise to one another and we are able to have wonderful smiling memories together now. Now at fifteen years old, I can honestly say without question my mom will always be my best and truest friend. Our bond, our way of getting over tough times, and the way we can laugh off all stressful things in life makes me feel as if I can get through anything. I've truly realized the meaning of the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."""
18	20737	8	3	"Laughter is truly a precious gift that can bring people closer together and create unforgettable memories. My boyfriend is not only my partner but also my best friend, with whom I share countless moments of joy and laughter. One late evening, as he playfully pretended to get pulled into tall grass and then ""lost"" his shoe, we ended up spending hours searching and laughing until our stomachs hurt. These are the moments that I cherish the most, the times when we can just be ourselves and enjoy each other's company. Laughter truly is the best exercise for the soul, and I am grateful to have such a wonderful friend in my life to share these moments with. With friends like him, every day is filled with smiles and laughter, making life so much brighter and more enjoyable. Laughing together is a bond that strengthens our relationship and creates memories that will last a lifetime."
19	20739	8	3	Laughter is a key component of relationships, creating a strong bond between individuals. It brings joy, lightens the mood, and helps people connect on a deeper level. In my own relationship with @PERSON1, laughter plays a significant role, as we share jokes and funny moments that bring us closer together. Without laughter, a relationship can feel dull and unfulfilling, which is why I prioritize humor in my interactions with others.  Not only do humans benefit from laughter, but animals can also be a source of joy and amusement. My cat, @CAPS1, and horse, @CAPS2, bring laughter into my life with their playful antics and unique personalities. Whether it's watching @CAPS1 zoom around the house after eating or seeing @CAPS2 playfully interacting with other horses, their presence brings a smile to my face.  Ultimately, laughter is a universal language that transcends barriers and brings people, and even animals, together. It is a powerful tool that can strengthen relationships, improve mood, and create lasting memories. In a world full of stress and challenges, the ability to laugh and find humor in everyday situations is truly a gift that should be cherished and embraced.
20	20741	8	3	Everyone enjoys laughter, which stems from happiness and joy in one's life. Personally, my niece brings me immense joy and laughter. At two years old, she exudes happiness and carefreeness, which is infectious. Playing with her and watching her giggle uncontrollably, especially when she hears a silly song from her cookie jar toy, never fails to make me laugh. Recently, my nephew joined the family, and seeing my niece burst into laughter at his antics brings even more joy and laughter into our lives. These moments remind me of the power of laughter in bringing happiness and creating precious memories. Laughter, often sparked by simple and innocent moments, is truly a reflection of the joy and contentment in our lives.
21	20742	8	3	Laughter has a unique way of bringing people together, creating bonds and shared memories that can last a lifetime. Even in the midst of a bad day, moments of humor and laughter can turn things around, making even the most frustrating situations into unforgettable experiences. Such was the case during a hunting trip that started off on the wrong foot but ended with uncontrollable laughter. From forgotten clothes and missing guns to broken eggs and a muddy truck, every mishap only added to the comedy of errors that unfolded throughout the day. Despite the setbacks and disappointments, the camaraderie between friends grew stronger as they faced each challenge with humor and resilience. In the end, what could have been a disastrous day turned into a collection of hilarious moments that brought the group closer together. Laughter truly has the power to turn even the worst situations into cherished memories that will be retold and laughed about for years to come.
22	20743	8	3	"""@CAPS1 figure something out to do! I am really freaking bored!"" @CAPS2 explained as all of us relaxed next to his dark blue @CAPS3 parked outside of my house. The @ORGANIZATION1 was young, and we were eager for some excitement.   ""Gather around, guys, I have a plan!"" I exclaimed. ""@CAPS1, I have an idea that will be hilarious and adventurous."" Excited, @CAPS6 chimed in, ""I'm up for anything, let's hear it!""   I proposed a mischievous plan involving buying cheap saran wrap from town and setting up a prank at a four-way intersection near my neighborhood. Everyone loved the idea, and @CAPS2 volunteered to drive into town to get the supplies. We pooled our money and eagerly awaited his return.  After a short wait, @CAPS2 texted us that he was ready at the intersection. We quickly made our way there, with excitement building as we approached the spot. Working swiftly, @CAPS2 and I wrapped the saran wrap around trees on opposite sides of the street, creating a makeshift barrier.  As we waited for a car to approach, adrenaline pumped through our veins. Finally, a car sped down the road and plowed through the saran wrap, coming to an abrupt halt. Laughter erupted as we watched the chaos unfold.  However, our laughter quickly turned to panic when the enraged driver emerged from his car and began chasing us. We sprinted back to my house, but @CAPS6 got caught by the angry man, returning with soda all over himself, much to our amusement.  As the night came to a close, we all settled in for the night, still chuckling at the day's events. It was a memorable and hilarious adventure that we would never forget."
23	20745	8	3	"Interesting flight. It was the 13th of this December, after a long day with some crying and lots of goodbyes, I was finally in the airport, waiting for my plane to Paris. I've been in that airport so many times... I love traveling but it's always exciting to go on a vacation, even though I do it with my parents pretty frequently. Today was different, this wasn't a vacation. It was going to be a whole year, and my parents weren't going to be there. Just the thought of being away from them and all my friends in Paris for such a long time made my stomach sick. Especially because in Paris, I was going to be meeting my host parents that I never saw before, and I was wondering if they were going to be normal people or a pair of completely weirdos.  Once in the plane, I sat with a young girl that was in Paris studying architecture and going back home for winter, while I was just leaving for a year. She asked me if I spoke English, and I said, ""I try to."" She laughed and looked nice, with a big smile, and was pretty too. We started talking and I could feel how nervous and anxious I was. She asked me if I was okay and I told her about being a foreign exchange student for the next year and my concerns about it, like meeting people or missing home. She told me, ""You will be fine, don't worry about it... I wish I had that chance when I was your age,"" and then changed the subject.  After a long conversation, she started reading a magazine and I put on my music. When we were about to get to Paris, she suddenly screamed so hard that made me jump, and we laughed for a long time. She couldn't even talk to me to explain why she screamed because everybody was looking at us, and that made it even funnier and kind of embarrassing too so we could not stop laughing. Then she told me that the guy in the picture of her magazine went to high school with her a few years ago, and they were together for some time but since graduation, they didn't know anything about each other. He was now working at a bank and making good money, really good money... She was going crazy talking to herself and asking why in the world she stopped talking with him. That good time with her, even if I haven't seen her again, made me really happy, and by the time we got off the plane, I was more confident and almost forgot about all the nervousness that I had before.  After two months here, everything is going perfectly, and I'm sure that even if it was just a few laughs and not a really long time on that plane, when I go back to Paris, I will think about her, and I'll count that moment as my first good experience. She made a difference in my journey and helped me feel more at ease about the year ahead."
24	20746	8	3	"In many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger, and complications. Although there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve laughter and it was rather boring and sad. I would spend tremendous hours of my time just to get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him. He was a rather gentle soul and could never harm a fly, but still could not laugh even though he was happy. I would ask many times over and over, ""Are you sure you're happy because you don't seem like it? I never see you smiling or laughing, all I see is a frown,"" I told him with a sour face. He replied back, ""Yes, I am happy, but just because I don't laugh doesn't mean I am not. And besides, with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?"" With that reply, I simply shrugged and began again. ""Then why can't you laugh?"" He replied back in a drowsy voice because he was getting tired of the same topic every day. ""It's not that I can't laugh, it's that I choose not to,"" he said. I asked, ""Well, why on earth would you do that?"" He sighed and huffed, really getting tired of the topic. ""Alright, if you don't stop this,"" he said in a gentle but strained voice, ""I'm going to have to stop being so nice to you, and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year."" But of course, he was only joking. He could never not be nice to me, and besides, he was my best friend; he couldn't not talk to me. The topic was dropped and never brought up again until the day I saw him.  It was a cold day when I walked out of my house one morning to go to school. I saw a big moving rental truck outside of his house and instantly knew that he had not lied to me but rather did not tell me that he was moving away. I began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh, but that would be a silly reason to leave. I went over to his house, not caring if I was late or never did show up for school that day, I had to figure out why he was leaving. Once I got to the porch of his house, he was walking to the door, and I blocked the doorway so that he could not go any further, making sure that if he wanted to get the box of clothes to the truck, he would have to answer me. I asked him, and he said, ""My father got a promotion at work, and now we have to move to New York."" I began to cry as he told me this. I was young, about eight years of age, and he was twelve. I knew I was not going to get to see him again, so I made sure that before I left for school that day, we would hang out before he left. That night at the park, he told me willingly without me asking him.  ""@CAPS1, I know you have always wondered why I don't laugh,"" he said and went on, ""Like I said, it's not that I can't laugh, it's that I don't want to. When I was young, I was teased because of my smile."" I didn't understand; why would anyone tease him? So I asked, ""Why, though? Why would someone tease you? You're nice,"" and he replied, ""Because before my new teeth grew in, my old ones didn't look so great."" And once again, I was still puzzled; his teeth looked good to me, so I asked again, ""Then why don't you smile now? Your teeth look fine to me."" He said, ""I would, but I don't know. After being teased for so many years, I just didn't feel the need to. And now, well... I could smile, and truth be told, I want to."" I said, ""Really!?"" with too much excitement. ""Yes, and the only reason is you. You're about the only person that makes me want to smile. It's because of that grin you always have, you're always so happy. I just couldn't admit it to myself, well because you're a girl, and to me, I guess having a girl make me want to smile and being my only friend that is younger than me makes me feel a little weak."" I didn't understand this at the time, but now that I am older, I do, and I am so glad that I had that one night to see his smile and many phone calls to hear his laughter. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and quite frankly, it is absolutely true because after"
25	20747	8	3	"These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend @PERSON1. No matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. Laughter can turn a bad day completely around. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my, ""friends"", tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions. At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. So there I stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. @PERSON1 had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped. She made me feel much better. Her just being there for me, and being able to reminisce in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my, ""friend"", who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. Every body has to have a somebody. Laughter truly is a powerful tool that can mend relationships and heal wounds."
26	20748	8	3	Friends are not always easy to find, but with a smile and a laugh, a friendship can blossom. I didn't expect to make a new friend when I moved to a new town, but that's exactly what happened during my sixth-grade year at @ORGANIZATION1. In a class where I learned about riding unicycles, I met a girl named @CAPS3 who would become my best friend. Our bond was formed through shared laughter and silly moments, like falling off the unicycle together and laughing until we couldn't breathe. These moments of joy brought us closer and laid the foundation for a strong friendship. Now, we cherish the memories of those early days and continue to share laughter, believing that it keeps us young at heart. Laughter truly has the power to forge deep connections and create lasting friendships that enrich our lives.
27	20751	8	3	"It was a normal bright and warm summer day, going into my fifth grade year. My older sister and I had been playing all day with my other neighbors that were around our age. One of those neighbors happened to be a boy. We could not find anything to do. It was too hot out to just go walk around in the sun, so we decided that it would be cool to play in the shade with the new slingshot my dad had made. He made it out of an old swing set seat and I thought my neighbor would really enjoy it. We all headed into our garage to get it. My sister offered to get it down for me since she was taller and it was hanging up pretty high, but I refused. It was my idea to show him so I would be the one to get it. As I was in total concentration, stretching and reaching to grab it, I noticed everyone around me giggling. My concentration got weaker as I begun to wonder what they were all laughing at. I stood there confused for a minute before I had found out what happened. My sister pulled down my pants.. in front of our boy neighbor. I picked my pants up off the ground, looked straight at my sister, and started beating her with my flimsy loose fists. I ran straight to my room, crying all the way there.   My sister came in a few moments later trying to bribe me out from under the covers with the last two fruit roll-ups. She sat on my bed waiting for half an hour, I didn't budge. She did not say anything but I could feel her eyes piercing me through the sheets. Later that night I finally came out. My sister kept on apologizing but it didn't matter to me because I was upset with her, that's all that mattered. The whole next day passed and nothing had changed. She was still apologizing and I was still in the ignoring mood. My dad came up to me and told me that she was terribly sorry and upset too because I was not talking to her. I thought in my head, ""how could she be upset.."" but I realized I had not treated her right, even though I wasn't happy with her.   After hearing what my dad had said, I decided that it wasn't worth it. I went and talked to my sister for the first time in days. She told me that she didn't mean to hurt my feelings, she was just messing around. After talking about it for a while I concluded that I got so upset because she did it in front of our friend. We joke around like that all the time, but it's never in front of anyone besides family. I was scared that it would have frightened our neighbor friend away, but he was back to play in a few days so I had nothing to be mad about.   Even though I was embarrassed, I admitted that it was pretty funny. We had a good laugh about it and were no longer enemies. I learned that dwelling over the past gets you nowhere and you have to learn to laugh things off. Ever since then, every time it is brought up, we laugh so hard tears role down our face. I would not have considered it a good thing when it happened, but I do now. It is another memory that my sister and I share and can reminisce about. The more laughable memories you share, the closer it brings you to someone."
28	20754	8	3	Making someone laugh is truly a wonderful feeling. It not only brightens their day but also uplifts your own spirits. I believe that spreading joy and laughter is one of the most fulfilling things we can do for others. My mother, who has a fantastic sense of humor, always finds a way to make me smile, even on my darkest days. Laughter has a magical way of easing tension, breaking the ice, and fostering connections between people. It is said that laughter is good for the soul, and I couldn't agree more. It is like a healing balm that brings people together and creates a positive atmosphere. My mom's laughter is contagious, and whenever she is feeling down, I do my best to cheer her up by doing something silly or telling a joke. Seeing her smile again brings me immense joy and reminds me of the power of laughter to heal and uplift. Laughter truly is the best medicine, and I am grateful for the moments of joy and connection it brings to my life.
29	20755	8	3	"""Laughter is the key to the soul."" Whether you are having the worst day of your life, or the best day of your life, laughing can always make it better. I was sitting in class one day, and was bored out of my mind. Then, a shy, quiet kid, all of a sudden started laughing! They couldn't stop! It was like they were on ""laughing gas."" They laughed so hard they couldn't breathe. Now this made me laugh, and then my best friend sitting next to me laughed. Soon enough the entire class was laughing! So even though some of the people in the class might have been bored, or had a bad day, the laughter was spread throughout the room, making it a better day. Laughter spreads like wildfire, and it makes everyone happier. And when you are happier, you are healthier. So with that, a relationship must have laughter in it, in order to work. When you ask someone what they like about their boyfriend or girlfriend, if it is a good relationship, they will almost always say, ""he/she makes me laugh."" Because when you don't have laughter in a relationship, you end up in more fights, more disagreements, and more disappointment. The more you laugh the more you can live a better life and enjoy life more. Have you laughed today? Laughter truly is the best medicine for the soul."
30	20756	8	3	Their are many joys in life, some more relevant than others, and some so obvious you'd be stupid not to notice them. Have you ever sat on your porch or stared out the window to watch the sun rise, pondering your life and its unusual qualities? Reflecting on all the memories, laughs, sorrows, pain, love, and hate. It's common to think about what could be changed, or if you'd leave it as is, feeling complete without regrets.  Despite the tears and pain, there have always been laughs to outweigh the sadness. I've learned that unexpected things will always happen, no matter how much you plan. Happiness isn't hard to achieve - keep an open mind, a light heart, and find joy in the world around you.  There are many things that keep me going - love, laughter, new beginnings, old endings, and the endless possibilities of the universe. I remember a time when I felt lost and unhappy, but looking at the stars one night, I realized there was so much more to experience if I kept going.  I strive to be a better person, to have a bright future with a deep love story to share. I want to find peace, protect animals, and work towards a cleaner, healthier planet. Even though I am small, I know my actions can make a difference. I aim to leave a positive impact on this shared home of ours, creating a better world for future generations to enjoy.
31	20757	8	3	"A true story about how two close friends became friends over the joy of laughter. One year, a boy named @PERSON1 wanted to do something fun on a particular day instead of just staying in his room and playing video games. He heard of a play called ""@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1"" and decided to join and help out with the play. @PERSON1 ended up getting a part in the play and helped backstage whenever he could. He found that he enjoyed the experience and made many friends during the process.  At the same time, there was a girl named @ORGANIZATION1 who didn't talk much to @PERSON1, but she secretly liked him. She also participated in the play and tried to make friends. As the play went on, @PERSON1 started hanging out with @ORGANIZATION1's older brother, @PERSON2, and began paying more attention to her. @PERSON1 discovered that @ORGANIZATION1 liked him, which he had already sensed from her behavior.  After joining another play called ""@CAPS2 in @LOCATION1,"" @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 started talking and found that they enjoyed each other's laughter. They quickly became close friends, bonding over shared experiences and mutual enjoyment. @ORGANIZATION1, who had faced challenges with friendship due to being homeschooled and teased for her intelligence, was afraid of losing another friend, while @PERSON1 was open to making new friends easily.  As their friendship blossomed, @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 realized that they could only remain friends due to their age difference - @PERSON1 being @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1 being @NUM2. They treasured the time they spent together during the play and continued to communicate even after it ended, reminiscing about the good times and looking forward to future opportunities to connect.  Although they acknowledged that a romantic relationship was not possible at their current ages, they hoped to maintain their strong friendship for a long time. As they eagerly anticipated the next play and reunion, only time would reveal what the future held for their relationship."
32	20758	8	3	"I never thought that laughing can help you start a conversation with someone you don't even know. But @CAPS4 can. Just by laughing with someone can get you to meet a new person. One of the things I do first @CAPS6 someone is trying to be funny is laugh. Once you know @CAPS2 the other person is talking about, you forget that you are just getting to know that person. This happened to me once. @CAPS4 happened in @LOCATION1, where my family and I usually go every year in @DATE1. I made a great friend and the first thing we did was laugh. As you know, @LOCATION1 is a hot place and the sun is usually out every day. I spend the days we stay over there going out to walk with my sister and cousins or going to the beach with all my family. I remember @CAPS4 was a day that my cousins, sister and I went to a small store that's right down the street from where we stay at. We wanted to buy candy and other stuff to bring with us @CAPS6 we returned to our home. I didn't expect to see one of my cousins there with his friends. @CAPS6 I saw them, the only thing they were doing was laughing about something. I couldn't hear them but once we got closer, I heard a hilarious thing they said. I couldn't help overhearing so I started to laugh. One of his friends saw me laughing and he thought I was laughing at him. He asked me if I was laughing at him and of course I said no. I told him I had accidentally overheard his conversation so then he started to laugh. ""That was funny wasn't @CAPS4"" he told me laughing. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 was. I didn't know you made jokes like that"" I replied.  He kept on talking to me and then he said, ""I always talk like that so don't be afraid. I don't say @CAPS4 to hurt anyone.""  I thought @CAPS4 was nice for him to clear that out but I already knew people in @LOCATION1 talk like that. We kept on talking @CAPS6 I started to laugh again. ""@CAPS2 did I say now?"" he asked. ""@CAPS3. I was just remembering @CAPS2 you said in the beginning. That was really funny"" I replied. For some reason I couldn't forget of @CAPS2 he said and I don't think I will ever forget. I think @CAPS4 was probably because the way we met was really surprising to me. I had never met a person, especially a guy, by laughing first. I guess I thought @CAPS4 was a great way to start a conversation. Laughing with the person will let them know that we are interested in their subject and we understand them. That's at least @CAPS2 I thought. I had a good conversation with my new friend. We talked about how I was taking my vacations. I told him that every year I go and I always enjoy them. My family and I have a great time spending time with my grandparent and cousins from @LOCATION1. I told him I sometimes say I would rather live in @LOCATION1 than where I live know because @CAPS4's so much calmer there. He agreed with me on one part of @CAPS2 I had told him because he knows @CAPS2's like to live in @LOCATION1, but he doesn't know how I'd like to live in any other place. After he told me that, he stayed quiet for a couple of seconds. I noticed something instantly. I had noticed that our conversation wasn't like in the beginning. In the beginning, we wouldn't stop laughing and we had interesting stuff to say. Then, @CAPS4 got calmer and a little unusual. I didn't want to just stop our conversation there so I asked him where was he going to go because @CAPS6 I started talking to him, he was with one of my cousins and I was with my other cousins. Now we started laughing again. This time @CAPS4 was because we just had noticed that the people we were with had left us. ""@CAPS6 did they leave?"" he asked me. ""I don't know, but they can't be that far because we haven't been talking for a long time,"" I told him. We walked together to go and look for them and I was right. They weren't that far. They were still looking for things to buy and I don't think they noticed we were missing. We just got together with them and acted as if @CAPS3 had happened. @CAPS4 was strange for me because whenever I looked at him, I would remember our conversation. The first"
33	20759	8	3	"As I waited in the car, anxious to meet my best friend and man I'm in love with, I started to laugh. Not because something my mother or brother said was funny, or because I saw something funny, but I was nervous. I'd talked to him countless times on the phone, many text messages, and emails. But I was still nervous. I knew him better than I knew most people, yet my anxiety seemed to be making me lose my sanity.  As our black rental sedan pulled up to where he was waiting outside of where his family lived, I got more nervous. What if he wasn't actually the way I thought he was? What if he didn't like me? What if I didn't like him? As soon as he stepped into the car, smiling brightly at me, my nervous laughter and my anxiety all melted away. I smiled back.  ""Hey, John,"" he said.  ""Hey, Mark,"" I said, butterflies in my stomach. I was smiling broadly still, he reached out and cautiously took my hand.  ""How was the drive?"" he asked, lightly squeezing my hand.  Good, and nerve-wracking,"" I replied, nervous laughter bubbling up again.  ""But you're here now, and I'm very happy you are,"" he said, smiling. And for the rest of the car ride to the restaurant our conversation flowed so smoothly I thought I was dreaming. Here him and I were two guys in love with one another, a new thing for both of us, and we were happy as can be. The whole car ride we held hands and talked, I felt like I'd known him my whole life. Not just the year and a half I'd known him.  We arrived at the restaurant all too fast and all of us got out of the car, I was famished and so was he. But we had to wait for a table for a half-hour before we sat down. Once at the dinner table my mother, who was very happy I found someone I loved so much and knew of our love, started regaling us with tales of my childhood. It was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. I was bright red for almost the entire time she told these stories. Some of which I remembered, others I did not. Mark laughed and joked with me about all of them. Which made my nervous laughter come out as actual laughter. It also helped that he was holding my hand under the table.  After we ate dinner and dessert we went to the nearby mall for some shopping and to just hang out. My mom and brother went one way, and Mark and I went another. We bought some clothes together and finally ended up in a book store. My favorite book store. Back in my favorite section, young adult fiction, I noticed Mark staring at me.  ""What?"" I asked stupidly. He smiled deviously.  ""You just look very... In your element,"" he smirked.  ""Huh?"" I said, in mock confusion. He just smiled and took my hand in his again. ""No problem,"" he said, squeezing my hand. He pulled me closer to him, we were the only people in this area of the store. ""Mind if I'm a little forward?"" he asked. I shook my head no. He leaned in and kissed me very gently on the lips, I blushed a bright red and started to giggle after our lips parted. He quirked an eyebrow, I knew what he was thinking just by the look on his face.  ""That felt fantastic,"" I said, putting my fingers on my lips. I had a silly grin on my face.  ""Good,"" he simply said, kissing me again. ""I love your laugh, love,"" he told me, I was on cloud nine, I was truly in love with somebody and I felt great! I'd never been this happy before. Except maybe the first time I went to Disney World. But this was definitely better, because it could last much longer. Which it has, since we've been together ever since. Both our gazes fixed on our future together. Now whenever I remember that I start to giggle happily to myself. Yes I get a stare every once in a while, but I don't care. Laughter is the thing that helped bridge the gap between him and I. Making us the closest we've ever been."
34	20760	8	3	"Fourth period, freshman year was the highlight of my entire freshman year. @LOCATION1 was what most people called him, but I simply called him, @CAPS1. So I'll start off with the first semester of ninth grade with physical science, fourth period. I had the first term with my best friend, @PERSON1, @CAPS12 we got to choose our seats, so we sat next to each other in the back, right-hand corner of the classroom. We sat there so we could get away with more, like passing notes @CAPS12 talking during class. So one day, while we were passing the notebook of notes, I must have written something that embarrassed her. So I went to grab something out of my backpack, @CAPS12 she took advantage of the situation. So next thing I knew, I was being shoved out of my desk, onto my backpack, on my back. The class got quiet, for he was giving us notes @CAPS12 showing us how to do the assignment. So as we erupted into fits of laughter, I looked at him to see if he was very angry @CAPS12 if he was going to send us outside of the classroom to talk to us. But all @CAPS1 did was look at us, shake his head, laugh a little to himself, @CAPS12 begin talking again. So, we kept laughing, but we were trying to settle down @CAPS12 stop ourselves from laughing. In the second term, @PERSON1 was @CAPS10 in there with me, but I had my friend @CAPS3-@CAPS4, @CAPS5.@CAPS5, @CAPS12 @PERSON2. I was even closer to @CAPS1 than in the first term. So one day he was teaching us about compounds. So while he was writing down a chart to help us study, he sang out, ""@CAPS7 play the @CAPS8 @CAPS9!"" @CAPS10 even seconds later, the class burst with laughter, even he had to stop from writing he was laughing so hard. It took us about ten minutes to settle down @CAPS12 stop laughing. Another part of the second term that was a fun @CAPS12 a good laugh was doing some example problems on our own. So one of my classmates, @LOCATION2, asked what should we do to tell him we are finished with the problems. So @LOCATION1 thought for a few moments, @CAPS12 said, ""@CAPS11 you finish your problems, cluck like a chicken for me."" @CAPS12 about five minutes afterward, people started clucking like chickens. @CAPS12 with that, my friends brought up the fact that I own chickens. But as more people were finishing their problems, it was getting annoying. It was hilarious at first though. Then there was @CAPS13 @CAPS14. We had just a regular classroom, @CAPS10 a science @CAPS13, so we were unable to do too many experiments. So @CAPS15, the other science teacher let us borrow her classroom for an entire school @CAPS14, being as her class had an online report to do. @CAPS1 banned me from using the matches because his nickname for me was @CAPS16-@CAPS17. Then on the final day, he broke about @NUM1 to a dozen glass test tubes. @CAPS11 this happened, I was almost complete with my packet we had to do for the @CAPS14. So I went over to him while he was cleaning up, @CAPS12 I asked what happened. He told me, my classmate broke a bunch of glass test tubes by dropping them. But he looked at me @CAPS11 he did so. So @CAPS11 I looked at him, he started laughing. Which gave his cover away, so I got after him @CAPS12 told him @CAPS10 to blame the children for things he did. especially for breaking the test tubes. There was also the one time I went into his @CAPS18 class to do some homework. My friend wanted me to be there for one day because she loved the class so much. So my guitar lessons teacher allowed me to spend fifth period in that class. So, @CAPS11 he was done giving notes @CAPS12 giving the class their assignment for the day. Some friends of @CAPS3 @CAPS19 called him over for a question. So I looked up from my drawing. By then he was already over to them. So they asked him if he was a swimmer, he replied he did swim. So then they asked if he shaved his legs because he was a swimmer. I think he got embarrassed, so he said to come after class @CAPS12"
35	20761	8	3	"Sometimes I wonder why people laugh. People laugh when something is funny or when things are awkward and they aren't sure what else to do. Often people laugh when they are embarrassed or offended. I, actually, find myself laughing for no reason on occasion. If I can make someone laugh I usually feel very accomplished. I think it personally shows emotions out loud. But, in some cases, you laugh uncontrollably at yourself. Every year, since I moved here six years ago, my two cousins and my sisters and I have gone ""cheese ball caroling"" with our grandparents around Christmas time. Even after my grandpa died in 2014 and my older sister left for college. On the twenty-first of December, we go secret Santa shopping one at a time with one of our grandparents while we make the cheese balls by hand. After all five of us have gone, we wrap the cheese balls and put a ribbon on them while we practice our carols for that evening. We always make a list before we start the caroling. First thing on the list is the people who's houses we are going to go to that night. Second next to each family's name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house. Third is what song we are going to sing to them. Usually, there is about twenty-five to thirty people on the list. All of which are family members and really close friends or people from their work. We always have a really good time with it too. No fighting or bickering or anything like that. It's really nice to just be with the family and catch up. Usually, it's been about a year since we have all been together at the same time. Last year was the first year we went caroling without my older sister. She went off to college the year before, leaving me the oldest grandkid there. At first it didn't seem any different, but as the day went on I could feel it taking its toll. With her being gone and my grandpa no longer being around made the pressure build uncontrollably. I started to relax a little when we got started and just tried to have fun. My grandma yelled to me to grab the list and add a name. At first, I didn't think anything of it. Later she told us we had to come up with a special song for the family. And that's when it hit me. The name looked and sounded familiar because I used to go to school with a boy with the same last name. That's when I asked her to verify if it was the same family. Sure enough, it was. I had had a crush on this boy since I could remember. We lost contact after I had found out he liked my cousin though. I knew it was going to be extremely awkward to have to sing in front of him, not to mention embarrassing. I remember thinking ""Oh great, this is just what I needed. This is going to be awesome."" We did our rounds and everything went very smoothly. We were having tons of fun, making jokes and laughing at absolutely everything. Then it came time to go to ""his"" house. We all choked up. The girls had heard many things about how cute and dreamlike this boy was so they were all nervous too. We were sitting there in the truck telling ourselves he won't be home, and even if he was it would be fine and we would be fine. I think that was the longest walk to a house with that short of a walkway ever. My grandma rang the doorbell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened. To our dismay, he answered it. We froze! We were like gargoyles gawking at him. He gave us a weird look and said ""Are you going to sing or just stand there?"" with an evil little smile. I did attempt to sing, but nothing came out. That's when the youngest cousin starts singing happy birthday. That was not the song we had planned for this house, and it was not his birthday. In the middle of the second ""happy birthday to you"" we all start cracking up laughing, and I don't mean giggling or a small laugh. We were all laughing hysterically to the point where we could not breathe, and he shut the door. I know if we would have just stood there it would have made that memory a lot more dreadful, but because we all were laughing, we can look back and laugh at ourselves for it. Laughing is a good way to release inner emotional pressure I realized that night. It's a memory I'm sure we will never forget. I have done something like that on multiple occasions but that was definitely number one on my list of ""what were you thinking"" moments. I wouldn't change anything about it."
36	20762	8	3	Laughter is indeed a powerful tool that can bring happiness and create bonds between people. I recall a funny incident from my time as a new student in the 1st grade, where I experienced a moment of embarrassment that turned into a source of laughter for me and my new friend. Despite the initial awkwardness of falling down the stairs and revealing my character underpants, I chose to laugh along with my classmates. This shared moment of laughter led to a strong friendship with a girl named @CAPS2, with whom I shared many more funny and memorable experiences. It is true that laughter is a universal language that can bridge the gap between people and create lasting connections. It is important to embrace moments of humor and laughter in our lives, as they can bring joy and lightness to even the most challenging situations. So, let's remember to always find reasons to laugh and share our funny stories with others, as laughter truly is the key to complete happiness.
37	20763	8	3	@ORGANIZATION1 blew my mind the first time I saw her. She was my other half. Everything we did together was perfect. She made me laugh with everything she said. She was my better half, to sum it all up. I still remember when I first saw her in @CAPS1. The nickname of the town was @CAPS1 @CAPS4 hell because of where it was located, in the middle of nowhere. We met when I was on vacation at @CAPS1. My parents had just retired a few months before and were looking for a cozy retirement home away from the big cities and closer to the beautiful eastern @LOCATION2 mountains with snowy tops and picturesque landscapes.  We ended up staying in a trailer during our vacation, which was quite an ordeal to set up every time we stopped. Despite the challenges, we found a stunning handmade house in the town that we all fell in love with. However, we had to sell our house first before we could afford to purchase it, so we reluctantly returned to the trailer park for the time being.  Feeling bored, I decided to explore the town on my dad's bike and stumbled upon a group of young people who had just returned from a thrilling youth group outing. They invited me to join them for a nature hike up a mountain, and I eagerly accepted. That's where I met @LOCATION1, who captivated me with her beauty and infectious laughter. We instantly connected and spent the hike getting to know each other better.  @LOCATION1 became my hiking partner, and her presence brought immense joy to my days. Her laughter was like music to my ears, and I couldn't imagine a better companion. She truly felt like my other half, completing me in every way possible. Our bond grew stronger with each passing day, and I knew that she was someone special in my life.
38	20764	8	3	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 story is about how I fell in dog @CAPS1 and stepped in it, I fell off a slippery trampoline. About four or five years ago, I went to a friend's house to stay the @TIME1. That day was hot, so my friend and I decided to have fun and stay cool by putting a sprinkler under the trampoline to make it wet and slippery. As we were jumping, my friend's higher bounce caused me to lose balance, and I ended up falling off the trampoline. Instead of getting hurt, I landed on a pile of dog manure, which was not a pleasant experience. Despite the initial shock and discomfort, the situation turned into a source of laughter for everyone, including myself. This story highlights how laughter can turn a seemingly bad situation into a funny memory, showing the importance of finding humor in unexpected circumstances.
39	20765	8	3	"@CAPS9 I have been scared so much that I couldn't sleep the whole night. I was with a group of @NUM1 friends at the time. Telling scary stories can be fun and games until someone gets too afraid and freaks everyone out. It starts out with everyone watching movies and having fun until the parents go upstairs and it's time to party. Our night was called our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" night, where us @CAPS5 kids consider ourselves as @CAPS1. Our night involves @NUM2 antsy @LOCATION1, @NUM1 frightened teenagers, and a house that has said to be ""@CAPS6"". To start this amazing night of terror, the guests had to arrive first. Everyone reached my house around @NUM4 pm and we started by playing video games, laughing, eating, and having a good time.  Once the parents were settled in bed, we brought out the ""@CAPS7 or @CAPS8"" games. After getting bored, we tried to play sing-star on the @NUM5 but couldn't due to missing cords. We then took pictures in our designated roles for our ""@CAPS1"" and enjoyed pizza before settling down for a movie. However, when the lights went out and shadows appeared, things took a spooky turn. We gathered in a circle and told scary stories, with one about a possessed @CAPS26 causing a stir. Laughter helped us overcome our fears and we ended the night in my room continuing our discussions.  The main lesson learned from the party was that with laughter and friends, any fear can be conquered. It was a night filled with laughter and support, making it one of the most fun and memorable parties I have ever had."
40	20766	8	3	"Laughter and exuberance are key elements in any good relationship. Being able to be giddy and joyful with someone close to you is a sign of comfort. It often can bring people closer and help to solidify their friendships. Your true self is shown in your humor. Two years ago when I was in seventh grade math class at school, I was chosen to be in the special math group along with just three other classmates. Being in this group simply meant that we would be teaching ourselves advanced math using only textbooks, while our teacher would teach the rest of the class an easier math curriculum. The group was almost like an elite club. Our other classmates looked upon us with jealousy because we got to sit in the back of the classroom together, never had to do any homework, and were never called upon out of the blue to answer questions in front of the whole class. Being the immature seventh graders that we were, we abused this incredible opportunity that we had. I became fast friends with the three other people in the group. Their names were Sarah, Jack, and Emily. Sarah and I were already friends, but it was working together in the group that really brought us closer together. I also became close with Nathan and Emily. To this day, Sarah is one of my very best friends and I still keep in touch with the other two. We were all very different from each other. Nathan was caught up in the popular crowd, Emily usually hung out with the really smart kids who were into chess and reading books, and Sarah and I were just normal. However, we all had two important things in common; our sick sense of humor and our intelligence. We each felt that the work we were teaching ourselves was much too easy. We breezed right through the book and never really had any questions. In doing so, we always finished our assigned work quickly and had more than half of the class left to just sit there, eat, and goof off. ""@ORGANIZATION2 guys, I don't feel like doing math today. I'm beat,"" I complained as we walked into the classroom for math right after lunch. ""Me neither,"" Sarah replied. ""I say we just sit there and make it look like we're doing work."" We made our way to the table in the back where Nathan and Emily were already sitting. They had their books, pencils, and spirals out, but sat there with vacant expressions. Sarah and I joined them in sitting and we all exchanged disgruntled looks. ""Hey, I was talking to Nathan earlier and he said that we don't have to do any work today. We can just sit here and hang out,"" I lied, not even bothering to hide my smirk. Catching on, Nathan and Emily grinned. Emily turned around and pulled a brown paper bag out of her backpack. She began to pull food out of the bag and offered it all up to us. I immediately grabbed the miniature chocolate pie. Midway through eating it, I dipped my finger in the gooey chocolate and wiped a big blob of it on the window behind Sarah. Nathan noticed and immediately started to chuckle. ""Sarah, what's that?!"" he exclaimed, loud enough for everyone in the class to hear. Our teacher and a few classmates glanced over briefly, but got back to the lesson instantly. It really wasn't funny at all, but the four of us dissolved into giggles. ""Hey guys, I had this crazy dream last night,"" Emily said as the laughter died down. ""I went to this camp thing, and Mr. Johnson was one of the camp counselors. He was wearing khaki pants and a white shirt with blue pinstripes. Oh, and he also had a clipboard!"" We stared at her blankly and then burst out laughing once more. The funny thing about it, was that Mr. Johnson often substituted for our teachers, and he wore that exact outfit each time. But the even funnier thing was that it really wasn't funny at all. We were just desperate for a good time, we found chocolate blobs on windows and khaki pants to be hilarious. Our laughter died down and we sat there in silence. Suddenly, Nathan leaned back in his squeaky swivel chair and it immediately broke, dropping him right to the ground. To anyone else, it would have been funny. However, we each sat in silence, staring at one another. It wasn't that we were embarrassed for him or felt sympathy, but simply ironic that obsolete things sent us into fits of giggles, while a substantial, laughable event made us simply sit there. I don't think I'll ever forget the group. Though it was a waste of time, we had many good laughs. We may not have learned a lot about math, but we learned a lot about each other."
41	20767	8	3	Many people believe that laughter always brings benefits, but the reality is that laughter can sometimes have a different impact. When I think of laughter, I think of smiles, happiness, and positive memories. However, there was one memory of laughter that did not bring joy. I was tasked with confronting my father about his alcohol addiction, and it was a difficult and emotional experience. As I poured out my heart to him, hoping for a serious conversation, he simply laughed it off and dismissed my concerns. This moment of laughter brought tears instead of happiness. It was a stark reminder that not all laughter is lighthearted and joyful. Despite this painful experience, I learned the importance of speaking up and standing up for what I believe in, even in the face of laughter and dismissal. Laughter may not always bring happiness, but it can serve as a catalyst for growth and self-discovery.
42	20768	8	3	Laughter filled the room as my parents sat me down to break the news. I could sense the gravity of the situation as they exchanged glances before finally revealing that they were getting a divorce. The atmosphere shifted, and I could see the pain in my mother's eyes and the turmoil in my father's posture. It was a moment that shattered my young understanding of family dynamics.  As I tried to come to terms with the impending changes, I couldn't help but feel a wave of sadness wash over me. The thought of my family breaking apart was almost too much to bear. How would my little brother, at just four years old, comprehend this upheaval? The confusion and heartache were overwhelming.  But amidst the tears and the impending sense of loss, my mother offered a simple yet profound piece of advice - to remember the good times and to find solace in laughter. It was a light in the darkness, a reminder that even in the face of hardship, there were moments of joy and connection that could sustain us.  As I reflected on the memories of laughter and love that we had shared as a family, I felt a glimmer of hope. Despite the challenges ahead, I realized that as long as we could hold onto those moments of joy, we would find a way to weather the storm. My mother's wisdom became a beacon of light in the darkness, guiding us towards healing and resilience.  In the end, I understood that laughter was not just a fleeting moment of joy, but a powerful force that could help us navigate even the darkest of times. And with that realization, I knew that we would be okay, that we would find our way through the pain and emerge stronger on the other side.
43	20769	8	3	"Laughter, the sense of pure happiness. You are in the moment and nothing else matters, all your worries and stress fall away leaving you with your true happy self. Have you ever had those moments when everything seem too much? Then a friend says something that makes you laugh, once you're done laughing you start to cry because it felt so good to laugh. Or when you laugh so hard you fall to the floor and can't get up for what seems like hours? Yet looking back you forget what was so funny. Laughter is magical, behind love. Those two seem to go hand in hand. When you love someone, not just your boyfriend/girlfriend but your friends and family too, you know how to make them laugh or cheer them up, how to have fun with them, and that brings you even closer together. When I'm with my friends, the one thing we seem to do most is laugh. We laugh about anything and everything that is even slightly funny. It brings us closer together, sharing a moment of joy. The six of us are very close and will be friends after high school is over, even if we go to colleges thousands of miles away. It is because we have shared so many happy memories. Laughter is important in a relationship. We trust each other and can share anything with them even our most important secrets. This story is how we came to be so close. Brightly colored fancy dresses and killer high heels were splayed out across the room. Open soda cans and chip bags. The faint smell of nail polish, flowery perfume, and deodorant lingering in the air. Laughter and giggles bubbling throughout the room with the occasional squeal. Pitch black outside but light and warm inside. Six of us lounging around the room. Smeared makeup and deflating hair. Sweatpants and baggy t-shirts. We all went from looking our very best to... not, within a few minutes. Yet not one of us cared. We when looking at each other we were able to look past appearances had fun with each other, not their looks. We had just gotten back from the dance. None of us had dates but we still managed to have the time of our lives. ""Did you see him! He was dancing with her!"" ""I wouldn't really call that dancing...."" she made a pelvic thrust, we all burst into a new round of giggles and shouted stuff like, ""Hey, get a room!"" We gossiped about what we saw, who was with who, pretty dresses, hot guys, creeper guys, slow dances, the music, even our drinks - we hid our cups so we would know which one was ours when we wanted to use it again. We had all been friends, but recently we had been becoming closer. Starting to move from friends to best friends. It was at least midnight. Everyone was exhausted but was forcing themselves to stay up with caffeine and sugar. You may ask why, but I'm not really sure. Maybe because we always seem to have so much to talk about, because we enjoy each other's company, or just because we can, so why not? ""I think we need a picture, a picture of the six of us."" I said. ""Yes!"" ""Okay!"" ""Are we doing it now? I'm a mess!"" ""I've got just the thing!"" someone takes off running upstairs to grab something. ""Where should we sit?"" ""On the bed?"" ""Okay, but scoot over fatties"" ""Hey! I'm not fat, I'm festively plump!"" We all cracked up to the reference of Elf as we started to squeeze into a corner of the squishy full-size bed. Someone's mom arrived back into the room. She was carrying an old Polaroid camera that printed out the picture immediately after you took it. She gave the camera to her mom and jumped onto the bed. We all squished together, barely enough room to breathe. ""One...Two...Three!"" Click! The picture came out. ""Let's take one more while the first is developing. Again, one... two... three!"" Click! Click! ""Cheese!!!"" We all screamed in unison. The bed broke! We had broken the bed! We all sat there clinging to each other in total shock. ""Your bed! You guys are faaaaat..."" someone said while trying to contain a giggle. Suddenly we were in hysterics. Even someone's mom was laughing. We were one big throbbing pile of laughter. Only the corner of the bed had broken so we were all pulled down into that corner. Then someone started tickling, it was war. Every girl for themselves. It was a mass of bedsheets, wiggling fingers, bare feet, biting and a whole lot of laughing. ""All the pictures have developed."" The first one showed us sitting"
44	20770	8	3	Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone's day. Humans like to laugh and make others laugh as well. I remember a time when I had to take a writing test, much like the one I am taking now. The topics were so vague that choosing one was a challenge. After some contemplation, I found humor in the irony of having to write about laughter when none of the topics interested me. I decided to write about myself laughing at the situation, which I found amusing. As I wrote, I couldn't help but laugh at how ridiculous the task seemed. I worried that the grader might not appreciate my humor, but that only added to the irony and amusement of the situation. Different people find different things funny, but the beauty of laughter lies in its abstract nature. Despite our individual interpretations, laughter is a universal joy that brings people together. So, no matter how you perceive it, laughter is undeniably funny.
45	20771	8	3	"Someone once told me that laughter is the key element of comfort. I believe that laughter is one of the most important parts of any relationship. It's what brings people together. A perfect example; about two years ago in the middle of fall, I was crying about my dog passing away. My ex-boyfriend tried everything to make me feel better but nothing was working. I was so hurt I told him I just wanted to be alone and he understood. As he was walking away he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoon Spongebob, when Spongebob slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his entire back-side was drenched. His cheeks were cherry-red with embarrassment. I just busted out laughing, I couldn't help it. He saw that water had gotten all over me, then he started laughing. That was a moment of comfort brought on by laughter. Whenever we had a problem, we could always laugh it off. That's actually how I met him. I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and we decided to go see a movie called Step-Up. There was this one scene where one of the characters said, ""That was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur,"" then the other character looked like he was going to cry. I thought that was so funny. After the movie was over my friend suggested that we go back to his house. When we got there, he was waiting on the steps for my friend. My friend stood back a second then said, ""aw were you waiting for me little one."" He replied with, ""That was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur."" I laughed so hard I almost went to the bathroom on myself. He and myself were the only ones laughing and we just clicked. If he wasn't funny I can honestly say I would've never been with him. I love laughter. I believe it's the easiest way to trigger the best emotions. Laughter truly is the best medicine."
46	20772	8	3	On a chilly evening, my friends @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and I were walking to cheerleading practice. Despite the cold, we found humor in our situation. @PERSON3 struggled with her hood, which made her look like a poodle with her hair sticking out awkwardly. When @PERSON1 complained of a hurting foot, I offered her a piggyback ride, followed by @PERSON3 taking her turn. As we neared the end of the block, we encountered @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON2, adding to the laughter of the evening. The fun continued as we walked into the school for practice, remarking on everyone being present. This memorable night was filled with laughter and camaraderie, making it a practice to remember.
47	20773	8	3	Freshmen year was a memorable time for me at school. I met a boy who caught my attention and made me smile and laugh. We shared a class called @CAPS2 and would often pass each other in the hallway, brightening my day. Despite not needing help, I would ask him just to have an excuse to talk to him. Our interactions extended to the swimming pool, where we would see each other due to his brother's involvement in swimming. Although we were separated in class the following semester, we continued to bond over shared interests like hunting, wheeling, and favorite foods. As our friendship grew, so did our closeness, with hugs in the hallway becoming a regular occurrence. By the end of the school year, we had become inseparable, spending time together at each other's homes and enjoying outings like the strawberry festival. Finally, he asked me to be his girlfriend, and I happily agreed. Our relationship has only grown stronger since then, with promises of a future together. I never expected to fall in love so quickly, but I'm grateful that I did. Our days are filled with laughter and conversation, and I can't imagine my life without him. Love truly found me in the most unexpected way, and I couldn't be happier.
48	20774	8	3	When I was younger, I liked to go fishing a lot with my two friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON1. We loved to catch @CAPS1, @CAPS2 head, and sometimes @CAPS3. One day, while camping, we were fishing for @CAPS2 head in cold, snowy weather. @PERSON1 hooked a massive fish on his last cast, and as he struggled to reel it in, he slipped and fell into the river, losing the pole. Without hesitation, @PERSON2 and I jumped in to help retrieve the pole and catch the fish. After a challenging chase downstream, @PERSON2 managed to grab the pole, but as he tried to bring the fish ashore, the line broke, and the fish escaped. Despite the disappointment, we all agreed that it was a memorable fishing experience. We headed home, grateful for the adventure, even though our efforts did not result in a successful catch.
49	20775	8	3	"One time when I was spending the night at my friend's house, she wanted to sleep outside in a tent. It was summer and we always tried to see each other whenever possible because she had to go back to boarding school a lot. So her mom set up the tent for us on the deck, and after we ate dinner, we grabbed our things and went outside. She was on the phone with her boyfriend and I was on the phone with mine, and both of them were best friends. It was like two best friends dating two best friends, and we were closer than ever. My boyfriend had to get off the phone because he had work in the morning, so my friend was just chatting away on the phone. I started saying really funny things and she just started laughing so hard that she snorted, and at that moment, she was still on the phone with her boyfriend. I couldn't help but burst into laughter at the sight of her laughing so uncontrollably. To make things even funnier, she ended up laughing so hard that she peed herself while still on the phone with her boyfriend. It was a hilarious sight, and I couldn't contain my laughter. When I saw what had happened, I couldn't help but exclaim, ""Oh my God, you peed yourself!"" This only made us laugh even harder. Eventually, her boyfriend had to intervene and suggest that she take care of the situation. After they got off the phone, she was understandably embarrassed. I couldn't blame her; it was definitely a memorable and comical night."
50	20776	8	3	@ORGANIZATION1 is one of the many joys I love to share with people. I absolutely love to laugh, I don't know where I would be if I didn't laugh. My cousin, @CAPS1 and I, are usually together for most of the day and the truth is we are not supposed to have energy drinks. @CAPS1's dad, @PERSON1, gave us a monster to split and that day we were going to @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1. After about ten minutes of us drinking the whole monster, me being the one who drank most of it, was the one who was staying calm. @CAPS1 on the other hand, who drank a couple of sips, was going crazy. She was running down the aisles and tripping over her own feet. She almost tipped the cart over with me on the end of it. Laughing hysterically for no apparent reason is normal for her. Wendy, @PERSON1's wife and my second cousin started to get hungry, so we went to go eat pizza at the @ORGANIZATION2 cafe that is there. My mom had called me and I was trying to get my phone from my pocket to answer while trying to hold onto my plate of hot pizza. I handed my plate to @CAPS1 because my plate was slipping from my grip. She was holding her food in her other hand, she felt the bottom of my plate and said it was really hot so she passed it off to @PERSON1 who wasn't paying attention and he didn't have a good hold on it and my pizza dropped on the floor, pizza side down. It was so embarrassing everybody was looking at us. After that embarrassing moment, @PERSON1 realized that he forgot the churros, so he told @CAPS1 to go get them. All three of us realized his mistake as soon as @CAPS1 left, cause @CAPS1 is a klutz and we probably jinxed it by saying @CAPS1 is probably going to drop them. We were a little surprised that she hadn't dropped them yet, as soon as we thought that and she set them on the table, one of the churros fell off the table and rolled out of the package. We were laughing so hard that we couldn't breathe. @CAPS1 was so embarrassed by her mistake that she turned bright red. We felt bad for poor @CAPS1, but we couldn't help but laugh because of how funny it was. She knew it was funny but she didn't want to laugh at herself. One of the things I usually say is if you can't and aren't willing to laugh at yourself then you aren't having fun. That's why I believe it is so important to laugh cause you gotta learn how to have fun when it is in a situation that you need to laugh at yourself but yet aren't wanting to. That's one of the biggest ways to have fun is by laughing, because you know you made a small silly mistake that you think everyone in the world saw, all you need is to laugh it off. But you won't cause you feel too embarrassed or too ashamed to admit that you made a little mistake. Sometimes it's your job to go over to them, pat them on the back and tell them that everybody makes mistakes, you gotta learn how to be silly in a tough situation, and that nobody is perfect. Tell them to laugh it off, it helps and you will feel better once you realize that when life knocks you down just get back up cause that's what life is all about. That's the only way you can learn from your mistakes and from life as well. Laughter is really important; the more you laugh, the better you feel and the better you feel, the more fun you will have. Laughter fixes everything; it is a bandage for the little things that happen in life. Laughing with others, especially in moments of embarrassment, can help build stronger bonds and create lasting memories that we can look back on with a smile. So, let's keep laughing, embracing our imperfections, and finding joy in the little mishaps that make life colorful and fun.
51	20777	8	3	"I once heard ""laughter is the best medicine."" I believe that is true. I could laugh all day long, finding anything and everything funny in the world. Laughter is important to me, without it, life would be boring. Sometimes laughter is good and comes from the heart. Other times it can be cruel and mean. I like to avoid the cruel and mean laughter, and just stick to the good laughter. When one of my friends is laughing and smiling, it makes me want to know what they're laughing about, so I can laugh too. Birthdays are fun, laughing usually comes with fun. I remember my twelfth birthday, I decided to have a party at my house. I wanted it to be very special so I invited my closest friends and my cousins. Family always makes everything special. My cousin and I are pretty close, she was born nine months after me, so we are both the same age for a little while. We always have a good time, both of us acting crazy and always laughing. For my party my mom made rainbow sherbert punch, it was delicious. Everyone had fun, and soon the party was over, but my cousins were not leaving until the next day so we continued the party. I was in the kitchen getting more punch, my cousin came in and wanted some more too. I poured both of us a glass. ""This is so good!"" my cousin said. ""I know that's why I had my mom make it"" ""Do you wanna hear a joke?"" ""Sure."" she said. ""Okay, there once was a kid named butt itches, he was really sick and one day died, his mom cried to the doctor,""Oh my poor butt itches!"" ""And you wanna know what the doctor said?"" ""What?"" she asked. ""Scratch it!"" she had just taken a drink of punch when I said that. She spit the punch out of her mouth while laughing, it got all over me. Usually when someone spits, or spills something on you, you get mad. I started cracking up laughing, and so did she. ""Oh my gosh! That's so gross."" ""But I could not stop laughing. The joke was not that funny, it was the punch all over me and the kitchen. We laughed for at least fifteen minutes before even realizing that both our moms were standing in the kitchen. They were just staring at us wondering what in the world had happened. You would think that getting punch spitted at your face, on your birthday, would make you mad. That is why laughter makes ordinary days special. In my case, laughter was the shortest distance between my cousin and I. It would have to be short for her to get that much punch on me. Laughter made that birthday extra special, because I will never forget my twelfth birthday."
52	20778	8	3	"@CAPS10 @CAPS10 @CAPS10, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1, and now even @CAPS2 (@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5). Laughter! Some say it is the best medicine. It can brighten a cloudy day, cure the blues, and soothe a breaking heart. However, a simple snicker or giggle can also break a heart. I remember being in 1st grade and becoming the target of my classmates' jokes due to my weight. Their laughter crushed my self-esteem, leading to tears. One particularly hurtful moment was on the bus when girls I considered friends laughed at me, calling me a ""beached whale."" Their words stung, and I vowed never to ride the bus again. That experience motivated me to lose weight and regain confidence. Years later, I am 60 pounds lighter, a varsity cheerleader, and proud of my journey. Despite my own growth, I caught myself laughing at an overweight girl with my friend at the mall. Seeing her pain mirrored my past hurt, prompting me to stop. I realized the impact of hurtful laughter and vowed never to mock others' feelings. While I enjoy humor and making others laugh, I draw the line at the expense of someone's emotions. My story serves as a reminder of the harm laughter can cause and the importance of empathy. So laugh, but not at the cost of another's feelings."
53	20779	8	3	Laughter is a big part of my life and I believe it is essential for a healthy relationship. My mother and I share a bond filled with laughter, often finding humor in the silliest of things. I also enjoy laughing with friends, even coming up with unique ways to experiment with different vowel sounds while laughing. One memorable moment was when my mother, aunt, and I tried a homemade facial mask and ended up looking like a group of crazy ladies, struggling to contain our laughter. Despite the mask cracking and our efforts going down the drain, that day remains one of the funniest in my life. I have various forms of laughter, from laughing so hard that I forget to breathe to emitting a snort on occasion. Laughter has brought so much joy and lightness into my life, and I cannot imagine living without it. It truly is the best medicine.
54	20781	8	3	The laughter in me is a powerful force that helps me get through tough days. A good laugh, especially with my best friend, can bring hope and joy even in the most difficult moments. My best friend, who I call @PERSON1, always manages to say something hilarious, and we end up laughing uncontrollably. Even when people give us strange looks, we don't care because we understand each other. Laughter with her, as well as with my other best friend @PERSON2, is a way for me to relieve stress and enjoy life. Whether it's joking around in class, sharing funny memories, or teasing my family, laughter is a vital part of my relationships and daily routine. It keeps me motivated, helps me connect with others, and adds a spark of joy to my life. Without laughter, I would struggle to navigate the challenges of each day and find it difficult to make meaningful connections. Thank you, laughter, for being my constant companion and source of strength.
55	20783	8	3	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3  The beautiful flames danced so peacefully in the @CAPS1 air. The faint shimmer of the blaze was the only light we had. As I stared at the majestic destruction of the warm, humid air, I felt someone or something watching me from behind. The weight of the sixty pounds of wood started to get heavy as I walked from one side of the house to the other. Finally, I reached the trailer just to be told by @PERSON4, my best friends mom, the she didn't think we would need that much wood. I thought to myself the this was going to be a long weekend. After about two hours of packing clothes, food, water, sleeping bags, pillows, and tents we headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. It would be about two hours of driving, that felt like twenty minutes. @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and I were the worst group of people to put into one car. We all yell and fight and punch at each other just for fun. Once we arrived at our destination, we sprung out of the car like a hive of angry bees. I race @PERSON2 to the @ORGANIZATION1. the second we were done unpacking our belongings. The first few days were spent basking in the one hundred degree heat, swimming, and flirting with the random girls we found around the camp site. We slept as little as possible, so that we could enjoy the friendship and just pure fun we were having. During day two, we decided to go mountain biking. We were on those bikes for hours before we noticed the sun was going down. In the moment we all turned and saw the most extravagant view the earth has ever created. There were burst of orange and red. The colors ricochet from cloud to cloud. After hours of riding our bikes in the heat, we chose to go for a swim. As we swam I felt something touching my foot. Then all of a sudden there was a hand on my foot. When I looked down to see who was grabbing me, it was only a stick. As I looked closer, it turned out to be a root system of a fallen tree. It looked fake, as if someone or something had put it there. This though sparked a conversation about @CAPS2 for the day to come.  The sparks danced together as if they were @CAPS4 and the @LOCATION1. The only light we had was the brilliant glow of the fire. @PERSON3 was playing a gorgeous melody on his guitar. As I listened and enjoyed the flawlessness of nature, I felt someone watching me from behind. I nudged @PERSON3 and when we turned around, our hearts stopped. There was a spinning green light, almost twenty feet in the air. I spoke the word everyone was dreading, @CAPS2. I had slowly stood up and the light started spinning faster. I quickly grabbed the machete, that was next to me, and approached the light. As I grew closer, I could make out small figured in the @CAPS1 shadows. Then, an eruption of children laughing came booming from the direction of the light. A little boy emerged, unable to control is laughter, and ran away. After returning to my seat next to the camp fire, I thought about life. What if @CAPS2 were real and they are watching us. No, there not real. I laughed it off, and continued my week long vacation.  The days at the campsite were filled with adventure, laughter, and moments of pure joy. The mysteries of the night, like the spinning green light, only added to the magic of our time in nature. As I reflected on the possibility of supernatural beings watching over us, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the unforgettable experiences and the bonds formed with my friends. The flames continued to dance peacefully, illuminating the beauty of the moment, and I knew that these memories would stay with me forever.
56	20784	8	3	Laughter is a powerful tool that can help alleviate stress and improve mood. Different people have unique laughs, and finding humor in difficult situations can lead to a more positive outcome.

57	20785	8	3	Laughter is indeed a powerful tool, as demonstrated by the transformation in attitude of the narrator's nephew towards school. Despite initially dreading school, the surprise party organized by the school staff completely changed his perspective. The joy and excitement of the party, coupled with the fun atmosphere, turned school into a place of happiness and enjoyment for him. The playful antics during the party, including a mischievous squirt gun prank, created lasting memories and solidified his newfound love for school. With his positive outlook and resilient spirit, the nephew is sure to thrive in his academic journey. Laughter truly has the ability to work wonders and bring about positive change in unexpected ways.
58	20787	8	3	I know you guys listen to the same things over and over again, but I also know that a lot of people don't really answer the prompt that you give them. Well, I'm sorry because I was not able to answer the prompt either. I cannot remember when the last time I had a really good @CAPS3 within a couple of years, so I will tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What's so special about laughter? For me, laughter helps us in many ways. I will talk about how laughter is good for my health, how everyone's laughs are different, and even make us @CAPS3 at them. Also why laughter is so special to me. I have always felt this weird feeling in my head after I laughed. I think it's because endorphins are being produced into my brain. If I @CAPS3 too hard my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works out my abs. I also think it helps all three sides of the health triangle. My social life makes me @CAPS3 with people. Emotionally laughing makes me happy. Also physical is always funny when you work out with a friend. I think that everybody's @CAPS3 is unique in its way. I also know that sometimes it's funny to listen to other people chuckle, snort, or sound like a mouse. Our laughs are another thing that just makes us, us! Laughing to me is special because of all the people who make me @CAPS3. My friends are family I have chosen for myself. My family makes me @CAPS3 and be happy every day. It's special to me because those people are special to me. Laughing with my father is nothing compared to me laughing with my mother. Laughing with my friends will never compare to me laughing with my significant other. My life is all about laughter, and it's special to me. It's not like chewing a piece of gum. It's a whole other thing. Nothing is more fun than having a girls' night and laughing all night, or even going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is a matter of life. Laughing is truly special in many ways, from its health benefits to the unique sounds we each make, but most importantly, it brings joy and connection with those we care about the most.
59	20790	8	3	Laughter has been a nonchalant but steady and strong force for me in many relationships. I believe that laughter is useful in getting to know people you've just met and growing closer to people you care about. In my opinion, laughter brings people closer and can change a bad situation upside down. Getting enough bravery to gain new friends, ask this girl out and eventually develop a good relationship with her, is where laughter played an important role.  It was when I was fifteen and a sophomore at school. It was my first year there. I have been to many schools, Wood, etc., and like any new school, I was having a hard time connecting on a social level with my peers. Everyday seemed like a boring cycle that I seemed to be trapped in. Trying to fit in and be cool did not seem to work, until I realized that being real and true to myself was what people actually liked.  I changed my ways, stopped trying to act cool, and just started being myself. And it turned out that I actually was cool, and girls found me attractive because of my ability to make them laugh or at least smile. This gained me many friends that I didn't have before, and even one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen, named . She had many admirers, so what chance did I have? What did I have to offer her? Laughter. My greatest attribute that had come to my rescue many times.  Even though the relationship didn't last as long as I would have liked, it was great being with her for as long as I did. The experiences we had together were priceless, all because of my ability to make her laugh and put a smile on her face. I believe that without laughter, this world would not be the place it is today. Joy, which is the core of what laughter brings, allows us to forgive and forget. It allows us to overlook things and survive the future.
60	20791	8	3	Laughter is truly one of the best parts of life. It spreads happiness and joy, making everything better. It is contagious and can brighten someone's day in an instant. Surrounding yourself with loved ones is key to experiencing true happiness, as they bring warmth and light to your life. One memorable moment filled with laughter for me was on a sunny day at a friend's house. We were having a great time playing catch and enjoying each other's company when a funny mishap occurred, setting off a chain of laughter that lasted throughout the evening. It was a perfect moment of pure joy and camaraderie. Laughter truly is the best medicine, and I cherish moments like these that bring so much happiness and light into our lives.
61	20792	8	3	"Laughter is the essence of life. Without laughter, my life would be meaningless, and without that sense of happiness or compassion, life wouldn't be worth living. My sister is the only person I trust with my secrets. She is the only one who makes me happy when I feel down. My sister and I laugh with each other at our own jokes. My sister is my other half, and we share everything. She makes me laugh and is always there when I need her. I'll always be there for her also. Laughter is an important part of life. My sister and I laugh and play together. One day, I came off the bus from school, all I could do was cry. As I waited for my sister's bus to arrive, the tears fell down like a river flowing. The bus appeared, and a sense of joy appeared with it. But it wasn't the bus that brought my joy, it was my sister. Right away, she could feel my pain and noticed my tears. I could see in her face the love and care. She asked me what's wrong, and I could hear the worry in her voice. My river of tears stopped, and I began to speak. I could tell her everything without trying or holding anything back. The words flowed through my mouth. I didn't need to think of what to say. I told her what happened without a pause. Afterwards, she told me something I'll never forget. She said, ""No matter what happens, I'll always love you."" And we laughed. It was the sweetest laugh, a chorus of laughter filling the air. Nothing that people say about me is true, so I learned to laugh at it. My sister is my rock, my confidante, and my source of joy. With her by my side, I know that no matter what life throws at us, we will always have each other to lean on and laugh with."
62	20793	8	3	The night was dark and gloomy, reflecting the dismal state of my day. Everything had gone wrong, especially a hurtful exchange with my girlfriend that left me consumed with guilt and sorrow. As I lay in bed, tears streaming down my face, a call from my best friend brought a glimmer of hope. Venting to him over dinner and sharing laughter by the river's edge, I realized the power of friendship in lifting my spirits. Laughter, in particular, has a magical ability to brighten even the darkest of days. I find solace in the thought that as I grow old, my wrinkles will be a testament to the countless moments of joy shared with friends through laughter. Laughter truly is a beacon of light in the darkest of times.
63	20794	8	3	Being with people who can make you feel comfortable and be yourself is the best quality in a friend. A friend can look past your flaws and make you laugh until you cry, bringing immense joy to your life. Laughter is a precious gift that can uplift our spirits and create unforgettable memories. I have experienced moments of uncontrollable laughter with my friends, where we shared jokes and watched comedy shows that left us in tears. These moments of pure joy remind me of the importance of having supportive and loving people in my life. Laughter is truly a universal language that connects us all and brings us closer together. I cherish the times when I can laugh freely and be myself with those who accept me for who I am. Life is meant to be lived to the fullest, and having friends who bring laughter and happiness into our lives makes the journey all the more enjoyable. I am grateful for the laughter and love shared with my friends, as it enriches my life in ways that words cannot fully express.
64	20795	8	3	It's always hard to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you when they are sad or mad. Most of the time you don't know what to do. I have learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better. As I was sitting at home one sunny afternoon, I got a call from my friend @PERSON1. When I put the phone to my ear all I could hear was a loud crying. @PERSON1 wasn't saying anything to me, not one word. Even though, I repeatedly asked her what was wrong with her, @PERSON1 wouldn't even say a word. Not knowing what to do or say to her anymore, I asked her to calm down and take deep breaths. Desperately, I wanted her to be able to talk to me and tell me what was going on because I had started to get really worried.  A couple of minutes later, @PERSON1 started explaining to me what had happened. @PERSON1 started off by telling me she was irresponsible that she didn't pay attention to what was happening around her. I asked her why she was saying that about herself because I knew she was a responsible person. Finally, @PERSON1 screamed that while she was home watching the @CAPS1 basketball team play basketball, her dog @CAPS2 got run over. The dog had actually died. I found it very ridiculous and pathetic that @PERSON1 would be crying over her dog. I didn't want to be rude about it and tell her what was going through my mind at that time.  Even though that was the way I felt about the whole situation. I thought of the words I needed to say to @PERSON1 but I was confused. Actually, it wasn't so much that I was confused, I was afraid of hurting her feelings with my words. Finally, I decided to tell her not to worry about her dog, that my friend had a couple of dogs for sale. Also, I told @PERSON1 that if it made her feel any better I would buy her a new puppy. After saying that to her there was an awkward silence. My hands started to get shaky because I thought @PERSON1 was mad.  All of a sudden, I just heard her start laughing really loud and once again she couldn't talk. I felt so relieved that I had made her laugh and not cry or get mad at me. @PERSON1 wouldn't shut her mouth, she just laughed and laughed and laughed hysterically. Finally, she shut her mouth up and started talking to me again. @PERSON1 thanked me for making her laugh and making a joke out of the situation, rather than saying depressing words that would make her feel bad and make her cry even more.  I was happy I made her laugh because she felt better about herself and not worse. As I was laughing, I told her that anytime she needed to laugh I was the person she needed to call. Anytime, any day, and anywhere I would be happy to bring a smile to her face and a loud laugh to her mouth. @PERSON1 laughed with me and thanked me one more time for making her laugh. From that day on, I always like to make people laugh because I know I'm going to make them feel better. I sure love it when others make me laugh too. It's just an amazing feeling, a great feeling that everyone loves and can't really describe. After making my friend @PERSON1 laugh, I found out laughter was a key element of life.
65	20796	8	3	Laughter is an important element to have in life. Because without it, there would be no happiness or joy in the world. Friends are a great source for laughter, they are the people you go to to be yourself. Some people use laughter to release pain. For example, whenever my dad gets hurt he starts laughing. My dad was in the navy a few years ago, and during training he got hit in the stomach. Nothing really was wrong, but it did hurt him. So he sat down and started to laugh. I guess this trait is hereditary because I find myself doing the exact same thing from time to time.  When I learned about how laughter heals, it wasn't too long ago. It was last summer, early August and the end of summer was coming close. Traditionally, my family would drive to a nearby store and buy a huge pack of fireworks. Once the sunset came, it was time. We all knew it was time to light up the sky with colorful sparks. After the end of summer had passed, my cousin came over. My mom had been feeling a little sick, but it wasn't contagious. Despite her health issues, we found ways to keep ourselves entertained and distracted.  As days went by, my mom showed signs of improvement. I was eager to go out and enjoy a movie with her and my cousin. The next day, my mom woke me up feeling much better. We decided to go see a movie and have a good time. Everything seemed to be going well until a few days later, my mom passed away in her sleep. It was a sudden and devastating loss that left me feeling like my heart had exploded like a firework.  In the midst of the grief and pain, my cousin and her family tried to bring some laughter into our lives. They knew that laughter could help alleviate some of the pain we were feeling. Finding moments of joy and laughter in such a dark time was truly remarkable. It reminded me of the importance of laughter in our lives, even during the most difficult moments. Laughter truly has the power to heal and bring light into the darkest of times.
66	20797	8	3	"Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" To me, that means that laughter is the quickest and easiest way to connect with another person. I believe this because my older brother and I used to have a strained relationship. However, as we spent more time together, we found that laughter played a crucial role in bringing us closer. One day, while sitting on the back porch, my brother unexpectedly fell into a bush, leading to a moment of shared laughter that broke the tension between us. Since then, laughter has become an integral part of our family gatherings, where stories are shared and bonds are strengthened. In my experience, laughter brings happiness, which in turn fosters love, making it a vital component of relationships. Therefore, I agree that ""laughter is the shortest distance between all people."""
67	20800	8	3	This true story might sound somewhat cheesy, but it's true and, in my opinion, it's a love story. On a typical day, after finishing her school tasks, Sarah decided to log on to BookFace to chat with some new friends she had made online. Sarah had forgotten that she had sent a friend request to Mike. Mike had accepted Sarah's request, and that's when Sarah remembered about the request. Mike and Sarah started to know more about each other, minute after minute, before they had no clue who the other one was. Mike gave Sarah his number after a long chat so she could call or text him to keep in contact while being off of BookFace. Mike was starting to like Sarah, and so was she. Sarah now knew that Mike is a high school student, a sophomore to be exact, that he is tall, and also has friends in common with her. Sarah really liked talking to Mike a lot, and so did Mike to her. Sarah noticed that Mike loved to laugh a lot, which always made her day brighter. Mike knew Sarah had recently broken up with her boyfriend, but he didn't mind; he liked her. He had a strong hope that he could have a chance at making Sarah happy. Eventually, Mike asked Sarah if she would be his girlfriend, to which Sarah joyfully accepted. Days passed, and they were doing perfectly until Sarah started receiving texts from her ex-boyfriend, which affected their relationship. Despite still being in love with her ex, Mike didn't give up and fought to win Sarah's heart. One night, while talking on the phone, Mike asked Sarah if she was willing to try to forget her ex. Although scared, Sarah agreed to try. Their communication was excellent, especially when laughter was involved. Sarah even asked Mike to laugh for her, which he happily did. Laughter played a significant role in their relationship, making it much better. It may not be perfect, but it certainly helped them overcome obstacles and unnecessary fights. Laughter seemed to be a universal language that helped them communicate and understand each other better. In conclusion, laughter indeed plays a crucial part in all relationships.
68	20802	8	3	My relationship with laughter has been a crucial aspect of my life ever since I met my boyfriend. He brought joy and happiness into my life, replacing the constant feelings of depression that I had been struggling with. Laughing with him has become a regular occurrence, and it has strengthened our bond over time. Despite facing challenges and misunderstandings, we have managed to overcome them and keep our laughter alive in our relationship. I cherish the moments of joy and laughter that we share, as they remind me of the love and support that we have for each other. As long as we continue to make each other smile and laugh, I believe that our relationship will remain strong and unbreakable. Laughter will always be a fundamental part of our connection, bringing us closer together and helping us navigate through life's ups and downs.
69	20803	8	3	"""Laughter"" I once heard a man say "" laughing is the key to happiness, and if you do not laugh you aren't healthy"" @CAPS1 do people love to laugh? Because it laughing creates great memories, it gets rid of sadness, it gives you energy, and it even gives you a good abdominal work depending on how hard you laugh and for how long. There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is even sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny.  I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job. Say you go in for an interview for a job that involves you working with people everyday. Are you going to go in there boring and moditone? No, your going to go in there make the person who is interviewing you laugh and act like you have known him or her since @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  Laughter can also be abused. It can be used in bad ways, such as making fun of people because it @MONTH1 be funny. Calling kids in your gym class names because they cant throw a baseball as far as you. Laughing @MONTH1 make people feel as bright as the stars at night, or it @MONTH1 make people feel as bad as a basketball player missing the buzzer beater to win the championship game. Be careful when you use it, treat it like a loaded gun, because if you use it wrong it could hurt someone.  A few hours after my @CAPS4 died. My family and I began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us. I had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my @CAPS5 @PERSON1's cheeks. We then suddenly began to talk about all the times she would get mad mad and swear at my dad when he was a little boy, then get embarrassed because she knew she never should have said the lords name in vain. After thinking back on those moments we began to laugh, and not just a small unnoticeable giggle, i mean we were laughing out loud. It then got rid of that aching sadness that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how laughter that very night would become such an emotional memories later in life. Laughter truly has a powerful impact on our emotions and memories."
70	20804	8	3	"Laughter is a crucial aspect of my life, bringing joy and brightness to my days. It plays a significant role in my interactions with friends, family, and my boyfriend. One particular instance that stands out is when my boyfriend used humor to alleviate my stomach ache during a journey home. As we traveled, he lightened the mood by sharing amusing anecdotes and eventually made me burst into laughter by revealing his unintentionally voluminous hair after using a shampoo labeled ""from flat to volume."" This incident turned my focus from discomfort to uncontrollable laughter, showcasing the power of humor in easing distress. The memory of his comically inflated hair continues to bring smiles, highlighting the enduring impact of laughter in my life. Laughter truly remains my go-to remedy for any ailment, ensuring that joy and mirth are never far away."
71	20805	8	3	"Have you ever wondered how you and your best friends even became friends? Maybe not, but maybe you have and couldn't remember. Well this story I'm about to tell you today is about how my friend @PERSON3 and I became friends. I'm also going to tell you how we have stayed friends for as long as we have and all the little things that have kept us friends. Admittedly we did not start off as friends who laughed all the time, instead we started off as a crier and a helper. @PERSON3 and I first met in the eighth grade. I had just gotten called out of my first period class and greeted by my math teacher @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told me that we had just gotten a new student that moved here from @LOCATION1 and wasn't exactly happy about it. She also asked me if I wouldn't mind showing her around the school with another classmate, @PERSON4, I agreed and walked into the room @PERSON3 was in. When I saw her the first thing I noticed was her eyes, as the tears went down her face. Then I realized she was a very pretty girl who, like @PERSON1 said wasn't happy. I will admit i was a little scared to try and show her around seeing as she wasn't happy at all to be here. But once we got started she had calmed down immensely, but she still wouldn't even crack a smile at our feeble tempts to make jokes. I still felt like she should be happy and broke out the big guns. So I walked differently and talked in a funny voice, I even started saying random funny things in long pauses. Eventually she smiled, so I kept going. Toward the end I got her and @PERSON4 to laugh so hard we all almost wet ourselves. But as funny as it was for us, it definitely wasn't the last funny thing we did. You know the type of funny things that happen and no matter what, you always remember it when you see that person it happened with, right? Well to say the least @PERSON3 and I have a lot of those moments. Granted a lot of them happen with other people, but that's what makes it fun. Like this one time in our drawing and painting class we, @PERSON3, @LOCATION2, and @CAPS1 and I, were all in @PERSON2's little office getting a picture to draw. I had been hyper pretty much all day and so had @CAPS3 else. I randomly look around the room and see a really cute looking poster I hadn't noticed ever before and without realizing it I had said aloud, ""@CAPS2, that's really cute."" @CAPS3 started laughing and holding on to the desk to keep from falling to the ground. I still hadn't realized I said it aloud and was really confused but still laughing because watching them laugh was really entertaining. They finally calmed down long enough to say what I'd just said and I blushed but started laughing along. Now every time they see me and remember that moment they crack up laughing and they point to something and say it the way I said it. That's why I think that having the big memories of the really funny thing has kept us together. It helps us remember the fun times during the bad times. It also helps to keep our link strong throughout the group of our friends. But the little things matter too. Every little thing we do together as friends helps us later. If we didn't do all the little funny things and only did either big funny things, or boring things, I don't think our friendship would last long. Like when we're talking and we accidentally burp or we fart while we walk. Or maybe when I laugh and I hide my face with my hands and my arms jiggle. Possibly even when we say something weird or walk funny because we really have to go to the bathroom. It's not just being friends that keeps us together it's how we are and who we become with that other person, I feel like I become a better person and I believe I help her become one too. Besides the little things are just as funny as the big things we do. So as I've stated before laughter is a big part of a friendship. @PERSON3 and my friendship hadn't started in of laughter, it started in tears and grew to be laughter. Laughter had brought us together in an act of weirdness and it has stayed very strong ever since, not only because we had a lot in common, to be frank we don't really even have that much in common, it is because of the big hilarious moments we've shared not only together, but with other people and the little things we do on a daily basis that we find really funny. I do have to say laughter is probably the best thing to keep any relationship good and healthy."
72	20806	8	3	"There are a couple things that can lead strangers to being comfortable with each other, in my experience it was laughter. Meeting my boyfriends parents was very nerve wrecking and uncomfortable. I am a people person and I can get along with anybody. Starting a conversation with someone who is judging my every move was a little bit of a challenge. My boyfriend @PERSON3 and I have been dating for almost a year now and are the type of people that like spending time with our families. So because of this it was obvious that meeting the family would come into play. I met his parents when we were young and we attended the last years of elementary and some of middle school and all but one year of high school together, I left for a couple years and came back really different. So after @NUM1 months of dating I met the folks. One day in @DATE1 @PERSON3 had a football game that i attended with some girlfriends who were also dating guys on the team. After a terrible loss @PERSON3 came out of the locker room and hugged me and told me it was time to meet the parents. I took a deep breath and started to get really nervous. I love meeting new people and I usually don't have a problem with it, but the fact that I wanted his parents to love me put a lot of weight on me. I slowly walked over after him, and said ""@CAPS3"" in my most friendly voice possible. His mother reached out and said "" @CAPS1 @PERSON1, I'm @CAPS2"" I took her hand and shook it and replied ""@CAPS3, so nice to meet you"". I looked at @ORGANIZATION1 for reassurance then his father reached out with a very welcoming smile and his eyes looked so familiar and warm. "" @CAPS4 there, I'm @PERSON2"", I shook his hand and felt less nervous and a bit comfortable. "" @CAPS1 , great to meet you, what did you think of the game?'. He looked surprise that i talked and we started a great conversation about football. After talking about football for about @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes @PERSON3 brought up something that reminded me of a joke. I always have lame jokes so I was nervous about telling it to his parents. It wasn't even a funny joke, @PERSON3 thought it was lame, yet i loved it. I took the chance anyways. I said "" @CAPS4 that reminds me of a joke"", @PERSON3 looked at me with wide eyes that said oh god, don't. I looked away and started ""so there were two muffins in the oven one said, wow its hot in here, there the other screamed, holy crap! A talking muffin. I started laughing and my laugh is very odd. Anyone i meet tells me me laugh is so unique. His mother was like ""that is adorable i will have to tell it to @CAPS6"", I smiled gratefully. His father @PERSON2 said so sweetly "" I like your laugh, i ain't heard anything like it"". @PERSON3 came in and said ""yes her laugh is really something"". We all kinda smiled and at each other and went to dinner, cracking jokes and laughing then laughing at my laugh. Thank goodness for laughing, once we started laughing I felt comfortable and welcomed. Until this day we laugh at me telling that joke. I still until this day am happy i told the joke."
73	20807	8	3	"On @DATE1, I had a mission trip meeting in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 o'clock in the @TIME1. @CAPS11 friend @PERSON2 decided he would go with me. So I had @CAPS11 grandpa pick us up from the house and take us to @LOCATION2. When we got to the church I went to @CAPS11 meeting till @NUM2 o'clock, then went to bible study. I was tired and ready to go home by then. Come to realize @CAPS11 grandpa is know where to be found, he apperently left to go home and @CAPS11 mom, grandma and @CAPS11 sister @CAPS3 had just got there to pick us up. I had just been informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip. After the meeting we went to @PERSON1 craft store. When we got there me and @PERSON2 went over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, while @CAPS11 mom, grandma, and @CAPS3 stayed in @LOCATION3. I bought me and @CAPS11 mom a pair of comfortable slippers. then we went back into @PERSON1 to brag about the slippers to @CAPS11 mom and grandma. That was a bad idea, @CAPS11 grandma decided she needed a pair for herself, so she walked over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She was taking forever. I told her that if she stopped looking at stuff we would go to @CAPS6, get a sandwhich, and come back. So we did. When we got to @CAPS6 @PERSON2 was in a bad mood because he was ready to go home. We ordered our sandwhichs and went back to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She finally found herself a pair of slippers, after looking for an hour and a half. Everyone gets in the car, and we think were going home when all of a sudden grandma shouts out ""were going to @LOCATION5's, I want a bowl of chili"". Our reaction was ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11 gosh"". We couldn't let her be hungry, so we had to stop. after getting her chili she says ""I need to go into @ORGANIZATION1"", @CAPS10 boy was that a mistake. We were in @ORGANIZATION1 forever in a day. After we got back in the car from @ORGANIZATION1 I sat in the backseat in the middle of @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION2. I told @PERSON2 not to forget to show @CAPS11 mom an important piece of mail he had when we got home, and his response was ""@CAPS10 ya! If we ever get home"". All I could do was laugh. I was being video taped by @PERSON2 and @CAPS11 mom kept looking back at me to see if I was ok. I just couldn't stop laughing. I laughed so hard I was crying, I lost all @CAPS11 breath, and @CAPS11 face was as red as a cherry. I laughed without a break from @ORGANIZATION1 to @LOCATION4 road. When I eventually fell asleep.   As we finally made our way home, I couldn't help but reflect on the chaotic yet memorable day we had. Despite the unexpected twists and turns, it was filled with laughter and shared moments that I will always cherish. It's days like these that remind me of the importance of family and the joy that comes from simply being together, no matter how unplanned or eventful the day may be."
74	20808	8	3	Laughing is a crucial aspect of life that can bring joy, create lasting memories, and strengthen relationships. From childhood beliefs about laughter prolonging life to the fun shared moments with friends and family, the power of laughter is evident in everyday experiences. Whether it's sharing jokes with siblings, enjoying the company of close friends, or simply finding humor in everyday situations, laughter has a way of lifting spirits and brightening moments.   Memories of shared laughter, such as stealing a truck for a joyride or pretending to be in a spaceship under a table, hold a special place in the heart. These moments not only bring a smile to the face but also serve as a reminder of the joy and connection shared with others. Even in difficult times, a good laugh can provide a sense of relief and perspective, making challenges seem more manageable.  The ability to laugh and find humor in life's ups and downs is a valuable trait that can lead to a more positive outlook and stronger relationships. Whether it's reminiscing about past adventures or creating new memories filled with laughter, embracing the joy that laughter brings can truly enrich life in countless ways. So, next time you find yourself in a tough spot, remember to laugh, for it may just be the remedy needed to navigate through life's obstacles with a lighter heart and a brighter spirit.
75	20809	8	3	Laughter is a crucial part of my life, serving as a source of strength and comfort in challenging times. Whether faced with difficult situations like my brother's return to jail, a painful breakup, or my own health struggles, laughter has the power to uplift and heal. Even when dealing with heartache or illness, I choose to find humor and joy in life, knowing that laughter is the best medicine. Through the laughter shared with loved ones, I am able to navigate through adversity and find solace in the simple pleasures of life. Embracing laughter as a vital ingredient in my daily existence, I am reminded to cherish the small moments of happiness that bring us closer together and make life worth living. So, in times of darkness, I choose to laugh and find light amidst the shadows, knowing that laughter is the key to living a fulfilling and joyful life.
76	20812	8	3	Laughter. We all need it. We need it as a reminder that there is hope for those who have perseverance, for those who strive not to better others, but for those who strive to better themselves. We need it as a reminder to live our dreams, instead of dreaming of living. And, in my opinion, most importantly, we need it as a reminder that even though we make mistakes, there is still a chance for those who simply have the courage to seize it. In the past, my foster parents decided to go out for dinner, leaving me with a friend to spend the evening together. We decided to set up the Christmas tree first, and after admiring our work, we went down to the den. It was during this time that I made the decision to break up with my girlfriend, feeling a mix of happiness and loneliness. My friend, sensing my emotional state, gave me a hug, which unexpectedly made me burst into laughter. This simple act of kindness and understanding brought me comfort and reassurance. It was in that moment that I realized the true value of friendship and the power of laughter in healing the soul. And for that, I will always be grateful.
77	20813	8	3	As people have bonded over the years, those bonds have been strengthened by laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are important, but they all work together to build these bonds. For normal people to enjoy one another, they must have fun, and fun begins with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain, and if two people find the same thing funny, it brings them together with their similar interests. By telling a funny joke or being a person who always has a smile on their face, people are drawn to them more easily. Being a seemingly happy person has given me the friends I have. When I am with my friends, we are always laughing or joking about something. We could be laughing at ourselves, at a random person on the street, or even at something stupid. Most of the time, we won't get upset about it, but sometimes we may take it too far. Stupidity and pain are probably the top two reasons why we laugh. Stupidity occurs when someone says something that doesn't make sense or comes in at the wrong time. While I have never understood why we laugh at pain, it may be because we are relieved it is not happening to us or because we know the person will recover. Laughter will always bring people together in relationships, showing common interests and what people can tolerate from others. Without happiness and laughter, the world would be incredibly dull.
78	20814	8	3	"Laughter is a mystery. Happens whenever it pleases. It puts smiles on faces. Laughter just happens in many ways it can. Although, mine just happened to end up in a crazy situation with a huge mess to follow it. Things got extreme, unforgettable. Things you could never forget. Around two months ago, in the cold winter. It was my 21st birthday. I threw a little party for myself at my house. Though, I was in for a little treat. As everyone arrived they all had a smirk on their faces. Nobody would tell me what was going on. I started to become distraught about it all. Until my buddy and my boyfriend walked into the kitchen with a 5 pound bucket full of spaghetti, with a ten pound gallon can of tomato sauce. Next thing I knew my mouth was agape. I couldn't believe my eyes, not understanding why so much of it. Also, why did they have it. My mother walked out and exclaimed ""Load up the cars, and let's go!"" As we approached the park, I had a funny feeling in the pit of my gut. I looked around and noticed my sister-in-law was holding a video camera. Right then and there I knew something was going to happen. Something big, extraordinary, out of the extreme and I was right. Spaghetti was flying everywhere, getting in people's hair, faces. Clothes were getting stained and messy. Not to mention it was cold, wet, and rainy outside. The fog made it hard to see who you were hitting and who was throwing it at you. By the end of the noodle war, I looked the worst. Even now the shoes I was wearing are stained. As we got back to my house we had to wash down with the hose. I swore I was going to get sick from the cold water running down my face. I could feel noodles falling out of my hair and clothing, the sauce streaming down my face. Laughing here and laughing there. Everyone was laughing at others for how badly they were covered with noodles and sauce. Eventually, we all got hungry. We decided on nachos. So, my mom poured two family size nacho chips on the table followed by two ten-gallon cans of nacho cheese with jalapenos, olives. You might think the noodle and sauce was messy, well that's where I went wrong. My friend dropped nachos on my couch. She threw cheese at the tree. So, my friend finally said ""No more nachos!"" And on it was cake time. Ginger thought that there wasn't going to be another mess. Well once again she was wrong. They all started singing the happy birthday song, cameras were flashing, my mother in the background crying. Soon after that we played video games. I got irritated with someone on the game and ended up throwing the controller at my television and broke it. Mother wasn't too pleased with me after that. Oh well, we still got to watch movies in the other room. Eventually people started leaving. Saying our goodbyes, I'll see you later, peace out dude. We said it all. I looked back in the living room and saw nothing but a huge mess of chips, nacho cheese, and cake. Not to mention my broken TV. I got stuck cleaning the mess for over three hours. Though, we were laughing the entire time it happened. Having the greatest time ever with each other. If I could I would go back and do it all over again just for the fun and laughs. Laughter is everywhere. You may not see it right away. Though you will once you start laughing your brains out. Laughing puts everyone in good moods and smiles on their faces. It may also make a mess and put things in a crazy situation. You can't deny after those crazy situations that you would go back and do it again. Laughter is the greatest thing in this world we call home."
79	20815	8	3	Laughter plays a significant role in our lives, influencing our relationships and how we interact with others. While some may see laughter as a means of creating distance between individuals, I believe it is a vital component of any relationship. Through laughter, we reveal our true selves and showcase our sense of humor. It allows others to understand us better and see the fun side of our personalities. In relationships, laughter can strengthen bonds and create a sense of camaraderie. It is a tool for building connections and breaking down barriers, rather than causing distance between people. Ultimately, laughter is a powerful force that brings joy, happiness, and unity to our lives.
80	20817	8	3	"There are times when I get along with others and times when I don't. I also have moments where I can make people laugh until they cry. One particular incident that comes to mind is when my friends and I were walking to the store and I started pointing out random things along the way. When I pointed out the @CAPS1 store, one of my friends burst into laughter so hard that he ended up peeing his pants. We had to go back to his house so he could change into clean clothes, which took him a good @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to do so. When I asked him what took him so long, he simply replied, ""I'm taking a pee."" This statement made me laugh even harder, and it dawned on me why he found the @CAPS1 store so amusing. It turned out that the last time we were there, a man was bragging about his son's football team, which my friend and I were supposedly part of, being in the top ten, even though we weren't. The man was so embarrassed by what my friend said that he got up, hugged us, and then jokingly asked why he didn't get a hug. This whole situation was so hilarious that I couldn't stop laughing, thankful that I didn't have to rush to the restroom."
81	20818	8	3	Laughter fills the air around us with happiness and joy, bringing warm memories of loved ones and adding a splash of hope to those in need. It is the key to solving life's problems and can come from various sources such as jokes, shows, or joyful reunions. Laughter not only creates bonds between people but also helps form lasting friendships. Surprises and shocks can also trigger laughter, turning unexpected moments into humorous memories. The connection shared through laughter is special, allowing people to understand each other without words. From family gatherings to childhood memories, laughter plays a significant role in our lives, reminding us of the joy found in simple moments.
82	20819	8	3	Laughter plays a crucial role in my everyday life, allowing me to express a range of emotions such as happiness, sadness, and even pain. Whether I am feeling joyful, hurt, or trying to mask my true feelings, laughter serves as a powerful tool in conveying my innermost emotions. It brings me solace during times of sadness, helps me cope with anger, and creates moments of pure joy when I am surrounded by loved ones. Laughter is not just a simple expression of amusement; it is a vital component that brightens my days and enriches my relationships. In essence, laughter is an essential part of my existence, bringing light and positivity into my world.
83	20821	8	3	Laughter is indeed a powerful force that can transform even the most mundane of experiences into memorable ones. In the case of the narrator, it was the infectious laughter of their fifth-grade teacher, Mr. @CAPS3, that made their school year truly special. Initially disappointed by Mr. @CAPS3's seemingly ordinary demeanor, the students were pleasantly surprised when he revealed his true colors on the second day of class. The classroom was transformed into a vibrant and lively space, filled with laughter and fun activities that brought the students together. Mr. @CAPS3's sense of humor, relatability, and genuine care for his students not only made learning enjoyable but also instilled a sense of confidence and enthusiasm for education in his pupils. The narrator fondly recalls the days spent in Mr. @CAPS3's class, where laughter and learning went hand in hand. The impact of Mr. @CAPS3's teaching style and personality is evident in the lasting memories and lessons that the narrator carries with them to this day. Laughter truly has the power to leave a lasting mark on our lives, shaping our experiences and relationships in profound ways.
84	20822	8	3	Laughing is an essential aspect of my relationships with others, serving as a way to connect, bond, and uplift spirits. It acts as a universal language that transcends barriers and brings people together in moments of joy and levity. Whether it's sharing inside jokes with close friends like @LOCATION1 and @CAPS4 or simply enjoying a good laugh in the company of others, the power of laughter cannot be understated. Through laughter, friendships are strengthened, memories are created, and life's challenges become a bit more bearable. As I navigate the ups and downs of life, I am grateful for the presence of friends who can make me laugh, reminding me that even in the darkest of times, there is always a reason to smile.
85	20823	8	3	"Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of every kind together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can bring discomfort to you and others around you, such as beans. Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak ""language"" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into the world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a ""bunny trail"" and was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving ""black eyes"" of sorts to both teams. was right and I knew it, but did really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, "" hadn't done what did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill."" was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that. ""That only happened one time!"" declared as tried to defended herself. "" way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!"" ""I didn't tell the world,"" I objected. ""I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on."" raised her eyebrow in a manner as to say, ""? You know what I'm talking about."" The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going nowhere and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; was done with me, I was done with her. leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to lose her footing. All the cool once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, met the unforgiving, stone floor with a which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. "","" managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same ""language."""

When you're feeling sad, angry, or in an argument, laughing can turn any negative feelings into good ones. Though you @MONTH1 not want to show the turn of emotion, it is very hard not to. Laughter is an important thing to have in abundance throughout your relationships. Laughing is a wonderful feeling. Whether it be a chuckle or a hilarious outburst, it completely changes one's mood. Laughing with someone is even better still. Having laughter-filled relationships is an important element to someone's well being.

Without it, there is no connection, joy, or excitement. There is no common ground if you're unable to @CAPS3 with someone. People need relationships with humor. Laughter bonds people together at any age. When I was still in diapers, I watched a video titled ""I @CAPS2 to @CAPS3."" I would watch this countless times during the day with my parents and siblings. Now, whenever that video is brought up we have a great time reminiscing about those days. Being able to @CAPS3 together has brought my family relationships to the highest point. Relationships are very important to have; including laughter will only make them stronger. Not only is laughter important, but it is contagious. Laughter can lighten a tough situation and lift everyone's spirits. It is very hard not to @CAPS3 when someone else is laughing.

Comedians make a career out of making people @CAPS3. There are good feelings that emerge when you can make someone @CAPS3. @PERSON1 is one of my personal favorite comedians. I @CAPS2 his style and the way he sets up his jokes. He knows how to make people @CAPS3. All of one's friendships need someone who can lift the spirits higher. However, the laughter shouldn't come from making fun of someone. It should come from the situation or a circumstance that the group @MONTH1 be facing. That is key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends. The healing powers of laughter are real and they work. There have been studies of how laughter can heal the body.

He shows how one needs laughter to be well. Laughter is so very important to a person's health. It raises the spirits and lightens moods. The fact that there is laughter therapy shows that if one doesn't have enough laughter in his life, he @MONTH1 not be as healthy as he could be. If your friendships are lacking humor, seek it. Laughter is one of the most important feelings that one needs to surround themselves with throughout their entire life. Laughter truly is the best medicine."
87	20825	8	3	In this essay, I will be discussing the importance of laughter, conflict, and trust in a relationship based on my strong bond with my cousin, who I have known for many years. My cousin and I share a deep connection characterized by laughter, conflict, and unwavering trust. We often find humor in each other's mistakes, using laughter as a way to bond and support one another through difficult times. Despite our frequent disagreements and conflicts, we always have each other's backs, preventing each other from making detrimental decisions and offering support when needed. Trust is a fundamental aspect of our relationship, as we confide in each other without fear of judgment and rely on each other in times of need. Our relationship is built on a foundation of mutual respect, understanding, and unconditional support, making us not only cousins but also best friends, confidants, and pillars of strength for each other. The combination of laughter, conflict, and trust has strengthened our bond over the years, allowing us to navigate life's challenges together with unwavering support and love. Through the ups and downs, we have learned that these elements are essential for a healthy and fulfilling relationship, and I am grateful to have such a strong and meaningful connection with my cousin.
88	20826	8	3	"Bell rings. Shuffle, shuffle. Snap. EEEE. Crack. Slam. Click, stomp. Tap tap tap. SLAM. Creak. Shoof, shoof. Sigh. Seventh class of the day. Here we go. ""@CAPS1! Tu va ou pas? On a +¨tude cette class-l+. Tu peux aller au bibliotheque si tu veux...."" @CAPS3 all blinked at me, @PERSON1, @NUM1le, and @ORGANIZATION1, chocolate-haired and mocha-skinned, impatiently awaiting my answer. The truth was, I knew @CAPS3 didn't really care if I came or not. It made no difference to them if I trailed a few feet behind like some pathetic puppy. I was silent but adorable, loved only because I was an @CAPS4. Because I spoke fidgety @CAPS5. Because I was the exchange student, because my translator and colorful clothes were so shocking for ten seconds, and were then forgotten about. I was a flock of seagulls haircut. So why are you here? I thought. Why did you go on exchange at all? You are the complete opposite of everyone here. No one wants you. Just go home. But my ego had a ready answer. You begged for this remember? For months and months, it was all you wanted, all you thought about, all you dreamt about. So I went with the girls. As expected, @CAPS3 walked down the three-person wide staircase side-by-side, and I shuffled awkwardly behind them. Finally arriving at @NUM2scalier, we sat at a table, the three girls talking. I glazed my eyes over, attempting to look lost in thought, as if I didn't care I wasn't included. Selfish thoughts buzzed in my head; if @CAPS3 weren't talking to me, why should I make the effort to talk to them? I really had no idea how @CAPS3 felt about me. How does someone feel about their shadow? @CAPS3 notice it, sure, but it never offers up insight, it never makes you laugh. It's all in the confidence, said my mother's voice, all how you carry yourself. But I knew it wasn't that simple. I was just too alien. These girls would never understand me, as I would never understand them. In frustration, I started to flick peas across the room with my spoon. Pat, flick, sproing. This caught the interest of @PERSON1, as @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1 were discussing something very emotional. Tears began to pour out of @ORGANIZATION1's eyes. Sniffling, she and @NUM1le went to the bathroom, leaving me all alone with @PERSON1. Only @PERSON2 could have felt my same emotion as he stared up at @CAPS6. Silently, I continued shooting peas. @PERSON1 just stared at them as @CAPS3 darted around the room. Suddenly, with a horrible miscalculation, a pea hit a boy in the face. And then, he turned around and swore. And then, @PERSON1 and I looked at each other from across the table. And then, we laughed. We laughed so hard I cried. So hard that huge, alien tears flooded from my eyes. People around us were laughing too, even though @CAPS3 had no idea what was so funny. I didn't even know what was so funny. But it didn't matter, because we were dripping tears and snot, reaching for each other, reenacting the pea hitting the boy's face. It was as if we had been friends for years, and laughing happened all the time. It was saturated with all the angst and lonliness and despair I had felt the past four weeks. The connection we felt was instantaneous, like lightening, the kind of connection I felt with my best friends back home. I felt that huge swelling sensation in my chest, like a balloon was stuck inside. My stomach was aching and my cheeks were so sore I felt them seizing up. My heart felt whole even for that second. My soul was open. It was the best laugh of my life. Sniffle sniffle. GASP. Laughter. GASP. Swipe of tears. Sniffle sniffle. Laughter. GASP. This is why. I thought. This is why you came. Bell rings."
89	20827	8	3	"I didn't believe my grandfather when he told me laughing could cure anything. I was nine years old, the days were dark and cold, and I felt like my life was a shattered piece of a stained glass window. Not only had my ageless pit bull just died, but also my little sister would tease me if I dared to shed a tear for the loss of my best pet. I sat on the couch, staring at the fire as it crackled and popped, when my grandfather sat down beside me and told me a story. It was about him when he was young and how he lost his best friend too, only his friend wasn't a pet.  ""His name was Jack,"" he began, ""and we were eleven years old. Oh, how we had so much fun. All we did was play! We thought we were gonna grow old together and be each other's best men and cause trouble until the end. Jack was my best friend until the end. I loved him, very much like how you love your dog. I never thought anything would happen to him. I thought that we'd both live forever. But then something did happen. Jack had gone fishing alone because I was at church and his dad had to work, and it was such a wonderful day to go down to the river and then he never came back from the river...""  As he sniffled at the old story, he said, ""You see, there's a cure for sadness. Do you want to know what it is?"" I nodded, half-thinking there was a magical medication or spell. ""It's laughter,"" he said. ""Laughter?!"" I was utterly shocked. ""Yes, it's simply,"" he said gently, knowing my easy temper, ""through the stages of grieving. Feel lost for a little bit, and then find your way back home. Love is in your heart and always will be. Find a wave of joy and go with the flow. Love life, because, as you have just seen, it can be so short.""  I nodded and didn't look at his sober face. He kissed the top of my head, looked into my eyes, and then left me alone to think. I needed to move on? How? Life wasn't that easy. I knew that. I opened up my notebook to do some homework to get my mind off my dog and Jack. That's when I discovered a small piece of paper the size of a deck of cards. I flipped it over, showing that it was a picture. A tear leaked out of the corner of my eye. It was of me and my dog. We were both in a mud pit, my blond hair looking like dirt. My pit bull was rubbing his greasy head on my shoulder, smearing more mud onto myself. I smiled, missing him even more, and feeling a lot better than a minute before. I loved him. I loved him so much. I still do to this day, and I had to get over the fact that my friend was gone. After I saw the picture, I laughed to myself, automatically feeling better about being such a horrid granddaughter and an inconsiderate best friend. Seeing the good times we had and smiling made me honestly feel better about myself. Maybe laughter is the cure for anything."
90	20828	8	3	@DATE1 was the start of a new age, i had just turned @NUM1, what a joy i thought that was. i was so existed for my birthday party, that i couldn't even bare it. my mom asked what i wanted to do for my birthday, i told her that i wanted to have a party and a sleep over. she agreed, so that night we planed and made invitations. that week flew by and before i new it, it was party time. i invited @NUM2 of my best friends and all of my family. we had such a good time that the time just flew by and it was time for everybody to go, three of my friends stayed the night there was, @PERSON1, barbie, and @CAPS1. my parents whet to a party of there own and we were staying at home all night by ourselves. it was around @TIME1 and we were all watching hills have eyes. we all herd a big crash, from up star, we all went up stars and saw that my self had been knock down and we all freaked out. we ran down stars screaming, i called my mom and thinking that someone was in the home they rushed home thinking it was a real emergency. my mom and dad went up stars to check it out and they found that it was my black cat mouse he had gotten in through my window and jumped on my self not sturdy enough it clapped.  My parents were relieved that it was just my mischievous cat causing the commotion. After calming down, we all laughed at the unexpected turn of events. It was a memorable birthday celebration filled with excitement and a bit of unexpected chaos.
91	20829	8	3	"The bus flew around tightly wound corners. Beyond the windows, farmland, rocky bluffs, and peaceful rivers streamed past. Exhausted from the fourteen-hour flight, I barely knew what time it was. The only things keeping me awake were the jolting of the bus and one other person I barely knew gossiping quietly. We were going to visit and live with a group high school students, affectionately referred to as ""our family."" I had met my partner, Lisa, only once. Everything I knew about her, her life, her family I learned from maybe ten, maybe twelve short messages. Communication was going to be problematic. My mother started teaching me German when I turned two, but I was nowhere near fluent; I was self-conscious and uncomfortable around native speakers. Lisa's English was decent, but her family spoke only German. Finally, the bus drove down the narrow cobbled streets of the quaint town. It pulled up to a plaza packed with people. The doors hissed open, and we filed out into the crowd, standing on tiptoes to search for our new families. All around me, people chattered in a mix of German and English. Lisa and her parents waited somewhere in the middle, and I slowly wove my way towards them. Brigitte, my host mother, grabbed me in a hug. ""Wie geht's? Wie war dein Flug? How are you? How was your flight?"" Trying to recall my German, I faltered, ""Der Flug war sehr lang, also ich bin ein bisschen mude. The flight was very long, so I'm a little tired."" Lisa took my arm and led me uphill towards the school, where our welcome dinner was being held. She explained, ""Everyone is very excited to meet you. Our town is so small; we never get tourists. We only get exchange students every other year."" My stomach was filled with that jittery-sick feeling of nervous anticipation. Normally, making friends was easy for me, but this time was different. I only minimally understood the language and culture of the people surrounding me. The long flight was evident in the sleepless bags under my eyes and my greasy, knotted hair. My jet-lagged brain wondered how I would get along with these people. Would I fit in, be able to slip into German life without many hitches or snags? We passed from the antiquated street to a dusky tunnel-like entryway. After a few turns, we emerged into an open courtyard. An array of food covered several tables, and the scent of grilling bratwurst wafted through the air. ""Are you hungry? You should have something to eat. We have so much food here,"" Lisa told me. I grabbed a plate and placed a roll, strawberries, and a sausage on it; I was too anxious to really be hungry. Lisa steered me towards a worn table with wooden benches, where her friends were already enjoying dinner and a few beers. She introduced me, and I perched stiffly on the edge of the seat. Her friends talked excitedly, questioning me about my life. As they loosened up, they began to joke, sometimes in German, sometimes in English. Some of them teased me about my accent. It wasn't a mean teasing; they weren't trying to be malicious, just light and funny. So I laughed. In that moment, I seemed to fit better with these people I only sometimes understood. I was less a foreigner and more a new friend. Relaxing, I allowed myself to laugh at my mistakes and really enjoy being someplace entirely new."
92	20830	8	3	"My friend @PERSON1 and I have @CAPS1 friends from as back as sixth grade. We have @CAPS1 through so much together. Even though we don't have everything in common and we don't hang out, out side of school together, we have a lot of laughter in our friendship. I say that if you are gonna have a friendship that is gonna last, you have to have laughter in it to make it a fun friendship. When @PERSON1 and I where in @NUM1 grade, we where the biggest people to the sixth graders because we where in the highest grade in our middle school. We would have so much stuff to do. @PERSON1 and I would always walk down the hallways linking our arms together and one moment after another she would just push me into someone. That someone would plow into a locker or wall and we would just laugh are butts off. It was fun to us but the other people kinda minded, but not that bad.  Another thing we would do to make our self laugh would be when @PERSON1 and I would have big tickle fights. It would always start with one of us trying to stick something in each others mouths. I would always try to stick a piece of paper in her mouth and to get me to stop, @PERSON1 would tickle me. @PERSON1 new that I'm like the ticklish person on the face of the planet. One time that happened was when we where in front of the office at our school. We tickled and tickled each other till we where laughing our butts off on the flour. Well a teacher came and told us to stop and then the bell rang and so we just went to our classes. Well @PERSON1 was the office aid and so when she went to the office, apparently one of the office people saw us tickling each other and thought we where going out. @PERSON1 told me that she just said ""@CAPS3"" and started to chuckle. I got a big laugh out of that. Laughter is a vary good thing to me because without it, @PERSON1 and I wouldn't be best friends as we are today in @NUM2 grade. You see, our friendship all started off of laughter. I met @PERSON1 in the sixth grade @CAPS4 class. Our teacher had assigned seats and @PERSON1 and I and two other people had to sit together. I had no idea who she was at the time. We ended up saying something and laughing about it and soon enough she introduced her self and so did I. Well the seating arrangement changed and she sat somewhere ells and so did I. Well the person she sat by moved away. I had a bad grade in @CAPS4 class and I told my teacher I wasn't getting along with the people at my table and asked if I could sit somewhere ells. He told me yes and so I went over and asked @PERSON1 if I could sit in the empty chair that the guy used to sit in before he moved away. She told me that she didn't care and so then on out we started hanging in school together and had so much fun.  So you see. Laughter is a grate deal in a lot of peoples life's. You need it. Without it I would of never made my best friend who I have today. I have her to thank for getting me through my tough years. Without the laughter in this world we would be lost probably. Just think about what you might not have or what you might be missing if you didn't have laughter in your life. Laughter truly brings people together and creates lasting bonds that can withstand the test of time."
93	20831	8	3	I remember my freshman year when I was on the soccer team playing against the bulldogs in @LOCATION1. We were losing in the first half when one of our goalies got his hand hurt. They took him out, and the other goalie got hit in the stomach by a strong kick from the opposing team, knocking his wind out. Despite the seriousness of the situation, my teammates and I couldn't help but laugh at his exaggerated reaction. After the first half, we managed to score @NUM1 goals, leading us to victory with a final score of @NUM1 to @NUM3. Even though we found humor in the goalie's overreaction, we made sure to check on him afterward, only to discover that he was playfully pretending to be in worse condition than he actually was. The lighthearted moment added a touch of comedy to an otherwise intense game, reminding us of the camaraderie and fun we shared on the field.
94	20832	8	3	"Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. Many times there are things that happen that make you laugh. For example; someone trips over your backpack and falls on their face. You can't help it but laugh! Then you start feeling bad and wish you hadn't laughed at them for tripping, but then you start remembering how they fell and you think about it and you end up laughing so hard that you can't stop until you get in trouble.  Laughter is a big part of your life that there isn't at least a time of day that you don't laugh. Everybody in my family is fun and we always make each other laugh. There isn't a time when we are quiet and one of us has to say ""awkward silence."" We are always laughing and having fun and we are never sad.  Let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call ""good times."" I will tell you how laughter is a big part in my family. And how embarrassment is involved. It is a beautiful sunny day in September 2021. Today was a big day for me, celebrating my 18th birthday. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's house and sat down in a chair to have my hair done. I was wearing my favorite pajamas with a black shirt that said ""Legal AF."" I got my hair done, did my make-up, put on my dress, went outside to take pictures, and got into the limousine so I could go to church.  After I went to church I took pictures with my family and then went to a park to take pictures at the gazebo. After we got back from the park, I went to the venue, a hotel ballroom, and got ready for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my court of honor; six guys and six girls and my partner. After the waltz I danced the second waltz with my dad. When I was done dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner and towards the end came the big part... I was supposed to be picked up by my girls and the guys were supposed to spell my name with two guys wearing black forming each end, but one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong!  The guys were supposed to spell ""Isabella"", but they ended up spelling ""Isabell""! One of the other guys saw the mistake right away, so he moved to the left and since my uncle didn't move to the left either, they ended up spelling ""Isabel""! I'm not going to lie...I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong spot because the letters were facing my way, but I could have stopped that from happening but I didn't because I couldn't! But at the end it was funny. Everybody there started laughing and I got so embarrassed! But when I was walking off the dance floor I started laughing! Now that we think about it, that is the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family. I guess laughter really is there when something embarrassing happens. Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. But laughter is always there when we have an embarrassing moment. Laughter is always with us. It doesn't matter if we mean to or not, but we end up doing something dumb that makes us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family. Laughter is with me because my family is fun, crazy, and cool. No matter how sad we are, it doesn't matter if we are sad because one of my family members were in a car accident or someone died, we remember the times when we were happy and when we were having fun with that person. We end up remembering the fun we had together, that we start laughing really hard! Laughter is there when we are happy, but it is also there when it is the best day of your life. Laughter is a moment of happiness."
95	20833	8	3	"Laughter is a great thing, except for some instances. We all have been there. Having a good time with friends, laughing and making new memories. Then you take a drink of something and start laughing again. Next thing you know you're choking and can't breathe. You're coughing as much as you can, trying to stop. It's not only a little embarrassing, but it can get a little awkward too. You can't stop it, you just have to let nature take its course. Everyone stares, asking if you're alright. The moment feels like forever, and that was exactly how I felt. I have two best friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. It was during the @DATE1 and we decided to have ourselves a little movie night at @ORGANIZATION3's house. We were fully prepared with candy, soda pops, and the best of all, pizza. It all added up for a great night. We decided to watch the movie @ORGANIZATION1. It's all of our favorites, I don't think we could ever grow tired of it. @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and I found comfortable seating arrangements and started to watch the movie. We were eating, laughing hard-core and making comments along with it. We were having a great time. Then I decided to take a drink of my @ORGANIZATION2. I was about to swallow it, but just my luck, one of the funniest parts in the movie was on. I started to laugh and knew I had an issue. I put my cup on the table, quickly got off the couch, and took two steps when most of the @LOCATION1 in my mouth came flying out onto the floor. I couldn't breathe and was now coughing, so I kept running to my destination, the kitchen sink. I was about two feet away from the sink, I was so close! Then I felt something come up my mouth that I couldn't control. I wasn't going to open my mouth, it'd be all over the floor! I was so grossed out I basically threw myself at the sink. My mouth opened and there went the puke, into the sink. I continued to cough, wondering when it would it would all end. ""@CAPS2 you okay?!"" @CAPS1 ran into the kitchen and started hitting my upper back, trying to help me out. @CAPS5 hit me three times, then I could finally breathe again. ""@CAPS4 you, I was having a hard time."" @CAPS5 started laughing, while I was still disgusted with the nasty taste left in my mouth. I put my head under the faucet trying to clear it out a little. I grabbed a towel, and we made our way to the living room. We entered the room to find @PERSON1 sitting on the couch, laughing hysterically. @CAPS1 sat by her, and started to giggle a little along with her. I got on my knees and started wiping up the @ORGANIZATION2 spill on the floor. There wasn't too much, but still a good amount. I started to chuckle a little to myself while cleaning it up. I thought to myself, ""@CAPS6 must I always be the one to choke?"" ""@CAPS6 didn't you just go to the bathroom sink? I mean it's right there!"" @PERSON1 was pointing to the door and still laughing. ""I didn't think of that! I just ran for the kitchen!"" I've been to her house plenty of times before, but the bathroom slipped my mind. I laughed at how much of a blond moment I had just had. ""@CAPS8 my gosh,"" @CAPS5 laughed a little then continued, ""@CAPS9 me of @CAPS10! When I saved you!"" ""@CAPS11 up and watch the movie!"" I told her jokingly. @CAPS5 finished laughing and we were enjoying the movie in peace again. They both still tease me about that, but I don't mind. It just goes to show you the things laughter can unexpectedly bring. Laughter truly is the best medicine, even if it does lead to a little bit of embarrassment and awkwardness at times."
96	20835	8	3	During the summer of my sixth, going on seventh grade year, my friend and I were nearly inseparable. She was the first friend that I had made upon moving from my old school in the beginning of my sixth grade year, but in a short amount of time we became best friends. On that day, we were at my house by ourselves and we wanted to do something fun and creative. So we decided to make a fort out of sheets and furniture. We took chairs, the ends of some couches, and tables, and tied sheets and blankets from them, falling over ourselves and not paying attention to anything else. By the end of our adventure, the living room was a mess, but we didn't care, we had a blast building it.  I remember sitting in the fort and talking to her about anything that came up. We made jokes and laughed almost constantly, to the point of tears. It was one of those days with laughs that fill you up with so much energy and joy that you can't even contain yourself. I had never laughed so hard in my life and I never wanted it to stop. By the end, we were both emotionally drained. She ended up staying the night because we never wanted the day to end.  Every day ends, every morning is a new beginning, and every night leads to something new. But when you close your eyes after a day filled with laughter, you feel full of life. Live and laugh like today is the last day, and never forget the memories you created in the times before.
97	20836	8	3	The @CAPS1 Of Laughter In @CAPS2 @CAPS3 me laughter is important, we all laugh in our lives. It's a symbol of happiness, and it shows people around us that we care enough @CAPS3 listen and pay attention. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime. For my friends and I, laughter comes naturally and we all enjoy every moment of it. My friend @PERSON1 and I have known each other since the second grade and have been friends ever since. what has kept our @CAPS2 strong and still alive today, is the memories we have created through laughter. One memory I always seem @CAPS3 remember though, is the first time we had gone inner-tubing together. There have been many memories made between @PERSON1 and I that we remember because of the laughter we shared. Yet the memory that always remains dominate, is when we had gone inner-tubing for the first time. It was our seventh grade @DATE1 and we had planned on spending as much time as possible together. Now this did not really work out because I had @CAPS3 babysit a lot, but she was a good friend and understood. So when we did hang out it was always so much fun. Now yes, we have had our up's and down's, and that comes with any @CAPS2. We got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together. That @DATE1 we would hang out at each others house's and go places together. Then one day @ORGANIZATION1's parent's had decided that they wanted @CAPS3 take a trip @CAPS3 the lake and go boating. @PERSON1's family invited me @CAPS3 come along, and so I asked and I was able @CAPS3 go with their family @CAPS3 the lake. I had been boating before, and @CAPS3 the lake that we were going too. What I was not expecting, was for @PERSON1 and I @CAPS3 go inner-tubing. It was exciting, and nerve-racking all at the same time; I had never laughed so much with @LOCATION1 in my life.Going inner-tubing turned out @CAPS3 be one of the best memories we had ever made together. During the entire @DATE1 whenever possible,we had gone inner-tubing, for me, the adrenaline was almost addicting. Laughing was almost always constant when boating because we just had the best time. It was our new story @CAPS3 tell everyone and we were both proud of it. When inner-tubing we had learned @CAPS3 work together and it helped our @CAPS2 a lot in a way. Also when inner-tubing we got @CAPS3 the point where we went as fast as possible and went as crazy as possible and we loved it.  That @DATE1 we made some of my most treasured memories, and we really owe it all @CAPS3 laughter. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime, and I am very grateful for that. If not for laughter I do not know where my @CAPS2 with @PERSON1 would stand. And because of that, I believe that laughter is important in any relationship or @CAPS2. It's a symbol of happiness and that is what makes life great. Laughter truly is the key to building strong and lasting bonds with the people we care about, and I cherish every moment of joy and laughter shared with my dear friend @PERSON1.
98	20838	8	3	Iv always loved laughter in my life, I don't know how I could live without it. This is how it all started out. One day, I was not having a good day. Nothing could have made me laugh. Friends would tell me jokes, they would make funny faces, but nothing seemed to work. There was just that one thing they hadn't tried that finally made me laugh, and it was all thanks to my sister.   On a hot summer day, my sister and I decided to have a water balloon fight. As we threw water balloons at each other, one hit my face and I retaliated by hitting her face. We couldn't stop laughing, and the joy and happiness we felt in that moment was unforgettable.   Years later, when I was having another bad day, my sister reminded me of that special day and the laughter we shared. She took me outside, prepared with water balloons, and we had another epic water balloon fight. From that day on, I realized the power of laughter to turn a bad day into one of the best days of my life.   That's why laughter is so important to me. It has the ability to uplift my spirits, bring joy to my heart, and turn any situation around. I am grateful for the laughter that fills my life and the memories of moments like these that I will always hold dear.
99	20839	8	3	One day me and my friend Taylor got the idea on a snow day to get his quad and tie a rope to the back. He was drifting around a post, not seeing the hill ahead, and I was on the back on a sled. I flew over the quad and got about 10 feet high, then crashed. It hurt, but it was so funny we couldn't stop laughing for ten minutes.   After our wild ride, we decided to head back to Taylor's creek, which was frozen about 12 inches thick. I was driving the quad along the bank, with Taylor on the ice behind me. Suddenly, the ice started to crack, so I sped up to prevent him from falling in. However, after about two minutes, the ice gave way, and Taylor went under. I managed to pull him out and raced back to his house.   Once we were safe, Taylor changed into dry clothes and sat there, laughing for hours about our crazy escapades. It was a day full of thrills and laughter that we would never forget.
100	20840	8	3	"In any situation laughter is used. Many times have I been in an awkward position that I have used laughter to free myself from discomfort. Laughter will never go away and you will always have it with you to use when it is needed in a revolting moment. For example, a month ago I was walking to the park with my brother and some friends of mine. When we arrived there were already people at the skateboarding spot we wanted to skate at. We decided no big deal we will just go on with our business and skate. ""Hey punks! we were here first!"" one of them said. Me and my brother started yelling back. Then one of them got in my face and started talking a bunch of trash so I said something to him that was so funny that all his friends laughed too. He was pretty pissed off but it didn't matter because we ended up skating there anyway and nothing went down. This just comes to show that laughter can bring us all together at any given moment. No matter the skin color or where you're from you can always be funny. Some people may be funnier than others but everyone has a sense of humor within them. You can always find the time to make a joke or come up with a clever hilarious line for someone to laugh their brains out at. Laughter is the one thing you can count on in an awkward position or when you go to a new school or have never been somewhere before. Laughter can always keep you out of fights no matter what. All around the world people are laughing at this very moment and bonding by it. It is the sign of happiness and gratefulness. Laughter has a purpose and will never disappear. Laughter is bonding. Bonding is loving. Laughter is together."
101	20841	8	3	"As we understand the benefits of laughter, we realize that we can't live without it. It's one of those things that are always going to be with us through tough times and the joy of life. So when people say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" well, they're right! You can think anything you want to, but I want you to know that I have the best laughter in the world when it comes to the boy I have fallen for.  It all started on a softball tournament in Bend. Our team drove there for the weekend to play our tournament and we stayed in the @LOCATION2 Inn hotel, which was very nice by the way, probably too nice for our team, because we ended up destroying the place like a bunch of football players in a locker room, hence the hard practices. After our practice, we decided to swim in the pool, even though we had a big game the next day.  The hotel had two big pools, one outside and one inside with a sauna. We all went to the inside pool because it was way too cold outside. Then everything from there was a little different. My friend @PERSON3 and I went into the sauna after swimming to relax and just talk a bit. After a while, two boys about our age entered the sauna while we were still in there. They acted as if they were nervous and shy, so they sat down and started talking to us, which was kind of awkward, no doubt.  When it comes to boys, I'm not shy to just speak my mind and ask them why they were just sitting there pretending to mind their own business. We talked and laughed for a bit and got to know each other. One of them was extremely adorable, and I hit it off with him very well. It got later into the @TIME1, and it was time for all of us to head back to our rooms and say goodbye forever.  Me and @PERSON3 shared a room with her parents. I had no idea that @PERSON3 gave my number to @PERSON1, the guy I kind of liked in the sauna. About ten minutes later, I got a text saying ""meet me outside to walk around."" So I assumed that it was him, and I got all excited! We sneaked out of the room for the @TIME1. All we did was walk around the hotel and talk. He was barefooted and as cute as can be. I had never laughed so hard in my life! He made me smile and feel like I could conquer everything that came my way.  About forty-five minutes later, still gazing into each other's eyes, feeling like it had only been a second, his friend @PERSON2 saw someone walking out of the hotel room and realized that it was his mom. They bolted off, saying their goodbyes, and at the last second, he kissed me on the cheek for his farewell. Never in my life had I experienced something so exciting and fun, and most of all, I understood the importance of laughter. Knowing that I would never see him again is what kills me. He lives in @CAPS1, and I live in @LOCATION1. How could anything possibly happen between us?  Maybe someday I will meet him again. Maybe someday I will be able to talk to him again like we did that @TIME1, and just maybe, will I fall in love with him. All those maybes have come true because I followed what was right and I waited. Now, since all that happened, I can ponder and relate to laughter and how it affected me in life. That is what brought us together, and I'm happy that all of that could happen so quickly in my young life. Laughing with him was truly a special moment that I will always cherish."
102	20842	8	3	"I kept my head low as I walked through the halls of the brand new school I'd been signed up to attend. Students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their gazes, I couldn't. This is what real school is like, I thought to myself. I'd always been home schooled, since before I could remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of middle school @CAPS12 less. My dark, curly brown hair fell into my face as I entered my first class, acting. The room was warm and dimly lit as students began to recite their lines; the sets were colorful and I instantly recognized them as the garden from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I suddenly let out a small yelp as my foot caught in the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair.  Deep red color flooded to my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I let out a troubled sigh and brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I glanced up through my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized I was @CAPS12 longer the center of attention.  ""@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, the new student."" @PERSON1 said warmly.  I smiled and nodded my head slowly, ""@CAPS3, that would be me.""  @CAPS4 smiled at me just as I'd smiled at @CAPS13, but @CAPS13 smile seemed sad, ""I'm sorry dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help paint the sets next class.""  I nodded and reached into my backpack, pulling out a book and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and I wished with all my heart that I could truly go there. I was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me.  @CAPS4 didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @CAPS13 hair was a few shades darker than mine, more black than brown but @CAPS4 wore @CAPS14 @CAPS8. @CAPS13 bright blue eyes twinkled with imagination, as did @CAPS13 face. Something about @CAPS13 seemed kind. Maybe @CAPS14 was the way @CAPS13 dimples came out even though @CAPS4 wasn't smiling, or @CAPS14 could have been the way @CAPS4 sat, tall with confidence.  ""@CAPS5, hello?"" I murmured, closing my book, careful to mark the page. ""I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked all alone, and I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS6, but everyone calls me @CAPS7."" @CAPS4 said with another smile, making @CAPS13 dimples come out even more. I chuckled softly and returned @CAPS13 smile, ""@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you.""  ""@CAPS10, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?"" @CAPS4 asked hesitantly. My smile fell slightly, ""@CAPS12, I've always been home schooled, I've never actually been to a public school before.""  @CAPS13 smile fell with my own, and i could tell that @CAPS4 knew what I was talking about.  ""@CAPS14's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad that I'm finally getting to go to a public school."" I murmured, the lie coming easily.  @CAPS4 laughed and layed a soft hand on my shoulder, ""@CAPS12 need to lie,""  I knew that half of @CAPS13 words were serious, and the others playful but something deep inside of me shifted. I barely knew this girl but I felt that I could trust @CAPS13, and that we could be friends.  We laughed and joked the rest of the class, and I was almost always caught up in the way that @CAPS4 constantly got flustered while trying to explain things to me. @CAPS4'd try and use @CAPS13 hands, make movements, just to explain, which always took us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous we both were acting and I was startled when the bell for lunch rang, had time really passed that fast? @CAPS7 smiled at me, ""@CAPS16 for lunch @CAPS2?"" A"
103	20844	8	3	I'm going to tell you about moments and adventures with a boy named @CAPS1.C. He has brown hair that reaches his neck, which he loves to swoosh around. @CAPS1.C's brown eyes sparkle, and his smile can fool anyone. At @NUM17 years old, he is full of energy and mischief, always keeping those around him on their toes.  From a young age, @CAPS1.C showed a mischievous side, like when he would play with eggs from the refrigerator, creating a mess that he would run away from. He also loved watching the fish in an aquarium, trying to catch them with his hands and running away when someone approached.  As @CAPS1.C grew older, his antics continued, like picking at people just for fun or grabbing valuable items and taunting others with them. However, as he reached @NUM5 years old, he discovered YouTube on a borrowed device and became fascinated with shows like @CAPS12 and @CAPS13.  Now, at @NUM1 years old, @CAPS1.C is starting school and still full of energy and enthusiasm. Despite his mischievous behavior, one admirable trait is his unwavering defense of his brothers against bullies. @CAPS1.C's playful nature and protective instincts make him a lovable and entertaining character to be around.
104	20846	8	3	"Laughter is a symbol of joy and happiness. It is to become amused or derisive. Many people today make jokes or funny remarks just to hear somebody laugh. It is never something we should take for granted. Through many relationships no matter what kind, I believe laughter takes up at least 1% of your relationship. It's to show the best out of someone and to let them know you are listening. There are plenty of other reasons in this world needed for laughter. ""I'm sure you can even think of one"". In my views of this world and our society today, I believe laughter is what makes up our ""human"" spirit. It's to show ourselves and other people the spark we have inside us. Have you ever sat and pondered why we make each other laugh? I have asked myself this same question over and over. For me making people laugh is letting them know I care and to also think I'm funny as well. We even do it just the fact of wanting people to like us better and to be known as funny, hilarious, or just a good person to talk to. Sometimes we can go to the extremes of being too funny, and feeling guilty for picking on someone in a laughable way. I remember in the eighth grade, I was thirteen years old. I was really shy and didn't have many friends. One day in class, some of the popular kids actually came over and started talking to me. I was excited and nervous that other kids wanted to talk to me. Of course they were laughing and making jokes, not caring what anyone else was saying. Then this one girl started talking about other people like she knew everything. When she started talking about my best friend it made me angry but happy at the same time because some of the things she was saying were true. That's where I messed up, I started talking about all the other dumb things she did, just to make everybody else laugh. As I was sitting there all I felt was guilt and disappointment in myself. I couldn't believe I was sitting there talking about my best friend, just to try and make myself popular. Later that day she came up to me really upset and couldn't understand why I would do that to her. I told her I was sorry and that I only did it to make myself popular and seem funny to other kids. We didn't talk for almost two weeks. I tried to do everything in my own possible way to get my best friend back. It did take me a while, but she finally came around and forgave me. It was a good life lesson for me, knowing laughter may not always be a good thing. Now me and my friend are juniors in high school and when we think back on that day. We both together can share a laugh. In conclusion, you can see how laughter can bring somebody up and tear them down. I have experienced these things as well in my lifetime. Laughter has made me stronger and to be a better person, even if it means turning down popular kids you don't hurt those closest to you. Go out and make somebody laugh today."
105	20847	8	3	Laughter is a vital part of life, bringing joy and connection to people. Recently, during a writing test in the computer lab, technical difficulties caused a lot of chaos and frustration among the students. Despite the initial annoyance, the situation turned into a source of laughter and amusement as computers froze and error messages popped up. The shared experience of struggling with technology brought the class together in a lighthearted way. While the test ultimately had to be postponed due to the issues, the unexpected turn of events made the class unexpectedly enjoyable. Laughter truly has the power to transform even the most mundane situations into memorable moments.
106	20848	8	3	Laughter is essential for a fulfilling life. It brings joy, lightens the mood, and allows us to connect with others in a positive way. During a challenging period in the author's life, the absence of laughter made everything seem dull and heavy. However, as they started to embrace humor and not take themselves too seriously, life began to brighten up. Spending time with loved ones, especially their father, helped them rediscover the joy of laughter. Coming to terms with their true self and being open about their identity brought a sense of freedom and happiness. Making new connections, like the special bond with a girl named Person2, further added to their happiness. Laughter, whether shared with others or enjoyed in solitude, has the power to uplift the spirit and make life more enjoyable. Embracing humor and finding reasons to smile can truly make a difference in one's outlook on life.
107	20849	8	3	"In a relationship, you should be able to trust in each other, confide in each other, talk with each other, cry with each other, and most importantly, laugh with each other. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of relationships, and I can definitely agree with that statement. The relationship in my life that I totally get the most laughter out of is the relationship between me and my best friend and boyfriend, @PERSON2. He can always make me laugh, even on my worst days he can find a smile and a little giggle. I constantly thank @CAPS1 for putting him in my life. The first thing that I really noticed about @PERSON2 when I started to get to know him better is that he can always make me laugh. Whether he is making totally weird faces at me or tickling me until I can barely breathe, he always knows how to get me laughing. When I am bawling my eyes out to him, even then he can get me to giggle. Just @TIME1 I had a terrible day at school and within a few minutes of me crying to him, he had cheered me up and got me to laugh. In church or with friends we will just look at each other and make a face and start laughing, there's something about those blue eyes and that dorky smile that will always make me laugh. Our ability to laugh with each other has been a great aspect of our relationship since the beginning. When we play @CAPS2, or he plays and I fail at attempting to play, we always laugh at how bad I am at it, or when I finally do get an awesome kill. ""That just works out, don't it!"" is one of our inside jokes, obviously it's not all that funny but we have fun competing at who can say it the most in one day. The rule is you have to have a good reason for saying it and if we say it at the same time we always playfully argue over who won or gets ""the point"" (as if we actually keep score) but that usually gets us laughing at some stupid excuse or reasoning that one of us tries to use. When there is a camera around @PERSON2 likes to make funny faces, which will always get me laughing. Then we usually end up taking somewhere around twenty silly pictures and just going through them and laughing and laughing at all of the weird faces we decide to make. When one of us starts laughing it usually gets the other one laughing too, they do say laughter is contagious. To be truly comfortable with and around each other you have to be able to laugh at yourself. One time, @PERSON2 his little sisters, @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 and I were all seeing how high we could kick and long story short I kneed myself in the forehead, @PERSON2 was the only one who noticed or heard the crack of my bones hitting each other with force, and he just got silent until I started cracking up. Then he made sure I was okay. We were laughing so hard we cried and I had a big red circle on my forehead, not to mention my cheeks were bright red from embarrassment too, but I just laughed it off. Another time we were goofing around on the hardwood floor at his house and I pushed him to the ground, his whole family was cracking up and his face was bright red, but he just laughed it off. Whether we say or do something stupid in front of each other we both have the ability to laugh it off. Even when things get rough or you disagree on something it is always good to later be able to look back on it and laugh about it with each other. Just because @PERSON2 and I are best friends doesn't mean we agree on everything, we actually disagree about a lot of things, most are small but once in a while we will disagree on something a little bigger. At times one of us will do or say something that upsets the other one, we are always able to work it out and later look back on it and laugh even when it is a touchy subject. Both of us have made mistakes in our past too but again we just look back and laugh. Obviously I have reason to agree with the statement ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" because I have that connection in the best way possible. I am so thankful to have @PERSON2 in my life, his ability to laugh and make me laugh is what made me fall for him in the first place. So between ""@CAPS3"" over a text message, cracking up at weird things we do or just watching a movie, we are always laughing at each other or with each other. As we both would put it ""we're freaking soul mates!"""
108	20850	8	3	"Every day I spend with my girlfriend is a day full of fun and laughter. I can be in the worst of moods and she can brighten my whole day with just a couple of words. Together we can change any situation into a happy one. What I'm trying to say is that laughter is a very powerful thing; by making someone laugh, you can change their mood, their day, or in some cases maybe change their whole life. People say that laughter is very contagious. I believe that is true. Take comedians, for example, they can take any situation and make a whole room burst with laughter. My favorite one is when this one comedian said, ""If we're shivering in the cold, we will bring him silver and gold,"" like the song. He then said, ""Why don't they bring him some blankets, I mean come on, the poor kid is going to die of hypothermia but at least he will be rich when he does."" I wrote this paper to show how powerful laughter is in the world. I believe that everyone should laugh at least once a day to make the world a brighter place. I conclude with this: ""A smile can light up a room but laughter can change the world into a happier place."" Nobody should go through life without laughter. ""A life without laughter is a life not spent."""
109	20851	8	3	A true story for me in laughter. My favorite memory in laughter happened two years ago when I met my friend at a local organization. I met her at the entrance of the building, and we accidentally bumped into each other. At first, we were both upset and exchanged some words, but soon we realized how silly the situation was and started laughing. We ended up getting food together and sitting down to chat. It turned out that we had actually met before at a band competition, where we had a similar encounter. We laughed about the coincidence and how we had both reacted the same way back then. Since that day, we have become great friends, bonded by our shared laughter and memories. Laughter truly is a crucial element in friendship, creating strong connections and unforgettable moments. I am grateful for the laughter that brought us together and the joy it continues to bring to our friendship.
110	20852	8	3	Laughter is a vital aspect of life, bringing joy and connection to those who share in it. However, it is important to remember that laughter can have consequences, especially when it comes at the expense of others. A seemingly harmless moment of laughter at someone else's expense can leave a lasting impact, causing hurt and discomfort. It is crucial to be mindful of the impact our laughter may have on others, as we never know how our words and actions may affect them. In the end, laughter should always be a source of positivity and togetherness, rather than a tool for belittlement or harm.
111	20853	8	3	My boyfriend and I spend a lot of time hanging out together, but two days ago we had just gotten into an argument. His mom had just finished making food, and he wanted me to try it. I asked him if he would eat some of it with me, and he agreed. However, he ended up just sitting next to me talking to someone else. I didn't mind and continued eating, even making a face out of the food on my plate. He teased me about it, but we laughed it off. Later, we went out to eat and ended up playing around like kids in a play area. When he farted loudly, causing all the little kids to stare, we couldn't help but laugh hysterically. We shared the funny incident with our friends, and it brought us all closer together. In the end, we realized that even in silly moments, we can find joy and laughter in each other's company.
112	20856	8	3	@CAPS4 @CAPS1 Laughter is indeed a powerful tool that can bring people together and uplift spirits in challenging times. My personal experience in the @ORGANIZATION2 has shown me the true value of laughter in fostering strong bonds and achieving success. When I transitioned from @CAPS2 middle @ORGANIZATION3 to @ORGANIZATION3, I felt lost without my close group of friends with whom I shared laughter. However, joining the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 program, specifically the @ORGANIZATION1, and later the @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION4, provided me with a new family that embraced laughter and camaraderie. The laughter we shared before competitions not only eased my nerves but also strengthened our unity as a team. This sense of belonging and joy propelled us to success, as evidenced by our multiple victories in competitions. Laughter has inspired me to devote myself to this new family and has truly taken me to new heights. I encourage you to reflect on the role of laughter in your life and the communities you are part of.
113	20857	8	3	"Seeing one of @CAPS15 best friends trip and hit his face on a screen door was enough to make myself laugh. It was the day after @CAPS15 graduated from 8th grade. I was having @CAPS15 friends @PERSON2, @PERSON3, and @CAPS15 neighbor @PERSON1 stay the night at @CAPS15 house. Whenever we got bored, we usually went around @CAPS15 neighborhood playing a harmless prank we called ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3."" The game involved sneaking up to someone's front door, ringing the doorbell, and then running away.   That day, the weather was perfect with a gorgeous sun, warm temperature, and a gentle breeze. As night fell, we found ourselves in @CAPS15 room playing games. Suddenly, @PERSON2 expressed boredom, which led to a brainstorming session for entertainment. Eventually, I suggested playing ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,"" and everyone agreed to give it a try.  We set out, ditching a few houses before I came up with a plan for each of us to target a different house. The prank was going smoothly until @PERSON1, in his eagerness, tripped over a step and hit his face on a screen door. Despite the mishap, we all had a good laugh and returned to @CAPS15 house in high spirits.  Even though it happened years ago, that night remains a memorable moment. So, the next time you decide to play a prank like ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,"" make sure to check if the porch lights are on first."

Despite some car troubles and embarrassing moments, we made it to the game, which ended in a close loss. Afterward, we headed to @ORGANIZATION2 for a meal, encountering more challenges like getting lost and a traffic stop. Despite getting a ticket for expired insurance, my laughter at the absurdity of the day couldn't be contained. It was a day full of unexpected events and mishaps, making it one of the most eventful days ever.
115	20860	8	3	Laughter is a key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion. It can break the ice in an akward situation or help you become closer to someone. Some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and that laughter is the best medicine. I believe that both of those statements are true. Personally laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations throught my @NUM1 years of life.  One time in particular that I remember laughter really bringing me closer together with other people is when I was camping with a few of my friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @DATE1 and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We had all been talking about pretty serious stuff, family and friend problems and just sharing our hardships in general with eachother. I didn't really have much to complain about, I had a pretty average family that I loved along with good friends. However that evening I was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friends home life. She started to talk about how her parents don't care and how they are both alcoholics, I could tell by her tone of voice how painful admitting this information was for her. The mood had suddenly changed from discussing light issues to a serious, emotional conversation. She continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends because we always have a good time.   After she told me all of this we laid in silence for a while. Neither of us were asleep but I had no idea what to say. I mean how could anything I say make that situation better or help her to feel better. While we had been having this conversation our other friend had run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom. We heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark. All of a sudden she knew where we were, she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag fell on us and spilled a bunch of fizzy grape soda all over our faces. Normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical. While in the midst of laughing like crazy people I looked at my friend who had just recently told me her painful story, now she was crying from laughing so hard and I knew that a little laughter had brought us closer.  That is a memory that I will never forget, it was an experience where I feel laughter has played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and close. Similar experiences have occured throughout my whole life. Laughter is a common ground, where all people can relate to one another. Maybe it brings people closer together because when you are legitimatley laughing you are so caught up in it that you forget about everything else. All of your problems disappear. Laughter truly has the power to bring people together and create stronger connections.
116	20861	8	3	Laughter has always been a key component in @CAPS2 relationships, forming bonds that last a lifetime. @CAPS2 best friend was met through a mutual friend, @PERSON1, who suggested they connect. The initial interaction was filled with humor and sarcasm, setting the tone for a friendship built on laughter. @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 best friend, has a natural talent for making others laugh, even in the toughest of times. When @ORGANIZATION2's mother passed away, laughter became a source of comfort and healing for both friends. Similarly, when faced with personal challenges like a @CAPS4.B.I., @ORGANIZATION2 returned the favor by bringing joy and normalcy back into @CAPS2 life through laughter. The power of laughter not only strengthens the bond between friends but also serves as a source of support and resilience during difficult times. Ultimately, the ability to laugh together has enriched @CAPS2 friendship with @ORGANIZATION2, highlighting the profound impact of shared laughter on relationships.
117	20862	8	3	"""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2 society today loves laughter. From comical shows to hilarious friends, people have fun convulsing with glee. Not to mention that when you're doubled over with laughter you are getting an amazing workout. Everyone that texts @MONTH1 use ""@CAPS3"" or ""haha"" to show they think something is funny; but it is nothing compared to actually being with friends and having, ""a smile that burst.""  I couldn't wait. I was on the coast at a camp with my friends, and we were about to head-up to walk up to the three crosses. Some of the other girls were asleep and we had to leave quietly. One of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter. Because when she tripped, she barely caught herself, as she was about to fall on sleeping @CAPS4. Jasmine scurried out the door with the rest of us. After the door was closed, we all doubled over laughing. Jasmine's face, when she tripped was priceless.  We headed into the crisp air without looking back. From a gravel path to the cement road going up the hill, we happily skipped along. As the hill got steeper, we started walking. Jasmine, after being tired from skipping, almost fell again. Everyone started laughing again. The walk up the hill was taking longer than expected. Finally, we could see the three crosses at the top.  When we arrived at the crosses, we waited for the miraculous sunrise. We kept staring at the ocean; waiting with anticipation. Eventually, @CAPS5 pointed out that the sun rises on the east and would we coming over the mountains. Again, all the girls laughed because we were so tired we forgot which side the sun rose on. At last, the astonishing sunrise happened. It was full of pink, purples, yellows and oranges. After watching the sunrise we realized we still had the treacherous walk back down the hill. I peered over the edge and saw a little path. With a bunch of convincing, I got all the girls to walk down the steep hill because it looked shorter than the cement road we came up.  The first part of the path was simple. As we started heading farther down the hill it got skinnier with more brush. A couple of the girls thought we should head back up, but I convinced them otherwise. So on we went. ""@CAPS6 no!"" @CAPS7 yelled. We turned to see she had managed to let her shoe fall of into a blackberry bush. She had just gotten her shoes the day before and now they are muddy and lost. Everyone was trying to reach it, but it was just a little too far away. Suddenly, @PERSON1 tried to grab the shoe; immediately she fell into the blackberry bush! @PERSON2 forgot about her shoe for a little and started doubled over with laughter again. While flailing and screaming we yelled for her to stop because if I didn't mention this earlier; this is a very steep hill. While she was in the bush, she grabbed @PERSON2's shoe. The hard part was getting @PERSON1 out.  The first time we tried to pull her up; we got her up a couple of inches then she fell back down, into the bush. Finally, after what felt like a million tries, we pulled her big butt out of the bush. Everyone was laughing so hard during the extravaganza. @PERSON1 was super embarrassed. After all of that, we headed down the hill. We still had giggles while trotting down the trail. As we went, we saw animal tracks. We then realized the trail was most likely made by animal. A couple girls joked around about being terrified of the animal tracks. Eventually, we got back to the cabin, still laughing about what had taken place. The rest of the day everyone was happy and giggly for waking up with an amazing morning.  Laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day. Laughter helped us work through the mud, the shoe losing, and the cold. With out it, we could have been very grumpy. Also, having amazing friends to laugh with was phenomenal. Laughing helps people be happy; being happy is better than being sad; therefore, laughter is important. When writing this paper to the @ORGANIZATION1's in @LOCATION1, I told my friends about the adventure we went on and the predicament we got ourselves into. They laughed hysterically, since they knew the girls. Laugh often to be happy.  Laughter is indeed a powerful tool that can turn any situation into a joyful experience. It helps us navigate through challenges and brings us closer together with friends. So, let's embrace laughter in our lives and continue to spread happiness wherever we go"
118	20863	8	3	"""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 best friend @PERSON1. Wow! All those great times last @DATE1 and all the ones to come. Some people think we're weird, but if you knew us, you would understand. Sometimes people say, ""I'm going to die laughing."" @CAPS2 I know I am because of @PERSON1; she knows how to always make me laugh. If I had to count how many times we've laughed or done together, I couldn't; there aren't enough time or numbers to tell you. First of all, this friendship started @DATE1, and now we are in sophomore year of high school. We've been friends for one year and eleven months and six days. We are the best of best friends.   So last year when we were learning the cheers for football season, almost every time we got done with a cheer, @PERSON1 and I would say, ""@CAPS3-in @CAPS4."" That was our saying, and we always did it during and after the football or basketball games. We called it our @CAPS3-in @CAPS4 style or for short, our slogan. We would be having a blast and laughing for hours. ""@CAPS5 turn, @CAPS6 turn,"" In @DATE2 we were on our way to state for cheer. On the car ride up to @LOCATION1, every time we took a corner, we would say what corner it was and do a motion with it. Oh my goodness, we laughed and had a blast. After the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 turns, there was another motion we called the monkey, and we would act like monkeys. It was so much fun; we laughed until we cried and almost had an accident. That was one of many car rides that were amazing.  On the other hand, @PERSON1 and I cheer together, have sleepovers, I should say that we do everything together. She is my cheer sister and will always be, also she is my best friend. I would do anything for her. I love @PERSON1. In addition, to that, we do everything together. When @PERSON1 is over at my house, I always have to make sure I make sandwiches and orange juice because one time we stayed up past midnight and were hungry, so I made that and @PERSON1 loved it. Now I have to make sure I have some for her when she comes over. Now we always talk about the origins of the sandwich habit; we laugh about it all the time.  Finally, @PERSON1 and I are going to be together forever because I don't know what I would do without my sister. I would not be the person I am today without her; she is everything to me. We laugh even when we want to cry; she is everything to me. You could say we have the perfect friendship of all time. My best friend is my sister. I love you @PERSON1, thanks for always having my back."
119	20865	8	3	It was some day in December, I was on my way to school. My friend Alex was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every ten minutes. It was pretty annoying. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school. We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull. We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle i had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was P.E. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats.  I got done with P.E. and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend Alex was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at the pond and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy.
120	20866	8	3	"It was one of those days where I just sat around all day doing nothing, but play video games, text, and laugh at myself. It was one of those days where no one bothered me; no one even really talked to me; no one told me to do chores. By dinner time someone decided to call me up stairs to eat, but let me tell you, it wasn't anything like pizza. Although I'd rather eat it than get a lecture on not being thankful. My brother came home for the first time in ever, ate with us, then decided to leave again. But this time I asked to come with; I'm so tired of beating my high score on the game. He said no, of course. I made my daddy change his mind for him, of course. I don't see why he wouldn't let me come in the first place. He was going to hang out with the guys I grew up with, my friends, not his. Anyways. I got ready then we hit the road. There him and I were, laughing about dinner and what kind of music my mom listens to, on our way to pick up my friends. These guys are great! All we do is crack jokes about each other and crack up. But let's get down to business. I didn't tell you this, but it's summer time, around The Fourth of July. Fireworks are for sale and we're creating ""bombs"" out of them. Or they are. Since I'm a girl, I guess I'm not allowed, or something lame like that. But there is this girl my brother likes and I guess he wants to impress, excuse me ""impress"" her by showing up at her house so she can see these ""master pieces"" they've made. That just makes me feel bad for him, but honestly just made me laugh. Maybe she'll be impressed. Key word: maybe. Although, no, it won't. Because to this day they are still only friends. So about these bombs. Complete duds. We tried, well I just watched, over and over again to make 'em work, but they wouldn't do a thing. Eventually my friend Josh put a whole bunch of sparklers into my favorite stuffed animal. It just made a bunch of sparkly colors and loud noises, but it was pretty fun to watch. We got in on video too, it was a total good laugh for everyone. After my brother said goodbye to his ""girl,"" we decided to head home. The thing is, we had so many fireworks left! We know this kid Tim who lives somewhere on the way home. So we decided to go by his house, have Josh get out of the truck, light the firework on his porch, have him jump in the tail of the trunk, then drive off as fast as we could. The first time we did it we couldn't stop laughing. They didn't come out of their house, so we did it again. They still didn't come out. We did it about one more time, by then all the neighbors were out. They were all so confused. That just made us laugh even more. It was so great we wanted to keep doing it, but to someone else this time. We know this girl Sarah who lives near all of us. We thought, why not? It's not gonna hurt to stop there real quick and have some fun with her too. Apparently she thought different. Way different, actually she thought it was the rudest thing ever. We were just joking around, gettin' a laugh out of all our fun. We weren't being rude, she's our friend. Long story short, her mom got mad too and chased us down in her car. She never caught us, but she got our license plate number. The next day, on The Fourth of July, she called the police. They didn't think it was a big deal, but they still showed up at my house and talked to my parents about what went down. I was at my boyfriend's so lucky me I only had to talk to my mom on the phone about it. She realized we were just having fun and actually laughed about it too. That Fourth of July night was great. It was one of those nights where you laughed the whole time and wouldn't change a thing even if you got in trouble with the law for it. Something I will definitely never do again, but I'm so glad I have this hilarious memory to reminisce on for the rest of my life."
121	20869	8	3	A day with the family was filled with laughter and fun. We started the day with breakfast at a restaurant, reminiscing about old memories and sharing stories. The atmosphere was light-hearted and joyful as we shared jokes and enjoyed each other's company. However, things took a hilarious turn when one of my cousins couldn't stop farting while laughing uncontrollably, leading to a comical situation that had us all in stitches. Even my mother tried to drown out the noise with a salt shaker, adding to the laughter. The day continued with games and more laughter, with one memorable moment being my brother's failed attempt at mimicking a waterfall in a game of gestures. Despite the competitive spirit and a minor mishap, the day ended on a high note, with everyone enjoying the time spent together. Family bonding and shared laughter truly make for a memorable and heartwarming experience.
122	20870	8	3	Laughter is a powerful tool that can quickly change the dynamic of a relationship. I had a similar experience with @PERSON1, whom I initially found irritating and offensive. However, a moment of honesty and humor from him made me realize that he was actually a good person at heart. Despite his tendency to be loud and brash, @PERSON1's ability to find humor in any situation and keep smiling has taught me the importance of not taking life too seriously. He has become a constant reminder for me to always find a reason to laugh, no matter what challenges come my way. Laughter truly has the power to bridge gaps and turn enemies into friends, as it did in my case with @PERSON1.
123	20871	8	3	Laughter is good for everyone as it helps the body be more awake and acts as an exercise. In fact, laughter is a form of therapy for the body, especially when individuals are feeling stressed. It can act as a cure, clearing the mind and body of tension. Not only does laughter benefit the individual, but it also encourages others to join in, spreading positivity and courage. Laughing is not just a simple act; it has significant benefits for both physical and mental well-being.
124	20872	8	3	Laughter is a powerful medicine in difficult times. We have all experienced moments of tension and stress, like when a loved one is going through a tough time. In my case, it was when my father was recovering from a motorcycle accident and the family was under a lot of pressure. Despite the challenging circumstances, my father's ability to bring humor into the situation helped us overcome the tension and find joy in each other's company. Laughter truly has the power to mend a broken heart and strengthen bonds between family members. It is through humor and light-heartedness that we can navigate through tough times and come out stronger on the other side.
125	20874	8	3	"Laughter plays a vital role in relationships and contributes to overall enjoyment and happiness. When I laugh, it signifies that I am truly enjoying myself or having a great time. Some people may not have a strong sense of humor and may not find things funny. Watching comedy movies is something I enjoy, as I eagerly anticipate the funniest parts. It's essential not to laugh too hard to avoid any embarrassing accidents. My favorite comedian is Adam Sandler, who never fails to make me laugh with his sense of humor. Another comedian I admire is @PERSON1, who brings laughter through his performances, especially on the show ""Wild 'N Out."" Understanding what makes something funny is crucial, as not everyone laughs at the same things. Comedy movies like ""Grandma's Boy"" and ""Happy Gilmore"" are great examples of films that keep audiences laughing throughout. It's not just about being funny; the way comedy is presented and the storyline behind it also contribute to its success. Enjoying laughter wisely is important, ensuring not to overdo it and risk any embarrassing moments. Thank you for reading."
126	20876	8	3	Laughter is truly a powerful force in our lives. It has the ability to heal, to connect people, and to bring joy in even the darkest of times. Through laughter, relationships are strengthened, bonds are formed, and memories are created. It is a universal language that transcends barriers and brings people together in a moment of shared happiness. Without laughter, life would be dull and lacking in color. It is an essential element that adds vibrancy and vitality to our existence. So, let us never underestimate the power of laughter and always remember to spread joy and laughter wherever we go.
127	20877	8	3	"I have had many great times with my grandpa. He is a very funny and loving man. When my cousin, my grandpa and I get together for a camping trip there is trouble coming no matter what. A few years ago he took me and my cousin on a two day camping trip along the @ORGANIZATION1. The first campground we arrived at had no open sites so we moved on to the next campground. @CAPS1 campground had tons of open campsites so we picked the best one we could find and stayed there for the first @TIME1. Later that evening we learned why there was no one at the campground. The reason was that there was a racoon problem a few days before and people were scared to stay in the campground for fear of attack or having their food stolen. We were lucky and never saw the racoon and we never lost any of our food. The next @TIME2 on the way out we saw a sign that read ""caution racoon problem."" @CAPS1 made us laugh all the way to @LOCATION1, which is a small town on the @ORGANIZATION1. Once in @LOCATION1 we stopped for gas and more food to last through the @TIME1. While at the gas station we had little bit of an issue but it was very funny. A young blond woman came out to help us and she wasn't the smartest person I have met. She charged us three times the amount of gasoline than we bought and couldn't tell us where the nearest grocery store was. Well, as my grandpa is rolling up his window he mutters quite loudly ""dumb blonde"", while the woman was standing right there. She didnt say a word and my gandpa drove off with me and cousin laughing so hard we could barely breath. My grandpa asked us why we were laughing so hard, so we told him what the circumstances were when he said dumb blonde. He was so oblivious to the situation that he didn't notice what came out of his mouth at the time. What even made it better was that he drove off like nothing had happened. The next @TIME1 we stayed at a diiferent campground with no racoons. Still the @TIME1 was filled with laughter. We were roasting marshmellows over the fire after our dinner and for some odd reason my grandpa could not keep the marshmellow on his stick. He wasted about six marshmellow before he even got one that he could eat. And everytime he dropped one into the fire it got more and more funny. We laughed and laughed until our stomach hurt. The best part was theat my grandpa didn't think it was funny so he just looked at me and my cousin like we were stupid or something. In the tent that @TIME1 we were so tired everything seemed funny to us. We laughed at each other until two in the @TIME2. Thats when everything went silent and we couldnt last any longer. We were all asleep within seconds. My cousin and I have gone camping with my grandpa every year now for about four years and each year we have an adventure filled with laughter as we go closer to each other. My grandpa is a great man and I look up to him for many things in my life. He has always keep me laughing and I try to do the same for him. He and I believe that it is important to laugh together because it keeps you smiling and helps you grow closer to whoever you are with. Keep laughing and have a fun in all you do."
128	20878	8	3	"""Laughter"" I believe laughter is the shortest distance between two people. When things between you and a loved one get fuzzy making them laugh will always help break the ice. When I get angry with my boyfriend he knows that in order for me to be happy he must make me smile/laugh. That is exactly what he does. The very first time he made me angry he didn't know what to do. It was @DATE1 @CAPS1 and I had just started dating. I remember he asked me if I was hungry and I said ""no I'm not hungry,"" so he continued to ask. Since we had only been dating for a short period of time he really didn't know much about me, so he didn't know that I am a type of girl that gets annoyed easily and I have a really low temper. He continued to ask me if I was hungry, thirsty, bored, or tired but he didn't realize that at this point I was really annoyed; an hour and a half passed by and he was still asking! I was going crazy I didn't want to tell him how I felt because I knew I was going to make him feel bad, but I thought to myself and said ""no he has to know because its going to be worst if later on in the relationship he has to find out what I like and don't like on his own rather that me telling him. I went on and told him every single little detail about me good and bad, at first he just listened but towards the end he exploded and told me that why wasn't I just straight up with him from the beginning. That made me really upset, I was trying to be honest with him before anything worse happened but i guess not. I stayed quiet for the longest time and he kept asking me ""what's wrong,"" ""tell me what I did wrong"" so I told him that it really made me upset how he flipped out on me for no reason really all I was trying to do was save us from a larger argument, he looked at me and told me that I did do something wrong! He said that we had already been together for two months and it took me that long to show him my true colors I kind of understood where he was coming from but at the same time I didn't agree because by that point he should have already known. I mean it doesn't take that long to know a person especially if its your girlfriend. In the end we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other. He busted out saying ""ouch charlie you bit me"" in a @CAPS2 accent that just made me loose it I laughed for days after that and completely forgot about thee over whelming discussion we had. The point being here is that laughter is the tool to breaking the ice when things get tough and it doesn't necessarily have to be a loved one it can even be a complete stranger, if the person is shy making them laugh will help construct a great friendship with them. You can make anybody's day go great with just a little grin that you put on their face a simple ""hello"" or ""hey"" can even make them smile. I believe that a person that smiles often lives longer. This @MONTH1 not be true but in my little world it is. I am all about smiling, all about making people laugh. Honestly I hate seeing people walk around with angry faces like if they have no friends when all they really want is someone to make them smile-and that would be me! In conclusion, if it wasn't for laughter what relationship would still be standing at this point? None, because if your always arguing and always wining and never laughing then how do you expect your relationship to last? Like I said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""   Laughter plays a crucial role in building and strengthening relationships, whether with loved ones or even strangers. It has the power to break down barriers, ease tension, and create connections that can last a lifetime. So, don't underestimate the value of a good laugh - it may just be the key to a happy and lasting relationship."
129	20879	8	3	Angelina and her best friend had a memorable night full of laughter and fun, from painting their tongues blue with nail polish to having an impromptu ice chugging contest in the kitchen. Despite the occasional fights they may have, they always find a way to laugh it off and cherish the bond they share. Laughter has become a vital part of their friendship, serving as a form of stress relief and a source of joy whenever they are together. The power of laughter continues to strengthen their relationship and bring them closer, reminding them of the importance of finding happiness in the little moments shared with loved ones.
130	20881	8	3	"Once upon a time, on a late rainy night my friends @PERSON2 I decided @CAPS5 would be fun to go out in the woods @PERSON2 play @NUM1-go-seek. One of my friend's sisters drove us out to the woods @PERSON2 the idea of the game was that since there were four of us, two would go out @PERSON2 hide @PERSON2 tow would stay in the car @PERSON2 count until the other two were ready to be found. Well once while us four were doing that @CAPS5 was pouring down rain @PERSON2 very very muddy outside. Well the two that hide were @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 the two that stayed in the car to count was me friend @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. Before @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 went out to hide we all made up a signal to let the others know if we were okay or no. The danger signal was @CAPS1 @CAPS1. @CAPS3 after we had our little meeting @PERSON2 got everything situated @PERSON2 dealt with, @PERSON1 got out of the car @PERSON2 went of @PERSON2 hid while me @PERSON2 @PERSON3 stayed in the car to wait @PERSON2 count. After we counted to about @NUM2 we hear screaming @PERSON2 shouting. My first thought was that they just got chicken @PERSON2 maybe wanted to freak out @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. I was curious @CAPS3 I cracked the car door open @CAPS3 I can hear a little better about what they were saying. Sure enough here came @PERSON1 @PERSON2 rite behind her was @PERSON2. @PERSON2 looked as if @CAPS4 was about to cry @PERSON2 @PERSON2 couldn't ran fast enough to get back to the car, @CAPS4 kept slipping @PERSON2 sliding everywhere all over on the road but @CAPS4 finally made @CAPS5 back @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 @PERSON2 crammed into the car with us. We all sat there crammed in this little car thinking about what they were running @PERSON2 screaming from, @CAPS3 me being the brave one at the moment decided to go take a look at things. Of course with @PERSON2 not wanting to look or feel like wimps followed close behind me. As I was walking down the road from where I saw them run from @LOCATION1 jumps out in front of me @PERSON2 says ""right over there I swear I saw something dart across the road!"" @CAPS3 I walked over to where @CAPS4 pointed @PERSON2 looked around thinking that @ORGANIZATION1's crazy @PERSON2 @CAPS4's just seeing things. But as I walk on, @PERSON2 grabs me from the back @PERSON2 screams. I turn around @PERSON2 look at her thinking ""what the heck is wrong with you people!"". @CAPS4 grabs me by the arm @PERSON2 looks up with a very frightened expression on her face. I turn toward her @PERSON2 ask her ""whats wrong"" @CAPS4 asks me, ""why does that tree look white but right there in the middle there is a big tan spot?!"" @CAPS5 was dark @PERSON2 I couldn't see very well but when I looked up I saw exactly what @PERSON2 was freaking out about. I go back to the car to get a flash light hoping a came see what is on the tree a little bit better @PERSON2 as soon as I make my way back to @PERSON2 by the tree, @ORGANIZATION1 lets out a blood curdling scream @PERSON2 yells ""@CAPS6! Its moving, whatever @CAPS5 is @CAPS5's moving @CAPS7!"" @CAPS3 as I approach the girls @PERSON2 rips the flash light out of me hands, turns @CAPS5 on @PERSON2 points @CAPS5 to the tree. Sure enough there was a big tan spot @PERSON2 the white tree. As us girls sat the waiting for @CAPS5 to move again @CAPS5 finally did. I flashed @CAPS5 with the flash light @PERSON2 started laughing. As soon as @PERSON2 get their feet under them they want to hit me because they don't know what is in the tree or what I was laughing at. As they approach me, I turn back to @PERSON1 @PERSON2 ask her ""@CAPS3 @PERSON2, do you want to see your monster?"" @CAPS4 freaked out again asking what is was. I told her, ""take a look at @CAPS5 for yourself"" @CAPS4 looked up @PERSON2 saw @CAPS"
131	20882	8	3	"For me, laughter makes the world go round. It is much needed to keep the world light and filled with a sense of happiness. You will hardly come across me without a big old smile plastered across my face. There are so many stories to choose from but one that will be the most fun to tell, I think. It still makes me giggle just thinking about that moment. I was going on a trip with my last boyfriend, down to for the Fourth of July. They have a big Fourth of July walk and I was lucky to get to tag along with him and his mom. We were staying with good friends of his mom, and. Their house was stunningly amazing, with beautiful wood floors, a big open living room that combined with the kitchen and dining room, vaulted ceilings, and a big stunning window that framed crisp scenery. Even with the house being so great, my favorite part was the railroad tracks. Not more than a quarter of a mile through a little trail surrounded by woods were two sets of tracks stretching out in both directions as far as the eye could see. My favorite part of the whole trip were those tracks. It was the second night of our stay in around midnight. My boyfriend and I went for a walk in the refreshing night air. We could hardly see and were holding on tight to each other to try and keep balance. Smiling and giggling, we finally stumbled out of the very well-hidden trail entrance onto the tracks. Hand in hand, we started to walk down the tracks just enjoying each other's presence. In the dark, the stars were the most stunning I have ever seen. I'm not sure why, but the sky just seemed to open up and look two times bigger than it really is. Midnight was perfect for stargazing without a cloud in sight. So we decided to lay down between the tracks and look at the stars. There we cuddled together for a good few minutes. Then my boyfriend looked up, giving me a puzzled expression. I followed his gaze to see what had caught his attention. Far in the distance was a light slowly advancing towards us - a train at midnight. Looking back at each other, we both laughed at the pure surprise of a train at that hour. As the train advanced, we jumped off the tracks to wait for it to pass so we could resume our spot. The train was going way slower than I was expecting, no more than four to five miles per hour. My boyfriend's eyes lit up with an idea, and without thinking, he said, ""We should jump it!"" As soon as the words left his mouth, he regretted saying them. I thought it was a great idea, but he tried desperately to convince me not to do it. I headed towards the track, telling him to live a little and let's have some fun. I had never jumped a train before, but from the looks of it, this train was perfect to try it out on. I grabbed onto one and jumped on right before my boyfriend could stop me. He finally gave in and jumped on the next one. We were both smiling and having a great time when we jumped off and met in a hug. Then the train stopped, and we froze. A light started coming our way, and freaking out, thinking we would get in trouble, I sprinted for the trailhead with my boyfriend close on my heels. I couldn't find the trail, and the light was getting closer, so we both jumped full speed straight into a big bunch of bushes. There we stayed perfectly still until the light passed us and the train began to resume its pace. I met my boyfriend's big fat smile, and we both just rolled over laughing, unable to help ourselves. What were the chances of going out for a simple walk and all this happening? Still smiling hugely, my boyfriend leaned over to me and gave me a perfect kiss. That was one of my best nights ever. This moment is just an example of how smiling and laughter were a big part of my boyfriend's and my relationship. Love, friends, and laughter are the reasons life is worth living."
132	20883	8	3	Being able to laugh is one of the greatest feelings in the world, especially when shared with family. These moments are priceless and create lasting memories that bring joy even in difficult times. During a family trip to an unfamiliar destination, getting lost turned out to be a hilarious adventure. Despite the confusion and worry, laughter filled the car as they navigated through the town. Jokes about the mother's navigation skills lightened the mood and made the trip unforgettable. Laughter truly connects family and friends, turning negative situations into cherished memories. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and laughter with loved ones is a vital part of that enjoyment. Embrace the moments of laughter and fun, for they are what make life truly worth living.
133	20884	8	3	Laughter brings people together in a unique and powerful way, creating bonds that can last a lifetime. I experienced this firsthand when I joined a lacrosse team and connected with two girls through laughter. Our shared moments of joy and amusement helped us build a strong friendship that extended to the entire team. As we traveled to a tournament, laughter continued to unite us, despite our diverse backgrounds and origins. This experience taught me that laughter is a universal language that can bridge differences and bring people closer. It truly is the shortest distance between two individuals, making the world a better and brighter place when shared among friends.
134	20885	8	3	Humor is a huge part of who I am, and I love making people laugh, but this story is about an event that made my whole family fall down laughing on the floor. It all started one day when my cousin received a trampoline for his birthday. It was a great day not only for him but for the rest of us kids too because we all could go and play on it whenever we wanted.  We were always over at my cousin's house after that. We would have competitions to see who could jump the highest or who could do the coolest trick. Sometimes we would fall off or one of us would get hurt, and then my aunt and uncle wouldn't let us play on it for a while. But they would always cave and let us back on it.  It wasn't until a few months later that we all witnessed the funniest accident that any of us had ever seen in our lifetime. It all started out at my aunt's birthday party. Usually, she had it at some fancy restaurant, but not this year. This year she decided just to have it at home to save some money.  So we all showed up for my aunt's party - my mom, my brothers, and me. First off, we did all the regular birthday things - meeting family members, eating some food, and singing happy birthday. Basically, in my eyes, it was all the boring stuff. I mean, come on, there was a trampoline out in the backyard just waiting to be jumped on, but the adults wouldn't let us get anywhere near it until we had eaten.  Finally, everyone was done eating, and they were going to let us kids go have our fun. It started off as normal as any other day we went to play on the trampoline, but little did we know that all of our stomachs would be hurting from laughing in a few hours from an event that was about to transpire.
135	20887	8	3	It was a normal day, I had just woken up, because my friend @PERSON2 who had called me wondering if I wanted to hangout.I said yes and I went and took a shower and got ready. Once I was ready I called him back and asked him where he wanted to hangout at. He told me that he wanted me to go over to kyle house and play basketball.When I got there everyone was over there so we decied to have a big game of basketball.I was on the better team and already knew we were going to win, but every single shot I took I missed and it was really embarresing, but my team ended up winning which was no suprise.After the game we all were tired and went inside to play video games. We played @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1, we took turns and on my turns I did really bad because I dont really play video games so everyone laughed at me including myself.As soon as we were done playing I got a @CAPS1 from a bunch of girls who were going to the movies that night, and wanted to know if everyone and I wanted to go.Everyone decied to go, and we all wanted to see the movie paranormal activity @NUM1, so we were pretty excited and before the movie started we all went over to @PERSON1 house and hungout with all the girls.We all sat in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were up stairs getting ready.I was bored so I went up stairs to hangout with the girls and let me tell you it was a bad idea because the second I walked up there they all wanted me to let them straighten my hair or let them put makeup on me.So I went back down stairs and warned everyone not to go up there.They asked why and when I told them they all laughed and some of them went up there anyway and came back with makeup on I laughed so hard that i fell off the couch.Once I finaly stopped laughing it was time to go and her mom drove us there but there was not enough seats in the car so me and all the girls we cramed into the front seat and the reast of the guys were in the back seat, so I was pretty happy.When we got in the movie theater there was a pretty long line but it was worth it.Suprisingly the moive was acutaly kinda scary it made me jump like five times.When we drove home it was like @NUM3 and @PERSON3 and I walked home from her house and the whole way back he was freaking out and it made me laugh and it made him laugh how I was kinda freaked out too.I think that it was a really fun day because I was laughing through most of it.I had a great time hanging out with friends and experiencing new things, making it a day to remember.
136	20888	8	3	@CAPS1 is my personal belief that hilarity and giddiness are the best emotional states to be in. Therefore, it makes sense that people who find laughter in the same things would be of good relations. It is because of their likeness of minds that they are connected and find happiness in each other's company. My story is an example of laughter's connection between people and the strength of the bond it forms. Picture the scene: it was a hot day on the north side of a mountain. Standing there was a weak eleven-year-old boy who thought he could not continue further. Patiently standing beside him was his father, a climbing veteran who had scaled mountains in different locations. The boy was tired, he could not put one foot in front of the other. His muscles screamed in protest as the blisters on his heels throbbed in harmony. The sun beat down on him while the snow gave way and brought him to the ground. It was as if the mountain wanted him to fail and was urging him to give in and cry in defeat. Fatigue then consumed the boy adding fifty pounds to each of his limbs. His brain had dimmed as well leaving him capable of only simple thoughts like putting one foot in front of the other. He began finding any excuse to stop and made them often. The boy's father had tried everything he could think of to give his son the incentive to keep going with no avail. He tried another tack, he began to tell the boy stories, perhaps in hope that it would take the boy's mind off the excruciating pain. And to the relief of all concerned, it proved effective. What was most interesting about the whole event is it wasn't the content of the stories that helped, it was the humorous and sarcastic tone that made the real difference. An infusion that I would describe as a solution of laughing gas and an energy drink washed over me. In the presence of my father's humor, I found the strength to keep going. It was like I had been completely recharged and refreshed. My arms and legs, which had previously felt like solid pipes of lead, lightened considerably. The stabbing agony in my muscles and joints frayed away and left. The dull pulsing of the blisters on my heels was silenced. This was all due to someone's thoughts and ideas tickling my funny bone. I believe laughter to be the anesthetic of nature, the emotional element that keeps the world sane. It was at that point in time when I realized what I respected most about my father. I had no shortage of traits to choose from. He had an indomitable work ethic, was a great teacher, and possessed an extraordinary amount of energy. But what I respected most about him was that we were similar in our humor. We laughed at the same things and found hilarity in each other's comments. It forged a strong bond between us, one constructed of euphoria and glee that continues to this day. Whenever I am morose, he always manages to find a way to bring a smile to my face and I found that I too had the same ability. To my belief, a relationship formed on laughter is the strongest one of all. Laughter is a force that paves the way to friendship, respect, and love. You cannot have hope for a better future if you do not have laughter. It is the drug that descends from the heavens, a drug that runs through the bloodstream of society, freeing the minds from the stress and worries of what tomorrow will bring. Laughter can unite a population and instill a feeling of friendship in a society. Have you ever laughed at something and then turned to find that at the exact same moment someone across the room had also begun to laugh? Then your eyes lock and a slow smile spreads throughout both of your faces, as you realize that you are not alone in how you think and what you laugh at. That connective force is a result of the power of laughter.
137	20889	8	3	"Laughing, smirking, giggling, chuckling; these all have to do with one subject, that is, laughing. Laughter is everywhere, you hear it in libraries, parks, at home, behind your back, it can be a great thing or a horrible thing even with family and friends. Everyone has a past with laughing that has welcomed them, helped them out, cheered them up, or even, just so they can make a very special friend that will stay with them forever.  It was the start of a brand new school year. I had just moved from another town. I was a seventh grader about to start at a new school in a new town, and I wasn't a real big fan of hanging out with people, so I stayed to myself most of the weeks, eating lunch in the guidance center, trying to figure out where books were without talking to anybody. My schedule was good, I had choir, art, drama, you know all the stuff I like. Art and drama were a blast, but when it came to choir and singing, my social level went down. I love to sing, but never did it in front of people.  Then one day, I was walking to choir and I tripped and fell, my papers falling with me. My school work was all over the hall, math at one end, science at the other. But, out of all the kids in the hallway, only one laughed. She walked by, said I did a great job but something triggered her to come back. She helped me pick up all my math homework and picked up my schedule and saw that she too had choir this period. Her name was Sarah, she told me, and I told her my name, and we walked together. We sat next to each other and I sang with her, our voices in harmony.  We talked in between periods, at lunch, on the bus ride home. We became great friends and the principal thought so too and he went ahead and gave us classes together. We were friends and we still are friends till this day. But the sad thing is that she moved at the near end of eighth grade year. But she was the only friend I had for a little while and I always give her a call every now and then. Sometimes we can talk for hours, laughing and talking about how we are doing and when we are going to see each other again. She has been my best friend for at least two years now and it all happened by a slip of a foot, that falling of papers, and one little laugh from an amazing person.  Laughing has got me so far in life and at school. Every now and then, when I see someone all alone, wanting a friend, I go and talk to them, and even laugh with them. One little laugh can trigger a huge friendship waiting to happen. Some say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" and I believe whoever said that because it happened to me. Laughter truly is a powerful connector, bringing people together in unexpected and beautiful ways."
138	20892	8	3	"When it comes down to laughter, it can change a person's thinking or even the mood that they are in. Laughter can be the ending result, to a bad start to a day or to greater the relationship between two people. I love to laugh because it shows how I am feeling and it keeps me happy, I not only laugh when I'm sad, but also when I'm in a great mood as well. Growing up in a world full of tragedies and war, I feel like you should always keep your head held high and the smiles flowing. Although, when life gives you lemons, you must make lemonade and keep your face with the sour look because it's funny! I think that laughter is one of the best medicines around and can fix most problems whenever you are feeling down. My older sister brought into this world the most amazing little nieces an aunt could ever have. When they were little babies I used to make silly faces, dance to music, and watch movies with them, but this isn't what brought us closer. It was the fact that I wanted to laugh, in which made them happy too. One time, I was feeling really down and out, but I didn't want that to affect me, so I proceeded with my day and began to watch music videos, when ""Crazy in Love"", by Beyonce came on. They went crazy! They started jumping on the bed and twirling their hair back and forth as if they were Beyonce!, they really stole the show. I couldn't believe what was happening before my eyes, and I burst out with so much joy. I felt so much of their joy, that I had to get up and dance with them, we jumped, we twirled, and whipped our hair several times before the song ended with us dizzy and out of breath. After we had our fun of the music video, they just kept dancing and in my head I'm, like ""don't they ever get tired"", but I was pretty sure that their laughter brought them continuous amazement. A smile is worth a thousand words and laughter is priceless, my nieces really and are truly what brought me up that day. It was bitter in the start but then ended up sweet, let's just call it bittersweet. I feel like my nieces knew that I would be sad so they would say ""Shorty, what's wrong"", Shorty being my nickname because I am very short. They would always find a way to make me feel the need to smile and have a good time. Me and my nieces' relationship has grown to the highest extent and I know that whenever I'm with them, I will laugh. If someone once said that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", then they are correct because I may be in a different country, state or any other area but whether we talk on the phone or actually see each other, I will laugh about all their crazy antics and the closer we become as one."
139	20893	8	3	Having laughter in your life is essential in showing your true self. It transcends relationships, whether it be with a romantic partner or a friend. Laughter brings people closer together, creating memorable moments and strengthening bonds. It is a powerful tool that can turn any situation into a joyful one. So, embrace laughter in your life and cherish the moments of pure happiness it brings.
140	20894	8	3	"As we all know, water is essential for our survival, just like laughter is crucial for our well-being. A positive attitude can make a significant difference in our daily lives, just as my night school teacher once said, ""@CAPS1 is @PERCENT1 attitude."" Laughter has a way of bringing joy and lightening our moods, even in the darkest of times.  In my relationship with my boyfriend @LOCATION1, laughter plays a significant role. Despite our busy schedules that limit our time together, we always make the most of the moments we share. Our shared interests and similar backgrounds make it easy for us to enjoy each other's company. Whether we are celebrating birthdays or simply spending time together, laughter is always present.  During a birthday celebration for @PERSON2 at @LOCATION1's house, laughter filled the air as we gathered around the pinata. Children eagerly awaited their turn to smash it open and grab the candy inside. When it was my boyfriend's turn, I nervously joined him, accidentally hitting him in the process. The moment brought laughter and jokes among the guests, lightening the mood and creating lasting memories.  As the party came to an end, I thanked my dad with a smile, grateful for the laughter and joy that filled the day. Laughter truly is a gift that brings us together and uplifts our spirits in the most unexpected ways."
141	20895	8	3	"Just walking through a party store in a banana costume with one of your best friends, trying to find the perfect costumes for an upcoming event, can lead to endless laughter and unforgettable memories. This was just one of the many instances where my friend and I found ourselves in fits of laughter, enjoying each other's company to the fullest. Laughter has always been a central part of our friendship, serving as a stress-reliever and a source of joy in our lives. As former gymnast teammates, we spent hours together training and pushing ourselves to our limits. In those intense moments, laughter was our escape, our way of releasing tension and fear. The bond we formed through laughter extended beyond just the two of us - it drew others to us, creating a sense of camaraderie and shared happiness. Whether we were playing games with neighbors or simply hanging out in the sun, our laughter always brought people together and strengthened our friendships. As the saying goes, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and it couldn't be more true in our case. Our shared laughter has not only connected us on a deeper level but has also helped us navigate through tough times with a lighter heart. In the end, it's clear that laughter truly is the glue that holds our friendship together, making every moment spent together a cherished memory that we'll always hold dear."
142	20896	8	3	Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. I also agree with those thoughts. When I first arrived in a new place about a year ago, I struggled to communicate as I did not speak the language fluently. However, I quickly learned that laughter can bridge any language barrier. On my first day at school, a girl approached me and upon learning about my language difficulties, she burst into laughter. Instead of feeling embarrassed, I found her laughter infectious, and it helped us bond instantly. Through our shared laughter, we became fast friends, and I realized that laughter truly is a universal language that can bring people together in any situation.
143	20897	8	3	Laughter is the best way to show someone that they are funny. It is the best way to relax. Everyone says that hearing a baby laugh is great. Watching comedians doing their acts can cheer people up and have them start laughing. Laughter is the best way to relax and here is three reason for that. First, is that no one can stay angry at the person making them laugh. Second, is that when someone laughs everyone around that person start laughing. Third and last reason, is that no one can stay sadden when something funny is happening. What do you think when you hear a baby's laughter? I think that the baby is truly loved by its family. He or she is having a bast playing with someone in the family or themselves. They think that whatever you are doing is funny. A comedian's job is to make a crowd of people laugh at or with them. One way a comedian does an act is stand up comedy. That is when a comedian is on stage and does his or her act. Another way is a comedy. A comedy can be a T.V. show, a play, or a movie. Comedies usually do not have a plot, but the point is to make you and anyone else start laughing. That is what I think about laughter. It helps anyone relax. Hearing a baby's laugh is great. Comedians love hear people laugh at or with them. Laughter truly is the best medicine for the soul.
144	20898	8	3	@CAPS6 only happened a few weeks ago on a day when all the students were supposed to be out having fun or sleeping because there was plenty of snow outside. A guy was crying in the band room, holding a french horn in his lap, his gaze fixed on the ground. He expressed his frustration about never getting the first chair position despite his hard work. Another student, who held the coveted first chair position, tried to explain the situation, emphasizing the need for specific players in specific spots. The argument escalated, threatening to tear apart the horn section. Realizing the potential consequences, a third student intervened with a humorous approach, diffusing the tension and prompting a resolution. The senior student was promised the first chair position once the competition ceased, bringing an end to the conflict. Despite being the target of jokes, the humorous intervention ultimately helped improve the relationship between the two students. As they look forward to the senior student's upcoming opportunity to shine, the band section is now characterized by mutual understanding and respect.
145	20899	8	3	"We're happy together @PERSON1 told me @CAPS2 we lay on his bed. I just smiled and I knew this was going to be a really good relationship. @CAPS5 always made me feel so great. @CAPS5 made me feel beautiful. Now don't say your too young to know what love is ,@CAPS1 I've heard it from my mom every time I talked about him. But I know that no one has ever made me feel this wonderful about myself, made me feel perfect. When we are together it's fun. Most guys I have been with have not been @CAPS2 fun, @CAPS2 in our dates together, walking to the park too sit and talk, eating out to kiss in public. Before we were ever dating, We were best friends. We still are best friends. Everyone asked us @CAPS6 we were dating, The answer was always no we're best friend's, but I always wanted more. @CAPS5 has always made me laugh. I don't think we would have made such a strong couple @CAPS6 we didn't make each other laugh. Just thinking about @CAPS4 I first knew I loved him makes me laugh. I was walking to my @DATE1 class, and out of no where @PERSON1 grabs my arm and pulls me into a huge bear hug, and buried his head in my neck and laughed and said ""@CAPS3, you have some toilet paper sticking out of your pants"" I felt my face turn twenty different shades of red. I smiled and quietly asked him to hide me so I could grab it. When I got to my @DATE1 class I was thinking to myself @CAPS4 could @CAPS5 just say that to me, @CAPS5 must of wanted to embarrass me. But the more I thought about what @CAPS5 did and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 did it made me feel, well it made me feel like @CAPS5 really and truly cared about me. Wanting to help me out rather then embarrass me. I bet every other guy was laughing. Not @PERSON1... well after that happened we had a good laugh. After we laughed and joked about what happened to me, @CAPS5 looked up and kissed me. I didn't know @CAPS6 that was a best friend kiss, or a real love kiss. So I simply laughed. then @CAPS5 kissed me again. This time I knew it was a real love kiss. We weren't like most couples either. Which made us stand out, and the more we stood out the more people started to hate the fact that we were together. They would say some horrible things to me in the hallway about @PERSON1. Who knows what they were telling him. @CAPS7 some of my closest friends started to make rude comments toward me and @PERSON1. I know @CAPS5 didn't believe anything they were saying @CAPS1 @CAPS5 would laugh at everything people would toss our way. When @CAPS5 laughed I would always ask him whats so funny, @CAPS5 would say ""@CAPS6 they rumors aren't true then laugh about them, that way people will know your not bother by them"" I would have never thought about that. I'm the kind of girl who wears her emotions on her sleeve, so of course I would get a little peeved with all the stuff they were saying about us. After I started laughing at all the rude and nasty things people were saying,. They stopped talking about us, it was like magic. I never thought about being in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 let alone @ORGANIZATION1, and finding a guy that would understand what I'm going through. Let alone someone who is going through something almost @CAPS2 difficult. My brother went to prison @DATE1, and I don't think I could have be able to make it through @CAPS2 much @CAPS2 I did with @PERSON1. I cried almost everyday at @ORGANIZATION1 with him. It's been about a year now. Every time I go see my brother I remember what @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS6 your happy the people around will be happy"" so I always put on a smile to see @LOCATION1, @CAPS7 though I know this will be the hardest years of my life. Laughing does really help. @CAPS7 @CAPS6 nothing is funny just laugh. God put you on this @LOCATION2 for a reason, and @CAPS6 you haven't found that reason laugh until you do. @CAPS1 the people in your life mean the world to you, and @CAPS6 they're down bring them up. I love @PERSON1 for helping me understand that life's to"
146	20900	8	3	Everyone loves to laugh, but not everyone fully understands the power of laughter in building relationships. A simple laugh can bring two strangers together and turn them into close friends. This was the case for me and my best friend, @PERSON1. We started laughing when we first met in the @NUM3 grade, and that laughter broke the ice, making everything less awkward between us. As we continued to laugh and talk, our friendship grew stronger. By @NUM6 grade, we were inseparable, spending weekends together and sharing secrets. Our laughter not only brought us closer but also created a strong bond of trust and support between us. When @PERSON1 needed a place to stay, she moved in with me, and our friendship only deepened. Living together has only strengthened our friendship, and we are like sisters now. It's incredible to think that a simple laugh was all it took for us to become the closest of friends. Laughing truly has the power to transform strangers into lifelong companions.
147	20901	8	3	One summer evening back in high school, a couple of friends and I were feeling incredibly bored. Nothing seemed appealing - not a trip to the movies, not grabbing some food, not even playing video games. It was then that one friend suggested we go outside and do something different. Before we left, he grabbed two hefty rolls of plastic wrap from his pantry. As we walked, he kept urging us to follow him without revealing our destination. Eventually, we ended up at a local building, where he unveiled his plan.  The idea was simple yet mischievous. Three of us would be stationed on the roof as lookouts, while the rest would be on the ground to execute the prank. When the coast was clear, we would quickly run across the street and wrap the plastic around it, causing cars to come to a halt. Despite some initial doubts about the plan, we all agreed to give it a try.  As we waited for the signal, tension mounted. Finally, we received the go-ahead and swiftly carried out the prank. The sight of cars stopping in confusion was both exhilarating and hilarious. However, when a police car approached, we had to make a quick escape, leaving behind one roll of plastic wrap.  After narrowly avoiding getting caught, we regrouped at a friend's house, laughing and reminiscing about the successful prank. Moments like these strengthened our bond and created lasting memories. The thrill of laughter and the shared experience brought us closer together as friends, solidifying our friendship even more.
148	20902	8	3	I agree when people say laughter is what mostly brings people together. In my opinion, most of the time when you're talking to someone, laughter is needed. It is what brings the dullness out of a person and makes the conversation interesting. Only when you are talking about something serious, you don't need to include laughter, but I'll explain later.  I can easily tell a true story about laughter from my life. Right now, I have a perfect group of friends. Sure, there are times when they mess up and act like kids, but I feel like I need to forgive and remember that they are there when I need them. Anyways, I can remember the first time I met each one of them, and the one thing that started our friendship was a joke. I can't exactly remember which joke we shared, but I do remember that we all had the same taste in comedy. And once we saw that neither of us were serious and dull people, it made us want to spend more time with each other.  As time passed, my friends and I were really drawn to each other. From time to time, we were happy to express our friendship through jokes. Sometimes the jokes are really stupid and have caused us to bring revenge on each other, but that is just how we stay close to each other. Day by day, when we see something funny on television, the internet, or real life, we always show it to each other and know that the other person will find it very funny. It makes us feel closer and know we all have the same taste in at least one field.  I can give one clear example of this: I was watching a comedy once, and the comedian was talking about his childhood and a prank he once played on a stranger's house. Right when I saw this video, I knew right away my friends had to see this because I knew from past experiences that they enjoy these types of laughs. And I was right, as soon as they saw the show, they were amazed at how funny it was, and we got closer than ever.  I want to share one more example from my life about laughter bringing two people closer. So, after telling you that laughter gets me closer with friends, I also want to point out that laughter brings out a sense of outline when you talk to girls - or boys, if you're a female. I met this one girl, and every time I talked to her, I had to throw in a joke or a story that would make sense to our subject. After a while, she started joking around and making stories too. She told me that she saw me as a different guy compared to other people. She said that she meant I wasn't a boring type of person, and that it kept her wanting to keep talking to me. Now, me and this girl are closer than ever, and the root that started this relationship was laughter.  So, as you see, laughter makes any relationship happy and open. Of course, I'm talking about the relationships that are playful. I meant there are people out there that take everything seriously and can't take a joke. But I would really encourage you to take laughter in your life if you already haven't. Look in my life, I used laughter and gained a lot of friends of all sorts just by joking around about something stupid. You don't have to say stupid things, but I say it would really make your life more interesting if you use laughter.
149	20904	8	3	These are some examples that I remember when I had fun and laughter in my life. It all started in the early years when I was a child, and my cousins were living with us because they had just moved down to our town from another place. It was fun having them around. My cousins and I would always ride bikes. Sometimes, one of my cousins would take my bike without asking, and I would get mad at him. We would race down the street with our bikes, and I always seemed to win on my dirt bike made for racing.  We would go behind some apartments where we had built a ramp out of dirt. One rainy day, we all went outside to play, even though it was pouring. We got all muddy and had a great time, despite the mess. After cleaning up, we would play video games or head to the park for free lunch. It was always a blast being at the park with friends and family, playing and enjoying the outdoors.  In later years, my friends and I would often stay at one friend's house for the weekend. We would play games, including one memorable birthday sleepover where we played Grand Theft Auto. Laughter was always a big part of our friendship, and those who could make us laugh were the best company to keep.  Laughter is essential in friendships because it creates a bond and shows that someone is a good person to be around. Friends who can make you laugh are truly valuable. In my experience, laughter has been a crucial aspect of my relationships with friends and family, making our time together all the more enjoyable.
150	20905	8	3	"Someone once said laughter was the best medicine. To me it was like someone was saying ""Hey! Life isn't gonna get any better so just enjoy it while you can!"" And that's what I did for a while, but laughing at everything got old very quickly. Sad to say I still laugh at most things, even sad things. I laugh because I think that if I do then everything will just get better. That's not even close to what really happens. In fact, it only causes more pain and suffering in most cases.  Like the time where I met this guy named Person1. He was amazing. Most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset. He was a human. Nothing more and nothing less. That's how I saw it and that's how he saw it too. When we first started talking to each other it was between notes I would give my friend and she would give them to him. He was a very shy guy so he never wrote back on a piece of paper. Instead he had her tell me what he said. Then he finally got the idea to write messages in her phone and then I would read them and answer back. It was fun for a while but I wanted to actually meet the guy.  A few months went by and we were back to our old way of talking to each other. He was very kind and never did he have a bromidic moment. He told me about his family, his life, his future, what he felt, and how he wished he could see me so he could give me a big hug. I thought we could actually make things work between us, that is until he moved away. I was a little upset but it really didn't bother me except the fact that talking to each other became almost as rare as seeing a different picture of him.  While at school one morning my friend came over to me and had a careful gaze. I knew something was wrong and that it had to do with Person1 but I just acted oblivious to it hoping it would lessen the blow I knew was about to come. She said he had told her it wasn't going to work out between him and I. I sat there and like the idiot I was I said I knew it wasn't going to anyways, he was him and I was me. She said he was sorry and all these other excuses but I wouldn't listen. Instead I ignored it and went on with my life like I think everyone should.  So who ever said laughter was the best medicine obviously hadn't experienced the after effects of it all. It may bring temporary relief, but in the end, it can lead to more pain and disappointment. Laughing may help us cope with difficult situations, but it doesn't make the problems disappear. It's important to face reality and deal with our emotions in a healthy way, rather than masking them with laughter."
151	20906	8	3	Trust is a crucial component of any friendship. It is built on honesty, transparency, and mutual respect. When friends trust each other, they can rely on one another to keep their word and be truthful in all situations. This trust forms the foundation of a strong and lasting friendship, where individuals feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or betrayal.  In my own circle of friends, we have established a deep level of trust by agreeing to be open and honest with each other. We make a conscious effort to communicate openly, discuss our opinions, and work together to find solutions that benefit everyone. This level of trust allows us to depend on each other like a team, knowing that we have each other's backs and will always support one another.  However, trust can easily be broken if one party is dishonest or deceitful. When trust is lost, it can be challenging to regain, and the relationship may never be the same again. This is why it is essential to value and nurture the trust between friends, as it forms the basis of a strong and meaningful friendship.  In conclusion, trust is a fundamental aspect of any friendship. By being honest, transparent, and dependable, friends can build a strong foundation of trust that will help them navigate challenges and strengthen their bond. It is important to value and protect this trust, as it is the key to maintaining a healthy and fulfilling friendship.
152	20907	8	3	"One day when I was having trouble coping with some big changes in my life, I sought the help of a friend. Normally, when I'm having a bad day, I tend to keep to myself. But this time, I needed someone else there to help me. I met with my friend, and she tried everything to cheer me up, but nothing was working. Then she said, ""Want to hear a story?"" Wanting anything to take me out of my slump, I agreed. She began, ""The other day, my family and I went grocery shopping..."" She continued to tell me a funny story about their dog treats being mistaken for cookies, and how it led to a hilarious moment with their dad. As she told me the story, I couldn't help but laugh, and soon enough, I found myself feeling much better. I realized that sometimes all you need is a little laughter to brighten your day and help you through tough times."
153	20908	8	3	Have you ever had a fear of falling off of a cliff when up in the mountain? I have, I actually had that experience. It was a few winters ago, we had just gotten off of the bus. I had grabbed all of my gear from the storage from under the bus and headed for the slopes. we strapped in our boots and went to the lift to catch a chair up. I was with my friends, all three of us joined the snowboard team at school that year. The three of us caught a chair up to the top of the run. The air was so crisp, and the snow was a fresh blanket of powder. We were all so excited to go ride in that perfect of a day. As we went down the run, it was the same old usual every time. so I talked to my friends and suggested that it was time we went through some new trails. They agreed, so we went down through a new area. It was a good trail with many jumps and a lot of powder. It seemed like a perfect area to board in. We all enjoyed it very much. But we realized that it was coming to the end when the trail was getting a little narrow, then suddenly, there was a drop right in front of us. I shifted my board sideways so I can stop, but it didn't help. It was a patch of ice that I hit, and it was no use. I couldn't stop. I fell off, and braced for impact. I was thinking that I was about to be seriously injured because of the rocks below. But luckily, my board was the first to hit the rock, showering the cool day with sparks lighting it up. I slid down the snow a couple more feet, trying to stop myself. As I came to a stop, I looked back wondering how I survived that. I was worried that my friends would do the same, but they had stopped just in time. We all couldn't believe on what just happened. I learned a lesson from that day of to always scope out the area first before you go through it. I luckily was not hurt, I could have been seriously injured. It was a scary moment, but it taught me a valuable lesson about safety on the slopes.
154	20909	8	3	Laughter is truly a powerful tool that can help in various aspects of life. In a challenging volleyball season, where the team faced numerous obstacles and doubts, the captains, alongside new team members, had to navigate through tough games and situations. Despite facing initial resistance and setbacks, the team managed to come together and achieve success through perseverance and a positive mindset. By incorporating laughter into their approach, the team was able to lift spirits, boost confidence, and ultimately emerge victorious in the state finals. Looking back, the captains realized the importance of humor and unity in overcoming challenges and achieving their goals. As they embark on a new season, they hope to carry forward the lessons learned from their previous triumphs and continue their journey towards success with laughter and determination by their side.
155	20910	8	3	Laughter played a crucial role in saving my best friend's relationship with his girlfriend. They were caught in a heated argument that escalated over a trivial issue, eventually leading to a point where the root cause was forgotten. However, a simple act of watching a funny movie together and sharing laughter during dinner helped them break the tension and realize the futility of their fight. This laughter-induced realization brought them closer and resolved their conflict. From this experience, I learned that laughter is an essential component of any relationship, as it not only diffuses tension but also fosters connection and understanding between partners. In times of discord, a good laugh can pave the way for open communication and strengthen the bond between individuals, making it a valuable tool for building and maintaining healthy relationships.
156	20911	8	3	@CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2! Laughter is truly a gift that brightens our days and brings joy to our hearts. It is amazing how a simple moment of laughter can turn a challenging situation into a memorable experience filled with happiness. I vividly remember a funny incident during Christmas when my sister struggled to operate a monster truck, leading to a series of comical events that had us all laughing uncontrollably. Despite a minor mishap, the laughter and joy that ensued made it a cherished memory for our family. This moment taught me the valuable lesson that laughter is indeed the best medicine, capable of turning any situation around and filling our lives with warmth and positivity. So, let us always remember to laugh more, smile often, and cherish the moments that bring us together in pure happiness.
157	20913	8	3	Laughter brings enthusiasm and joyfulness to any situation. It can also play a key role in building and maintaining relationships. One example of how laughter helped strengthen a relationship is when I met one of my best friends in fifth grade. We bonded over our shared love for skateboarding and a humorous fall that we both found amusing. This shared laughter helped break the ice and made us feel comfortable around each other. Since then, we have shared many laughs and created lasting memories together. Laughter has a way of bringing people closer and making any experience more enjoyable. In my experience, laughter has been essential in forming and maintaining relationships. It helps to create a sense of connection and joy, making interactions more pleasant and memorable. In conclusion, laughter is a vital component in any relationship, as it fosters a sense of camaraderie and happiness among individuals.
158	20914	8	3	"A lot of people always say that a sense of humor is very important when looking for a significant other, or even a friend. Some people don't realize how much laughter can bring people together! I know now that all it takes is for two people to laugh together to become great friends. My best friends, Rachel and Sarah, became my friends by doing just that. All my life I've gone to small schools with my aunt, Susan. We are only two years apart so we usually can stay within the same school, so I never feel alone. Rachel ended up going to a different school than me. I would have to face school on my own. My freshman year of high school, I was pretty nervous. It was my first time at a huge school, I had just moved and I didn't know anyone, so I was pretty shy. I made my first friend pretty easily during one of my classes; Mrs. Johnson, the teacher, wanted us to have partners, so that we could do a certain exercise together. Rachel and I both chose each other for some reason, I don't know how, but we were drawn to each other. Mrs. Johnson told us we would be doing the ""mirror exercise"". We picked somebody to be the mover, and somebody to be the mirror. Rachel ended up being the mover. I had to follow her movements exactly so that Mrs. Johnson wouldn't be able to tell who the mirror was, but when Rachel started acting like a monkey, we both laughed and Mrs. Johnson even laughed too. During lunch, Rachel introduced me to her friend, Sarah. She claimed to have known her for several years. Sarah and I smiled at each other, we didn't really talk at all. By the time my last class of the day came around, I was ready to go home, because it was a math class, I never really liked math. I came to find that I shared that class with Rachel, we met already, and shared Sarah as a friend, we sat by each other. We still didn't have much to say though. A few days went by and we still didn't really talk, we just awkwardly sat next to one another. Meanwhile, Rachel and I became closer friends, acting out silly skits together in Mrs. Johnson's class laughter was bringing us together, but I didn't really notice, because it wasn't any different then how I've made most of my friends. One day, we had testing in our math class, we had to go to the computer lab. Sarah and I chose computers next to each other, we started our tests silently, same as always. Then, suddenly Rachel turned to me and asked me if I had ever heard the ""Knock Knock"" joke. When I, very startled, replied no, she sang it for me, right there in the middle of the computer lab. When she finished we both started laughing so hard that it hurt. Our teacher warned us to be quiet, and we got back to testing with smiles on our faces. After that moment, everything changed! Like magic, Sarah and I started talking and joking all the time! Rachel noticed the change, she was glad we were getting along so well, but wondered what caused the sudden difference. To this day, Sarah and I share laughs whenever we have the time for it. Even though I am busy with babysitting, school, and my job. While Rachel goes to college, nothing can stop the connection we made that day, through the power of laughter! I have learned that laughter is a top basis for any relationship, but it is not the only one. You also need to have trust. If you can't trust someone, even if they are humorous, that doesn't make them a good friend. You also need a sense of safety. If your friends are encouraging you to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable, they aren't very good friends. I know that Sarah and Rachel are the best friends I will ever have. Laughter brought us together and I know it will keep us together for generations to come!"
159	20915	8	3	"@CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. ""@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her."" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?"" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. ""@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can-tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?"" I asked kicking a rock. ""@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've @CAPS18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself."" @CAPS2 muttered looking away. ""@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way."" I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS9 you reckon that is?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS10 some dead animal."" @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 that I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. ""We're out of jerky, all gone."" @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. ""@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?"" @CAPS2 spatted. ""@CAPS3't know but @CAPS11's pretty big and @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11."" @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from @CAPS11 now. ""@CAPS11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?"" @PERSON3 asked watching every step. ""@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin."" ""@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded."" ""@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine."" @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing @CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, ""I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11,"" @PERSON3 said slowly, I now realizing @CAPS9 that thud was. ""@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep."" ""@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS23."" @CAPS24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. ""@CAPS9 you looking for?"" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2"
160	20916	8	3	Laughter is like feeling alive, where nothing else matters, and the pain in your life is released, giving you the feeling that everything is alright. It can lighten the mood, make tense environments more relaxed, and create unforgettable memories. I have shared many adventures with my friend since third grade, filled with laughter and stories to tell. One particular memory that still makes me laugh until I cry is when we tried to spy on our neighbors as kids. Climbing on a trash can next to a wooden fence turned into a disaster, leaving me with scraped hands and a hilarious story to remember. Through laughter, my friend and I have built a strong friendship, as it has become the main source of connection between us. Laughter helps us navigate through challenges, reflect on our mistakes, and simply be ourselves without any pretense. Without laughter, our adventures and experiences wouldn't be the same, and our friendship wouldn't be as strong. It truly is the shortest distance between two people, bringing joy, bonding, and authenticity to any relationship.
161	20917	8	3	"The comfort of a laugh. Many different kinds of comfort can come from a laugh. My story is the comfort of love. I was a young and foolish teen. A few days ago my friend had me laughing so hard, and all because he slipped up while meeting my mother. He was nervous to meet my mother. For some reason, I started to laugh and he suddenly began to act as if everything was fine, and that there was nothing to be nervous about. Later we went for our walk, and I asked him about it. I simply said, ""Did your mood change when I began to laugh?"" He smiled and replied, ""When you laugh, I feel calm and know that I am going to be alright."" Myself being a typical teen girl, I blushed and quickly changed the topic while trying not to make eye contact. Suddenly, I could not help myself. The feeling of his eyes on my cheek was overpowering my will to not look. Turning my head slowly, sure enough, he was staring straight back into my eyes, his eyes were wonderful, they reminded me of sunflowers with a blue sky behind them. As he stared back, I got a feeling as if he were trying to unlock all that I am, and all that I know with his eyes, as if he could see straight to my soul. Quickly, I turned away. With a soft and almost beautiful voice, he let a little laugh out. This laugh was as sweet to my ears as nectar is to a hummingbird. The next few days were hard. All I could think about was that walk. People must have thought I was crazy, every time I would remember the walk, each time I would remember his laugh, I let a laugh of my own out. I realized that laughter plays a big role in everyone's life. For me, I laugh when I'm with the people I love. For some, it's watching TV that they find amusing, or maybe their kids did something rather silly. So silly, you had to tell your book club. The point is that laughter is everywhere. Laughter is never a bad thing; in fact, it has been proven that laughter has a lot of health benefits. Some people don't get it. Laughter is not something to be ashamed of either, if someone laughs at you, just laugh with them. It's not laughter that starts wars, it's not laughter that kills people, it's people who choose not to fill their lives with the joy of laughter. So here is the goal. Laughter can also be very contagious. So try and pass a laugh on. Do something that makes people remember it, they will start their own laughs. Laughter - pass it on!"
162	20918	8	3	The benefits of laughter are well-known, but let's delve into how laughter can strengthen different types of relationships. In a brotherhood, laughter can create a strong bond and lead to unforgettable moments. Similarly, in a family, laughter can bring members closer together as they reminisce about past experiences and share joyful moments. In a romantic relationship, the ability to make each other laugh can enhance the connection and create a fun and enjoyable dynamic. Lastly, in friendships, the power of laughter can cultivate deep and lasting connections, as people are naturally drawn to those who can bring joy and laughter into their lives. Overall, laughter plays a vital role in fostering strong relationships and creating meaningful connections with others.
163	20919	8	3	Laughter is a unique and special aspect of human relationships. It is not only a sign of good relationships, but also a reflection of personality, love, and care. Each person has a distinct laugh that sets them apart. For example, as we age, our laughs evolve, just like @ORGANIZATION1's distinct laugh. I remember trying to imitate his laugh as a child, and now my own laughter is a defining characteristic of who I am. Others often comment on my laugh, saying it is memorable and unique. Laughter is a powerful way to express emotions and connect with others. Embracing our own laughter, no matter how it sounds, is an important part of being true to ourselves. Embrace your laughter and let it shine, as it is an integral part of who you are.
164	20920	8	3	In my story, I shared three funny pranks that my brother and I pulled on our aunt. The first prank involved pouring chocolate syrup all over her brand new purple suede couch, thinking she loved it more than us. The second prank was when I retaliated by pouring grape soda into her purse after she smacked me in frustration while I was playing video games. Lastly, the most chaotic prank was when my brother and I flooded the bathroom with toilet paper and water from flushing multiple rolls down the toilet, only to be caught by our aunt. Despite the mess we created, our aunt simply told us to clean up, and we spent hours restoring the bathroom back to normal. These pranks may have caused chaos, but they also created hilarious memories that we can now look back on and laugh about.
165	20921	8	3	"Being with family and friends during a memorable trip always seems to spark a smile. There are always times to look back on; whether they are fond memories, or thoughts of nostalgia. I was about to graduate, and my parents had just broke the news to me that we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 after the year was finished. We had the date set; @DATE1, right after school was over. The first reaction out of my mouth was filled with entreatment, wishing for my best friend to join us on this trip. My parents took the time and thoughtfully considered all the advantages and disadvantages, and rapidly responded in the affirmative. I was thrilled to know that the memories I was about to create with my closest family members were now to include my best friend.   First thing was first, I had to get down to business. I needed to call my friend, @PERSON1, and ask her if she'd like to come along. Selfishly assuming that her immediate response would be an exuberant ""@CAPS1!,"" I was @CAPS4 first devastated when she postponed her response and didn'@CAPS6 seem too excited. I didn'@CAPS6 consider the fact that there @MONTH1 have been some sort of miscommunication. She talked it over with her mother, and gave me a call back. I had made the mistake of not telling her that we would have her financially covered for airfare, dining, and hotel rooms. We cleared everything up, and they decided she @CAPS3 join us. The two of us together couldn'@CAPS6 have been more ecstatic if we tried! @PERSON1 and I made a countdown board that started around two months from our departure date. There were many factors that we would take into hand while planning. As we measured out exactly how much time we had, we also planned which landmarks, resorts, and shops we would visit. Our family friend lived in @LOCATION1 @CAPS4 the time, so she gave us a tour of the island. Having such a close acquaintance to guide us made the trip even more fun. She knew all the local hangout spots, and had access to the military beaches because she works in @ORGANIZATION1!    Many humorous occurrences happened often while we were on that vacation, but some of the most memorable moments happened in the hotel while I was with @PERSON1 and my mother. My mom has always had a way to make every situation hilarious, so it was a blast when we went out on a girls night. First, and most significant of our adventures, we went shopping in the mall that was attached to our hotel. There was an abundance of varied small clothing stores, food shops, and jewelry outlets. One of our favorite stores that we visited was a @CAPS6-shirt shop with chocolate infused fabrics! We spent so much time looking @CAPS4 all of the designs, that I think we ended up carrying a wave of cocoa with us for the rest of the night.    As soon as we finished our shopping quest in the town center, we worked our way back up to the room, laughing and involved in pointless girl talk. The three of us girls shuffled with smiles, sore feet, and new bags onto the elegant, ornately designed golden elevator. My mother pushed the button to take us to our floor, while @PERSON1 carried on a story about plans we had the night before. Absorbed in conversation, we hauled our new things down the long hallway to our room. Realizing that we didn'@CAPS6 have a key card to open our room's door, the three of us decided that we should just knock on the door and my father would answer. ""@CAPS2 was supposed to be back from renting our surf boards by now, so why isn'@CAPS2 answering?"" we thought, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS2 still be out on the beach?"" @CAPS4 this point our conversation died down a bit as we tried to figure out what to do. I sent a message to my dad's cell phone, and @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was in the room. We ended up pounding on the door for a good five minutes, assuming @CAPS2 was playing a joke on us by not answering. After waiting a few moments in confused silence, I began to notice a low buzzing voice coming from inside the room. I turned to my mother and best friend, and @CAPS3 barely keep from laughing. It was then that it hit me, and I said to both of them, ""@CAPS5 guys! We didn'@CAPS6 leave a @CAPS6.V. on!"" We immediately halted our intrusion, moved as quickly as we @CAPS3 away from the door, and continued to howl with laughter. My mother had hit the wrong floor button on"
166	20922	8	3	"Emotions are a fundamental aspect of human life, bringing both tears and laughter, which are essential components of our existence. Recently, I had the opportunity to turn a girl's tears into laughter and brighten her day. It all began on the popular teenage platform, ""@CAPS1"", where I noticed the girl I liked was also online. We engaged in typical teenage chatter, and she eventually asked if we could hang out. Eager to spend time with her, I agreed to meet at the library.  Upon seeing her, I noticed she appeared upset, though she was still stunning in my eyes. When I inquired about her mood, she was reluctant to share. Wanting to lift her spirits, I launched into a series of humorous and outlandish topics in the hopes of bringing a smile to her face. To my relief, my efforts paid off, and I succeeded in making her laugh and enjoy herself.  Since that day, we have been in a happy relationship, and I make it a point to say something quirky or random every day to bring a smile to her face. It is incredibly fulfilling to know that I can have a positive impact on her emotions and contribute to her happiness. Embracing the power of laughter and joy, we continue to build a strong and joyful connection together."
167	20923	8	3	The Element of Joy and Laughter  Laughter is a crucial element in a person's life, especially during moments of joy and happiness. It serves as a powerful expression of appreciation and can uplift the spirits of not only the person laughing but also those around them. Different people react to laughter in various ways, influenced by their emotions and personalities. While some may find humor in jokes, others may laugh at mishaps or accidents. Emotions play a significant role in how individuals perceive and respond to laughter, with happiness often serving as a catalyst for joviality.  Jokes, in particular, have the ability to evoke laughter and create memorable moments. From simple puns to elaborate pranks, humor can bring people together and lighten the mood. However, the interpretation of jokes can vary widely among individuals, depending on their sense of humor and personal experiences. What one person finds hilarious, another may not, highlighting the subjective nature of humor.  Accidents, too, can sometimes elicit laughter, albeit in a more complex manner. While some may find amusement in unexpected mishaps, others may view them as unfortunate events. The perception of humor in such situations can vary greatly, underscoring the diverse ways in which people respond to laughter-inducing circumstances.  In essence, laughter is a valuable component of human interaction, fostering connections and spreading joy. By sharing moments of levity with others, individuals can cultivate a positive atmosphere and uplift spirits. So, embrace laughter, cherish the moments of joy, and remember to share a good laugh with friends and loved ones. Laughter truly is the best medicine for the soul.
168	20924	8	3	Laughter can make a situation less uncomfortable, bring two people together, or just show you're having a good time. In my experiences, laughter comes at the best of times. On a typical day at school, I was sitting with my friends at lunchtime, just hanging out and talking about what's going on in our lives, when I noticed a girl sitting all alone. I don't recognize her; she must be a new student. Curious to meet someone new, I walk over to her and make conversation. After a little while, we relax and start to talk about our interests. I remember her saying something funny, and I started to laugh. She begins to laugh at my laugh, as it sounds almost hysterical, and everyone thinks it sounds ridiculous. At that moment, as we're sitting there laughing together, I realize it's bringing us closer despite the fact we had just met. Laughter makes life more enjoyable and happy, knowing that you can share that with someone you have just met or someone you have known your whole life. It's a universal language that everyone should speak. Laughing is healthy and good for the heart.
169	20925	8	3	There was this time during our vacation when there was a lot of snow on the ground. My cousin, brother, and I were all getting together to go out to my grandparents' place for some snowmobiling and a few nights' stay. Despite the delay in getting out due to the late hour, we made the most of it by watching movies until morning. The next day, after a hearty breakfast, we finally ventured out to enjoy the snow. With my grandpa driving the snowmobile, us kids were in for an exhilarating ride, with me ending up looking like a snowman from all the snow flying around. It was a hilarious sight that my grandma couldn't resist capturing on camera. After a full day of snowmobiling, we headed back inside, where I thawed out in front of the heater while sipping on some delicious hot chocolate made by my grandma. It was a fun and memorable day, filled with laughter and unforgettable moments in the winter wonderland.
170	20926	8	3	"We were heading to our first ski race. On either side of me, my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 sat, crammed together in our team van. Our packed bags and ski gear filled the vehicle to the top, along with six other kids, occupying all of the other empty spaces. Our uncomfortable seating arrangements didn't seem to ruin our fun, within five minutes of our road trip, the van exploded with laughter, as @PERSON1, most likely a future comedian started off cracking jokes, just being himself as usual. Within those first five minutes of our drive, I could already tell that this was going to be a ski trip I would always remember.   The van rolled up to the hotel parking lot. My ski team would be lodging here for the long weekend. The sky had turned black with the @TIME1, and me along with everyone else trudged along with weary eyes, exhausted from the long drive. We quickly unloaded our bags, all eager to hop into our beds, needing to be well rested for our first ski race of the season. Shortly after, everyone was soon in bed, knowing that five a.m. would be coming quickly. The sun began rising over the mountains, signaling time to wake up. This was not the case for me. I had been up for nearly an hour, and sat in our van while we sped around each corner up to the mountain. It was race day, and me, along with all of my teammates were all excited for the day coming.  The morning flew by, collecting our bibs at registration, getting our lift tickets, and inspection of the course. I now stood at the top of the hill peering down at the course ahead of me. I had to focus. While I have had a lot of fun, it was time to concentrate, to preform my absolute best. The pressure was on. I now stood in the start gate, my coach stood by my side, and my friends were watching as well, cheering me on. I was hoping not to disappoint. ""@CAPS2 ready,"" the official began in a tense voice, ""@CAPS3!"" I threw my self our of the start gate. I flew by each gate, staying in control and most important, going fast. The wind slid past my aerodynamic body, my ankles and knees rolled with each turn. Everything was going well until I broke over the knoll. My body compressed bringing my knees to my chest, as I skied over the roller, throwing me off balance. I fought to get back up, to regain myself, but I couldn't do it. My skis spun out from under me, causing me to be spit out from the course, landing on my back, sliding down the mountain, hopeless and done for. It was over. I sat in the snow frustrated with my performance. I wanted a second chance that I wasn't going to get. @PERSON1, one of my teammates, came up to me and sat in the snow by my side. My first thought was he was going to say something of a cliche ""nice job,"" or a ""you'll do better next time"". To my surprise he tells me one of his ridiculous jokes. My mouth turns up, trying to contain a laugh, unsuccessful, I burst into laughter. @PERSON1 sits there and smiles at me. Almost immediately I found myself in a better mood. I give him a quick ""thanks,"" with a smile before we both @CAPS3 to watch and cheer on our teammates. Although I didn't do my best, I didn't let my results ruin my weekend. The next day, I skied two solid runs with top finishes, if I had stayed upset with myself, I would have never been able to achieve those results. I came to realize that some days, just a small laugh can be all you need to turn any day around. Laughter, I have found is essential in any situation. It's a connection that can bring anyone closer. For me, laughter changed my personality that day on the mountain. Laughter can mean many different things for many different people, laughter could be a special bond between to people. Laughter can remove the seriousness or competitively in a situation, but also it unites us. Languages are different among people, but everyone understands a what a laugh can do, a laugh is universal."
171	20927	8	3	"The @CAPS1 of Laughter  Laughter seems to be almost the basis of one's relationship with friends, with no laughter, there is no spark of interest in wanting to be someone's friend. When I think of laughter, I think of the times when I go to @ORGANIZATION1. Even if I have had the most horrible day, I know that the girls I play with on that team, who are like a second family to me, can always cheer me up with the things they say or do. The underlying relationship between an @ORGANIZATION1 team becomes unknown to the outside world; no one really knows how much we laugh together, or how much frustration builds up between us. Frustration may get the best of us sometimes, but I can think of a lot more memories where I was laying on the turf field laughing because of a dumb decision of a player, which turned into one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  I remember the first time I had a @ORGANIZATION1 practice, back in second grade. I was playing with many girls who had gone to a different school and I had never seen before. All of the girls decided that they wanted to see who was the best at juggling a @ORGANIZATION1 ball on their knees. It came to my turn to try, and as I went to bump it with my knee, it hit in the wrong spot and came back up to hit me in the nose, leaving it bloody. I had no idea how to react, so I started to laugh. At that moment, a girl I had never seen before started to laugh with me, and came up to give me a tissue. Believe it or not, the girl who gave me a tissue that first day became my best friend and has been ever since. The laughter that occurred that day bridged the gap of distance between us, and since then we have never had an awkward silence wondering what to say or do.  Entering the fall of fourth grade, I had just joined the @ORGANIZATION1 team @ORGANIZATION1, still playing with the same girls, with the exception of a few people. I had no idea what to think of those people or what to say, so I decided not to say anything. We had been playing monkey in the middle, and I was guarding a short blond girl named @CAPS3, who had extremely good talents but was a little clumsy. She started to run for the ball, and to my surprise, the clumsy girl tripped on nothing! Thoughts rushed through my mind - should I laugh? Will she hate me if I do? What if she's actually hurt? Though these thoughts didn't become reality, I went with my instinct and burst with laughter. She rolled over to see who had started laughing at her accidental trip and began laughing as well. After the incident, we got up and started talking, realizing we had gone to the same school but never associated with one another. From that day on, we became inseparable at school and became best friends.  The next story has nothing to do with @ORGANIZATION1, but everything to do with laughter. Though there is no specific story I could tell you that happened between this girl and me, all I can say is she is the one who gave me the first experience of laughing until I cry. I remember her moving to our school, and I was no longer the ""new girl."" At first, I thought she was the weirdest person I had ever met, but as time progressed, I found out that she was one of the funniest people I had ever met. If I had realized beforehand the personality she had, I would have gone up to her in a heartbeat and made friends, instead of hiding behind the crowd. Ever since we became friends, our friendship has been based on how much we laugh together, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  In the end, the person who once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" was absolutely correct. I used these stories above to show that no matter how shy or awkward a person may be, sharing a laugh with a new person is the easiest way to find a best friend. When I was introduced to laughter by these three people, I started to become more social throughout my middle school years and now into my high school career as well. If I lived a life without laughter, I would lose the life I have, and it would be filled with dull memories that are not worth sharing, and to me, that is definitely not worth it. Over the past six years, I have gained three best friends due to laughter, showing that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and is truly a gift to have it."
172	20928	8	3	Laughter plays a significant role in my daily life, bringing joy and emotional expression that words cannot convey. It has been a source of comfort and solution to my problems, highlighting the importance of humor in relationships. When I was away from my boyfriend for a month, our relationship felt strained, but upon reuniting, our laughter brought back the spark and happiness we had been missing. The sound of his laughter was a reminder of our shared joy and closeness, reinforcing the positive impact of laughter on our bond. Laughter truly has the power to dispel sadness and invite happiness, making it an essential element in my relationships and overall well-being.
173	20929	8	3	A couple of months ago, I was hanging out with my friend @CAPS1. It was a @DATE1, and I came to her to spend the @TIME1. At first, we were extremely bored, so we went on a walk to find something to do. We found our friend Dylan at the skatepark and stopped to talk to him for a while. After hanging out there for about two hours, we headed back to her house. When we opened the door, her sister started freaking out because we left her stuck with their younger brother @PERSON1. @CAPS1 didn't yell back; she didn't want the drama. Her sister got even more mad because Jesssika was not showing a reaction to what her sister was doing. Ten minutes later, she exploded, throwing herself around and freaking out. @CAPS1 and I looked at each other and started laughing really hard at how funny her sister looked. After her mom calmed the situation down, @CAPS1 and I made a @CAPS3 bed on her bedroom floor. As we were falling asleep, we burst out in laughter. It was the funniest @TIME1 I have had in a long time. (:
174	20930	8	3	"Living, laughter, love. To this day, I don't remember exactly why I was laughing. All I can remember, vividly, in my mind is the look on my grandfather's face. He had on the same smile he always wore during times of joy. It was a wide warm grin he would shine your way every so often. As I laughed uncontrollably that day, so many years ago, he shined his happiness and love down on me for so long that I will never forget a single wrinkle in his grin. My grandfather, who we all called ""Pops,"" had a way of keeping the peace and happiness in everything. No matter how bad things were within our family, he would always make things right. No one could get angry at Pops, and no one could stay sad when he smiled. That's just the kind of guy he was. Pops was a big part of our family gatherings, just like the one we had on my birthday. That day was our family's last birthday celebration with Pops, soon after, he passed away. When I look back and realize how important that day was, I can see that it was a perfect day for everyone. It was a happy day and my earliest memories of my grandfather were of his great big happy grin shining down on me while I giggled away during a card game.  When that day kicked off, in the early morning, the weather was already proving to be spectacular. Every one in my family was in high spirits and was ready to enjoy the day as a family. My favorite activity during each and every family event is to play my favorite games with everyone. Our family has a few specific games that are a tradition during family gatherings. One of our favorites is called ""Spades."" Now ""Spades"" was one of the many games that my grandfather was very good at playing. He rarely ever lost a game, and would not finish playing until he had won at least once. So when everyone was assembled at our house, I convinced Pops and my cousin to play ""Spades"" with me. We went into the spare room and starting dealing out the cards. About a half an hour later we were still playing, and to no one's surprise, Pops was winning. It was just before the food was ready and we were about halfway through the game when either my cousin, or Pops said something to me that I thought was the funniest thing my tiny 5-year-old ears had ever heard, and I began to laugh.  My family was so thoroughly entertained by my laughter that they could not keep their smiles and laughter tucked away without bursting into giggles as bad as mine. It seemed that my senseless laughing created instant joy to my family, including my grandfather. Pops' smile was one of the greatest things my little eyes looked up at during my childhood. It was something so imaginary, yet so colorful and vivid in front of me, that I would worship his smile like I was seeing my first solar eclipse. I never quite understood, at such a young age what was so fascinating about his smile, but now I do understand. Pops' smile showed true, wholesome, unbreakable joy. His smile didn't come out all too often so when it did, you knew something good was happening.  No one knew that was our last birthday with Pops. I most certainly could not imagine it to be the day I would spend with my grandfather. Everything was so perfect and so increasingly happy, it seemed to be a crime to end his life during such a time of joy. Although if I were him, and if I had to choose my last day, that day would be perfect. My single memory of that day was laughing, and being happy. I can't think of any better way to spend my last bit of time with Pops than a day where we were both completely satisfied in our card game, laughter, and smiles.  Laughter is a funny thing. It is unique in every person, and can range from any kind of humor to pure happiness. Laughter brings hope in times of doubt and never fails to make someone smile. Someone, somewhere started a quote that says, ""Live. Laugh. Love."" I believe those three words can combine together, and act separately to sum up a perfect life for anyone willing to live out the true, meaningful definition of each of those words. Laughter brings smiles of happiness, humor, and love. Love brings us all together, and when we strive to be happy and to love, that is when we can truly live. My grandfather loved each and every one of his family and friends and made a priority of keeping them happy. He lived his life the best way that I believe anyone could ever live it. He died after a life full of love, happiness, and, most importantly, the very special gift of laughter."
175	20931	8	3	"Some people say that laughter is good for the soul, and that could be true, but the soul is definitely not the only thing. Laughing is great for your heart and mind too. It can improve relationships, make friendships grow stronger, and even start making two people who don't know anything about each other, extremely close. You can meet someone new or be with someone you barely know, and just because they make you laugh you feel like you want to get to know them better. I love that feeling. Honestly, you can laugh with any age or gender. You don't both have to be male and female, you could be with a little boy, an elderly lady, or anywhere in between and still have a lot of fun. Last year I never had anything to do, so I decided I should start volunteering places. The two places I could volunteer at were: a daycare next to my house, or an old folks home about 2 miles away. I thought really hard about it, trying to make the best decision for me. I couldn't make up my mind, and even though I didn't admit it, I felt like they would be just as boring as sitting at home. I finally decided I should do both of them, so I could meet some new people, and have new experiences. I started with the daycare. I woke up at 3 am, and walked to the daycare. I wasn't sure what it was going to be like at all. I didn't even know if I was good with kids. I walked in feeling awkward. The manager came up to me and asked me if I could help out with the 4-year-old's coloring room. I nodded my head nervously. Was I supposed to color for them? There's no way they could color a picture by themselves. They're only three! I thought. Oh well, if I follow directions then this day will go by faster. When I went in, all the kids ran up to me with a smile on their face. ""Sit by me!"" one said. ""Color here!"" said another. ""There's a spot right here!"" ""Look at my picture!"" ""I drew a rainbow!"" ""I drew a car!"" ""I drew you!"" With that, I looked down. There I was, on the piece of paper. A bunch of blue and green scribbles. That day was a lot of fun. I was laughing and having a great time with the kids. I learned that I absolutely adore kids, and I'm actually pretty good with them. The next week I went to the nursing home. I was even more nervous there. I felt so out of place. I hadn't found out what I was going to be helping with yet, so I sat in the lobby. When the receptionist asked who I was here to see, I said nobody. She then asked me why I was here, and I replied, oh, I was going to volunteer. She led me down the hall and told me that it was almost time for lunch so I needed to get ready to serve lunch. I did, and then I heard, what I assumed was, the lunch bell. I gave everyone their lunch with a big smile and it was honestly great. If one of them looked a little down, or upset I could flash them a smile and they would grin back, obviously in higher spirits than before. After lunch, I played a few games of chess. Most people who were there took naps after lunch, so there were only three people out there. I played first with a lady who used to be a nurse. I got to know her pretty well in the half-hour we played the game; which I won. Next was a guy who was a veteran. He fought in the Vietnam war. He seemed really nice, but serious. I won that game too. The last man used to be a comedian. He was so funny. He told jokes the whole game! Maybe he said a few too many, because he beat me at chess. Well, that was my excuse. When I got done, I was in a great mood and I couldn't wait to come back again. I learned a lot that day. I found out everyone is alike in some ways, even though each person is unique. I realized you don't have to be the same as the person you're with, to laugh and have a good time. It doesn't matter what age, race, gender, size, mentality, maturity, etc. The only thing that matters is that you are in the same place at the same time, trying to make the best of your day. I am so glad I decided to volunteer, otherwise I would have never known so much about people, love, life, and laughter. Laughing truly does bring people together, regardless of their differences."
176	20932	8	3	Looking back on my early childhood, one thing that stands out bright and shiny in my memory is laughter. Since birth, I have always loved to smile and laugh. I've found a kind of comfort, peace, and confidence through laughter alone, which I doubt I would have been able to find somewhere else naturally. This could, in part, be because of my @CAPS1. We rarely get to see each other because he lives in @LOCATION2 and I live in @LOCATION3, but when we do have the luxury of spending time together, it is always full of laughter, and full of joy. I credit him for giving my my love for laughter. I've been told by my parents that as a baby all my @CAPS1 had to do was laugh, and my eyes brightened and a smile became apparent as wide as the @LOCATION1 on my face. It's been that way ever since. One of my earliest memories I have is laying on my parent's bed listening to my @CAPS1 tell me jokes. Every time he finished I would erupt in laughter, and, at the sight of me laughing, he would burst out too. The important detail to note is, when my @CAPS1 laughs, his belly shakes violently like @ORGANIZATION1. I found this the greatest part of the jokes. Once his belly started bouncing up and down, my laughter became uncontrollable. Our laughter escalated until tears were streaming down our faces. Besides having a belly that bounces when he laughs, my @CAPS1 has one of the most distinctive and contagious laughs one has ever been lucky enough to hear. It's one of those fabulous and enriching laughs which words do not do justice, but once you hear it, you won't ever forget it. His laughter can light up the darkest room in a house. For me, his laugh almost has medicinal healing. Whenever I hear my @CAPS1 laugh, for just a moment, the world stops, and everything within is okay. I am not the only one who has a great appreciation for my @CAPS1's laugh. My father and him both have a love for telling jokes, which I have observed over the years, is one of the few items they hold a common agreement on. Everything from politics, to religion, to who should pay for dinner, usually ends in an argument between them. Because of that, they tend to stay clear of those topics for fear of confrontation. They have never mentioned this, but from my observation over the years, I've come to the conclusion that the laughter they share so often, acts as the glue which keeps their relationship strong. Were it not for laughter, I sometimes wonder if they would still have a working, loving relationship. I will forever be thankful for the great gift my @CAPS1 unknowingly gave me at such a young age. He created a deep and passionate love for laughter inside me, which has gotten me through the roughest times. I truly believe that laughter heals the soul and that when two people share a laugh, they are bonded for a moment in a precious, fragile, and sacred way. My day can be going horribly, and in the instant that a joke is cracked, and laughter overwhelms my body, everything brightens and the worries and stresses of my day seem so minute. Finding humor in every situation is another lesson that my @CAPS1 taught me. If you can find humor, you can find serenity in the most disastrous moments. Laughter, to me, is somewhat like a drug. It's a harmless, enriching, and life-saving drug which I can proudly say I hope to be addicted to for the rest of my life, thanks to my @CAPS1.  As I reflect on my childhood, the memories of laughter and joy shared with my @CAPS1 continue to hold a special place in my heart. Laughter has been a source of comfort and healing for me, thanks to the contagious and distinctive laugh of my @CAPS1. It is through laughter that bonds are strengthened, relationships are maintained, and moments of darkness are illuminated. I am grateful for the gift of laughter that my @CAPS1 has bestowed upon me, and I cherish the moments of shared laughter that have shaped my outlook on life. May the sound of laughter always brighten my days and remind me of the precious connection it brings.
177	20933	8	3	Laughter is an essential element in any relationship, whether it be with friends, romantic partners, or family members. It serves as a vital ingredient that can strengthen bonds and create lasting connections. Without humor, relationships can feel dull and lackluster, making it difficult to truly connect with the other person.   I once experienced a relationship where laughter was absent, and it made me realize the importance of humor in fostering a strong connection. In contrast, I have seen how laughter can bring people together, even in the absence of a traditional friendship. Family relationships, for example, may not always be filled with humor, but they are built on a different kind of connection that can withstand the test of time.   In various situations, such as job interviews, humor can play a crucial role in making a positive impression and forming a connection with others. A good balance of seriousness and laughter can leave a lasting impact and even lead to successful outcomes, like securing a job offer.   Overall, laughter is like water for a plant - essential for growth and vitality in any relationship. It brings joy, happiness, and a sense of closeness that can make any bond stronger and more meaningful. Embracing humor in relationships can lead to greatness and fulfillment, making it a truly marvelous element to have in life.
178	20935	8	3	Laughter is key. You never really think about laughter in importance, but the truth is, laughing brings the most opposite people together. Last year, I met one of my brothers friends in school. We never really talked but she seemed nice. We had a class together and we started talking more and more everyday and she was best friends with my best friend. @PERSON1 was her name and she drove a bright orange @ORGANIZATION1. We hung out after school one day and I leaned the passenger seat all the way back and was sitting on it like a dog and she slammed on the brakes and I flew into the front of the vehicle and I couldn't stop laughing. At that moment I knew we were going to be friends. I was a freshman so I didn't really know anyone and she was always nice to everyone so we started hanging out more. I lived about @NUM1 miles out of town and her brothers went to school about @NUM2 miles past my house so we had to go pick them up. We bought a game called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' and there are tons of little jellbeans that were flavored like vomit, centipede, dirt, rotten egg, etc.. So we were playing while we were driving out there and @CAPS3 had to stop the car nearly @NUM3 times in our @NUM4 mile drive! Those were the nastiest beans ever! Then, we would drive out to my house and we'd listen to our favorite country songs and blast them in her car. She was my ultimate best friend and no one could replace her. Whenever we would get in fights we wouldn't start drama, we'd always have an actual fight because by the time one of us were pinned the other was laughing too hard to do anything about it. Her dad and my dad became friends later on too and we would always have barbeque's and family get togethers. We also talked in a @CAPS4 accent all the time because one of our friends was from @LOCATION1. Whenever we went to @CAPS5 to go shopping we'd use our accent and everywhere we went people would ask us where we were from. Before we knew it our dads started talking like us. We also created a bunch of slang words and then the whole school started using them. She is a great friend and she keeps me laughing everyday. Whenever @PERSON1 was having problems with her family she knew she could always talk to me and I would always be there for her. She always called me sister instead of @CAPS6 because we were so close. She used to take @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 classes at my old high school and when she got the fake baby doll it would keep us up late into the @TIME1, that baby was crazy. @PERSON1 would be a good mom. She always cared for things, even the smallest little thing she would cherish. One time, we painted her little brothers room because we were bored and @PERSON1 was rolling her paintbrush in paint and texting and she took her eye off of her phone and dropped it in the paint. She couldn't find it for like @NUM5 minutes and by the time she did find it it was totally covered in green paint! I laughed at her for so long and those are the moments I wish I could bring back. Everytime we hung out I would laugh and I realize now how important that laughter is to me. About six months ago I moved to a whole different state and I don't see her very often. There is no one like @PERSON1. She could make me laugh and was always just @NUM5 minutes away when I needed something, now I have to drive about @NUM2 hours to even see her. I haven't laughed like she made me ever since I went back to visit. Laughter is key, as I stated before and if you frown, you'll never know who is falling in love with your smile. Laughter truly is the bond that connects us, bringing joy and closeness in the most unexpected moments.
179	20936	8	3	A few years ago, when I was younger, I decided to conduct an experiment on laughter and the colors of clothing people wear. I noticed that I was generally a happy person, laughed a lot, excelled in school, and had a positive attitude, mainly due to my bright and cheerful wardrobe. I hypothesized that individuals who laughed less and wore darker clothes would have a lower mood and attitude.   For a week, I attempted to limit my laughter and gradually transitioned from bright colors to darker shades in my clothing choices. It was challenging to find dark clothes that I liked, as I was accustomed to vibrant colors. As the experiment progressed, I received curious looks from classmates and concerned inquiries from teachers about my unusual behavior. Despite feeling a bit off, I continued with the experiment.  Towards the end of the week, my demeanor noticeably changed, and even my family noticed a difference in my energy levels. I struggled to find joy in everyday interactions and even lashed out at friends, which was uncharacteristic of me. However, when I reintroduced bright colors into my outfit on the final day, I didn't feel any significant shift in my mood.  In my conclusion to the class, I shared that my hypothesis was partially correct. Laughter did have a significant impact on my mood and attitude, but the color of clothing did not seem to influence it. As my teacher cracked a joke, I couldn't help but burst into laughter, signaling a return to my usual cheerful self. It felt liberating to laugh freely once again, reinforcing the power of positivity and joy in our lives.
180	20938	8	3	Laughing is truly a powerful tool that can bring people together and strengthen relationships. In the case of the narrator and their mother, laughter played a crucial role in improving their bond and helping their mother overcome her struggles. By making an effort to bring joy and laughter into someone's life, we can make a significant impact on their well-being and create lasting connections. So, let's remember to laugh more, to spread happiness, and to nurture our relationships through the power of laughter.
181	20939	8	3	Laughter is an essential part of life that brings happiness and joy to people. It is a universal language that can bring people together and create strong bonds. In my family, laughter is encouraged and celebrated. My parents and I share many laughs together, which helps us to connect and enjoy each other's company.  However, laughter is not just important in family relationships, but also in romantic relationships. When my girlfriend and I were going through a rough patch, it was our ability to laugh and have fun together that ultimately brought us back together. We realized that laughter is a key component of a healthy and happy relationship, as it helps to lighten the mood and strengthen the connection between partners.  In life, it is important to embrace laughter and happiness, as they are essential for overall well-being. Without laughter, life would be dull and colorless. Laughter not only brings joy to individuals but also promotes harmony and understanding in relationships. So, let's continue to laugh, smile, and enjoy the simple things in life, as they are the key to a fulfilling and happy existence.
182	20940	8	3	A few years back, my dad and I were watching TV at home when my little sister's friend accidentally ran into a sliding glass door, leaving a slobber mark on it. We couldn't stop laughing at the situation. Later, my brother scared our cat, causing it to jump in the air, leading to more laughter. In the garage, we found an electrical starter and ended up shocking ourselves for amusement. Despite the broken starter and giving away the cat, these funny memories will always bring a smile to our faces.
183	20942	8	3	A laughter is a wondrous gift. It allows your mind and your body to conjoin with others. It is the root of happiness, and brings a sense of sanity to those who have lost hope. When you feel alone in the world with no one at your side, laughter will be there to accompany you. At one point in my life I felt confused and by myself. I was empty. Solitude was the only thing I could have, and the only feeling my mind would register. Just when I had thought that I might be the only person in the whole world, something had come to save me.  I was six years old when they got divorced. I couldn't stand to hear my parents fight. One day we were the perfect family. We would play board games and go to the movies together. Something had changed very quickly. My father grabbed his jacket, told me he loved me and then he was gone. Was I ever going to see him again? Why isn't he living with us? These are questions I kept asking myself. I think i was too young to truly know what was going on. The days were long and I found myself becoming sluggish and glum.  About two weeks after my father had left, some neighbors moved into the house adjacent to me and my mom. One of the neighbors looked young, about my age. I didn't think much of the new people in town. I told myself that people come and go. Nothing lasts forever, and I should expect the worst. One day I was riding my bike and thought that I should stop pedaling and crash into my fence. I hit the metal fence and simply fell over. I heard a laugh and turned around. It was the new neighbor kid. There he was rolling on the ground, grabbing at his sides. He must have thought of my crash as entertainment. I picked up my bike, began to move, then crashed once more. Another series of laughs sprang from this boy. That was the first time I had smiled in a long time. I grew fond of whatever feeling or humor I was giving off to this new kid. I asked the boy his name and he didn't respond; though he did start to laugh again. It was my voice that he was laughing at. Everything I did caused him to become hysterical. I found out later that he was from Mexico and didn't speak a word of English. Over the course of a month or so, I felt the hole in my heart begin to fill. My new companion and his laugh was the start to my new beginning. My mom and I eventually moved out of our house and lost contact with the neighbors. I am always reminded of him when I hear a laugh. Though he's not near me in a physical sense, I am guided by his laughter every day.
184	20943	8	3	Laughter is indeed a powerful medicine that can help lift spirits and bring joy in difficult times. In a recent experience with my mother after her surgery, a simple word-search activity turned into a hilarious moment filled with laughter. As we navigated through the puzzles, making silly comments and jokes along the way, we found ourselves laughing uncontrollably. Even simple misunderstandings or mispronunciations brought tears of laughter to our eyes. These moments of shared laughter not only helped us forget about the pain and discomfort but also created a stronger bond between us. In the end, I am reminded once again that laughter truly is the best medicine, capable of healing not just the body but also the soul.
185	20944	8	3	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was a spontaneous and exciting day filled with adventures and laughter. It all started with a simple text from my friend @PERSON3, and from there, we embarked on a journey that took us to various places around town. From shopping at @ORGANIZATION2 to indulging in delicious food at @CAPS6 @CAPS7, every moment was filled with joy and fun. Meeting up with friends downtown added to the enjoyment of the day, as we shared laughs and created memories together. Our visit to @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS11-topic brought even more excitement, and our impromptu trip to the park turned into a hilarious and memorable experience. As the day came to an end, @PERSON3 and I parted ways, both agreeing that the day was truly epic. It was a day filled with laughter, adventure, and friendship, making it a @CAPS2 to remember.
186	20945	8	3	One day after school, my friends @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 came over to my house and convinced me to put on clothes that I could get dirty in. Reluctantly, I agreed and we all set off to a nearby park. We walked along train tracks, went down a steep hill where I slipped and fell, much to the amusement of my friends. As we continued our adventure, we crossed a log and eventually reached a muddy puddle. Despite being warned that it was deep, I stepped in and got stuck, eventually falling in completely. My friends found this hilarious and couldn't stop laughing. When I couldn't retrieve my boots, @CAPS2 tried to help but ended up falling in as well. After some struggles, we managed to free ourselves and continued on our journey. On our way back, we faced the challenge of climbing back up the steep hill, with some of us slipping and falling multiple times. Eventually, we made it back to my house where we used a hose to wash off all the mud. A playful water fight ensued, with handprints being exchanged between @CAPS2 and me. After getting rinsed off, we all headed inside, still laughing about our muddy adventure.
187	20946	8	3	"Human beings are indeed strange creatures. We constantly seek validation and acceptance from others, yet struggle to truly accept ourselves. Building relationships is a risky endeavor, as we give others the power to either uplift us or tear us down. However, there are key qualities that can help us identify true ""builders"" in our lives - trust and kindness. While kindness may not always lead to immediate friendships, laughter is a universal language that can instantly connect us with others. In a classroom setting, laughter played a crucial role in fostering unity and breaking down barriers between classmates. Through shared moments of joy and amusement, individuals who were once perceived as annoyances became cherished members of a newfound ""family."" It is remarkable how something as simple as laughter can transform our perceptions of others and ourselves, highlighting the power of humor in building strong relationships and fostering a sense of community."
188	20947	8	3	The @CAPS1 of Laughter @CAPS2 brings people closer together in relationships and friendships. Without laughter, the world would be a miserable place. During a vacation with friends, attempts to embarrass one friend led to a hilarious moment when her shorts split in front of her crush. Despite initial anger, laughter eventually brought everyone closer. However, a prank at a party involving pulling down someone's bikini went too far, causing temporary tension. Ultimately, the experience helped solidify the bond between friends, showing the importance of laughter in strengthening relationships. Laughter truly plays a significant role in creating positive connections between people, making it an essential aspect of life.
189	20948	8	3	"During the @CAPS1 break my family went to @LOCATION4 except for my older brother. We were head to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4. The ride there was long but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents house there was already snow! I was very excited. They got about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before we went out to enjoy the snow. Later while I was outside I got a visit from old friends of mine. I hadn't seen them since @DATE1. We talked and hung out. They told me that I was lucky to get out of school early for @CAPS1 break. They still had to got to school. I told them that if they're lucky then they would have to go to school for only half of the week. And they did get lucky. @DATE3 they went to school and the rest of the week they got off because the roads were icy. I was very happy that they got the rest of the week off, now we were able to actually hang out during the break. That night my grandma made us some barbeque chiken, scalloped potatoes, green beans and corn, and rolls. It was really good. I love my grandmas cooking and she's the head chef at the school that she works at. She is an amazing cook! @DATE2 was a very cold day. My friends invited me to go shoot air soft guns. It would me my first time. Being with my friends again was fun. While I was trying to shoot an air soft gun, my friend @PERSON6 told me that I was shooting it wrong. ""@CAPS3 am I shooting it wrong?"" I asked him. He told me that he didn't really know and that I suck at shooting. I reminded him that it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to try to help me aim better. It was very awkward but I was a little frustrated. Sometimes I hate it when people try to help me when I don't want it. And that was one of the time. But he was one of my good friends so it wasn't too bad. When we were done, @PERSON6 asked my to hold onto his air soft gun while he was getting something. He had also told me that the safety was on. So while I was waiting, I was spinning the gun on one of my fingers and somehow I shot him in the back. He freaked out a little bit and asked why I shot him.  ""I didn't mean too. I was spinning the gun on my finger and somehow I shot you! Pluse you said that the safety was on!"" @PERSON6 forgave me and told me that it wasn't my fault because it wasn't. He saw that our friends @NUM1, @PERSON3, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1 were laughing and so was my cousin @PERSON4. @CAPS4 confesed that he was the one that shot @PERSON6 in the back. So @PERSON6 decide that he was going to shoot @CAPS4 back. Then somehow it beacame an all out shooting between all of us. I had lots of fun that day. It's one of my favorite memories when I was there. While I was still in @LOCATION4, my @CAPS5 @DATE4 asked if I can babysit for her. So the next day after lunch I let my little cousin @PERSON2 play in the backyard after he was done eating. My baby cousin @PERSON5 was taking a nap so I told @PERSON2 that we can't be to loud. I decide to go play outside in the snow with him. After we were done we decided to go back into the house. We got locked out. Then I remembered that @TIME1 when my @CAPS5 was still home, @PERSON2 was messing with the lock. So I decided to go around the house and try the front door. It was locked too. @PERSON2 told me that the garage door can open, but he didn't know the code. I felt really stupid. After a couple minutes more we went over to one of their neighbors house so that I can call my @CAPS5 because I didn't have her cell phone number. But the neighbor only had their house number. Then I called my dad so that I can get her number. I told him what happend and he started to laugh. @PERSON5 was still taking her nap so things were still kind of ok. I called my @CAPS5 and we waited until she got home. She told me that it was ok and it happend to her twice while @PERSON5 was taking a nap. She also said that sometimes before she goes outside she takes a key with her of makes sure that the door was unlock. I learned a little lesson that day. But other than"
190	20949	8	3	Laughter is indeed a powerful tool that can bring immense joy and happiness to our lives. It is a universal language that transcends barriers and connects people in a unique way. The ability to make others laugh not only spreads happiness but also strengthens relationships and builds bonds. Laughter is a key ingredient in a fulfilling and successful life, as it helps us navigate through challenges and find light in the darkest of times. So, let's cherish the gift of laughter and spread its magic wherever we go, making the world a brighter and happier place for everyone.
191	20953	8	3	"A while back, I had a friend named @PERSON4. We were best friends; like two peas in a pod. We would hang out everyday, all day @DATE1. One random day we walked up to our other friend @PERSON1's house to see if she could hang out. We all were hanging out all day when @PERSON1 came up with an idea. She wanted both me and @PERSON2 to stay the @TIME1. We stayed out a little past dark and just walked around @CAPS1. We stopped at @LOCATION1's house so she could get her clothes then left to go back to @ORGANIZATION1. On our way there, we stopped, again, at @LOCATION2's house and chilled for a while. We were there for @CAPS9 @NUM1 minutes just laughing @CAPS9 all the crazy stuff that has happened over @DATE1 already! When we were finally giving hugs to go to @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @LOCATION2's older brother, smacked @PERSON1 on her butt and told her it was nice. We made fun of her for the longest time for that! Not to mention how @CAPS3 kept talking @CAPS9 that until he moved to @ORGANIZATION2. When we left, @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 and I were singing to @ORGANIZATION2's new @CAPS5 when some random person stopped and asked for directions. Then I directed him to where he was going and he said, ""@CAPS6 you,"" and drove away. When he had gone, @PERSON4 looked at me and screamed, ""That was the hottest guy I have @CAPS7 seen!"" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 the time we reached the @CAPS10 down the road we saw the guy again. @CAPS8 this time he wasn't so hot. He had a scruffy face and long, brown, straggly hair tied in a ponytail and was dressed like a hobo. I, still to this day, give her crap @CAPS9 it. That was the greatest @TIME1 of @DATE1. We ended up going to the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 to buy some drinks when @PERSON1 started freaking out @CAPS9 losing her @CAPS5. So we all had to retrace our steps all the way back to @LOCATION2's house, hoping we'd find it. Re-retracing our steps, we came across this guy who tried to help us find it. By then it was probably @CAPS9 @NUM1 @CAPS14'clock @LOCATION4. We finally gave up and decided to head back to @ORGANIZATION1. Before We even stepped foot in her front door, her mom comes darting out and starts screaming at @LOCATION3. So her mom took me and @PERSON4 back to my house @CAPS8 by the time I knocked on the door, because it was locked, and everyone was asleep so we had no where to go. So for that @TIME1 @PERSON4 and I were stuck homeless. We walked around all @TIME1. Almost fell asleep in the laundromat when i remembered that my aunt @PERSON3 was looking at a small, white truck for sale in the @CAPS15 parking lot. The truck had a bed in the back, no, i don't know why, and it sounded better than the hard floor of the laundromat so we crawled in. It was a tight squeeze, @CAPS8 we managed. Plus it wreaked of dirty socks and pee. It was, for sure, the worst thing 've @CAPS7 smelled. @CAPS8 no doubt was it the funnest @TIME1 I've had with that girl. Later on, we laughed about our homeless adventure and how we managed to make the best out of a tough situation. It was a memorable experience that brought us even closer as friends."
192	20954	8	3	Being in a relationship can be both fun and challenging. It is important to have trust in each other to build a strong bond. Trust allows you to confide in the other person and feel secure in the relationship. Having good friends who support you and have your back is also crucial. They can help you navigate through difficult situations and enjoy fun times together. Ultimately, being with people who bring joy to your life and make you feel happy is essential for a fulfilling and enjoyable relationship. So, cherish the relationships you have and make the most out of them by creating lasting memories and sharing experiences together.
193	20955	8	3	Everyone laughs differently, some people laugh so hard that they cry, and some don't. But one thing that they have in common is laughter. People use laughter as a way to express their feelings of joy, happiness, or if something is just really funny to them. Laughing is a great way to feel happier about something. Having a good sense of humor can help you get through tough situations, embarrassing things, or just a bad day.  Laughing at yourself and embarrassing moments can help you get over them and not be so embarrassed. Whenever I laugh, I always feel better. Laughing reminds me of all the good things in life, like spending time with friends and family, and all the inside jokes we share.  Some of my best memories involve laughter with my friends, like the time we went to @ORGANIZATION1 before high school started. The car ride was filled with laughter and singing. We even did a fire drill around the car when we got stuck in construction. We made boring moments fun and memorable.  Exploring @ORGANIZATION1 on bikes, we laughed, told jokes, and talked about our excitement for high school. Floating down the river on rafts, we splashed each other and laughed the whole way. Even strangers passing by could see how much fun we were having.  Back at home, we enjoyed a meal together, unable to keep straight faces. Our friendship was evident in how we could just look at each other and laugh, sharing inside jokes and special moments. Laughter truly brings people together and creates lasting memories.
194	20956	8	3	Laughter can indeed play a significant role in building and strengthening relationships. It has the power to uplift spirits, create a sense of connection, and bring joy to those involved. Making someone laugh can break down barriers and help people feel more comfortable with each other. It can also be a powerful tool in diffusing tense situations and turning negative emotions into positive ones. Laughter truly has the ability to bring people closer together and foster a sense of camaraderie. So, next time you find yourself in the company of others, remember the power of laughter in bridging the gap between two people.
195	20957	8	3	Each person filed in, one after the other, making a human train. The metallic red bell chimed once as each person pushed the door slightly more open. Walking in, I was enveloped by the smell of Chinese food and conversations that hummed in my ears. I took a few steps forward and stopped, not knowing where to go. To the right was a wall covered in Chinese symbols and meanings, while to the left were hundreds of tables already filled. Not knowing where to take my place, I turned to my mom. I so badly wanted to plop myself down at one of the adult tables, even if it meant I had to sit there silently. With moms knowing what's best, she shoved me towards the back of the restaurant, telling me to go sit with my cousins. I did as she told me, like always, but made my reluctance clear. Walking over to the table with the speed of a slug and my feet dragging on the floor, I awkwardly stood in front of the circular table. Yanking out one of the chairs, I turned to my mom with a pleading look as desperation filled every fiber of my body, for I knew there was no way she would give in. Staring at these six relatives, I didn't know how I could manage to sit here the rest of the evening. We had all gathered at a Chinese restaurant for my grandpa's 80th birthday. Each of his children had flown from the mainland to Hawaii in order to spend this special moment with him. I hadn't seen these cousins for over two years, and some much longer. I had already visited with them since we'd been in Hawaii, but I hadn't talked to them much, none the less when we were all together and forced to mingle. With my napkin on my lap, I sat and looked at my cousins, each one staring back at me like I was an animal at the zoo. After a moment or two, they seemed to forget I was there because they averted their gaze and began talking amongst themselves. The only person at the table who I didn't feel like a complete stranger towards was my cousin, Sarah. She had wavy brown hair with blindingly blond highlights, sun-kissed from those bright tropical days, along with that brown tanned skin that made me jealous. We began talking, and soon I found myself enjoying the moment. It wasn't until the food came that we actually began interacting as a group. Being teenagers with bland palates, everyone stared as the waiter brought the first dish. After asking the friendly waitress what it was we were about to eat, from her broken English we deciphered that they were buns with duck inside. Frantically trying to get all of the tables served in fairly constant intervals, she left our table and all of us looked at our food blankly. No one wanted to take the first bite. One of my cousins, Michael, stepped up to take the masculine role as the dare devil. We all waited tentatively as he chomped down on the moist bun and swallowed. Once done chewing, he smiled and it seemed this dish had won his approval. Digging into my buns, I began to wonder if maybe these people were easy to relate to and I had made a small thing into a big ordea. From then on, I would just be myself and stop worrying about not having seen anybody for years; All I needed was to be myself. The way the courses were set up left plenty of time to chat between each plate they brought. Since I was no longer worrying about what to say or how to say it, I easily fit into the conversations and began to relax. Shortly after the duck tray was removed from the table, it was discovered that my cousin Michael, who is from Boston, pronounces certain words with an accent. Soon everybody began comparing the way we pronounce things to the way that he does. After each difference we found, we would chuckle. Things carried on like that for the rest of the evening, everyone laughing at things that were only moderately funny, but we found hilarious. It was that evening when I realized, even though you may be uncomfortable around a group of people who you don't know very well, finding a common ground helps you to ease that discomfort. Finding something that you all enjoy talking about may be hard to do, but finding something that makes you laugh is a lot easier. Laughter is something that everyone enjoys and can take part in even if they're not contributing to the conversation. By feeling as though you're a part of what's going on, you feel accepted, and that's all anyone ever wants.
196	20958	8	3	"People say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. A concept I saw to be true was when I met a girl named Sarah. Three years ago I was at a city park swinging, wondering if it would hurt if I jumped. I took a few chances and let go of the swing chains, flying through the air, feeling the unbalanced sensation of falling in my chest. As I hit the ground and struggled to get up, I felt hands on my shoulder and arm. Looking up, I saw a girl - not just any girl, but a gorgeous one. She had green dazzling eyes, flowing hair, and soft, gentle skin.  ""Hi,"" I managed to say. ""Are you okay?""  ""I'm fine, just forgot to stick the landing. Thanks for helping me. Um, what's your name?"" I asked.  ""Sarah, and you're welcome. What's your name?"" she replied with a giggle. We decided to walk around together, stopping at a monkey dome where we asked each other random questions. I learned that Sarah was 12 years old, loved baby blue, and aspired to be a doctor. During our stroll, we shared past memories and personal stories. At one point, she suddenly asked why she felt so happy with me.  ""Well, it could be my charm or just making you laugh,"" I joked.  ""It's definitely the laughter,"" she said between laughs. As a car horn interrupted us, we exchanged goodbyes, knowing we might not see each other again as my family was moving to a new town. Walking back home for the last night in the city, my thoughts lingered on Sarah and how laughter had paved the way to our friendship."
197	20959	8	3	"When a day is qualified as perfect there are a lot of things that go into making it so. Most perfect days in people's teenage years are in the summer beyond the stress of school. My perfect day wasn't in the summer, nor was it on a crazy spring break in Cancun. My perfect day was on a fall day in the middle of October in my freshman year of college. It was on this perfect day that my friendship with my roommate was founded. A friendship that is now the best one of all. A friendship that is based on fun times, memories, story-telling, and laughter. By the end of October, I had spent multiple weekends with my roommate. However, none were as memorable as that weekend in late October. We decided we needed a break from studying and with that said, we set off for a nearby hiking trail. Arriving at the trail was peculiar because I was so far out of my comfort zone. It was also peculiar because I hadn't met a single soul my roommate was about to introduce me to. When I first laid my eyes on her friends, I couldn't fathom how my roommate had met them. She is artistic, creative, outgoing, and adventurous. The friends that shook my hand were into things like painting, photography, and poetry. I didn't think upon first meeting them that opposites could attract or become fond of one another. As the day progressed I found my comfort zone again. As the hours flew by and jokes and laughs were exchanged, I realized just how similar we all really were. I didn't think that all of the silly things we did that October day would matter to me months down the road, but they do. When we were taking pictures in the colorful leaves with silly poses and laughing so hard we cried, I realized just how perfect the situation was. If that day wouldn't have brought smiles to my lips and my mind to its comfort zone, it would have been a day long forgotten. If you go back on every happy memory you have, there is always one common ground. A joke, or even a funny face makes you laugh extremely hard. Every time I walk by that hiking trail I think about the day when the sun was shining and we sat on the rocks exchanging laughs. I think about my roommate and I running through the forest laughing and tripping over our own feet. I think about her friends laughing and pointing as we attempted to climb a tree. After all of the fun activities we were quite wound up. They suggested we take a walk; so we accepted and off we went into the woods. Within five minutes of our departure, we stopped walking. Our walk had put us on a hill covered in fallen leaves. I'm not sure what events lead up to my roommate pushing her friend down the hill. However, I remember her friend pulling another friend down with her. I also recall the others sliding down to join the fun. Watching them play and roll down the hill of leaves was something like watching a scene from a movie. Nobody was on their phones or distracted by technology. Around us was laughter and peace which enveloped us like music. The day had no stress and it had the perfect amount of sunshine. It was like something out of a dream. Once you are in a moment like that, where your own little world is pulling you closer, you never want to leave it. When you're on a laughter high, you disconnect yourself and for a few brief seconds, your life is in its simplest form. You are just you, no racing thoughts, no overwhelming emotions. You are just one person. I never thought that something as simple as laughs could create or strengthen a friendship. On that October day I realized that the laughs shared between my roommate and I would be the first memory of many to come. Every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something I think about when I'm feeling doubtful about the world. It will always be a memory that makes me grateful for being alive. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" On that October day, I wouldn't have believed it, but laughing made me closer with people I would have otherwise overlooked. Laughter and smiles connected my world to my roommate and to the world of her friends. And as of today, that has made all the difference."
198	20962	8	3	Moving to a new place can be a daunting experience, especially when leaving behind familiar faces and surroundings. The thought of never seeing friends and family again can be overwhelming, and the prospect of starting over in a completely different location can be unsettling. The journey to @ORGANIZATION1 was long and tiring, and the initial impression of the new surroundings was less than welcoming. The apartment complex seemed old and overcrowded, and the constant rain only added to the dreariness of the situation. However, amidst the initial discomfort and sense of isolation, a ray of hope emerged in the form of unexpected friendship. Despite feeling out of place and alone, a simple joke sparked laughter and camaraderie with a group of boys in school. In that moment, the sense of alienation began to dissipate, and a new sense of belonging started to take root. It was a reminder that connections can be found in the most unexpected places, and that even in the face of uncertainty, friendship and laughter can pave the way for a brighter future.
199	20963	8	3	"Laughter at its finest. Laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has. Not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also turn your day all the way around. The capability to laugh is of huge importance in this world. Without laughter, days would be dull, sad, and somewhat depressing. When I see someone laugh, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and causes me to laugh along with them. By laughing we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. I have experienced, first hand, the joys laughing can bring after I have had a bad moment, and that is why I believe that laughter is extremely important to have and to keep in your life. Not everyone can have a great day all the time. Bad days occur, and when they do, seeing one funny incident and laughing about it is what can turn the whole day around and make it great. Many people hear the statement, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" or a statement similar to that one and will never agree with it. Often times we will scoff and disagree completely. It turns out that I used to be one of those people myself. Most days were not the best they could be, plus having to go to school all day long ruined it a little more. People kept telling me that if I laughed once in a while then I might feel better more often, and I never actually have fun when I participated throughout the day. I never believed them, and why should I? How could one action as simple as laughing change the way I feel about everyday life? The possibilities were just too unlikely. I didn't think I'd change my views on it either, until a few years ago. It started off like any usual day would, not so great. My hair was a mess, my sister and I could not stop fighting, and my brand new phone broke right as we started our shopping trip to the mall. I had decided that the day was going to be horrible because so far, nothing had worked out well. As the day went on, nothing worse happened, but nothing better did either. My sister and I kept traveling around, going to stores, and shopping. Finally, at our last stop we saw a situation occur. As we were sitting at a stop light, waiting for traffic to move, I spotted a strange man sitting across the road all by himself. The man looked as though he had an injury on his foot, and our suspicions were confirmed when he began walking like a hurt penguin would, barely shuffling his feet and bobbing up and down as he moved forward. The sight of this man made me smile, and when I pointed him out to my sister she started laughing uncontrollably. Then I too, began cracking up. The man with his crazy way of walking had made me laugh had proceeded to turn my entire day around. What I thought was impossible turned out to be the exact opposite, possible. Laughing could bring you closer to others and make your day more amazing. As a result of my trip with my sister that day, my views and beliefs about laughing were changed greatly. Laughter actually was the shortest distance between two people. Even though my little sister and I were arguing before the funny man came, after we were done laughing about him we realized that in the span of a few minutes we had become closer than ever before. It is crazy to think that one incident can change your mind about some of your strong beliefs, but it happened, and that day is now a memory that I am going to keep with me forever. I'm happy it happened because as a result of it I have begun to think differently about laughter and the effect it can have on certain situations in my life. I now think of laughter as one of the greatest pastimes to have and do it quite often."
200	20964	8	3	"It was @DATE1 seventh and I had invited my two best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, to go to my boyfriend's football game with me. It would be the first time for them to meet him since he went to a different high school than we did. Our plan was to get off the bus at my house and then my @CAPS3 would take us to his game later. When we arrived at the end of the lane we started walking up to my house. Then all of the sudden ""ahhhhhh, @CAPS1 my god!"" @PERSON2 and I were both screaming at the top of our lungs, ""@CAPS2 a... ahhhh!"". @PERSON2 and I had almost stepped on a dead snake that was laying in the lane. While this was going on @PERSON1 had no idea what the problem was or why we were screaming. We looked back at her and saw a completely puzzled look on her face which we found absolutely hilarious so we burst out laughing. She soon figured out that we had been startled by the snake and also started in ""you guys are so funny @CAPS2 just a dead snake"". We talked and laughed our way up to my house. @CAPS4 we had caught up a little and I had changed into my boyfriend's #@NUM1 jersey, we went downstairs to eat. We sat down at the table with our bowls of chili and started eating. My @CAPS3 came over and put her bowl down then went back into the kitchen to get something. When she came back she had napkins and another bowl, I playfully ask her ""are you really hungry @CAPS3?"" she said ""no..uh why?"" That's when the girls and I started laughing hysterically again, ""@CAPS3 you have two bowls you are obviously very hungry"" I giggled. She turned a little red and then said back ""well I do love chili, I can't ever seem to get enough of it"" then she laughed a little ""your probably right I should just start with one bowl.""  @CAPS4 we gathered the blankets for the stands we left. On our way up we made a pit stop at the famous @ORGANIZATION1. I was so exited to see my boyfriend and to have my friends come along that coffee was probably not the best idea, but we stopped anyway. While we were in there waiting for our coffee we passed the time by making faces through the nearby window at people who happened to drive by. We were cracking up over the looks people gave us, some looked like @CAPS5 thought it was funny while others looked like @CAPS5 thought we had escaped from a nut house. Soon enough our drinks were ready and we headed out the door. Then as we were walking to the car some guy whistled at us. We hopped in the car and then lost it when we saw that it was some guy who was dressed up in one of those statue of liberty costumes.  We were almost at the school and I was bouncy from the caffeine and excitement mix. My @CAPS3 had never driven to @PERSON3's school before, while my dad had only was busy that night. I was trying to keep calm while giving her directions in a very giggly manner. I started off by saying ""you go straight up here @CAPS3"" the my @CAPS3 and the girls said ""honey you can't go straight up here"". ""yes you can"" I argued then @CAPS4 a while @PERSON1 said ""girl look you could go straight but you ain't gonna see @PERSON3 if you do"". I realized @CAPS5 were right and told my @CAPS3 ""don't turn, just turn right"" she got confused cause I had said the directions wrong so she turned left. I started to freak, screaming ""no no no! we have to turn around I meant right"" @CAPS5 all burst out laughing at me ""man calm down woman, we just have to turn around"" said @PERSON2. We finally got back on track and I tried to give clear directions. I wasn't completely positive where the turn off was for his school so I told my @CAPS3 to go slow, when we passed it and I freaked out again. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS3 we have to turn around"" @CAPS5 all laughed at this and then my @CAPS3 said that she was testing me to see if I could be patient. We all laughed again. When we got there and hopped out to pay and get in. We got there in in time to see the guys come out of the locker room. I got another dose of excitement, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 started to walk away so I could wave at @PERSON3. I pulled on their shirts and"

I remember waking up early and heading to the meeting point where the bus would take us to the outdoor education center. After boarding the bus, we were assigned to cabins, and I was placed in a cabin with seven other students.  I had brought my electronic device with me, but the teachers informed us that we were not allowed to use any devices during the trip. The following day, we engaged in various activities, starting with a delicious lunch of pizza, pizza pockets, and hot dogs. One of the activities involved catching fish and examining them before releasing them back into the water. We also went on a hike through the mountains, where we were fortunate enough to spot some deer grazing peacefully.  After a tiring but fulfilling day, we prepared to head back home. Despite the exhaustion, I felt a sense of accomplishment and enjoyment from participating in the outdoor activities. Outdoor education not only provides students with a break from their daily routines but also offers valuable lessons about nature and teamwork. I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of this memorable field trip.
202	20966	8	3	The laughter of my family is a precious aspect of our lives. Whether we are sharing breakfast, lunch, or dinner, we always find joy in each other's company. During breakfast on the morning of @DATE2, my sister recounted a hilarious incident from her workplace involving a banana and her manager slipping. The image of her boss falling was so comical that we couldn't help but burst into laughter. Later, during lunch at school, my mom shared a funny story about our dog running around frantically after a shower, which had me laughing uncontrollably. Even my brother had a humorous tale to tell during dinner, about walking out of the bathroom with toilet paper stuck to his pants. These moments of laughter and shared stories made our day fly by, filled with joy and light-heartedness. Laughter truly is a vital part of our lives, bringing us closer together and making even the simplest moments memorable.
203	20967	8	3	I was raised with two brothers who mean the world to me, until my baby sister was welcomed into the world in the year @DATE1. I am the second of seven kids, and most of my family members have passed away. It's been a long four years being away from family, missing funerals, and not being able to cry at the ones I did attend. The only funeral I cried at was my mother's in the year @DATE2. She didn't want my brothers, my baby sister, and me to be separated, but circumstances led to us being split up. I haven't been able to watch my little sister grow up or see my brothers start their own families. I miss the times when it was just my brothers and me, having fun in @LOCATION1, before things changed. Despite the challenges, I hold on to memories like the time my brothers and I decided to cut each other's hair, resulting in a funny mishap that my mom discovered later. These moments remind me of the importance of family and the need to protect them from harm. As a sixteen-year-old girl, I cherish these memories and hold them close to my heart.
204	20968	8	3	Laughing is the key to happiness and can create lasting memories with loved ones. I remember a time when my dad and I were arguing, and laughter helped us overcome our differences. Despite being upset about my grades, a shared moment of laughter during a family gathering brought us closer together. This experience not only strengthened our relationship but also created a special connection that we continue to share. Laughing has the power to change perspectives, bring people closer, and make life more meaningful. It is important to always find reasons to laugh and cherish those moments as they can have a lasting impact on our happiness and relationships.
205	20971	8	3	"@CAPS8 families @DATE1 in @LOCATION1 was one of exploration, but also one in which we came to regret our move from @LOCATION3 a little. We missed our friends, our connections, but also places. The place @CAPS8 brother and I came to miss second only to our farm was a @CAPS3 we had dubbed ""The @CAPS1, @CAPS1 @CAPS3."" The place itself was a dump. Close to a dairy farm, it reeked of cow pats mixed with cigarettes. I remember that the grass was perpetually dry, and the bridge crossing the @CAPS3 was continually squeaking; it was an old, covered bridge, and on its last leg. So, it wasn't so much the place we missed, but the happy memories associated with our special place. On one particularly mopey day, our father roused us from our rooms, saying that we were going to explore a new @CAPS3. We knew about @CAPS4's adventures; we called them ""@CAPS4-ventures"" because they were truly one of a kind. Most of the time, we ended up miles away from any civilization and stuck in the car with our lunch out of reach. Even at our young ages, we had come to be wary of ""@CAPS4-ventures."" @CAPS7, our mother was able to rouse @CAPS8 brother and I, and we were soon hustled into the car. During the trip, our father was unbearably cheerful. While @CAPS8 brother and I were in the back of the car, pining for our nice, comfortable rooms, @CAPS8 father had the audacity to laugh along to the radio, and open the windows of the car to our protests. Riding with @CAPS8 brother and I in the back were two circular lumps of rubber that had been inflated. I would soon learn that these were called inner tubes, and could be used to drift down the @CAPS3. After what seemed like hours on the road, we arrived at a place called ""@LOCATION2 bend."" @CAPS8 brother and I jumped out of the car, and were met with pristine beauty. Covered in shade, the @CAPS3 flowed noisily, and we could hear it although we were not that close to the @CAPS3 bank. The grass was green and velvety beneath our feet, and the smell of fresh water welling up from the earth was delicious. The light filtered down through the trees and had a crystalline effect on the water. @CAPS8 brother and I hurriedly dressed into our swimsuits, while @CAPS8 father began to cart our food and supplies down the the @CAPS3 bank where we would be spending the day. As soon as we finished dressing, @CAPS8 brother and I chased after him, for the day was warm and the water looked good and cool. When our hunger had been sated, it was time to pull out the inner tubes. The water was nice and fast, with some white water and a very little water fall at the end. Being a rather petite child for @CAPS8 age, even these small obstacles looked like the most insidious of rapids, and they made @CAPS8 eyes widen a little. @CAPS7, I managed to steady myself, and prepared to get wet. At @DATE1, I hung on to @CAPS8 inner tube with clutched fingers and wild eyes, but gradually, I relaxed. I let @CAPS8 hand drift out to causally trail behind me in the water, drawing circles as the sunlight filtered down through the trees. As the water grew faster, I began to feel apprehensive again. I drew sharp, quick breaths as the little waterfall approached me. In reality, it was only about four feet tall, but in @CAPS8 panicked haze, those four feet looked like twelve feet. The white water was suddenly upon me, accompanied by a large and frightful shriek I gave. Somehow, I managed to stay afloat, and @CAPS8 ride left me smiling. I broke into long peals of laughter, laughing away all @CAPS8 homesickness and heartsickness. @CAPS8 brother came down the waterfall, spluttering and giggling, and we laughed together. Our laughter healed us, and for the @DATE1 time since the move, we felt totally and completely at home."
206	20972	8	3	Falling in love was easy with you. The moment I realized I loved you, everything about you seemed to shine and sparkle. We had so much fun together, and I couldn't imagine my life without you. People noticed how happy I was when I was with you, and that happiness was a result of the love we shared. Our laughter was contagious, and it brought us even closer together. Laughing with someone and being able to be yourself is truly magical and helps strengthen a relationship. My brother and I share a similar bond of laughter, and it's something that keeps us close. Laughter is not only enjoyable but also a great stress reliever, as my health teacher once told me. It's amazing how something as simple as laughter can bring people together and create lasting relationships.
207	20973	8	3	Laughter is a vital component of any relationship, whether it be with a friend, family member, or romantic partner. It has the power to alleviate stress and bring people closer together. However, it is also important to strike a balance between laughter and seriousness in order to maintain a strong and healthy relationship. This lesson became evident in my friendship with Olivia.  Olivia and I had always shared a close bond filled with laughter and inside jokes. But as we entered middle school, we encountered new challenges that strained our relationship. Instead of addressing our issues, we chose to mask them with humor, causing unresolved resentment to build between us. Our once inseparable friendship began to falter as we drifted apart.  Despite both of us noticing the change, we struggled to mend our fractured relationship. Apologies and superficial conversations were not enough to bridge the growing divide between us. The distance between us only widened, and it became easier to avoid each other rather than confront the underlying issues.  However, a breakthrough came during a week-long stay at Olivia's house, where she finally confronted me about our dwindling friendship. We had a heart-to-heart conversation, laying bare our feelings and grievances. It was uncomfortable at first, but ultimately, it allowed us to address the root causes of our discord and move past them.  Since that pivotal moment, our friendship has only grown stronger. I have learned the importance of open communication and vulnerability in relationships, realizing that while laughter is crucial, so is the ability to be serious and address difficult emotions. Olivia's courage to initiate that conversation has not only deepened our bond but has also taught me valuable lessons that I carry with me in all my relationships.  In conclusion, laughter is a cornerstone of a strong friendship, but the willingness to be serious and confront challenges is equally essential. Through navigating the ups and downs of my friendship with Olivia, I have come to appreciate the delicate balance between humor and sincerity in fostering meaningful connections with others. I am grateful to have a best friend like Olivia who has shown me the importance of both laughter and seriousness in sustaining a healthy relationship.
208	20974	8	3	Laughter is an essential component in building relationships, whether it be with family, friends, or strangers. It serves as a bridge that connects individuals, fosters a sense of joy and happiness, and creates an atmosphere of unity. Without laughter, the world would be a dull and somber place, devoid of warmth and connection.  In a recent experience on a missions trip to a small town, laughter played a crucial role in establishing rapport with the children we were reaching out to. By approaching them with smiles and laughter, we were able to break down barriers and show them love and kindness. The impact of laughter was evident in the children's faces, as their eyes lit up with joy and excitement.  Similarly, within families, laughter is a sign of closeness and unity. It signifies understanding, respect, and a shared bond. Whether it's sharing a meal together or enjoying a fun activity, laughter brings families closer and creates lasting memories.  In personal relationships, laughter can also play a significant role. My cousin's story of meeting his wife is a testament to how laughter can spark a connection and lead to meaningful relationships. The simple act of sharing a laugh can open doors to new possibilities and shape the course of our lives.  Ultimately, laughter is a powerful tool that can uplift spirits, bring people together, and create a sense of belonging. It is a universal language that transcends barriers and spreads joy wherever it goes. So, let us cherish the gift of laughter and embrace its ability to brighten our lives and those around us.
209	20975	8	3	"Laughter is a part of life. It can help bring people together or even tear them apart if it is in bad taste. There was a time when me and my cousin @PERSON1 did not really like each other but I had to stay at his house because my mom was out of town. After that night we were closer then brothers and there is one huge funny tale behind it. I was really reluctant to even go over there that night. But my mom told me to stop complaining and to just try to have fun. When I got there we pretty much just watched @LOCATION1 in awkward silence. Then his parents informed us that they were going out and that they would not be home until it was very late. About ten minutes after they left my cousin @PERSON1 turns to me and says ""you want to do something really fun."" @CAPS1 I was at the young age of thirteen years old a could not help but to be interested. So I asked him what this fun thing was and he told me it was a surprise. We left his house and cut through his field to the wall of blackberry bushes that surrounds his field and he showed me a little path through a certain spot. After we got through the bushes we ended up on a gravel road that led to a house that had a lot of land surrounding it. And on the land were what my cousin identified as fainting goats, I had no idea what fainting goats were. So my cousin said he should just show me what they are and what they do. @PERSON1 walked right up to these goats and made a sudden noise, about a quarter of them just fell over stiffened and unmoving. I was roaring with laughter at the fact that these goats fainted when they got scared. We spent about forty five minutes scaring them and watching them faint. No matter how many times we did it, we found it no less amusing then the first time. The funniest thing by far that happened that night, started off when @PERSON1 informed me that he brought an @NUM1 firework. We put it in the middle of where all the goats had flocked to and lit it. It went off and the bang that was as loud as a gunshot. As one entity the goats all collapsed and we were doubled up with laughter, that is until the people in the house came out side. We ran like our life's depended on it, we flew down the road through the blackberry path, trough the field and straight into @PERSON1's house. We sat down on the couch then we looked at each other, we burst out laughing, my ribs were aching from it, I was light headed with laughter. His parents got home about a minute after we calmed down which we also found extremely funny. As soon as they went to bed we burst into silent giggles. That was one of the funnest times I've had with my cousin and even tough we did not like each other before hand, we ended up becoming brothers in all but blood, but we were cousins so maybe even a little bit by blood but mostly brothers in laughter. Laughter truly has the power to bring people together and create lasting bonds."
210	20976	8	3	"Laughter is an amazing thing. Laughter is bilingual. It does not need to be translated or looked up in a dictionary. It is the one form of communication that we all know and understand. Laughter has no boundary. @CAPS5 was the most taciturn girl in the whole school. In the mornings and during lunch, @CAPS5 would hide in the shadows hoping not to be seen by the world. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 asked @CAPS8 what @CAPS5 wanted to be, @CAPS5 would say invisible. People passed @CAPS8 by without even a glance, thinking if I don't see @CAPS8 then @CAPS5 can't be there. My heart was sad for the poor girl because I knew @CAPS5 needed a friend. However, how would I approach @CAPS8? Would @CAPS5 think that I was insane? I knew there had to be someway to get @CAPS8 to talk, or at least smile. As I walked into school the next day, the hallway was filled with the same hullabaloo as always. Paper airplanes flying one direction and mouths going off in another. I was used to being shoved around and dodging things on my way to class. It was just the fun journey of getting to your next period. Finally, as me and my gawky self made it to fourth period, I sat down and began to look for a pencil. As I did so, I noticed someone pulling out a chair next to me and sitting down. It was the girl! I didn't even know @CAPS5 had this class with me, let alone sit right next to me. I began to be overwhelmed with joy, knowing that this could be my chance. Furthermore, I began thinking of ways I could start a conversation with @CAPS8. I noticed a picture on the front of @CAPS8 binder that someone had drawn. At the bottom was @CAPS8 signature. I asked @CAPS8 if @CAPS5 had drawn that picture. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said in a very quiet voice. My heart was pounding, almost breaking free from my chest. I knew I had to say something more. ""@CAPS2,"" I began, ""I believe you are a very good artist. Do you have any other pictures?"" ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said again, ""however, they are all at home."" ""Is there any possible way that I could be able to see these other pictures of yours?"" I said happily. ""@CAPS4 if you would like, you are more than welcome to come over to my house after school today and see them,"" @CAPS5 said in a very joyful voice. ""I would be honored,"" I said. As we ended the conversation, the teacher began her lesson. @CAPS5 was really a nice girl, I thought to myself. I couldn't wait until the end of the day. When the school day came to a close, we met each other in the foyer. I could tell that @CAPS5 was very excited. I was excited as well, because I knew that @CAPS5 was finally feeling confident with herself; like a baby bird flying away from its nest for the first time. We drove over to @CAPS8 house in my mighty mule of a truck. I became very nervous as we walked to the front door. As @CAPS5 opened it, my pounding heart flew from my chest. The house was absolutely beautiful. It smelled of fresh baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I could not believe what was before my eyes. My mind couldn't make sense of it all. @CAPS8 mother yelled from the other room, ""is that you sweetie?"" ""@CAPS1 mother,"" @CAPS5 said back, ""I have a friend over."" ""Great!"" @CAPS8 mother exclaimed. We enjoyed some cookies and milk with @CAPS8 mother and then we went up to @CAPS8 room. @CAPS8 room was filled with so many beautiful drawings that @CAPS5 had done. @CAPS5 told me that there was a story behind each one of them that inspired her to draw it. @CAPS5 asked me if I have ever drawn a picture before. ""@CAPS9,"" I said, ""I am what they call challenged in the world of art."" We both began to laugh; however, we both began drawing a picture. In the midst of it all, I looked over at @CAPS8 picture. It was a beautiful drawing of a fairytale world filled with castles and dragons. Then, @CAPS5 looked at my picture. It was a failed attempt of drawing a simple sunset with clouds and birds. We looked at each other and"
211	20977	8	3	"""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" a quote that resonates with everyone at school. Laughter has a way of bringing people closer together and brightening their lives. It's a universal language that transcends differences and creates a sense of connection. Personally, I've always been drawn to people who have a good sense of humor. I believe that a shared laugh can strengthen bonds and make relationships more enjoyable.   I remember the first time I met my boyfriend. Despite our differences, he had a way of making me smile and laugh effortlessly. His sense of humor and cute smile instantly caught my attention. As we got to know each other, I realized that he was someone who could always lift my spirits and bring sunshine into my life.   One particular memory that stands out is when we attended a football game together. Even though we weren't officially dating at the time, he showed up with a fluffy stuffed animal, knowing my love for them. As we walked around the track, I tripped and he caught me, whispering reassuring words that made me blush. Looking back, that moment of clumsiness and laughter only brought us closer together.   In any relationship, whether romantic or platonic, having someone who can make you laugh is invaluable. Laughter not only creates joy in the moment but also serves as a reminder of the bond shared. It's through laughter that we can navigate through awkward silences and forge connections that last a lifetime.   So, the next time you meet someone new, remember the power of laughter. A shared joke or a funny memory can break the ice and pave the way for meaningful relationships. Because ultimately, being able to make someone smile is a gift that keeps on giving. Laugh often, cherish those who bring laughter into your life, and never underestimate the magic of a good giggle."
212	20979	8	3	My mom always says laughter is the greatest medicine, and it is true for me. Whenever I am sick or hurt, I always laugh at a great joke, and it makes me feel a little better. When my family goes on a long trip, we always make jokes and tease each other, making the journey feel shorter. Laughter brings people together, whether they are family, friends, or even enemies. It adds fun to life and can create new friendships and strengthen existing ones. I remember a snowy day when I organized a snowball fight and capture the flag game with my neighbors. We laughed so hard that day, and I got to know my neighbor better. Laughter truly has the power to bring people closer and create lasting bonds.
213	20981	8	3	"My cousin @PERSON1 and I are constantly sick with laughter, he is the funniest person I know. He is hilarious when he isn't trying to be. I believe that is why he is so @NUM1king funny. @PERSON1 is a hardcore alcoholic, he is always drunk or drinking. On the rare occasion that he is doing neither of those two options, he is the dullest, most depressed, angry unfunny man around. Give him a drink or two and watch him turn into funtime @CAPS1. @PERSON1 and I have great grand wonderous times when there is an alcoholic beverage in or near his hands. @CAPS5 is sort of an awe inspiring thing to see this transformation take place. He starts as this sad, depressed, sober caged sociopath lion at the zoo with so many of society's judgemental, sour souled, pittiful excuses for men and women pointing, laughing and sobbing over this poor lion. When one of these ""people"" throw a beer his way he'll catch @CAPS5 in his fierce, angry teeth and devour a @NUM2 oz tallboy of @CAPS2 in mere seconds-- can and all! He then stands up on his gigantic feline paws and let out an amazingly deep vibrato of a purr. His big, ferocious cat teeth then smile like a @LOCATION1 lion, as his sick, beastly, blood stained fur slowly morphs into the scaley, scarred skin of a man. As he is standing there with a goofy idiotic sh!t eating grin he shouts ""I @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @PERSON1!!"" @CAPS5 really is an amazing thing, I have seen @CAPS5 so many times and I absolutely @CAPS6 find a single word to desribe this marvelous reconstruction of a living creature. Then with drinks in hand we will continue to have a great night of unknown comical amusements. I guess you could say laughter is a large part of our relationship.  Laughter truly is the bond that holds us together, transforming even the darkest moments into moments of joy and connection."
214	20982	8	3	One day my friends and I went to a friends house and we started playing Xbox, we were laughing having an awesome time. My friend started telling jokes and all my friends started laughing hysterically. My friend was drinking milk at that time and he laughed so hard that milk started coming out of his nose, that was also funny but gross at the same time. Another friend was the sad one of the whole group that was there, we all asked him, why was he so sad. He answered that he heard that his girlfriend wanted to break up with him. So he asked us how to keep her interested, and we said that he should tell her some jokes to make her laugh. He said that he would think about it. The sad friend was a real funny person and a blast to hang out with, so we didn't really worry about it so much, we thought that everything would be fine. So after all that, he left and we started hanging out in my friend's living room. We were hanging out and just talking about who was the hottest girl at school. An hour passed and the sad friend came back. He came and sat with us and yelled it didn't work man, I was like okay calm down, what happened?. He said, she didn't think it was funny she thought that he was being dumb and just plain silly. Oh did she really say silly that's not a word I thought she knew, everyone laughed, no I was just messing with you man don't get mad come on now. So he left after he yelled at me, he left and all of us guys started laughing I thought that he was just but hurt and he would get over it. An hour passed and my phone started ringing and I looked who's calling and it was his ex-girlfriend. Surprised I answered and I told her that he wasn't with us that I would tell him to call her later, I said that because he would use my phone to talk to her, but then she replied that she wanted to talk to me so I was like okay so we started talking and she is telling me that she likes me... I started cracking up in laughter. She got all sad and mad at me because of me laughing. But I told her that it was cool that she did so I told her I have to go and we hung up... I couldn't help myself I started cracking up again and so that's how my day ended in laughter and it was like that all day.

In the middle of the floor was a @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 cousin @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was inside the @CAPS2. At first, we tried to convince @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was outside talking to @CAPS3 uncle, but @ORGANIZATION2 was convinced he was in the @CAPS2. After poking around, @ORGANIZATION2 opened the @CAPS2, only to find it empty. @CAPS3 dad walked in and we all laughed at the misunderstanding. Later on, @CAPS3 dad decided to play a prank on @ORGANIZATION2 by hiding in the @CAPS2 and scaring him, leading to more laughter and bonding between them.

219	20988	8	3	"What's Laughter if not a smile, a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, a awkward situation or just about anything. Laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship. I'm going to tell @CAPS5 a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own. It was my first day of high school, I walked in the school looking down at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them and smile or if I should just keep to myself, so I said nothing. I went to the office and I asked them how to find drama class, they give me a map that I had no idea how to read and sent me off. By this time I was scared. A tall @CAPS1 guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me and instead of an ""I'm sorry"" or even a polite ""@CAPS2 me"" he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway. It took me some time but I finally found my drama class. The teacher wasn't nice to me, it seemed like she hated everyone. She was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair. Her name was @PERSON1 and she is not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me and she looked just as scared as I felt. During the first @NUM1 minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing. About half way through the class the girl next to me asked my name, I replied ""@CAPS3"" extremely quietly. As I went to turn away she grabbed my attention by whispering to me, she chuckled ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 see what she's wearing? What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?"" I started laughing hysterically. The large teacher lurking in front of me said ""@CAPS5 two, hallway, now!"" I didn't know if laughing was an option but as soon as I stepped out of that door a grin crossed my face and I fell on the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong I didn't think us getting into trouble was funny but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice, or so I thought. The next class period I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back, next to @CAPS6. @PERSON1 was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw up, a pair of light blue skinny jean that did not flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink @NUM2 inch high heels. Today she was in a great mood, @CAPS5 could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot @DATE1 day. We would all laugh behind her back but that's the way we got through her class alive. After a few minutes of talking she sent us off to @CAPS4 our first scene. The people in my group were @CAPS6, my friend @CAPS8 who I had met in algebra the day before and a girl I didn't know named @ORGANIZATION1'montae. We all got to know each other quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was @CAPS9 @CAPS10 as was @CAPS8. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was taller than me by about @NUM3 inches. She had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs. She was stunningly pretty. @CAPS8 was a quiet, @CAPS4 it alone type of person. She was about @NUM4 inches shorter then me and she had short black hair. It was straight, as I would quickly learn it always was. She was stylish, she had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a @CAPS12 jacket. Her whole outfit screamed adorable. We laughed the whole time, making fun of the teacher and telling jokes. We got barely any work done. That was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them and often we talk about that day, and how glad we are that we met. So, as @CAPS5 can see laughing is a big part of my relationships. Its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even when @CAPS5 barely know someone @CAPS5 can quickly find out that laughing"
220	20992	8	3	So many people focus on sad and depressing events in life, constantly seeking pity and wanting to have the worst story. But if we shift our perspective and appreciate the little things, we'll realize how much we truly have. Choosing to go with the flow and find humor in situations can make life more lighthearted and enjoyable. Instead of dwelling on canceled events or feeling lonely, we can make the most out of every situation and find joy in unexpected moments with friends. It's important to remember that a smile is more powerful than a frown, and laughter can truly make us stronger and help us live longer. By embracing positivity and finding humor in life's challenges, we can create a happier and more fulfilling existence.
221	20993	8	3	"Many have heard that laughing makes you live longer. I don't know if this is true but I can believe it. When I laugh I feel lighter, my stress load lightens, and I am able to see the world with different eyes. This change in myself is more evident sometimes than others, such as if before the miracle of laughter I was feeling overworked, worn out, or sad. It is my belief that having people to make you laugh is essential to living a fulfilling life, and I am grateful that my days are filled with great friends and funny memories. One of the things that must be present in any relationship is humor; you must be able to make each other laugh. I have had multiple times with my two best friends, when we simply couldn't stop laughing. I deeply cherish all the time we spend alone together because I know that I will leave feeling happy, with a smile on my face, with many good stories to tell. One of these occasions was my best friend's birthday party the year before last. She wanted a small party with just the people closest to her there, so she and I were the only ones invited. We live in a tiny, cute town, however, there isn't much to do in the area of parties. Because of this, everyone ends up going to the nearby river, just half an hour away. It was a blistering summer day and we wanted to show off our tans, so of course we started her party off with a float on the meandering river. That's when the laughing began. Three twelve year old girls drifting down a river by themselves with a giant beach ball (early birthday present) that was promptly dubbed ""Wilson"", what could be so funny? One of the things that makes our friendship so important to preserve is how we find humor in every situation when we are together. They thought it was hilarious that I have an irrational fear of seaweed and that I would yelp or full out scream every time that some touched me. I thought it was fantastic that my friend just couldn't hold on to her sandals, she would end up making wild dives for them as they floated away. We both thought the way our other friend, the diva that she is, was reluctant to get wet was preposterous. So, naturally, we pushed her in numerous times. These are the things that make our relationship so special. We can be serious for each other when needed, and no one will disrespect my friends and get away with it, but when we are together, I can let my guard down and can be myself. My goofy, irrational, apparently hilarious self, and still have fun. Our laughter can even change how a situation is going to progress. For example, after we were done on the river, we all went to a local park for an afternoon of music and food. We all got enormous ice cream cones, the best money can buy. My friends had already finished theirs, and were playing with ""Wilson"" a few yards away. I was just about to take another heavenly lick of my waffle cone when the beach ball flies over and knocks all the ice cream right out of my cone! I was left with a completely intact cone, but all of the good stuff was on the ground. Needless to say, I was devastated. Who knows what would have happened if we hadn't started laughing. Maybe I would have teared up, or sulked for an hour or two. However, my face was just so comical, staring in disbelief at the empty cone, that they just couldn't help but laugh. They fell on the grass, in hysterics. Even through my disappointment I started cracking up as well, and then everything seemed okay. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people, or three in my case. My two best friends make me laugh like no other people I have ever met, and I suspect I will never meet anyone else that makes me feel as they do. This laughter we have makes us feel better. It helps us relax and let our guard down, so the times after we laugh together is often when we confide in each other the most. If one of us is feeling down, or is under the weather, laughter is the sure fire way to get them back on their feet and smiling. Even simply being with them makes me feel more exuberant, lets me abandon my troubles. This is why laughter is so important to the the three of us. Whenever we laugh, our relationship builds. It is the good times we have had that help us through the bad times, and I know that our good times wouldn't have been so good were it not for the way we can laugh together."
222	20994	8	3	"The @CAPS1 of Laughter  Many people think it is love that brings people together. But love is something that develops over time and brings people closer in the long run. Before you've ever loved someone though, you've laughed with them. Laughter creates conversation, mends relationships, and brings joy to people. Its an important part of any relationship and has certainly helped me make friends.  In the kindergarten, everything was new to me. I got to leave my house, go to school, eat lunch, and go to recess. There were many children just like me, bouncing with excitement as our daily routine started. Although we played together at school, at home there was no one around to play with.  One day after school, I noticed a boy walking around next to my yard. I walked over and remembered him from that school day in my classroom. ""@CAPS2"", was all I said. He turned around, and with all his might, burped as loud as he could. We fell into a fit of laughter and I knew I'd made a new friend that day. From then on, him and I were best friends. Any adventure that happened after school always ended with us laughing about something. There was no need for our parents to set up any ""playdates"" or scheduled time to meet other children because it was easier to laugh at something and make a friend naturally, not awkwardly while the parents chatted. From then on, making friends was a piece of cake.  Through grade school and well into my teenage years, I had a best friend and a lot more friends, solely, because of a moment of laughter. Laughing is something that can always ""break the ice"". Whenever you meet someone new, it's always kind of hard to just talk to them. You don't know whether to be serious, outgoing, funny, or quiet. But if something happens that makes both of you laugh, then it becomes easier to communicate because that laughter eases some of the tension in between. It's like riding a bike, after the initial awkwardness, things just get easier and easier.  For many, laughter helps heal pain. Tragic things happen in every person's life and it can be hard to deal with at times. Whether it's a breakup, a depressive mood, or maybe even a death of a loved one, something funny and a laugh can help them get their mind off of whatever is bothering them. Most of them time that's all a person wants, something to help them forget whatever troubles them, if only for a few minutes. It's how people build better relationships, they do whatever they can for each other to make each other feel better.  Besides its healing and conversation starting qualities, laughing is simply fun to do. It can start out as a small giggle, turn into a chuckle, and end up as a fifteen minute session of raging, side cramping laughter. And most of the time, you're with friends so they're enjoying the moment of fun and happiness right along with you.  If you've never laughed once in your life, there's something wrong. It will eliminate awkward moments, relieve painful thoughts or feelings, and create instant fun. Just try it, it's not that hard. I guarantee that it will bring you closer to someone, make life less stressful, and make you happy."
223	20996	8	3	When I was younger, my sister and I would constantly fight, whether it be verbally or physically. Our arguments would drag on for hours, causing tension within our family. With only a few months between us, the rivalry seemed to intensify. My mom tried various tactics to make us stop, from grounding us to giving us extra chores. However, the most effective method was making us sit face to face, holding hands in a criss-cross applesauce position. Despite initially hating this, the forced closeness would often lead to laughter, helping us forget our disagreements. This laughter brought us closer together, allowing us to move past our fights with a hug and a renewed bond.
224	20998	8	3	"Life is so uncertain, unfair, and unforgiving, but one simple thing can change that view on the cruelty of the world; laughter. In your deepest concern in your darkest thoughts laughter can bring the sun. Laughter is a cure for the sick, a pill for the wounded, and comfort for the old. We give not even the slightest thought to laughing, when in return it gives us joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, a flashlight for the lost, and a lifeline for the hopeless. Laughter truly is the cure for all of humanity. Explaining laughter is like explaining why we breath, we just do, it's a part of living. It's natural for people to laugh, maybe not always appropriate, but it's something we revert back to in necessary times. Laughing makes dreams, hopes, and puts to rest the thoughts of uncertainty. Laughing is a friend, a helper, and an icebreaker to many leaving joy and hope to everyone that it meets. It's part of life we must cherish every moment we can.  Many times laughter has helped me, but one time sticks out more then the rest. A moment, a simple moment were laughter changed me, my views, and life itself; putting my life into motion. With shoulders slumped I listened to my six period teacher as she droned on about nothing important. I turned around hoping to find something to distract me. When I turned I met eyes with a man I had never had spoken to, he watched me with curiosity waiting for my explanation. I wanted, no, needed to talk to him so I took a chance. ""@CAPS1 you watched wrestling?"" he smiled and chuckled.without that the conversation would @CAPS1 been totally different. He could @CAPS1 ignored me, but he laughed and that altered the course of my life. Soon after that, that man became my boyfriend, because we talked after I asked him that. That laugh made everything so simple, it made the puzzle fall into place. Moments @CAPS1 arise when laughing has dug me a pit of ruins. Even though laughing is such a wonderful thing you still need to be careful and know when the right time to laugh is and when its not. Again a moment that sticks to me was a time when I was young. I played by myself for the most part picking up a barbie I brushed her hair,""@CAPS2 come here."" I heard my father call.I went to the living room where my brother already reside and waited with my barbie. My father kneel to talk,""@CAPS3 going to be leaving soon because she needs sometime. I want you to go with her and make sure everything is okay. I want you to stay with her and I'll see you when I can. I love you @CAPS2 always remember that."" I bubbled with laughter, I didn't realize or even comprehend what was really going on. I laughed as we got into the car, by the time we were gone i realized how serious this issue was. Maybe I didn't hurt anyone by laughing, but it hurt me for not taking it so serious.  Life is never know, we never know where life will take us, lead us, kick us, or drop us. Laughter is an emotion and can cure the wounds, but its also a power we must not mistreat or misuse. Giving us joy and fun, it helps pick us up when we fall and it rejoices us. Laughter is a way of life and the savior of humanity. Laughter truly is a gift that keeps on giving, a light in the darkest of times, and a beacon of hope for all. Cherish the moments of laughter, for they hold the power to transform lives and bring about positive change in the world."
225	20999	8	3	"Laughter is a contagious disease that should be included in everyone's life as they grow up. It plays a key role in creating memorable moments and strengthening relationships. For me, my family has five days dedicated to laughter throughout the year: birthdays, Easter, Independence Day, Halloween, and Christmas. These days are filled with fun activities, games, and shared laughter that create lasting memories. From playing laser tag on Independence Day to trick-or-treating on Halloween, each celebration is marked by joy and laughter. These moments of laughter not only bring us closer together but also help us relax and enjoy life. As my grandparents used to say, ""A laugh a day will keep the doctor away."" Laughter truly is the best medicine for the soul."
226	21000	8	3	"Many summers ago, @CAPS1 best friend @PERSON1 and I had a sleepover at @CAPS1 house. We were both excited because @CAPS1 dad would be the only one there. @CAPS1 mom and brother were out late. After eating popcorn and getting stuffed up on candy, we decided to try something new and fun. @CAPS1 house has a counter bar where four to five people can sit at and so @CAPS1 daddy decided to turn on some hip hop music. As though @PERSON1 and I could read each others minds we jumped on the counter and started doing the runway model walk. We worked it like no other. It was funny to see @CAPS1 dad pretending to be the fake photographer and say that's ""gorgeous"" as though he was a real photographer. @PERSON1 and I strutted up and down and did stops and poses and turns, until we got too dizzy. We all knew we could never do this with @CAPS1 mom @ORGANIZATION1 which made everything so funny! We all bursted out laughing until we couldn't breathe! Later on after that fun model runway, we decided to pillow surf down the stairs. I was a little afraid at first but after I saw the look on @PERSON1's face, I knew I had to do it. I grabbed a big body pillow and surfed down those stairs like a champ! It was such a blast! @PERSON1 and I kept pillow fighting for what seemed like forever! @CAPS1 dad put on @ORGANIZATION1 and we laughed the rest of the night away. That night was one of the best and funniest memories of @CAPS1 childhood."
227	21001	8	3	"In my opinion, I think that laughter is a very important part of life. What would the world be like without laughter and jokes? It would be a very boring and dull place. I can't even imagine what it would be like. The world needs to have laughter in it. People need to make jokes and they need to have laughter and comedy in their life. I myself have a lot of laughter in my life. One day in fifth grade my best friend and I were jogging around the track for gym class. We were running together and talking and telling jokes to each other to help pass the time because it was really boring. I told this one really awesome joke, I can't remember what it was, and he started laughing so hard. We were both laughing together to the point we were crying. He fell down on the track, and rolled off into the grass. I said ""@CAPS1 on we need to keep going or the gym teacher will get mad"". He said, ""I can't, I just peed my pants!."" That made me laugh even more. He got up and walked over to the gym teacher. The gym teacher told my friend to go to the nurse's office. After gym class was over I met him back up with him in the classroom and he told me he called his mom and she brought him a new pair of underwear and pants. I wonder what his mom must have thought. It was a funny day.  We have always talked about that day together from then on. I would always jokingly make fun of him for peeing his pants, but I told him a funny joke. Our whole relationship was based on making each other laugh and telling jokes. Just all around the two of us being stupid together was what we did. Jokes and laughter made our friendship so much better and gave me amazing memories that I might possibly have for the rest of my life. At the same time, if you have no jokes and laughter in your friendship, it can make your relationship very boring and lame. If you do not have any, or little laughter in your friendship, then you do not have fun with that person and it makes you not want to hang around them because it just feels boring.  I have this other friend named @CAPS2, I occasionally go over to his house and we hang out and play video games together. The weird thing is, we hardly even communicate with each other. We just do stuff and don't have any fun with it. There is no jokes or laughter or anything awesome like that. We just play his video games silently not saying a word to the other person. Its the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. It is the most boring friendship two people could have. It is really boring over there because we just do the same thing over and over. I don't really like going over there that much. I would rather be at a different friends house having fun, but I still go over there anyway and I am not sure why. Without jokes and laughter in a friendship, it just makes things boring and not fun. It is something you definitely need to have. Laughter is not just an important element in a friendship, it is also an important element to have in a dating relationship. If you are dating somebody, then you absolutely need to have laughter in your relationship. If you look around you always see couples making jokes together and laughing with each other all the time, having fun. It makes their relationship interesting and enjoyable. Think about it, who wants to date a boring person that doesn't like to laugh and make jokes? Nobody wants to. So in a dating relationship you especially need laughter and comedy more than in a friendship. You want to keep things going good so the other person likes you and thinks your funny. That is one of the key things that makes a couple close. So as you can see by my three examples, laughter really makes a big difference in relationships and just in life in general. If you have laughter in a friendship it can really impact the relationship in a very good way. It makes it an interesting and fun relationship. Laughter makes people happy and get along with each other. If you are feeling down, laughter can always bring you up and make you feel better. It is almost like a medicine. If you do not have laughter, it can really make things suck, and make the relationship boring. Nobody wants that. People do not want a boring, lifeless relationship with somebody. Laughter is something that bring people together in a good way. It brings all of my friends together and makes us better friends. We have a good time and really enjoy ourselves. Laughter is a great thing that everybody needs to have in their life."
228	21002	8	3	"From Laughter to Friendship, the first day of school last year, I walked through the doors of the school hoping I would make a friend or two. I was not sure of how this would happen but I hoped for the best. I entered my first class and sat at a table with all unknown faces. I wanted to say something but was afraid of their reactions. The teacher made us play a couple games where we had to introduce ourselves. Those didn't really help. Everybody was tense and it was all awkward. I wanted to be myself already and make friends. For the rest of the day, all my classes were like that. Everybody was tense and awkward, like something was keeping us quiet. Not knowing anybody didn't help the situation a bit. That was the first day for me. The second day I walk through the school doors determined to make some friends. I thought about what jokes I could say, what interesting thing about myself I could share, but to me all those sounded like stupid ideas. I walk into humanities and sat at a table with a friendly looking girl. The teacher told us to introduce ourselves to the other students at the table we were sitting at. For a minute or so it was very silent, but I wanted to introduce myself so bad. I couldn't stand this silence any longer. I looked in my backpack to grab a pencil and I see a note from my mom saying ""Be yourself and make some friends honey, have a great day at school. :)"" I started laughing because I thought it was funny that my mom actually wrote me a note and stuck it in my backpack. It was so unexpected and I felt like a child. I started laughing and when I looked up, I saw that the girl next to me was laughing too. I knew I had to say something, so I did. I said, ""Hi my name is [Person1], but you can call me [CAPS4] for short. What's your name?"" The girl looked at me, smiled, and said, ""Hi, my name is [CAPS8]."" Then I asked her what middle school she came from and other questions. We started talking, we exchanged numbers, and we became good friends. From laughter to friendship, who would have known? A year has gone by and we are still friends. We always laugh about how we started talking. A few days ago I told her how I felt that second day of school. I told her I was scared to introduce myself. She said she felt the same way and she didn't know what to do either. Since then I thank my mom for writing that note because without it I wouldn't have laughed and made [CAPS8] laugh and I wouldn't have made such a great friend."
229	21003	8	3	"It's the first day of high school and your gut is full of butterflies that make you want to run to the bathrooms and hide from the world. I had no friends yet and I was too shy to go and join any of the groups so I walked to all of my classes alone. Students would get in my face wanting to know what school I came from and wanted to know all about me. I remember wanting to be left alone, hidden in my own bubble space. Girls would ask if I was upset since I wasn't smiling or having fun getting to know my new classes. Lunch was much more crowded than my old school. Students would sit in hallways eating their lunch or crowd around one big table chattering loudly to one another. I chewed on my lip looking for a spot that wasn't occupied by students. I found a table near the front of the lunch room that was empty and placed my brown lunch sack in front of me eating my peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Two boys and two girls rushed over and settled down next to me laughing at one another for not getting a seat next to me. ""Hi, I'm Grace, what's your name?"" was a skinny boy in a black cap's response to me. ""Sarah"" was all I replied to all of them who stared at me the entire time. ""That's a pretty name, I'm Emily, this is Jake, you just met Grace, and Ben is the funny kid next to you with his orange backpack,"" I smiled and nodded to them. They all ate lunch at the school and got pizza or sub sandwiches. They showed pictures of funny events on their phones to everyone even including me. ""Sarah, that kid isn't careful he might get razor rash,"" I said laughing a little looking at the picture of a little boy sliding down a slide that looked like a cheese grater. Grace took off all his pepperoni and was flinging it randomly in the air. Emily was going to take a picture of everyone for picture id on her phone. Ben was next for his picture to be taken when the pepperoni in Jake's hands slipped and landed smack on Ms. Thompson's face. I busted up laughing and everyone at the table joined in. Ben and I were clenching our stomachs and wiping away tears. Jake went to the bathroom to wash away the smell from his face and when he returned Emily said, ""Oh my word you should see your face I took your picture right after the pepperoni hit your face and your picture is just hilarious, your mouth is hanging open like you're going to eat something and like you're angry."" Emily handed her phone to one person at a time and we all started to laugh again asking for Emily to send the picture to each of them. ""I was wondering if I could be your guys' friend?"" I asked looking them all in the eye. Grace was the only one to respond, ""Of course you can be our friend, Sarah, duh, we didn't want to be your friend then we wouldn't be hanging out with you."" Grace teased. My twisted gut loosened with relief. ""Yeah, we probably would have made some excuse to leave,"" Jake smiled. I laughed at myself for worrying that I wouldn't fit in or have friends who could make me laugh as hard as I did when the pepperoni stuck to Ms. Thompson's face."
230	21004	8	3	Laughter is a powerful tool that can bring people together and help them feel more at ease with each other. It can turn strangers into friends and create strong bonds between individuals. Sharing a laugh can lighten the mood and make even difficult situations seem more manageable. Through laughter, people can find common ground and build connections that last a lifetime. So, next time you have the opportunity to share a laugh with someone, take it - you never know where it might lead.
231	21005	8	3	Laughter is one of the most important things in life. People shouldn't go a day without it. It's healthy and good in any relationship. It can also help with healing. The best kind of laughter is when you're out of breath and crying. It makes people so happy and wanting more. Don't take life too seriously, just laugh and smile all the time.   Someone dying is a dreadful thing. When two high school boys die, it's even worse. On a tragic day, a group of high school students were walking on the rocks by the ocean when a sneaker wave snatched two of them. The community was in shock, unable to comprehend the loss of two beautiful lives.   Hundreds of students gathered at church to mourn the boys and honor their memory. Friends spoke of the good times they shared and how much they were missed. Laughter and cheering at a school basketball game helped bring some healing to the community.   As time passes, the pain of their loss will still be felt, but remembering the good times and sharing laughter can help in the healing process. Life is precious, and it's important to cherish every moment and tell the people you care about that you love them. Laughter is a powerful tool that can help us navigate through even the darkest of times.
232	21006	8	3	"People can share many things. DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion, and laughter. For my sister @PERSON3 and I, laughter is what made our relationship stronger than it ever would. When I was younger it was the typical older sister @LOCATION1 younger sister vibe, frankly we did not like each other at all. Through maturing, entering high school, and being part of the same cheer leading organization we have spent almost too much time together and now it's almost as if we are the best of friends. In the @DATE3 we were together constantly. We would watchJerry @PERSON1, laugh and/or make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show. We would watch clips of the showSaturday @TIME1 @CAPS1, that's where I introduced her to the character ""@CAPS2"". @PERSON3 and I would talk to each other in the voice that we adapted from ""@CAPS2"" and laugh constantly about @NUM1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 is also where we adapted the ""demonic voice"". We would talk to each other, and our friends in these voices. Both of us still talk like that @DATE1. As we entered high school we had to start driving together everyday to and from school. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves and sometimes I would have to steer if her favorite song came on(she was a very energetic dancer). It was all in good fun though. When we would enter into the school everything would change though and I understood that after about a week. I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hi to her in the hall or wave at her when she was around her friends. She wanted to be left alone so she wouldn't look weird. She was a junior then, they always think their the coolest around. Once she was a senior she would say hi to me, she would smile when she saw me, I even talked to her and her friends sometime. We also grew closer once I entered the student leadership class that she was also apart of, we had the same class every other day it was hard not to talk to each other. The single thing that I believe has made our relationship closer because of laughter was the three weeks she stayed in my room. She decided to ""move in"" when she would wake up in the morning with bug bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea what they were from. We suspected that she just didn't remember getting them when she was out the @TIME1 before, but then when she wouldn't go out she still got them. We figured out what it was when her friend @PERSON2 came over; she had bed bugs. That @TIME1 I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two three nights tops so my parents had time to disinfect her room. That turned into two three weeks. We spend almost every hour of every day together those three weeks, the only peace I got was in the shower. We would stay up late talking about our day, who we didn't like, who's outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in cheer practice and who could have done better at cheering. If you knew @PERSON3 you would know how scared she gets over a movie so half the time when we were up late I was next to her trying to scare her. It's quite funny to see her reaction. Finally she ""moved out"" and I got my room back though I don't think, even now it feels the same as it did. They say many things about laughter; ""Laughter is the best medicine"" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between people"" ""@CAPS5 two people in a room, they'll be laughing in @NUM2 minutes""; All of these talking about how relationships grow with laughter. I have the funniest, silliest, greatest sister in the world because we can laugh at the same things. We have the same mind people say, we do a lot of the same things, we think a lot alike, and we wear a lot of the same things as well. I am positive laughter has strengthened my sister and I's relationship. I bet if you really look at the relationship between you and someone you're close to, the first memory you think of is a happy moment of you laughing. Laughter truly has a way of bringing people together and creating lasting bonds that stand the test of time."
233	21007	8	3	"One day I was going to my friend @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1's house for her @NUM1 birthday party. I knew the birthday party was going to be a lot of fun even though it was only going to be @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 and I. I didn't know it was going to be as fun as it turned out to be though.  The whole day I was waiting for it to be @NUM2 so I could go to her house. I packed all my bags and got everything ready because it was a sleepover. As I was on my way to her, she called me and said, ""Before you get to my house, look to the right."" The whole way my dad and I were driving to her house, I kept my eyes on the right side of the road, unsure of what I was looking for. As we got closer, I saw something in the bushes. It was @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON2. I told my dad to honk at them so they knew I was there, and as he did, they both pulled down their pants and mooned us! I was laughing so hard the whole night, thinking about the look on my dad's face!  Little did I know that wasn't going to be the funniest thing that happened that night. Later on, @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2, and I went for a walk down to the dock by @LOCATION1's house. While we were on the dock, a bat flew by, and @PERSON2 almost fell in the water because she was so scared. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were standing behind her, laughing so hard. By that time, it was getting kind of dark, and her neighbors were being really loud. So we ran from the dock to her neighbor's house and hid, yelling things at them to quiet down. It was hilarious because they had no idea where the yells were coming from, so they just kept looking around confused. We started laughing so hard we could hardly be quiet.  We had to wait a while for her neighbors to stop looking around trying to figure out who was telling them to be quiet. As we were walking back to @LOCATION1's house, we heard a car coming, so we made a plan. I stood in the middle of the street, @ORGANIZATION1 stood ahead of me, and @PERSON2 was hiding in the bushes. The plan was for @ORGANIZATION1 and me to pretend to be in a fight, and @PERSON2 was going to run out of the bushes and pretend to shoot me.  As the car started turning the corner, @ORGANIZATION1 and I started fake fighting. The car slowed down as it got closer, and here came @PERSON2 running out of the bushes and pretending to shoot me. I fell to the ground like I was really hurt, trying to hold back my laughs. We thought we got the people in the car good, but then we realized there was no gunshot sound. The people in the car were actually @CAPS2, some of @ORGANIZATION1's family friends coming over for the party, and they knew it was fake the whole time.  That night, we found a huge watermelon and took it out to a bridge by @LOCATION1's house. We brought her video camera and put it on night vision, then threw the watermelon off the bridge. When it hit the water, it made a loud sound and split into tiny pieces. It was so much fun, and we had a great time together. The next day, the fun continued with activities at the lake, swinging on rope swings into the water.  @ORGANIZATION1 got a bad rope burn, which was hilarious. @PERSON2, @ORGANIZATION1, and I always have the best time together and tons of laughs. A lot more happened that night, making it a great @NUM1 birthday for @ORGANIZATION1. I'm glad I got to be there with her for it."
234	21008	8	3	We all have had times when some thing happened and you just thought of it as a nuisance. But looking back on the same occurrence you just have to laugh at how silly it was. I recall one of these experiences when I went on a motorcycle camping trip this past summer. It was a bright and sunny day when my dad dropped me off at the beginning of the main logging road of the area. I decided to keep my pace slow and steady and just enjoy the beautiful scenery. Later that day I found a picturesque place to camp for a few nights on the river. In the afternoon, I remembered some spurs off the main road from when I have driven with my brother in these woods and decided to go explore some of them near my camp. I decided to go check out one across the river that looked like a fun ride. As I was crossing it my front tire hit some lose rocks causing me to fall into the water! Thankfully I fell away from my motorcycle, if I hadn't it could very well have fallen on me which, out in the woods by myself, would have put me in quite the predicament. After getting my gear up and out of the water I headed back to camp to dry my clothes off, seeing as how I only brought one set with me. While reading a book and waiting for my clothes to dry I fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up I realized that the sun had been up for some time now so I decided that I had better get going on another ride before the day's out. This time I stayed on my side of the water and went up a steep road that lead up to the top of the ridge. As I climbed it became increasingly warm then I broke through the woods and witnessed a glorious sight. The sun was just cresting the ridge in front of me and I had to stop and bask in the sun shine. After a while of just sitting I got going again. The road I was on started to taper down into a valley. At the bottom of it, flood waters had washed large quantity's of silt over the road and it was still muddy. As I crossed it my wheels started spinning out and flinging mud at me as a result I ended up very dirty. Once again I headed back to camp to wash my clothes in the river. This time I didn't fall asleep for quite some time and when I did it was a fitful one. Upon waking I packed up my meager supplies and headed out to complete my journey. Most of a day got me only halfway to my destination so I was forced to stop and rest for the night. Just setting out my tent and getting out some food for dinner and breakfast in the evening didn't take me very long. Having little to occupy my time I just sat by my fire and pondered my trip and life in general. When I fell asleep I slept soundly until morning. Waking to the sound of birds chirping and the river rushing by me was delightful and invigorating. It only took me a few hours to reach where my dad was going to meet me and take me home. This trip helped me think and gather my thoughts. It also helped me enjoy the little things in life that we so often take for granted. Looking back at it always makes me laugh and realize that my errors could have been much worse but as it turned out they were just minor setbacks. All in all, it was a very good time to gather my thoughts and renew my soul.
235	21009	8	3	Laughter is a natural reaction that is a sign of happiness and plays a crucial role in building connections between people. It is a way to express joy and bond with others, especially when sharing moments of humor and light-heartedness. However, it is essential to be mindful of when laughter may be inappropriate or hurtful, as it can have negative consequences if not used thoughtfully. Understanding each other's sense of humor and being considerate of others' feelings is key to maintaining healthy relationships and creating a positive atmosphere. Ultimately, laughter should be a source of happiness and positivity, bringing people together in moments of joy and camaraderie.
236	21010	8	3	One day I decided to go over to my friend @PERSON1's house. When I went over there we cleaned the pool and I ran from her dad because he was chasing me around with a booger on his finger. This was one of the days that me and @PERSON1 laughed more than ever! We started the day just laying in her bed and watching a movie on her tiny @CAPS1. I can't really remember what movie it was, but it doesn't really matter since we were too busy talking about totally random things. After the movie was over we went out into the living room to watch @CAPS2 bob because @PERSON1 doesn't have cable in her room. At the time, I had a knee injury so it took me a minute to get comfortable. I got myself situated on the couch and @PERSON1 sat next to me. Her dad came in about 10 minutes later with a booger on his index finger. He threatened to give me booger lip, which is where he puts the booger on your lip, and I got up and tried to run away. I knew if I didn't get away he would really put it on my lip because he had done it before. it hurt really bad putting that much pressure on my knee so I hopped as fast as I could on one leg. I hid in @PERSON1's closet and all I could hear in the background was @PERSON1's laughter and her dad's footsteps. I waited in her closet for about 12 minutes and then got out because I could tell the coast was clear. I went back out in the living room and @PERSON1 and I laughed about the whole thing. After we stopped laughing we decided to go outside and clean the pool. We were in the mood for swimming and the pool had been out all winter so it was really nasty in there. There were tadpoles, dirt, some slimy green stuff, parasites, and who knows what else. We got in and started scooping all of the water out with buckets. We didn't notice the tadpoles until then. We didn't want to throw them out in the yard with all of the rest of the water because we knew they would dry up and die. So every time we scooped a bucket full of water, we would go through it and get all of them out and put them in a little can. Scooping all of the water out took about 33 and a half hours. After that, we went in the house and looked for some pool cleaner and soap. We couldn't find any, so we went and got the shampoo. We poured the shampoo all over the bottom of the pool and started scrubbing. That was taking too long and it wasn't very fun, so we got the brilliant idea to put shampoo all over our clothes and slide around. I slipped about a dozen times and so did she. It was hard to stay on our feet. We laughed so hard I almost peed myself, but I couldn't go inside because I was soaked and I had soap all over my body. After the pool was all spick and span, we had to scoop all the soap and water out again. All of this took about 44 hours, but it was really fun and we laughed a lot. @PERSON1's mom came home from work and was so happy that we cleaned it because it meant she didn't have to do it. After my grandpa came to get me, me and @PERSON1 said our goodbyes. I went home and thought about how that was one of the funnest days of my life. Overall, I think on this day I laughed more than ever before.
237	21012	8	3	@CAPS4 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I can relate to feeling like there's never enough time in the day to accomplish everything I want to do. Since starting my job at @ORGANIZATION1, I've been struggling to balance work, school, and personal responsibilities. The demands of my job have left me exhausted, making it difficult to focus on my studies and causing my grades to suffer. Despite feeling overwhelmed, I continue to work long hours to support my mom, who is relying on me financially.   Taking care of my mom is a priority for me, as she has always been there for me unlike my absent father. I worry about her future and feel a deep sense of responsibility to provide for her. My younger brother's lack of help around the house adds to my stress, and I believe it's time for him to step up and support our mom as well.   While I strive to be a good kid, I struggle with societal expectations and the pressure to conform to a certain mold. I am not academically inclined and often feel like I don't fit in with my peers who have plans for college. Despite these challenges, I am determined to improve my grades and find a better job that offers more financial stability.   As I navigate the complexities of my responsibilities and aspirations, I am aware of the need to prioritize my well-being and seek a balance that allows me to thrive in all areas of my life. It won't be easy, but I am committed to doing my best and overcoming the obstacles in my path.
238	21013	8	3	I think that laughter is very important. It is very important to me because let's say that a student falls and you laugh at him just because you think its funny it's going to hurt that student. I think that instead of laughing at someone that you could be a good kid and ask him if he is ok and help him up. That shows that student that he really has a friend that cares about him a lot and doesn't laugh at him and really cares about his best friend. You also can get rewarded for doing something good but to me it's really not about what I get it's the things I do to help out my peers. I think that we should not laugh and have a positive attitude and be mature about what we do and what we say and react to things like laughing at someone else. I also think that if I would have fell and I got really hurt and kids would start laughing at me so that's what I learn respect the students the way that you want to be respected. So I wouldn't like people to make fun of me so why would I like to make fun of someone else if I wouldn't want them to make fun of me that's why you should treat your peers with respect.
239	21014	8	3	"One day I was with my friend @PERSON1. We had been friends for a really long time. I was in a bad mood that day because my dog, Taco, ran away, and I had gotten into an argument with my parents. @PERSON1 asked me if I wanted to go out on a walk, and I said I did. We were really good friends at this point, and @PERSON1 always knew when something was wrong, even though I think I hide it pretty well. As we walked, we passed children playing at the park with their parents, and a man playing fetch with his dog. The sun was sunny and warm; it was during the summertime. We stood on the bridge for a minute, then @PERSON1 asked me, ""What's wrong, @PERSON2?"" I told him everything that had happened - my dog running away and my parents being mad at me. I told him that I was sad. I don't know why I opened up to him like that; we hardly ever talk about our life drama. We're always laughing and making jokes. I thought @PERSON1 liked me, actually, I was hoping he did. I liked him, I had for a while. We started talking about everything that was going on in our lives - school, friends, parents, and a lot more. @PERSON1 put me in a better mood. We decided to go to the park and sit at the picnic tables. We sat across from each other and talked for a while. Then it started getting late, and I had to get home. I said, ""Thanks for cheering me up, I really needed to laugh and smile today."" @PERSON1 looked at me, took my hand in his, and said, ""You should always laugh because you never know who is falling in love with your smile."" And then, he kissed me. That is a day I'll remember for a long time. I'm still with @PERSON1; we've been together for almost 8 months now."
240	21015	8	3	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 extreme temperatures occur, the situation becomes very dangerous. In my case, the extreme weather was @CAPS1. I lived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at this time and was eight years old. It happened in the middle of @DATE1, @CAPS3 an almost record high temperature occurred @LOCATION2. The day had peaked at one hundred twenty five degrees @CAPS4, and to make matters much worse, our entire neighborhoods power had gone out. Nobody had air conditioning and many people ended up getting severely sick or injured. We lived in a gated community, and everyone got along great. People from the neighborhood gathered together and put up tents for shade, and provided everyone with cold water. There are important things that you must remember @CAPS3 a situation like this happens, you must have a good attitude, because it's no help to be complaining, also to not think about the @CAPS1, and to help other people who need it. I don't think that our community would have lasted, if it weren't of everyone's great attitude and spirit, and of course, the laughter. It is so important to have a good attitude during a situation like this. What is the point of complaining and getting mad for no reason? I was told that it would not last forever, and to keep my chin up. I could tell that the many other kids, and even adults who were complaining were have a much harder time coping with this situation. It was very hard for me no not complain, being an eight year-old, but I eventually managed with the help of a lot of water. If you keep your spirits up, and interact with people, the say seems to go by much faster. I remember @CAPS3 my whole family was under one of the tents, just sitting around telling funny stories, and telling jokes. I would have much rather had a day like that with my family than a normal, boring one. Out of the many important things you could possibly do, is to not think about the @CAPS1. If you don't think about it, then you will have a much better time and not be complaining. It is important in many situations to keep your mind off the topic so you won't be stressed out. I saw many people there who just couldn't take it. They would only say how bad it was, and it was very easy to tell that they were all stressed out. If you try to make the situation a good one, and not keep thinking about it, then you will get through it, no matter how bad it is. During this @CAPS2 of @CAPS1, many people needed assistance. The community was a big help because they set up tents and provided people with water and snacks. However, it started to get bad, people were suffering from @CAPS1 exhaustion, and many of them had to be put on @CAPS5's. There were several ambulances there to help people out and get them back to normal. Some people did need to go to the hospital and get further attention. The community eventually got through the day with so serious injuries. The power came back on at around six o'clock. Being exhausted the people slowly walked or drove back to their houses. Our whole family walked back to the house and immediately turned on the air conditioning. Everyone was so relieved and happy that we were finally out of that situation. Even at night, the day was at a low of one hundred twelve degrees. We played games and told jokes the rest of the night and were able to get through it all. Our family had stayed strong through the @CAPS1, while many others didn't last. It just goes to show that ,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."""
241	21016	8	3	Laughter is such a great joy in my life. If people never laughed life would be dull and boring, most of my favorite experiences involve @CAPS9 while having a good time. One of my best experiences with laughter was going camping with my friends last @DATE2. I will never forget that experience last @DATE2.  During the middle of @DATE2 on a beautiful sunny @DATE1 @TIME1 my @CAPS4 @CAPS1 calls me and @CAPS2 me were getting a bunch of guys to go camping and I should come. Immediately I @CAPS3 my parents to let me go with the only exception of turning in my job application to @ORGANIZATION1 before I left for camping. After turning in my application I got in the car picked up my @CAPS4 @PERSON3 and makings for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and left for the adventure.  After I got to my destination after driving @NUM1 miles up river I didn't see anyone just two huge tents where my friends were supposed to be. Looking @CAPS5 the camp site had been attacked by bears with trash laying all around and camp fire still going i started searching for my friends. I found @CAPS1 passed out in one of the tents and tried to wake him but he was dead asleep. @PERSON3 and me not knowing what to do so we sat in the shade of the large trees surrounding us, it was a good @NUM2 degrees outside. After about five minuets we herd a splash and went to investigate. We walked towards the river and found all of out friends jumping off a @NUM3 ft rock into the river and we went to join the fun. After jumping off about @NUM4 times each we headed back to camp. @CAPS1 was awake and @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @CAPS7, @PERSON3 and myself all huddled around the camp fire @CAPS8 we returned to camp and told jokes all night.  All of us really bonded that three day camping trip @CAPS9 and joking and just being boys. I wouldn't get rid of those memory's for anything. After camping i returned to home and worked a lot of the rest of @DATE2 but ever since then have had really good friendships with all of my camping buddies.  After that camping trip, the memories created and the bonds formed remained strong, enriching my life with shared laughter and camaraderie.
242	21017	8	3	Once upon a time on my birthday, my friends came over and we had a blast. We played video games on a projector and on my TV, then moved to the living room to hang out. After enjoying cake and an icing fight, we headed to the park for some outdoor fun. Upon returning home, we watched a scary movie and played games, including spin the bottle/truth or dare. Laughter filled the air as we created unforgettable memories together.
243	21020	8	3	The only true story that I can remember that involves laughter was about @NUM1 years ago at the beach. I was with my mom and my sister @LOCATION1. I was running from incoming waves when I decided to run into just one wave which that wave sweep me off my feet and spun me around for what seemed like forever, but wasn't even @NUM2 seconds. I laughed so hard that I tripped and i started spinning again, my mom had to get me up because I could not stop. I got so many cuts from the sand that it was hilarious. after I got changed I got a big chest that my dad could fit inside it. That's the only time I remember laughter being my true friend.
244	21021	8	3	"My freshman year of high school started off less favorable than most. During the end of my eighth grade year, I found that my friends were not as loyal as I believed they were at the beginning of our friendship, and in turn started high school without any. It wasn't all bad because I was able to see things for myself for one of the first times in my life. Of course, I sulked, but looking back on it now, I am appreciative of this time that helped me get to know myself better. However, one can't go through life without any friends, so I quickly tried to conform to what was considered 'normal'. I had luck from the start, but I was still scorned from being deserted by all the people who I once considered friends and in turn took these recipients as little more than acquaintances. Like most acquaintances, we only spoke in class and kept the conversation casual about nothing more than trivial facts. I wanted to have 'real' friends, but I wasn't sure what a real friend was. I suppose that these so-called acquaintances considered me a friend, though I can never be sure whether or not this is true. So I continued through my days with a person to talk to in each class but no one to sit with at lunch. This circumstance, however, was made more desirable because my sister still attended the high school at this point. Her presence made my life slightly easier because I could confide in her and even eat lunch with her. People who have always had friends may not understand, but when you have nowhere to sit at lunch, it can be kind of lonely. Fortunately, my sister was always there for me, though she did skip a lot of school. And whenever she wasn't there, I could rely on her friends to keep me company. I found that even if I couldn't find my own friends, I could always share my sister's. This nomad existence continued until the second trimester of my freshman year. I had all new classes and felt as if it was a new beginning and anything could happen, and truly anything I could imagine did. It started out the same as the trimester before had. I went to my first couple classes and gained more acquaintances like usual and felt as if things might not change after all. However, after five minutes of sitting alone in my apparel construction class, two girls walked in and sat at my table. Their conversation caught my attention and held it. I knew that it was wrong to listen to others' conversations, but I figured that if they didn't want me to hear, they would have spoken quietly. Though I can't recall the actual subject of the conversation now, I remember it was a hilarious topic. Even though I took no part in the discussion, I couldn't help but be overcome with laughter as the two spoke. They then began to laugh so hard, which resulted in tears filling their eyes. In turn, my eyes also began to fill with tears from the extreme amounts of laughter. One of the two girls looked over at me and told her friend out loud to ""look at her, she's laughing so hard at you she's crying!"" I could hardly stop laughing long enough to introduce myself. Before I knew it, we became close friends, and it was all due to the amazing powers of laughter that can bring strangers together into best friends. This experience taught me the importance of being true to myself and showed me that sometimes, unexpected friendships can bring the most joy and fulfillment in life."
245	21022	8	3	"I'm going to tell you a story of smiles, laughter, and love. The story of my @DATE3 and how I changed a girl's life and my own with only smiles and laughs. I have three major memories of my time with her, there was the first smile, the day at the beach, and the @TIME1 at the @LOCATION4. Starting with the beginning, these memories are about me and my neighbor's exchange student @PERSON1 and they are memories, they are not perfect. The @TIME1 I made @PERSON1 smile. It was a cool @DATE2 @TIME1 out on the back lawn of grandmother's house which overlooks the @ORGANIZATION1 gorge, perfect for watching the firework show. The lawn was even inclined so that you don't have to sit up. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 came over to sit with me as I waited for the show. @PERSON1 sat to the left of me and @CAPS1, my neighbor and life-long friend, to the right. I was very curious about @PERSON1, what she was like, what part of @LOCATION3 she lived in, how were her customs different than ours. So, I started to ask her some questions as we waited. I didn't get much, it was obvious that she was shy, very shy. Finally, I got a conversation going between the three of us about the fireworks that had started. @PERSON1 was telling us how the fireworks back home in @LOCATION3 were much bigger than ours. Of course, me being sarcastic, I said ""@CAPS2 really."" She just smiled. The rest of the @TIME1, the conversations flowed much freer between me and @PERSON1 and it was a wonderful evening. Next, we have the day at the beach. This happened about @DATE1 for the @TIME1 memory. @PERSON1 and I were good friends and she had lost her shyness, and I was starting to really like her. We arrived at the beach down on the @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION1. It was starting to become a hot day, a perfect day for the beach. We unpacked the towels and other random beach stuff. Soon all of us were in the water, @PERSON1, @CAPS1 (@PERSON1's host sister), @CAPS4 (@CAPS1's boyfriend), and me. In a bit of a flirting mood, I started to splash @PERSON1 who happened to be by @CAPS1. This started a very large splash war with everyone splashing everyone else. Everyone was laughing and having a great time. It abruptly stopped because everyone didn't want water in their face anymore. Soon thereafter I dove under the water and tried to lift @PERSON1 up and then drop her in the water, it ultimately failed though because I missed and only caught her right leg. Nothing happened, just more and more laughter. That was a good wet day at the beach. Finally, my @TIME1 memory is the @TIME1 at the @LOCATION4. We had just finished eating dinner and it was @PERSON1's @TIME1 in @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. By now we were practically boyfriend and girlfriend. It was getting dark at @LOCATION2 @LOCATION4 as we arrived at the @LOCATION4 for Movies in the @LOCATION4. @TIME1 at the @CAPS7 was playing that @TIME1. I found a good spot and set out the blanket. We lay there talking as we waited for the movie to start. I had a flashback of all the laughs that had brought us close together. I knew at that moment that I was really going to miss her more than I had missed anyone before. It felt like the right moment as the sun was setting over the valley, I leaned in and kissed her and she kissed right back, I'll spare you the rest. Afterward we laughed and cried. For she was leaving early the next morning and we were in love. Yes, I used the @CAPS8 world, but it was and is true. We absolutely did not want the movie to end and yet it still did. As I drove her back to her host family's house we talked about the amazing @DATE3 we had together and all the smiles and laughs we shared. I smiled and laughed a lot that @DATE3 and it did bring me very close to someone. @PERSON1 and I still talk nearly every day, it is hard but I've never felt as close to her as anyone else. I will always have the memories of that @DATE3, the @DATE2 of @DATE2, that day at the beach, and @PERSON1's @TIME1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION1. I hope you enjoyed the story of my @DATE3 and I hope you can have an amazing @DATE3, like I"
246	21023	8	3	Summertime is always the highlight of the year for teenagers. It's when temperatures are the highest, we are able to stay out later, and its when we have the best memories of our childhood that we will never forget. It seems like there is never a dull moment when it comes to that time of year. Everyone seems to always get together and find something crazy and fun to do. @CAPS2, @LOCATION1, and I were sitting at home with nothing to do and decided that we were hungry. Without us having a car, we have to walk everywhere so we chose the closest place to @LOCATION1's house, which was at the time, @ORGANIZATION1. We left @ORGANIZATION1's at about ten o'clock and started walking around, trying to find something to do. We texted @CAPS1 and found out that he was with @PERSON1 so we all decided that we wanted to hang out at @ORGANIZATION2's house. We had absolutely no idea where he lived so they told us to meet them at the skate park. By then, it was pretty dark and we were still walking. When we got to the park, it was pretty late. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 arrived a couple minutes later so we started walking towards @ORGANIZATION2's house. @PERSON1 has the most evil cat I have ever met. @CAPS1 has told me stories and showed me videos about that cat a million times before. When we got there, it was bouncing off the walls and @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and I were scared of it. We didn't want it anywhere close to us because we thought it was going to attack us, eventually it did a couple of times. @PERSON1 was pointing the laser pointer all over the place for the cat to chase it and we were just sitting there, still bored. They were looking through our purses and saw that we had bathing suits because we went to the beach earlier, that gave them the wonderful idea of going fishing at one in the @TIME1. We all piled in the car and headed for the dike. We got there in our tank tops and short shorts and it was freezing. We were huddling for warmth. We couldn't see the ground and kept tripping over little holes and tree trunks everywhere. We finally got to a little dock that looked like it was ready to break and sink at any moment. @PERSON1 grabbed his @CAPS3 fishing pole and marched his way to the edge of the dock. There was no way the rest of us could all stand on it without breaking. We were taking a ton of pictures and had a ton of fun watching @PERSON1 try and fish and @CAPS1 just being @CAPS1. In the end, we found something to do out of nothing. When people experience the greatness in little things they realize that they could enjoy everything a lot more. That night was one of the most memorable nights of that @DATE1.
247	21024	8	3	I was about ten when this story happened to me. I was with my grandma at the park when I put my head in the monkey bars and got stuck. While my grandma was in the bathroom, the other kids at the park found it amusing and laughed at me, causing me to feel embarrassed.  After managing to free myself from the monkey bars, I decided to play a trick on the other kids. I dared them to try putting their heads in the monkey bars as well. Unaware that I had practiced beforehand to avoid getting stuck, the kids attempted the same and ended up in the same predicament. I found it hilarious and had a good laugh at their expense.  When my grandma returned and we left the park, I asked to go home. The next day, I repeated the trick on a new set of kids, but this time they reported me to their parents. Consequently, I got into trouble with my grandma and was grounded for two weeks.  Despite the consequences, I couldn't resist trying the trick again the next time I went to the park. This experience taught me that kids will be kids, always curious and sometimes falling for the same pranks over and over again.
248	21025	8	3	Friendship and laughter are essential components of a strong bond between friends. My best friend and I used to spend endless hours laughing at the silliest things, sharing stories that only we found hilarious. Our friendship was filled with laughter and joy, until a big fight threatened to tear us apart. The decision to end our friendship was difficult, but I couldn't ignore the betrayal that had occurred.  However, as time passed, I realized that I couldn't imagine my life without my best friend. Despite the hurt and disappointment, I missed our laughter and the special connection we shared. Slowly, we began to rebuild our friendship, acknowledging our faults and working towards a stronger relationship.  Through open communication and a willingness to forgive, we were able to mend the rift between us. The tension lifted, and we rediscovered the joy of laughing together. We both understood the importance of friendship and laughter in our lives, and vowed to never take each other for granted again.  Now, as we continue to nurture our friendship, we make sure to cherish every moment of laughter we share. Our bond is stronger than ever, and I am grateful for the lessons learned from our experience. Friendship and laughter truly are invaluable treasures, and I am committed to preserving them in my relationship with my best friend.
249	21026	8	3	Laughter is always the answer. It was freezing and dark outside. The walk home was too long to handle, but the laughter that filled the air made the journey a little faster and shorter. Cars passed by, staring at us, but all we could do was laugh even more because we were making fools of ourselves and didn't care. Our silly voices, crazy dance moves, and exaggerated facial expressions were hilarious to us. It's the silly and ridiculous things that people do that bring the most joy. As my friend and I walked back home, we dreaded the long journey ahead. It felt like it would take hours, even though it was only a short distance away. To make the walk more bearable, I remembered a funny voice my younger brother used to do that always made everyone laugh. So, I decided to try it out. We weren't even halfway home when I started yelling random words in a deep, creepy voice at passing cars. My friend joined in by dancing to the strange voice, attracting even more attention. We couldn't stop laughing, and our stomachs hurt from all the laughter. But it made the walk feel shorter and more enjoyable. When we finally reached my house, my mom asked if we had been dancing on the street. We just laughed and told her she had no idea how much fun we had. Laughter truly brings people closer together, whether it's friends getting to know each other better or a couple just having fun. It's the shared moments of joy and laughter that strengthen relationships and create lasting bonds.
250	21028	8	3	"In the summer of @DATE1, a close-knit group of friends including @PERSON5, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON4 decided to embark on an adventure to go cliff diving at @LOCATION2. The day was scorching hot, making the refreshing waters below the cliffs even more appealing. After a thrilling day of jumping off the cliffs and swimming, the group grew hungry and decided to stop at @ORGANIZATION1 for a meal on their way back. They later regrouped at ""the spot"" with additional friends, where they enjoyed a campfire as the sun set. However, a memorable incident occurred when @PERSON4 and @PERSON2 had a mishap while riding a quad, resulting in a call for help from the boys. Despite the unexpected turn of events, this eventful day created lasting memories within the group, solidifying their bond even further."
251	21029	8	3	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 trip was off to a lively start as I woke up to the sound of laughter downstairs. Joining my manager @PERSON2 and staff member @PERSON1, we embarked on our journey to @LOCATION1. Despite my initial apprehension due to a past family tragedy, I chose to focus on the present moment. The plane ride was filled with exciting bumps, and upon landing, we navigated through the airport to catch a shuttle to our hotel.  After a humorous incident involving soda spillage by @LOCATION2, we settled into our hotel rooms. With only two days of park hopping ahead, we spent the first day exploring the hotel grounds. However, dinner at a local restaurant named Chubby's left much to be desired with cold fries, undercooked meat, and lack of ice in our drinks.  The following day, I dressed in a fashionable ensemble of a polo shirt, sunglasses, shorts, and low-cut Converse shoes. Ready to take on the day, we headed to the park for a memorable experience. Despite the initial setback with dinner, the rest of the trip was filled with excitement, laughter, and cherished memories.
252	21030	8	3	I moved to the small town of @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION4 with my family when I was just a child. We have lived here for @NUM1 years, and it has been a place filled with both joy and challenges. Despite the difficult times, my family has always managed to find solace in laughter, coming together to support each other through thick and thin.  Last year, our family faced one of the toughest challenges yet when my @CAPS2 was diagnosed with a brain tumor. With limited time left, he made the decision to make the most of his remaining days by going on a trip to @LOCATION2. His infectious spirit and determination to create lasting memories brought us all closer together, turning what could have been a somber time into a joyous adventure.  From impromptu road trips to sharing laughter-filled moments, @CAPS2 showed us the power of finding humor in the darkest of times. His legacy lives on through the memories we created during that trip, reminding us that laughter truly is the best medicine, even in the face of adversity.  Though @CAPS2 may no longer be with us, the laughter and love he brought into our lives continue to guide us through each day. In the end, it is the moments of shared joy and laughter that we cherish the most, a testament to the strength and resilience of our family bond.
253	21031	8	3	My newest boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 11 months, and on our upcoming anniversary, it will be a year. We have a lot of fun together and enjoy each other's company. Recently, we have started working out together, although we don't engage in activities like biking or jogging. My parents adore him and even refer to him as their future son-in-law, which I find endearing.  On New Year's Eve, we had a fantastic time hanging out with one of Joe's friends named Randy. We ended up staying the night at Randy's hotel since there were no extra beds at his place. The next day, we had to pay Randy a bit of money for the stay and checked into our hotel room. It was luxurious, with a hot tub, a king-size bed, and other amenities. We had a great time relaxing in the hot tub and enjoying each other's company.  While getting out of the hot tub, I had a funny slip, but thankfully, I caught myself. We shared some laughs and then indulged in some snacks before winding down to watch TV and play video games. The sound of the game attracted the attention of a neighbor, but we assured him everything was fine. We spent the night playing games and enjoying each other's company until the early hours of the morning.  After a hearty breakfast at Randy's house, we headed home, where we continued to have a great time. We ended up taking a nap and sleeping through the next day. It turned out to be a school-free day, and we spent it playing video games and relaxing. The New Year's celebration was one of the best I've ever had, and I look forward to creating more special memories with my boyfriend in the future. He has been an amazing friend and partner, and I am grateful for his presence in my life. I hope our relationship continues to flourish, and we can enjoy many more joyful moments together.
254	21032	8	3	"The @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 great grandmother once told me that laughing adds and extra five years onto your life, she's currently @NUM1 years old. Laughing can bring a new element to relationships; they embark on a journey, whether it be between two friends, family members, or something more. More or less, laughter is an essential piece. Sometimes you feel closer to people because it breaks down that barrier between what defines acquaintance and friends, but that's actually how I met one of @CAPS3 good friends. The incoming @CAPS11 were participating a traditional ritual (name game) that the high school puts the incoming @CAPS11 through at orientation. They were placing us in long lines that faced each other. For this particular game you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner along with one interesting fact about yourself. Unsurprisingly, everyone found this task ridiculous and embarrassing, but we were able to laugh if off. A whole new feeling overcame the room. That overwhelming and uneasy feeling simply floated away and all because of laughter. It broke that barrier and allowed us to open up. I guess it really is true that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 back some of @CAPS3 best friendships were brought up through laughter. When I joined the cross country team for instance, the whole team unlike most other sports teams was like one big family. We share socks, @CAPS5-@CAPS6, tee shirts, shorts, water, sometimes even our watches, but we've also shared a great amount of laughs. Even while we run we talk to our friends and joke around, but trust that laughing while running is not easy! I think @CAPS3 best memory of it all was when we had our ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The entire team of eighteen @CAPS7 or so met up at @LOCATION1's house about a week before districts. The @CAPS10 had to bring snack foods, @CAPS11 had to bring drinks, and @CAPS12 brought the candy, and the @CAPS13 all chipped in for the ""main ingredient"". That first bit of the @CAPS8 was alright, but all were in anticipation for that hour hand to strike twelve. When it did, we were @CAPS9. The ""main ingredient"" to that @CAPS8 was the toilet paper. We were going @CAPS9 on a tee-pee raid! The first event was forking the coaches lawn; but not with just any old forks, these forks were special. For some reason the coach had this odd obsession with @CAPS14, so in spite of that a few of the @CAPS7 photo shopped his head onto the bodies of lawn @CAPS14. I was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible. I don't think I ever could have @CAPS16 up with something so clever. After that little stop we were onto the main event, the tee-peeing. We tried to tee-pee one of the brother's from the team, but there dad had already been waiting up. The other pair of brother's were next. All the cars slowly approached the culdesac, we lowered the the radios and shut off all the headlights. Just to be safe, everybody made sure to park at least four houses away and left all the doors open for a quick escape. Almost synchronized, everybody threw there first roll towards the the big tree on the side of the house. We kept missing and the rolls were would fall back down and unravel into the street, one could have called us the worst tee-peers ever. Then all of a sudden three figures came bolting @CAPS9 on skateboards with their own rolls of toilet paper yelling, ""@CAPS15! Get back here you forgot something!"". We were being ambushed! Sprinting back, we just barely made it to the cars. Still, something just didn't feel right. There was just this eerie feeling, like being in a horror movie. Then; suddenly, as we began to drive away, something big hit the car. In panic, @ORGANIZATION1 stopped the car and had to get @CAPS9 to make sure nobody had been hit. ""@CAPS16 get your toilet paper!"", a deep voice yelled. All the @CAPS7 started screaming in terror. What was going to happen now? What was even going on? Were we going to be killed? No,and fortunately we weren't killed that @CAPS8! In relief we discovered that it was only @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @LOCATION2, but I might as well have had a heart attack. Instantaneously, the whole group burst @CAPS9 in laughter and I had been laughing so"
255	21033	8	3	Laughter is an important part of life, bringing joy and connection to those around us. In high school, friendships can be a valuable source of support and laughter. While not having many friends, having a few close ones can make a significant impact. One such friend is @CAPS4, who introduced me to someone special, @CAPS11.  @CAPS11, a freshman when I was a sophomore, quickly became a close friend due to his humor and kindness. We shared moments of laughter, like at the school dance where he helped me overcome my worries. His presence and support made a difference, especially when we shared jokes and funny stories.  In my family, laughter is also a common occurrence, even through playful pranks. One memorable prank involved adding mustard to my sister's soda, leading to a hilarious reaction. While laughter can bring joy, it's important to be mindful not to hurt those we care about in the process.  Overall, laughter plays a vital role in relationships, creating bonds and happy memories. Whether with friends or family, finding moments of laughter can brighten even the toughest days. It's a reminder to cherish the moments of joy and connection that laughter brings.
256	21034	8	3	The day of my birthday, I found myself bored and unsure of what to do. After hours of failed attempts to make plans, my friend suggested grabbing something to eat. As we walked to a fast food restaurant, we stumbled upon a flier that led us to a surprise party planned just for me. It turns out, my friend had orchestrated the entire day, from the lack of phone answers to finding the flier, all to lead me to my own surprise celebration. It was a day filled with unexpected joy and laughter, and I couldn't have asked for a better way to ring in a new year of life.
257	21035	8	3	"My @CAPS1, my friend, and myself were driving down the road on our way to pick up a mutual friend for youth group that night. Our conversation was anything but special. We were mainly just telling stories of fun times that we had already had with our old friend, and looking forward to making some new ones together. She was such an amazing person. Always ready to crack a joke, make new friends, and have a good time. Her smile was cute, and she was bale to talk someone into doing anything.  As we pulled up to her house, we were thrilled to be able to see her again. It had been weeks since the last ""play date"", and we couldn't wait to be able to catch up with her. She walked out her front door and trotted to our car. The smile on her face was enough to tell us that the feeling, of being reunited, was mutual. Getting out of the car we received bear hugs from her. Times of fun we had had together were flashing in my minds eye, and I was hoping that there would be many more that I would be able to look back on one day. We all got in the car, pulled out of her neighborhood, and started down the road. I realized that we were going the wrong way. ""@CAPS1, we have to go back the other way, don't we?"" I asked. ""@CAPS2, but the barrier in the middle of the road won't let me make a @CAPS3 turn until up the street a little ways.""she said. ""@CAPS4, is that even legal?"" I asked, knowing the answer would be no. ""@CAPS5, I don't really have a choice now do I @CAPS6?"" I could hear the sarcasm in her voice. She could make her voice and appearance sound and look mean, but I knew that in reality, she was just messing around with me. The barrier dissipated, and she was getting ready to make the @CAPS3 turn. Cranking the wheel she was barely able to clear the end of the barrier, but was to late to be able to stop in time to clear the curb on the other side. She accidentally backed up onto the curb making those of us in the back seat jump, and sway, from the impact. My friends and I were all laughing, knowing that she was usually very careful, and had good driving skills. ""@CAPS8 everybody,"" she said. Her body language showing that she was having fun, but that she truly was @CAPS8 for giving us a jolt like that. Our reply was pure laughter. ""@CAPS5, I guess that's our fun for the month,"" she said, her eyes sparkling with joy about making us laugh. She was always very quick to make jokes about situations we were put in.  She pulled forward, the back fender scraping the curb again as we drove off it. Driving away, my friends and I were still laughing , replaying what had just happened to us in our minds eye. It was one of our fondest memories together. A continual joke that we can just mention, and burst into laughter because of it. ""@CAPS10 for the ride @PERSON1,"" my friends said as we got out of the car. We walked into youth group, laughing, knowing that this would be one of the many memories that we would cherish forever. Bringing us closer than ever before."
258	21036	8	3	"My best friend @CAPS1 and I have known each other since we were two years old. We've helped each other through good times and bad, and are there for each other like chocolate on a bad day. @CAPS1's best quality is the fact that she can make me laugh no matter what mood I'm in. This year @CAPS1 decided to go to @ORGANIZATION4's, an all girls @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, instead of continuing on to @ORGANIZATION1 like me. The first day of @ORGANIZATION2, I could feel that something was missing. @CAPS1. Without her cackling laugh ringing down the hallways, it felt oddly quiet. It reminded me of a place where we made most of our hilarious memories, and where we were told to ""shush"" a fair amount too. Our little brick @CAPS3 church!  Most @DATE1's, I stood up on the alter with the priest and helped him prepare the bread and such. And most @DATE1's, my best friend @CAPS1 was in the pews. One particular @DATE1 I will never forget, @CAPS1 thought it would be funny to sit in the front row with my family and make faces at me all throughout the mass. See @CAPS1, she has the power to make you laugh just by smiling at you. When she makes faces, I usually and up with tears in my eyes. I was standing up in front of the whole congregation and was using every ounce of self control I had not to bust out laughing. The congregation must have thought I was really being changed by the @CAPS8 because I had the biggest smile on my face.  I'm sure you've been in one of those situations where it feels like it is physically impossible to stop laughing. You have to bite you lip, think about something sad, or try breathing excercises. Every time I glanced in her direction a new wave of giggles washed over me, and every time I glanced in my mom's direction, her evil eye burned brighter. After what felt like eternity, the choir sang the closing hymn and once we left the building, I couldn't stop laughing for at least ten minutes. I had bitten my lip so hard that there were ridges indented on the inside of my mouth. Usually after church, we walk over to the @ORGANIZATION3 for coffee and doughnuts. We catch up on @ORGANIZATION2, and each others lives now that we don't see each other as often. She tells me about her new friends and I tell her about our old ones. I always look forward to hearing the hilariously stupid stories of her days, and I always inform her of the latest and greatest gossip from her hometown. But the thing that we always count on is a good laugh with a good friend.  Laughter keeps @CAPS1 and I close. If laughter really does add years to your life, we are probably going to be the two old ladies that live on the hill with twenty cats, and nobody really knows how old they are because they've been around forever. I can be myself around her and know that she accepts me because if I do something stupid I know she'll laugh and then we'll go play with her cat, @LOCATION2, or make popcorn and watch @ORGANIZATION2 three. My family must be tired of our never-ending inside jokes. When I laugh, it feels like liquid gold is bubbling in my stomach and everything is at peace in the world. It is one of the most comforting feelings in the world. That's what I feel when I'm laughing with my best friend @CAPS1. And even though we're miles apart now, our laughter will always keep us connected, no matter where life takes us."
259	21037	8	3	"Shafts of light escape through fogged windows casting a shadowed glare upon the surface of the table. A tremendous sign hovers on a wide oak shelf that borders the entire dining area. ""@CAPS1's"" reads in great letters buried under decades of dust. My eyes dance among the plethora of mismatched antiques and statues strung throughout the room, easily filling every crevice. These objects form a family of outliers, each individually unique, belonging to the restaurant. Huge posters of All-@CAPS2 athletes tower among large flat screens, while an acrid scent of molded wood and fermented beer lingers. Numerous bras fall from the ceiling of the bar that sits next to the entrance. The sound of crunching echoes in my ears as waitresses maneuver over fallen peanut shells. That's what sets this place apart from the others. The entire floor is littered with barrels of peanut shells and mashed peanuts as it is custom for the customers to throw them on the ground. Of course, there's my family; a vivacious group of five squeezing our round frames into a booth that comfortably seats four. We seem to mesh quite nicely with the crowd of miscellaneous objects, dressed in our ""Today's Special"" attire of skirts and dress suits. Distracted, I busy myself with the menu, browsing for something with a little zest and a lot of calories. A loud smashing noise breaks my attention, and I slide the newspaper-style menu below my eyes. Across the table sits my grandmother, a petite old lady standing proudly at 92, who devotes her free time to attempting stand-up comedy. I study the glass jar of ketchup she's holding and watch her pound the corner on a single peanut. The shell cracks open, and she picks out the nuts, sweeping its kernels onto the floor. I giggle to myself, surprised at the lengths this old lady is willing to go to. She proceeds to repeat this process with ten more peanuts until the entire family has stopped in curiosity. Looking up, she pauses with the jar suspended in her hand. ""What? I'm just trying new ways of cracking open the nut,"" she exclaims, pausing for a comical response. With no reaction, we resume contemplating our meal choices. Minutes later, a hefty waitress reeking of drugstore perfume and last night's hangover sets down glasses of water and drags off sluggishly. Raising his glass, my father motions for us to follow. ""Cheers!"" he calls, clinking each of our glasses in turn. ""Cheers! And cheers to cherry people!"" my grandmother pitches in. ""Oh, dear!"" I shout automatically. Immediately, my parents chuckle because my grandmother has never been funny. It's a joke that nobody in the family laughs at her comments but herself, and that's how it remains. Years ago, my brother deemed her jokes the ""Oh, dear!"" because she poses as a comedian but truly isn't. From then on, each time she would crack a ""joke,"" someone was quick to respond with yelling ""Oh, dear!"" To this day, she has neither improved nor given up daily opportunities to attempt to win over her audience. In quiet defeat, she chuckles to herself and focuses back on the menu. Seconds later, she's back in the ring for round two. ""It's noon. So are we having breakfast or lunch? Or should we have... brunch?! I'm dying here, just laugh already,"" she pleads. For a moment, we all just stare at her. Innocent eyes gaze back; the predator calmly sits awaiting the move of its prey. Then, as if a switch had been flipped, we eye each other, and the ribbon is cut. Tea party giggles erupt into hoarse cries as rolls of thunderous laughter echo through the room. I hand my mother a napkin, which she uses to dab jubilant tears. The thick wooden table shutters under the pound of my father's fist slapping the surface in hysteria. I laugh so hard my gut aches, and yet I cannot understand why everything is so funny. All the while, my grandmother sits in pure delight, tickled by the success of finally earning a sincere response to her notorious off-the-cuff ""jokes."" It's a wonder we aren't thrown out of the restaurant. Customers in surrounding booths peer over the edge of their bench, eying us with distaste. However, this isn't the first and certainly won't be the last time my family causes a scene. Plain yet obnoxious jokes are a loosely run camaraderie in our family that always finds its spot in our books of lasting memoirs. The remainder of the meal was spent in bursts of giggles, and we were more than kindly shown out the door once our meal was finished. It's when you break into hysterics for no monumental reason and can't get through retelling it to someone"
260	21038	8	3	"A long time ago, my family and I went to the lake to see my great aunt and uncle. They had a log cabin right on the lake, with an teepee in the back yard. They had a dock with a very big nice boat. I had went with my mom, my other aunt, and my two half sisters. I forgot why we went, but I think it was just because it was the weekend and my great aunt and uncle were getting older. I was very young, and I only remember bits and pieces of the trip. I remember watching cartoons with my sister on the couch, watching ""SpongeBob"" in our bedroom, having my sisters make me watch my first scary movie (I hate scary movies), going to a go-cart track and driving for the first time, taking one of the extra little boats and going on the lake with one of my older half sisters, also taking the big boat and riding around the lake with my great uncle, he would turn in circles and we would jump on the wave to make the ride more fun! We get around to the 4th of July, and they were selling illegal fireworks all around the state for the event of course. I remember sitting in the car with my two half sisters, and my mom had gotten out of the car to go and get fireworks from a stand on the side of the road. We were all tired from something, and we all stayed in the car. Outside the little stand where they sold the fireworks was this blow-up balloon guy; you know one of those blow-up looking things where it has a face on it and it doesn't stop moving and dancing? Anyways, my oldest half sister starts saying ""look there he goes doing the macarena!"" I had no idea what she was talking about until she pointed to the blow-up guy who was just wiggling and springing to life every second. Then my other half sister joins in and starts saying ""and now he's doing the mashed potato!"" and now I'm laughing because it's just so silly and funny, I actually thought he was dancing and doing all these dance moves! Now everyone in the car is laughing and giggling about something silly and funny, I mean we were throwing out silly dance moves, some not even dances moves, just random objects! ""THE worm!"" ""THE robot!"" ""THE sprinkler!"" we could not stop laughing! When my mom got in the car she was like ""what happened?!"". I tried to explain to her it was funny but she didn't get it. I guess you just had to be there to be a part of the ridiculous car stop at the side of the road where they sold fireworks to see why it was so funny!"
261	21039	8	3	"Laughter can be a very important thing in everyone's life because it can help in many ways. It has helped me get through emotional problems with ex-boyfriends. My mom once told me that ""laughter is the best medicine,"" and now I understand that dwelling on heartbreak is pointless. Making the people around me laugh and smile creates the best memories. Even a simple laugh or smile can make someone feel better and brighten their day. However, fake laughter can be hurtful, as it may come from insincere intentions. I try to make those I care about smile because it makes me happy to know I've made a positive impact on their day. My baby sister's constant laughter is infectious and reminds me of the power of a simple smile. While laughter can be a source of joy and relief, it's important to remember not to laugh at the expense of others' pain. Ultimately, laughter can have both positive and negative impacts, depending on the intentions behind it."
262	21042	8	3	I personally believe that laughter is essential in any relationship. It has the power to bring joy, relieve stress, and strengthen connections between people. In my relationship with my toddler daughter, laughter plays a crucial role in turning difficult moments into lighthearted ones. Even in the midst of stress and frustration, her funny antics or cute expressions never fail to make me smile and laugh, easing the tension and bringing us closer together. Laughter is a universal language that can bridge gaps and create bonds, whether it's with a child, a partner, or a friend. It has the ability to uplift spirits, improve moods, and create lasting memories. In times of sadness or hardship, a good laugh can provide much-needed relief and perspective, reminding us to focus on the positive aspects of life. Overall, laughter is a powerful tool that can enhance relationships, foster happiness, and promote emotional well-being. So, let's embrace laughter in all our relationships and reap its many benefits for a more fulfilling and joyful life.
263	21043	8	3	"@LOCATION2 @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 wants to travel, and while traveling is fun, it is more exciting to go with people you love, but sometimes you go somewhere with people you @MONTH1 not know very well. Every two years or so, the choir at my @ORGANIZATION1 has an opportunity to go on a trip together. During these trips, the students are able to work with college professors, eat tons of junk food, get away from their parents, and just have a great time together. It's a experience that every @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 dreams of. At the beginning of my @CAPS3 year of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, my choir director announced that we would have the opportunity to go to @LOCATION2. I was ecstatic to be going, but I'm an extremely introverted person and I knew that I didn't really have any friends in the choir. I also can't walk, and was scared I would be left behind in a store because I couldn't open the doors or they would go across a street corner that didn't have a @CAPS5 dip down into the street, and thousands of other things that were racing through my mind. I was so terrified that that I would be separated from @PERSON3, my one friend who was in choir, that I almost didn't go. I'm not really sure how, but my mother convinced me that everything would be alright, and I had nothing to fear. Once we arrived in @LOCATION2, we split up into groups to see who wanted to go to explore the @PERSON7 and who wanted to go up @ORGANIZATION2 street, one of the windiest roads in the world. My worst nightmare came true, I was separated from @LOCATION3. I tried to tell myself that nothing would go wrong and that the chaperons wouldn't leave me behind, but in the back of my mind I just kept coming to the same conclusion: I would be alone with a bunch of strangers in a city I knew nothing about. Somehow, I got on the bus that was slowly taking me away from @LOCATION3. One of the other girls, @PERSON4, came to sit by me, and attempted to start a conversation. That was one of the longest bus rides of my life. When we arrived at the bottom of @ORGANIZATION2 street we split yet again, one group was going to walk to the top of the steep hill and the other was going to ride in one of the old trolleys up to the top then walk down where the hill wasn't as steep. I was forced to go on the trolley because the hill was so steep part of the sidewalk contained steps, and since I can't walk, the only alternative was the trolly. Several of the other kids went with us and once again @PERSON4 was in my group. A couple hours later, after getting lost and turning on several wrong streets, we found the trolley station and bought our tickets. Luckily, I managed to avoid conversing with @PERSON4 this whole time, so the ride up the hill was enjoyable. Some of the local people smiled at us because we were so excited to be riding on the trolley. We saw houses, stores, and @LOCATION1 on our ride.  There were six people in our group at the time, two chaperons and four kids. Once we reached the top of the hill, two of the kids, @PERSON6 and @PERSON5, decided they really had to go to the bathroom, so one of the chaperons, @PERSON6, and @PERSON5 raced back down the hill to find a public restroom. This left me, alone, with @PERSON4 and @PERSON1, who was the remaining chaperon. We walked leisurely down the hill, @PERSON2 and @PERSON4 doing most of the talking. Every so often they would ask me a question and I would answer in as few words as possible, and that's what was going on when we walked past a group of men, arguing, in front of a store and one of them yelled, ""@CAPS4, @CAPS5 @CAPS6! Whatcha doing? You goin' to your @CAPS7's house?"" We didn't really know who he was talking to, or what he was talking about, so we just kept walking, but as we reached the end of the block @PERSON4 and I simultaneously broke into laughter. The man was talking about me. The rest of the way down the hill we started coming up with different weird responses that I should have said to the man, each one being more hilarious than the last one, and as conversations go, we eventually got on different topics, which made me realize that @PERSON4 and I really did have many similar traits. We"

Laughter is an important part of any friendship or relationship. One time when laughter help me out the most was the during fourth grade. Fourth grade had brought so many ups and downs with it which none of us knew it would. My friends and I had the biggest fight over the littlest reason. This fight included my best friend @PERSON2, also my neighbor, @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. We all were very close until this fight which was over my favorite sport, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Everyone had their sides, @PERSON4 sided with @PERSON2 and I was all alone. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 didn't side with anyone they just wanted us to get along. It was the hardest for @DATE2 and I because we were best friends and did everything together. All the students in our class knew that and could not believe we had a huge fight. @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 would try as hard as possible to hang out with both of us but somehow it didn't seem like that to @LOCATION1 and I. We both thought that @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 were never hanging out with us.  Soon enough our teacher and student teacher had called our parents to tell them about this fight. I remember every other day someone would go home crying. Our parents had a meeting with our teachers and principal to discuss how they can help us. They concluded with the fact that @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I would being going to see a councilor. @PERSON3 on the other hand got out of seeing the councilor. We found this out when our teacher announced it to the whole class. As @PERSON1 remembers it ""That was the first time, in a long time, you and @PERSON2 actually talked!"" @CAPS3 @PERSON2 or I remember talking but I guess change had start to come. When we went to the councler she was very nice and talked to us in a way we all felt comfortable. She asked us what we missed most about our friendship and all three of us answered laughing. We said that we laughed every day and now we go home crying. She asked us if we liked to play games during the times we used to spend together, we answered yes. She let us play games, such as monopoly, which was really fun. At the end of the day the three of us went back to class smiling and laughing. When we entered the classroom everyone was surprised that we were actually getting along. After school I went home and my mom asked me how the councling session had gone. I smiled and said we all had a blast! The next day the three of us went back to the councler and played more games. This session also we would be writing a paper about how the fight had changed us. When we were done writing, all of us read the paper to one another. All having the same message: I wish this had never happened, I miss the laughing, and I will laugh about this fight in the future.  To most extent this message was very true. @DATE1, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I are still best friends. Yes, we tell this story to everyone and laugh every time. Most of our friends reactions are shocking because they cant believe we had a fight or they just laugh at how stupid the fight was. Most of our friends ask what the moral of the story was and we simply say ""don't let any little thing get in the way of your friendship and remember to laugh about the good times."" In most ways laughing about this silly fight has brought all of us closer and kept us together. Now we have more and more things we can laugh about.  Every friendship has its ups and downs and along with those comes laughter or crying. In the end the only way that you and your friends can be closer is to laugh. Never miss a moment or second guess a change with your friends. They are always going to be with you along the journey of life and laughter is the key. Laughing with friends can strengthen bonds and create lasting memories, helping us navigate through tough times with a smile on our faces."
265	21045	8	3	Benefits of laughter are numerous, ranging from improving mood and mediating conflicts to even providing health benefits. In times of sadness or loss, laughter can help ease the pain and bring people together. In a situation where a friend's mother passed away, laughter played a crucial role in lifting spirits and providing comfort. Being able to make others laugh and see them in a good mood can create a positive atmosphere and strengthen bonds of friendship. Laughter, along with trust and respect, serves as a unifying force among friends, helping them navigate difficult times and find moments of joy amidst sorrow.
266	21049	8	3	The first time I heard about the sport of cross country was at the beginning of my freshman year. I had initially planned to play volleyball in high school, but after realizing it wasn't what I expected, I decided to join the cross country team instead. I was nervous on my first day of practice, but my coach reassured me and emphasized the individual aspects of the sport. As the season progressed, I grew to love cross country and looked forward to practice every day. One of my favorite races was the @CAPS5 @CAPS6, which was full of challenging obstacles like mud pits and steep hills. Despite my nerves, I had a great time and bonded with my teammates. Throughout my freshman year, laughter was a key component of our team dynamic. It brought us together, made practices enjoyable, and strengthened our friendships. Without laughter, our team wouldn't have been as happy or motivated. Cross country has taught me the importance of camaraderie and enjoying the journey together.
267	21051	8	3	"One of the most oddest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything. @CAPS1 what I see most is laughing. There is that laugh you do when you don't really understand your bosses joke and then there is that laugh that you do when it really isn't the ""right time."" @CAPS1 one of my favorite is laughing at your best friend when your crying. Sitting on the train a few weeks ago, I saw a lady with her friend sobbing about how her boyfriend just recently broke up with her. Quietly turning over my shoulder I try to hear more of the story. Her friend nodded and comfort her. @CAPS1 then said something about how gross it was when he ate. Sort of like a cow eating grass. As soon her friend said this the girls face blushed and she giggled with laughter. @CAPS1 still her eyes were red as she sniffled a little. @CAPS1 a slow smile washed over her face. The woman had more of giggle then a laugh. @CAPS1 you could tell the girl was going to be okay because she had someone to make her laugh and remember life is more then just a guy. I thought for a second how this happens more then you think with my best friend. I feel like now even that seven years have gone by it never gets old when we bust out laughing. Most of the time it's something stupid and we are just strangely thinking the same thing. @CAPS1 then there's other times where it will be like the lady's behind me. One of us is upset and we know the perfect thing to say to each other. Friendship is like that. And laughter is the medicine to any problem. After watching the two woman I turn in front of me seeing now a teenage boy and girl. The girl looks slightly nervous as she keeps smoothing her skirt out. Then the boy who keeps shaking his knee up an down. And you can tell he's trying to think of something to say while he keeps taking quick sips from his water bottle. The girl finally pointed out the window and said something about when she was a girl she would play soccer there. He looked where she was pointing and said he thought he maybe played baseball there one time. She nodded her head and they got silent again. The train came to it's next stop jerking a little making the boy spill some of his water on his pants. The girl quickly pulled some tissues out of her purse giving them to the boy. His cheeks flushed with red as he started to chuckle and explaining how nervous he was and this wasn't going to help. The girl stared at him and quickly started to smile. Then they both began to look at each other and started to laugh. The boys laugh was deep and echoed across the train the girls was contagious @CAPS1 sweet. Now the ice had been broken because of one awkward moment and had them both talking and laughing. This was the start of could maybe be even young love. I smiled and rested my head on the window. Watching the trees blur by. I knew how our world is always talked about being so melancholy @CAPS1 I think people forget moments like this. It's those brief seconds with another human relating to you. Making you laugh and caring enough to try to make you feel better that keeps our world from completely going insane. The train slams and starts to slow down as it comes to a stop. I slouch my bag on to my shoulder and get off the train. As I step outside I feel the cool air kiss my cheeks. I looked around see people hurry by me looking for their next bus or person to pick them up. I sit down on the bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands as they walk by me. As they smile and talk everything suddenly goes dark. I throw my hands up to my eyes connecting with another big cold hands. I snap around to see the person who had blinded me. It was my dad smiling ear to ear. I stood up on the bench and hugged him as I started to laugh. My laugh was high pitched @CAPS1 muffled in my dads coat. This was the best type of laugh to me. No action was funny or a friend saying something @CAPS1 because your so happy sometimes you just have to let out a little bit of joy. You just laugh, not for any reason @CAPS1 because your happy. And then in that second everything bad or what you stressed about goes away. Maybe just for a little awhile @CAPS1 it's still something that could make your whole day better. I realized that laughter is truly the best medicine, connecting people and bringing joy in the simplest of moments."
268	21052	8	3	All of us know how to laugh, and we have all probably laughed at least once in our lives. But I never laughed as hard as I did the day my friend @CAPS1 and I were waiting for our friends @LOCATION1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3 to come back from getting @PERSON3 from @LOCATION3 to hang out for a while. @PERSON1 had to wait at my house for them to return, and I was wondering what we would do alone. When @PERSON1 arrived, we had to stay outside in the shop because my @CAPS3 had a cold. We talked about our favorite TV commercials, and @PERSON1 even started dancing to describe her favorite commercial with hamsters. It was funny and a bit strange, but it made us laugh a lot. @PERSON1's energy and humor made the time fly by, and when our other friends arrived, we had a great time together. @PERSON1's presence always brings joy and laughter, and I'm grateful to have such a wonderful friend. The night was filled with laughter, silliness, and unforgettable memories, thanks to @CAPS1. I cherish our friendship and feel lucky to have her in my life.
269	21053	8	3	"I live in a life full of laughter, I can not think of a day that I have not laughed. Even when I went through the hardest days of my life a little while ago, there was still someone to make me laugh or a reason to laugh. I think laughing is the best medicine for a person. If you are someone that can go a day without laughing, I'd love to meet you and make that change! There are a few particular times I can remember that were just full of laughter, most involving family and friends. The first one that I can remember was when my parents showed me a picture of when I was a little girl, there are many laughing episodes when it comes to me as a little kid. The picture they showed me was when it was Christmas time and I had no shirt, just shorts on. I was sitting on a sled, facing uphill, with the sun just shining. I cannot explain how hard my family and I laughed together just from looking at one picture. Another laughing moment I can remember was not when it happened but when I look back now all I can think to myself is, wow. I was about six years old at my best friend's house who owned eight llamas, who got to get tied up in the yard every day. The one I always got to walk was named, Lulu. Lulu was sweet, or so I thought, until one fateful day she decided to drag me across a highway. While I was getting dragged across a usually busy highway, all I could hear was people yelling ""let go of her lead!"" However, being six, I thought if I let go that the llama would get hit by a car or never come back. I regretted not letting go once an adult got to me because I was all scraped up and blistered from being dragged across the pavement. That is a time in my life I will always look back on and laugh at, but never forget. The last one, my favorite times in life. This would be pretty much any time I am with my boyfriend. My favorite time was our trip to the beach for the first time. We had never been there together, but it was amazing! We attempted to ride bikes on the sand, failed, and just laughed about it. Then we decided to just walk around all the beach stores and see if we could find something we might have wanted to buy. Later that day we just went to the beach, walked, and felt amazing. The funny part of this trip was when we were trying to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the ocean behind us. People were looking at us like we were crazy, but we didn't care because we were having fun and laughing almost the whole time! I think that laughing is a very important part of everyday life, for everyone. If you don't laugh at least once a day, then something is wrong. I love looking back at pictures from when I was little, having memories with best friends and their animals, as well as taking trips and just being with my boyfriend. Laughing has helped me a lot in life because it brings me up when I am feeling down."
270	21054	8	3	Laughter is the best medicine, and it's true that sometimes we just need to find the humor in a situation to make everything feel okay. I remember a time when a simple mistake led to a series of unfortunate events, but through it all, the laughter of children brought light to the situation. Despite the stress of being locked out of a running car in a parking lot, the kids found joy in reenacting the scene and making light of the situation. Their laughter was infectious, and it reminded me that sometimes we just need to find the humor in life's mishaps to keep going. Laughter truly is a powerful tool that can bring happiness and light to even the darkest of days.
271	21055	8	3	Laughter is a vital element in forming and strengthening connections with others. It is a universal language that brings people together and creates bonds that can last a lifetime. From the moment we are born, laughter is ingrained in us as a natural response to joy and amusement. Making someone laugh can instantly break down barriers and pave the way for a deeper relationship. In a work setting, being able to share laughter with colleagues can foster a sense of camaraderie and teamwork. For example, at a daycare, being able to make both the staff and children laugh can create a positive and welcoming environment. Laughter not only helps to build trust and comfort but also has numerous health benefits, serving as a form of exercise and stress relief. In essence, laughter has the power to uplift spirits, strengthen connections, and bring joy to both the giver and receiver. The ability to make others laugh is a gift that can truly brighten someone's day and make a difference in their life.
272	21056	8	3	"Laughter, joy, and togetherness on an autumn day with the Smith family. One of my favorite autumn traditions is the visit to the house of our friends, the Smiths. They live on eighty forested and meadowed acres outside of a quaint, old town. Their small green house overlooks brown fields and a blue pond, with tall trees forming a backdrop. We arrive midmorning. We either find our friends in the house or encounter them tromping out of the woods to meet us, shovels, chainsaws, and other trailbuilding implements in their hands. After the customary hello, how have you been, we often wander around the yard, exclaiming at the new fruit trees or hearing stories about the latest tenants of the birdhouses.  During the hottest part of the day, we head for the shade of the lush woods. A short walk will bring us to a trail. I love walking among the sun-streaked ferns and fallen logs, treading carefully on the rickety bridges over burbling streams, bouncing confidently on the sturdy new bridges, and trying to avoid the dogs as they galumph in and out of the water. Mr. Smith knows all about the flora and fauna of the region, so we get a constant stream of knowledge as we hike. He also, of course, has to tell us about the trees he's planted -- a redwood here (look how well it's doing! A foot since last fall!) and a douglas fir over there (not as well. That big redwood is shading it too much). One of the best parts of the hike is when we see the dead-end section of trail that my family helped construct three years ago. We always walk to the end of it and discuss where it could go from there -- over the stream or beside it, or up the hill and if so, where would the switchbacks be? could you really bike up a trail like that?  After our walk, we arrive back at the house, sweaty and talkative. Then it's time to put on swimsuits and jump in the pond! They recently built a dock that we can jump off of -- a great improvement over wading in from the edge. We swim for the majority of the afternoon, racing from one end of the pond to the other, splashing on innertubes, having pondweed-throwing battles. Finally, we get tired and sit by the side of the pond, drying off in the warm sun.  By evening, dinner is ready. Laura usually makes salmon, accompanied by a plethora of delicious side dishes. We drag chairs out to the hill above the pond and enjoy a leisurely supper. From the hill, we can see turtles and birds on the pond, bugs over the fields, and more birds swooping through the air feasting on the aforementioned bugs. After the meal, we haul chairs and dishes back to the house and sit on the porch into the night.  Mr. Smith's favorite part of the evening is at dusk, when the sun is at just the right angle to show all the bugs swirling through the air. At one point, all the bugs gather together and create a tornado, twisting upwards into the darkening sky, and then -- they're gone, until the next day. It's an incredible spectacle; thousands of tiny insects disappearing at once.  The best thing about these days is the friendship and camaraderie we have with this wonderful family. The parents knew each other long before us kids were born, so we have a lot to talk about; Mr. Smith is very interested in science topics, and he always finds a way to bring up the latest article he read. And, as with all great friends, we laugh constantly. I consistently get hiccups at least three times just when we're lounging on the porch after our busy day. Even on the most serious topics, my dad or the Smith boys can find a joke to make, usually ""politically incorrect"" but always very funny.  Now don't even get me started on the camping trips, winter ski trips, or autumn cider pressing we do with the Smiths."
273	21057	8	3	"Misunderstood ""@CAPS1 the heck is her problem,"" is @CAPS1 I thought as I glanced over and @CAPS7 gave me @CAPS15 nasty look. @CAPS27 obviously thought the new girl was weird. @CAPS7 @CAPS24 had @CAPS15 killer look in her eyes. I observed the way @CAPS7 glared at @CAPS27 in the room, and how her facial expression never changed. ""@CAPS2 huh,"" my cousin, @PERSON1, asked while staring at @CAPS3, who was, of course, the new girl. I glanced over at @CAPS3 and then back at @LOCATION1. ""@CAPS5 on! @CAPS11 can say @CAPS26! @CAPS7 can't hear us,"" @CAPS7 whispered. @PERSON1's whispers weren't exactly as quiet as @CAPS7 thought. @CAPS3 could probably hear everything we were saying. I glanced over at her again, and I noticed behind those cold eyes, @CAPS7 seemed kinda lonely and sad. I guess @CAPS26's possible, @CAPS7 has been the talk of the whole @NUM1 grade class since @CAPS7 arrived about @NUM2 days ago. ""@CAPS6 hello! Taylor? Are @CAPS11 there?"" @CAPS7 was now in my face and view of @CAPS3.  ""@CAPS7 does look @CAPS2 on the outside, but maybe @CAPS7 is actually a nice person,"" is @CAPS1 I said, but I knew @CAPS15 would not satisfy @PERSON1 at all. ""@CAPS1? Definitely not. Her parents probably belong to some mafia or something. @CAPS7 gives off that type of aura."" ""@CAPS11 shouldn't judge someone @CAPS31 their looks,"" I responded. @PERSON1 gave me @CAPS15 sort of confusing look. ""I mean, @CAPS11 never know unless @CAPS11 ask.""  ""@CAPS12 if your such the expert on @CAPS26 why don't @CAPS11 go sit with her at lunch, and ask her."" @CAPS13 man. There was @CAPS29 way I could possibly do that. I know I @CAPS24 said not to judge someone @CAPS31 their appearance, but @CAPS7 looks like if I even open my mouth to speak to her @CAPS7 will kick me in the shins. @CAPS1 a predicament @CAPS15 is. ""@CAPS14't @CAPS11 the one who wants to get to know her? @CAPS11 ask."" @CAPS15 one won't @CAPS31 past @PERSON1 either. ""@CAPS16? @CAPS29 way. We already decided @CAPS11 were going to ask. @CAPS11 can't @CAPS5 back with the same thing,"" @CAPS7 argued. @PERSON1 is a very stubborn girl, and though @CAPS7 likes to pick on me, @CAPS7 really is a nice person. Also, despite her obnoxious exterior @CAPS7 has a lot of friends, unlike myself who is shy.  ""@CAPS17,"" I muttered. I had to give in. @CAPS29 matter @CAPS1 I say, I am going to have to face @CAPS3.  ""That's @CAPS1 I thought. @CAPS26's a good opportunity to make a new friend. I am @CAPS24 helping @CAPS11 out."" @CAPS7 had @CAPS15 mischievous grin on her face. I glanced over at @CAPS3 one last time, and then at the clock. @CAPS26 was @NUM3 in the morning, give or take a minute or two since I am nearsighted, but lunch is at @NUM4.  I couldn't pay attention at all during class. I was too busy playing out possible scenes that might occur at lunch. Maybe @CAPS7 isn't mean, maybe @CAPS7 is actually nice, and people are @CAPS24 misunderstanding, including me. That aside, I don't even know @CAPS1 to say; I can't @CAPS24 casually walk up, sit down in front her, look her in the eye, smile and say ""@CAPS21. How are @CAPS11?"" The impossible is @CAPS24 impossible and people should @CAPS24 except @CAPS26, in fact @CAPS26 should actually be a fundamental law. I looked over at the clock again, @CAPS26 was now @NUM5 and still ticking. ""@NUM6 minutes,"" @PERSON1"
274	21058	8	3	"It is often said that laughter can bring people together. We've all laughed at one point in our lives, whether it was in a group of people, or just laughing, and having a good time. Reality is we are all connected to each other in one very simple way, we all have laughed in our lives. Laughter to everyone means something different. To some, laughter can mean that they're happy and full of life, and other times it can simply mean that they really don't know what to do. There's one time, though, that it meant both. It was a cold and rainy day in April. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends, typically that means we're talking about the latest thing - guys, hair, and whatever else.  ""I'm gosh!"" we heard someone scream as two of my friends walked into my room. ""Oh boy,"" I thought, ""here we go again. I knew it would be a mistake to have both of them over at the same time."" My friend and I exchanged glances, and I knew she had the same thought going through her head. ""Alright, what happened this time?"" my friend sighed as we entered the room only to see the two of them going at each other, violently tugging each other's hair, slapping each other, and doing everything imaginable to each other before I lost it. I hate seeing my friends fighting at each other the way they were.  ""What's going on?"" I finally yelled. ""It's what are we going to do. You,"" I pointed to one of them, ""come and sit over there."" The other friend walked out of my room and sat down. ""Alright, guys, can't you two just relax and enjoy this time and act like you two are friends? For at least another six hours?"" I looked at each of them, and they nodded in response. ""Alright, let's just finish the rest of this movie, or play a nice quiet game."" I sighed, hoping the worst was over.  When they had left and the door was closed, I let out a sigh of relief. I couldn't help but give out a chuckle, and soon, we were all laughing at the situation. The tension in the air dissipated, and we were able to enjoy the rest of the day peacefully. Laughter truly has a way of bringing people together, even in the most challenging of situations."
275	21059	8	3	Laughter is indeed a crucial aspect of life, offering a sense of joy and connection between individuals. In my family, humor plays a significant role in bonding us together and creating moments of happiness. Whether it's quoting favorite comedians or sharing funny stories, we always find ways to bring laughter into our daily lives. Even during difficult times, such as the tragic loss of a neighbor, we turn to humor as a way to cope and find solace in each other's company. The ability to share laughter not only strengthens our familial relationships but also forms connections with others, bridging the gap between strangers and fostering new friendships. Ultimately, laughter serves as a powerful tool in bringing people closer together and enhancing the quality of human interactions.
276	21060	8	3	The human brain is truly remarkable in its ability to experience and process a wide range of emotions. One of the most valuable functions of the brain is its capacity for humor and laughter. Laughter serves as a coping mechanism for the challenges and difficulties that life presents us with. It allows us to find joy and happiness in even the most trying situations.   Having a sense of humor can bring people together and create lasting bonds. It enables us to see the lighter side of life and not take things too seriously. Even in moments of conflict or mischief, a shared laugh can bridge the gap and bring about forgiveness and understanding.   In a humorous yet chaotic hotel prank, friends found themselves covered in toothpaste, coins, and shampoo. Despite the initial shock and anger, they eventually found themselves laughing at the absurdity of the situation. This experience taught them that no matter what challenges or disagreements may arise, a sense of humor can always prevail and bring about peace and unity.   Ultimately, the ability to find humor in life is a valuable gift that can bring joy and connection to our relationships. It reminds us that no matter what life throws at us, laughter can always serve as a beacon of hope and positivity.

I ran to the kitchen where my parents were. My dad asked me if I wanted to go to work with him and i said yes. My dad is a roofer so i couldn't go on top of the houses because i was to young. I had to stay on the bottom and pick up trash that they would throw. I was doing that for a while, then i got my soccer ball out of my dads truck and i started running around kicking the ball. As i was running i noticed this slippery spot. I had in mind not to go there but i forgot and i stepped on the slippery spot. i fell but while i was falling some how i kicked the soccer ball and it hit the wall and it came back to hit me in the face. My dad and uncles were laughing their lungs out while i was turning red and embarrassed. They were telling me how funny it would be if it was slow motion.i was so embarrassed i put the ball back in my dads truck and i went back to work. The sun was coming down, and we were heading home. we arrived at my house and i walk towards the house door and i opened it and i hear ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2, i looked around and my friends and family were there. the reason my dad took me to work was because my mom was going to throw me a @CAPS1 party.i go and say hi to my family and friends. Then i went to go take a shower, iwas in the shower putting soap when all of a sudden the lights go out. I got scared and screamedas loud as i could. I ran out of the bathroom. Went to the the living room and the lights turn back on. My family and friends looked at me and started to laugh. In my head im thinking why are they laughing at me? I looked down and im naked. Everybody was laughing and enjoying the moment, while i was turning pitch red and about to cry. I ran to my room, i put some clothes on. I went back to the living room and i enjoyed my party. It was a birthday filled with laughter and embarrassing moments that I will never forget."
278	21063	8	3	What would you do in a world with constant laughter? Every day, everyone smiles or laughs, making people feel better. Laughter is like a healthy drug that has a positive impact on both oneself and others. There have been many instances in my life where a simple laugh was all I needed to uplift my spirits. For example, when I moved to a new high school, feeling lonely and isolated, all I craved was someone to make me smile and ease my loneliness. The first day at the new school was dreadful, with no one talking to me. However, my friends surprised me by showing up after school, cracking jokes and making me laugh. Their presence instantly turned my day around, and I found myself smiling and feeling genuinely happy again. Their laughter and jokes reminded me of who I was and encouraged me to be myself, ultimately helping me make new friends and enjoy my high school experience. Laughter truly has the power to dispel unhappiness and bring people together, making it the key to happiness in life.
279	21064	8	3	"@PERSON1 of laughter     Once upon a time there once lived a girl named @PERSON1. The year was two thousand and fourty eight and there were only a few people that were alive after @DATE1, that's when the world ended. @PERSON1's friend @PERSON2 was a huge @CAPS1 freak. She would, by herself, make funny videos and put them on @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. One day she was so bored that she went and sat in front of her computer camera and made an ""I'm a @ORGANIZATION1"" video. It was the funniest thing @PERSON1 had ever seen. She was wearing a @ORGANIZATION1 hat that was part of the @CAPS1 uniform, and was wearing a @CAPS1 shirt with some of the known characters. @PERSON2 was singing, ""I'm a @ORGANIZATION1. I'm a little @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. I'm slitherin' slitherin' in the garden, snatching me up a mouse, a mousey mouse. I'm going to move my tongue to taste you."" Once she was finished, she posted it on the website. @PERSON1 showed all her friends what an epic failure that video was, but @PERSON2, of course, loved it and so did @PERSON1.      Once the video wasn't that cool or funny anymore, which took about two and a half days, no one really watched it and no one really laughed about it, which it was made for that purpose. But when someone would watch it for the first time, they would go to school, laugh their butts off, and feel like an idiot because everybody had already watched it, and they didn't think it was funny anymore. So from then on, people called this kid all sorts of names, but the one that really stuck was @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone in @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2's friend group all laughed, and if @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 didn't laugh, their friends would call them losers because they weren't laughing at the kid who was getting teased. Laughing at someone being teased isn't funny. The reason why people laugh and put down others is because they are insecure about themselves, and it's not a laughing matter.      When people watch the video of @PERSON2 saying she was a @ORGANIZATION1, that was made to make people laugh and to be funny, it didn't mean the rude words people say should be used to put others down. Laughing is a key thing in a conversation, but it's also healthy for people to laugh. If others see that people are getting made fun of, it's not a time to laugh at them. It may be funny in some cases, but put yourself in that person's shoes, feel what they are feeling. When people say rude and hurtful things, people could stop the people who are throwing out put-downs and stand up for the ones who are getting their feelings hurt. Laughing was made for things that are actually funny.        Say you walk down the street on a sidewalk, and you walk by these punk kids who think they are the bee's knees, and they are poking sticks and throwing bottles and trash at a homeless man with his dog, while the man is on the ground in pain from these kids kicking him to where he can't move. Are you just going to walk by and laugh because you think it's funny? No, you're going to walk, or run, over to the poor man and see if he is okay. Then you might call the police and see if they can find the kids who did this to this poor old man. Laughing at people who are down because of words or getting beat up isn't right, and people need to stop. This is a world where if you are one of the last few people on the planet, and they have known you for laughing at others' pain, do you really think they are going to help you, or just walk by and laugh like you have? People are cruel in this world, and we all need someone who is going to help us if we are hurt or down because of hurtful words.      One way you benefit from laughter is that you feel good, and you have people who will help you in times of need, if you laugh about the right things. Tell your friends that if they laugh at people's pain and anger, one of these days no one is going to be there to stand up for them. You could be the change we need in schools, in work environments, in life in general. Be the change for your kids and grandkids, for your future friends, for the future world. Laugh at the right things and stand up for those who are hurting. Let's create a world"

We see the truth, harsh, stripped of the glossy film that hid it. Laughter helps us see the joy once again, to remember it is there. When is the last time you got lost in laughter? Studies have shown that laughter releases feel-good chemicals in the body. It can add years to a life because, believe it or not, our bodies like to be happy. Laughter is a highly addictive and contagious drug and the best part is that it is free, legal and healthy! Laughter makes us feel better in times of need and brings us closer together. Through whatever is happening in our lives, laughter is one of the only things that can distract us from the pain and stress. As life gets more and more complicated as we grow older, we find that laughter is harder to come by, but no less needed. I remember a time when I was excited every day to go to school. I loved to arrive at the familiar classroom and see everyone who made my days brighter. We would tell jokes and reminisce of fond memories and in the process would make brand new ones for the future. Life was simpler, the worst of our worries surrounded the desperation to be older, to shed our youth and step out of the powerless shells we were imprisoned in. Of only we knew what that really meant. Smiles were not hard to come by and we all enjoyed the simplicity that our lives had to offer. Through all the memories and laughter, I began to realize that love existed aside from movies and family, the love that you find for a friend that you treasure. Laughter was the key variable, revealed in understanding my relationships. When you learn how to fall deeply in love as a kid, that patience and trust can get you through ever day of the rest of your life. All we need to do is to is remember not to forget. The simplicity of childhood is what makes it so precious. Unfortunately as we all grown older, the future looms over our heads, casting a shadow over the things we cherish. There is a predetermined way we are supposed to live our lives that for some reason, erases the plausibility of our true aspirations. Laughter gives way to sighs and tears while dimples are forgotten and replaced with furrowed brows. Everything in adulthood orbits around the office and is held to a nine to five obligation. Businessmen walk past looking like identical mindless penguins. Where did all the fun go? It seems that the pleasure is evaporated with every passing day. We no longer get to know our colleagues around a circle of carpet squares. Instead we are confined to our felt paddock and swivel chair. All the stress makes us forget to laugh, but we simply can't forget. Laughter is the amnesia that makes the cubicle into a fort and the chair into a rocket ship that will take us from our fort to follow our dreams. So when is the last time you got lost in laughter? Make it now. Take the pen and turn it into a quill. Step out of your cubicle and find the world that you enjoy. Laugh every day because life is too short to forget.
281	21067	8	3	"It all started with a book @DATE1 @DATE1 ago. My mom had noticed I was struggling to find friends, so she took it upon herself to help me make some. She had a few friends from school who had kids of their own, some my age. I had been around these girls a few times as a child, but not recently. I'm not sure today what my mom saw in @LOCATION1 that made her think we would click, but she was right. What seemed like such a small action would change my life drastically. In @DATE2, in my new house I first met @PERSON1. That evening before she arrived I couldn't help but be very upset at my mom for doing this. I felt I was fine and fully capable of making friends myself. She acted like she knew me, but the few acquaintances I had she didn't believe would be good for me. I didn't think she could be right this time and I didn't want to waste my time. An abrupt knock on the door interrupted my train of thought, I could her muffled voices and footsteps downstairs. Quickly I retreated to my room and onto my bed. The bulky front door opened and closed again followed by footsteps coming up to my room. When @PERSON1 first walked into my room my first thought there was no way we would get along. She was a gorgeous blond girl, obviously popular and very confident. I couldn't stop thinking how she was going to call me freak and poke at my differences like the other girls at school did. ""@CAPS1, what are you reading?"" @PERSON1 asked as she sat on my bed. Come look for yourself."" I replied offering her the book in my hands. I knew she would hate this book. It was about all the microorganisms that live and feed off your body. I was right and as she leaned over cautiously @PERSON1 read the book with a disgusted look on her face. Laughter was boiling up inside me, I couldn't hold it much longer. My small, dull room buzzed with my laughter. @PERSON1 looked over at me with another strange look on her face and began to laugh along with me. Once the laughter had stopped and the ice was broken we began to talk about other interests. @DATE1 short hours flew by and we were finding plenty of things we had in common. We shared funny stories, introduced new music to one another, and talked about hobbies. I couldn't remember the last time I felt so in-tune with someone, especially someone I had just met! Suddenly our conversation was interrupted by a brisk knock on the door downstairs, we looked at each other and smiled. In that smile I saw a real person smiling at me with real pleasure showing through. Very much unlike previous encounters with kids at school. Downstairs we said our good-bye's to one another. As the new, cool @DATE3 air began to rush through the opened door I reached out to hug her. To my surprise she took my gesture and ran back to hug me. Her hair smelled of hair products and powder, a smell very unfamiliar but surprisingly comforting. Once she was gone for the night I began to think. I really liked @PERSON1 and I wanted to see her again soon. I felt accomplished in some way and fulfilled to have this bright future opportunity brought to me so easily and perfectly. Guilt also struck me as I realized how I had felt about @PERSON1 at first. For someone who had been judged through most of school I had been very hypocritical. That night I stayed up later than usual thinking about the next time I could see her, how she had looked and tried to understand how we could get along so well. Despite these questions haunting the edge of my every thought I slept happily, thinking of the next time I would get to see her. All of those @DATE1 questions and concerns have been answered in the @DATE1, and we are the closest friends. Not long after we started hanging out more often, we began to like one another a lot. One of my favorite parts about our relationship is how people get so confused to see us two different so close to one another. We can take the stares, comments and anything else we struggle with today and find a way to laugh together to reduce the importance of it. I have thanked my mom over these @DATE1 for many things, but mostly for what she has done for my relationship. If it hadn't of been for her my life would probably of been much darker. No one on that cold night expected this one meeting to evolve into our beautiful relationship. Laughter is an extremely vital part of a relationship whether it is being built or being kept up. Thanks to laughter excelling conversation @DATE1 @DATE1 ago, I have had the best experience I could of ever asked for. It's amazing how a simple book and a shared laugh can lead to"
282	21068	8	3	Since I was a little girl, I've lived without my biological mom. She gave me up for adoption when she was only 16 and wasn't ready to be a mother. My adoptive parents have always been honest with me about her, and I am grateful for the life I have now. If I hadn't been adopted, I wouldn't have had the chance to know my aunt, who has been a loving, adventurous, and wise woman in my life. She has taught me to appreciate nature and to find joy in laughter, even in times of sorrow. The bond between us is strong, like the sky and stars, like a bird and its wings. Despite the challenges we have faced, we find solace in laughter and in each other. When my cousin passed away, it was through laughter that my aunt and I found comfort and strength. She showed me that laughter is a powerful medicine, a source of hope and healing in the face of loss. I will always cherish the lessons she has taught me, especially the true value of laughter.
283	21069	8	3	"Laughing is one of the things we do best. @PERSON1 and I talk almost everyday and never get tired of laughing. We talk about everything and even if it is the saddest thing in the world we will be able to make it funny in a way, it's just one of those things we do. As best friends it's our job to make each other feel better, and if one calls the other crying it's their job to make them laugh and if it is funny for both @CAPS2 know it was a job well done. In @DATE3, my uncle died, I called her crying my eyes out, she said, everything was going to be okay and to just think of all the good memories I had of him. One of the only ones I could think of was the funniest story of my life and even though I was still crying, through those tears there was laughter and I knew my uncle would want me to laugh and he was right there laughing with me. @PERSON1 and I met @DATE1, at @ORGANIZATION1, where we spent a week out of our @DATE1 to get to know new people and getting closer to @CAPS1. That week was one of the funniest weeks out of my whole @DATE1, though me and @PERSON1 didn't ""click"" at @ORGANIZATION1 that week, we later found out we were more alike then we thought. Some people say when two people are to much alike the friendship doesn't work. Well, this is true yet false. When @CAPS2 are alike @CAPS2 can talk to each other about everything, yet when @CAPS2 hit those differences, and the other disagrees it starts a fight, but fights just bring people closer together. Even though me and @PERSON1 don't see each other much, doesn't mean we can't be best friends. What if your best friend lived in a different state, does that mean they aren't your best friend anymore? No, it just means @CAPS2 don't see them as much as @CAPS2 would like to. Even though we live close to each other we don't always have time to see one another, but, when we do finally get to see each other there isn't a dull moment. About a month after @PERSON1 had gotten in a bad car accident, we went to skate world, @PERSON1 was on crutches so she couldn't skate, but that didn't stop her from having fun and making the @TIME1 full of laughter. She was up dancing to the music, on top of seats yelling, ""@CAPS2 wont ever see these people again in your life, why not just have a little fun?"". By the @DATE2 @TIME1 she got almost everyone in our group dancing up on the stools and I don't regret one thing that happened that @TIME1, it was the most I had laughed in about a year. We were dancing and screaming for about three hours, before one the parents got their and after that we all went home. That is a @TIME1 I will never forget. A girl that was recovering from a horrible car accident made the best out of what she had! When things don't work out the way we wanted, we just go on with life wishing that it had happen differently, but when we look back a couple years down the road we will see that it was just fine, and it @MONTH1 just make @CAPS2 laugh. somethings are hard to laugh about, but a good thing to do when @CAPS2 get to that point is think of something happy, or funny and try to laugh. Laughing has always made me feel better, and knowing that I can make someone with a difficult life laugh until they are about to pee makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I have done something good with my life that I was willing to help @PERSON1 with her struggles. To me that makes this life, a life worth living. Though @CAPS2 cant help everyone through every single one of their struggles, just being there sometimes helps them more then @CAPS2 @MONTH1 know. @PERSON1 and I have planed out many lives we would like to live and looking back now on them all I can do is laugh, because in my heart I know they will never happen. Even if we try our best to make them happen I doubt they will. But, it was worth the laughter and a good time to make them up, and Believe they were going to happen for awhile and I know looking back in a few years we will both laugh. Laughing is a good way to get rid of fear, anger, and stress. It makes @CAPS2 think of all the good times @CAPS2 have had in your life, and lets @CAPS2 know that @"
284	21070	8	3	Laughter is a powerful tool that brings people closer together, forming strong bonds and creating lasting memories. The unique sound of each person's laughter adds a special touch to relationships, making them more genuine and enjoyable. Shared laughter with friends can lead to a deep sense of comfort and trust, allowing for open communication and a strong support system. As I lay under the stars with my five best friends, joking and laughing until we drifted off to sleep, I realized the true value of our friendship. Through laughter, we had created a safe space where we could be ourselves and share our innermost thoughts and feelings. I felt grateful for the laughter that had brought us together and excited for all the moments of joy and connection that lay ahead with these amazing friends by my side.
285	21071	8	3	One day, a day before the party for my brother's birthday to be exact. We were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because that's where the boys would be hanging out and sleeping. My cousin and I were helping mom and the boys that were already here. The boys were supposed to be cleaning the apartment, but they were more interested in playing video games and talking about girls. Mom got a bit frustrated with their lack of focus, but luckily, she was in a good mood.  The last two boys showed up, and my brother, the birthday boy, was so excited to be turning a year older. He declared that now he was a year older, no one could tell him what to do. We all shared a laugh, and I jokingly asked him to make me a sandwich, to which he obliged. Despite their initial reluctance, the boys eventually cleaned up the apartment and we all settled in to watch movies and play games.  The next morning, we woke up to a sunny day, excited to spend time with the boys. They came up with a game of cops and robbers, with the apartment serving as the jail. Unfortunately, while playing outside, I had an accident and hurt my leg, which meant I had to sit out for the rest of the game.  The following day, despite my injury, we all enjoyed a delicious breakfast together. The boys made pizza for lunch and we had a great time chatting and laughing. Despite the unexpected turn of events with my injury, we all made the best of the situation and had a memorable weekend together. My brother even declared it his favorite birthday so far. Sometimes, things don't go as planned, but as long as you're surrounded by good company, you can still have a great time.
286	21072	8	3	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4                                          @CAPS5 @PERSON1 is an essential for me to survive this crazy thing called life. So instead of writing about one experience where laughter is a key element I am going to write a montage of true events where laughter shows my true colors as to who I am. I think I should start with my blond moments first seems how that's my natural hair color. When I was little I would take my shirt off, throw it on the ground and be like ""mommy, I can't find my shirt"" @CAPS6 would tell me, ""@PERSON1 @CAPS21 just threw it on the ground"", I would look in all the wrong places and result to crying on the floor. @CAPS6 would pick my shirt off the floor hand it to me and then I would do the same thing all over again. Yeah @CAPS21 could say I was a little embarrassed when I got older and they had it on video camera, but that's what I love @CAPS21 grow up and laugh about what was once embarrassing and @CAPS21 move on.  There was another time when we figured out my initials spell @CAPS7, so whenever I go swimming with my brother and our friends, they start singing the @CAPS8 theme song and I start laughing because if I let them think I don't care they will eventually @CAPS4. Guess what, they still haven't stopped and I am beginning to think I @MONTH1 be stuck with the nickname @CAPS8 for the rest of my life. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 kept rolling when I was in first grade my brother, who @CAPS5 the way was in second grade, decided to tell my first grade teacher I had @CAPS10, @CAPS6 called my parents, who began to laugh like crazy and told her yeah, @CAPS6 does its a little thing called @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14. Looking back its funny because I remember the look on @PERSON2's face; @CAPS21 could say it was classic.  As I advanced in my @CAPS16 years moving into @CAPS15 @CAPS16, I joined an organization; the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 of the @CAPS19 for @CAPS20, where I learned later on that the color black is prohibited at any and all @CAPS19 functions. Well, the night I was initiated I wore all black from my hair accessories to my shoes. I felt no embarrassment just the need to laugh. I found later that I like to make jokes or funny comments whenever I get nervous during a speech, so when I had to get up and give a speech in front of approximately one-hundred and twenty people I made little efforts at making jokes and comments, did I mention I wasn't very @CAPS1 at jokes, but the ceremony went on and people went along and laughed with me, even though I hit my head against a dream catcher.  @CAPS19 has taught me its okay to cry at the depressing things in life, its okay to fear the things that frighten @CAPS21, its okay to love anyone @CAPS21 want, its okay to live your life, but most importantly its okay to laugh at your mistakes. I think that is one thing I will always remember and pass on to my children when I settle down with a family, which won't be for awhile I learned that lesson when I was babysitting my little cousins, who were sick, its a lot of responsibility, its a @CAPS1 thing my brother helped because I would of been nearly lost without him.  I know that because of the people who surround me with their positive attitudes and hearts gold that they have formed me to become a better person, to laugh when there seems no way out, to not only learn from your mistakes, but to laugh at them as well, to show that @CAPS21 have a deeper meaning for the way your life was meant to be lived. Remember that when life hands @CAPS21 lemons take the opportunity to make some sweet lemonade and then throw it on yourself so @CAPS21 and your friends can get a @CAPS1 laugh every once in a while. Thank @CAPS21."
287	21073	8	3	"Twins For a Laughter is a large part of who I am. I am a very happy, outgoing person, and I love to laugh. I especially love the laughs that make your stomach feel like it's going to fall out of your body and continue laughing on the floor. That's why I surround myself with people that are like me, that's my best friend and I are like two peas in a pod. People tell us all the time that we look like twins, and when we're together it's like a hurricane of loud, crazy laughter. The best part of our friendship is that we are alike I think, and we use it to our advantage. One day my best friend and I were taking a stroll downtown. We were just window shopping when we passed a clothing store that had on display an auburn tank top that had blue swirls coming up from the bottom and up one side, also a pair of dark blue jeans with a rip in the knee. My best friend and I fell in love with the outfit, and as we stood outside the window like ravenous dogs drooling over a piece of freshly cut meat, an idea hit me. When I turned to my best friend and said ""hey, what if I was you and you were me when we meet him later?"". She turned to look at me, and her eyes lit up like it was Christmas. We ran into the store and bought the outfit. We looked in the mirror and we both knew we could pull this betrayal off. The pants fit our curves, that were identical, like a glove, and the tank top rested on our bodies in the same pattern. The only difference was she was a bit taller than me and my hair was longer than hers, but we decided that showing a little neck wouldn't be too bad, so we just threw our hair up in buns and called it good. As we left the store, we got asked if we were sisters, and we replied in a simultaneous ""yeah, kinda"" it was reassurance that if we could trick them, then we could trick anyone. We comfortably walked towards the county library lawn where we were meeting him. When we were close to the lawn of the library, my best friend turned to me and said ""hide behind this tree, tell I head back, and then sneak around back and freak him out!"" I hid behind the tree while she went up to say hello, he asked where I was and she said ""I do not know actually, but I think I dropped something down there, I'll be right back, stay put."" ""Okay"" he replied. All the while I was sneaking around the back of the garden and I hopped down off of an embankment and said ""here I am!"" he was gawking off at a car that was parked a little ways down the road, he jumped a little, and I said ""did I scare you?"" in a little school girl voice, and he replied ""no, of course not! A man does not get scared."" I just rolled my eyes at him and said ""I have something for you, but you have to close your eyes"". He was apprehensive at first but he did as I had managed to sneak up behind him, and when she tapped him on the shoulder he turned, but he gave me a look of bafflement as he did. When they were face to face my best friend shouted ""hey I'm here!"" and he nearly jumped to the moon. My best friend and I were laughing so hard we nearly peed our brand new pants. He told us ""don't you two ever do this again!"" and I said ""oh come on! We basically are sisters so why not play the part?"" he just glared at me in discontent and my best friend rolled her eyes and said ""hey, did the man get scared?"". We both cracked up again and he just smiled because he knew we were playing around. It was just a blast after that, my best friend and I continued to torment the town as twins. We ran around cars and into stores and had a stupendous time being absolute fools. We even got him to laugh hard enough to clutch his stomach. When it was time to go, we ventured to the parking lot where my best friend's mother was going to pick us up, she did a triple take when she saw us, she just laughed at us when we got in and asked ""why are you two wearing the same outfit?"" and we just looked at each other and busted out laughing, and we replied ""it's a long story"". It was the perfect end to an amazing day being my best friend."
288	21074	8	3	"Somewhere along the road a guy once said ""a laugh a day keeps the doctor away."" @CAPS1 the hell was he talking about? I didn't really know or understand the importance of it either. Until i found out first hand how important those words could be, and how right that unknown genius was. It was just a few years ago when the most traumatic event happened to me.Do you remember that first girl or guy you thought you loved? If you can, do u recall that feeling of heartbreak and utter distraught? Well, if u can then u might understand how I felt...and sometimes do feel. If not you @MONTH1 learn something of importance to which you might realize why you're single. Before that certain event,when @CAPS2 and I would end up fighting, we'd end up making jokes about it to get through. We'd sometimes intentionally go to see romantic movies to laugh at how the girl or guy in them would break down crying. In one of those sobbing weeping, just obnoxious sounding cries. The kind that pisses you off more than making you feel sympathetic. Back to the later and key point of all of this, when the horrible situation occurred @CAPS2 and i were together for years, two and a half to be specific. yeah, long time I know. The day it ended it happened to be in the middle of math class (can you believe that? the middle of freaking class!) @CAPS4 convinced me to go sit back in the corner of the room with her. It'd be just us, no interruptions. We did this everyday so it wasn't anything to unusual to me. I was thinking ""yeah! i get to work alone with my amazing girlfriend!"" I was such a idiot. I do fondly remember glancing her over before sitting down. @CAPS4 was wearing white bleached jeans and a black band t-shirt. @CAPS4 had skin so white and unblemished a porcelain doll would be jealous. To top it all off dirty blond hair, rose petal lips and believe me on this one unending curves. I was dressed similar. I was in my @PERSON1 t-shirt, black jeans and my signature burgundy beanie. I had natural tan glowing skin and dark brown curly hair that covered my dark green eyes. When I sat down I'm not exactly sure @CAPS1 it was, but I felt like something bad was going to happen. Almost like a oncoming thunder storm or that paranoid feeling of being watched. The most dreadful words fell out of her mouth like water coming out of a faucet. ""We have to break up"" my heart seized in my chest her other words blurred into one becoming inaudible. I remained not moving and completely silent like a stone gargoyle. I couldn't help, but laugh at myself silently inside my head. I didn't ever say anything back. I didn't trust my voice enough to be steady and unwavering. Even if my words didn't...my body did. I couldn't control the shaking of my body as if it was having one big muscle spasm. I quietly and quickly walked out of the room making sure to have my bag in hand. I didn't want a reason to have to come back. The hallways along with the tiles and eventually grass along with the pouring rain all blurred into one. I just kept on walking and walking, with no wear in mind. Until when i was finally to tired to stop. My cheeks were tear streaked to my jawline and my eyes were red and bloodshot. The most wonderful thing in the world to me in my life had ended. As i look back at @CAPS2 and I's relationship, laughter was how we survived and got through a lot. It was however not enough. No amount of trying to laugh it off would help, like those petty arguments we had. I will sometimes though look back on how I reacted and that by itself will make me laugh. I was no better than those people in those movies. Unlike them however, I did not weep and bawl obnoxiously. As much as laughter helped me in the past, it couldn't erase the pain of losing someone I loved. It was a lesson learned the hard way, but one that taught me the importance of both laughter and resilience in the face of heartbreak. And maybe, just maybe, that guy was right after all - a laugh a day can indeed keep the doctor away."
289	21075	8	3	"Side by side with my best friend @PERSON1 we begin to walk to the park. The rained on @DATE1 @TIME1 wasn't very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in @LOCATION1 was enough for us. Approaching the grass to the benches, mud was dominating my shoes when I was starting to think other wise of such fun. Sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. Although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  The fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. The father we later find out, pretends his @NUM1 year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like ""@CAPS1 WAS THAT""?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all. ""@CAPS2 want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @CAPS2 want""? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @PERSON1 an I then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. The laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. The man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  Minutes into the video I look away since the phone was now in @LOCATION2's hands. I feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. Looking up I see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. Back to @PERSON1 I notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction I hadn't said more than @NUM1 words in between the silent laughter and looking always that I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red. ""@CAPS2 really look just like her @CAPS2 know""? All these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us. The boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next. Pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime. Once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk. breathe by breath running I could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request. Just another day in @LOCATION1 we thought, but for us everyday was just something to laugh about.  As we made our escape from the peculiar encounter, the absurdity of the situation lingered in our minds, leaving us with a mix of disbelief and amusement. It was a reminder that sometimes, the most unexpected moments can turn into the most memorable ones. And as we continued on our way, we couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all."
290	21076	8	3	"Have you ever got a detention from laughing an inordinate amount in class? If you haven't, you're very lucky. I know that teachers absolutely hate students that don't pay attention in class, or students that will randomly start laughing when they're giving a lecture. I'm that student that will randomly bust up laughing (preferably at my own jokes) in class. In other words, I'm a teachers worst nightmare.  Ring....ring....ring, time for @CAPS1. It was a beautiful afternoon and I was feeling great! When I walked into the class, I automatically noticed that our teacher wasn't his blessedly self. But I ignored it and went on with what I normally do, which is get out my @CAPS2 and crank up the tunes. I like to listen to music because it relaxes me and helps me focus more. The downside to listening to music is that you can't exactly hear everything that great. When I listen to music I have those moments when I feel like I'm in a movie that everything seems like it's in slow motion but you can't hear anything. It's almost like I'm secluded in my own little world and no one can see me or hear me, until I start laughing that is. Finally class started and everyone was being abnormally loud, at this point I was starting to see the steam come out of our teachers ears. He looked like a cartoon character off of bugs bunny. The teacher was getting very indignant and impatient with the class. I didn't exactly pay much attention to him so I went back to listening to my music. After a while, our teacher was now starting to get frenzied with the class even more so he told everyone whoever talks again will get their name written up on the board and you will receive detention.  About five minutes later my friend @PERSON1 comes and walks by me and starts talking to me. When I listen to music, I have a tendency to talk loud because I feel like they can't even hear me. So I start yelling, and she starts to giggle because when I wasn't looking my teacher was just staring at me wondering why I was talking so loud. He turns around and writes my name on the board (that meant I was given a warning). I turn to look at the teacher, oh no here it comes, @NUM1 my laughter is out, I couldn't control myself. When I laugh uncontrollably, I laugh like there's no tomorrow. ""@CAPS3! You owe me thirty minutes of detention!"" said my teacher. One of the biggest problems that I have is I'm very easily amused, I laugh at mainly everything and anything. When my teacher yelled at me, his facial expression was just way too funny, so I began to laugh even harder.  When I start laughing, my friend @PERSON1 usually can't help herself but start laughing with me. She tells the teacher that she was the one that made me laugh so she thought she deserved detention too. So she got what she wanted, detention! One week later, @PERSON1 and I arrived in good old detention with all the other ""rebels"" (that's what I call myself now) it makes me feel tough. The thing that we have learned is that we should never be sitting next to each other. When we sit by each other, we can't stop laughing, but we decided to sit by each other anyways. What do you know, we almost got more detention while in detention, imagine that.  ""@CAPS4's to short to live with tension and regrets, so just laugh it off!"" That motto is what I try to live by everyday. I feel like laughing is a very important part in my @CAPS4, it really helps me forget what is bothering me. Even though I @MONTH1 get in trouble from laughing, I don't regret it one bit. Some people are very serious and they don't know how to let things go so they're always tense. Laughing releases tension and for me I feel like it brings me closer to my friends. I love laughing with my friends and the feeling of your abs hurting from laughing is awesome!Live your live, laugh as much as you can, and love those that mean the most to you.Supplement appropriate details based on the existing information in the original text.

291	21077	8	3	"Laughter can be a huge help when going through difficult times. Like the time when my brother got ran over by a skid steer at our farm. We didn't know how bad it was going to be, but through our time of uncertainty, our family was there to be with us and help us through and keep us from getting down. It was just another day on the farm and we were out running the machines. The day was going just fine until after dinner my mom had told me and my brother to go out and cut corn. ""Come on, mom,"" me and my brother said in unison. She wouldn't hear it and told us to hurry up and leave. So we went down to the shop and got the skid steer out.  My brother, still hadn't come down, and so I started it and started driving towards the garden. I saw my brother coming from the corner of my eye. He was running as fast as he could and I yelled at him to stop and wait, but he kept coming. He tried to jump on the front forks but missed and fell. I got out of the cab and saw him lying on the ground crying. My uncle was standing nearby when it happened and he called the ambulance. We didn't know what was wrong with him, but his leg looked a little funny so we looked closer and saw the bone sticking out of his leg.  Finally, when the ambulance came, they looked him over and asked me some questions about what had happened. I told them all that I could and went back to the house. It was nerve-racking to not know what was going to happen to his leg, but we just hoped that it wouldn't be very serious. I spent the night at my grandparents' house. I had a lot of trouble falling asleep that night though. The next morning was, so I had to go to school. I still didn't know a lot, but I did know my brother's leg broke in a compound fracture.  The whole school day, my friends were helping me feel better by telling jokes and funny stuff and just keeping my mind off the accident. It was hard not knowing what was going on with him. Later that night, we went to see him. We learned that he had just broken the big bone in his leg and that it had gone back together just fine. My mom stayed with him the whole time he was in the hospital, so things around the house were a little bit different. Me, my dad, and sisters had to clean and take care of the house. It was a pain because I hate doing housework, and having to do it all the time was very boring.  When my mom and brother finally got back after about a week, things went somewhat back to normal. My brother had to wear a device on his leg that sucked the fluids out of the wound to help it heal faster. There were giant screws coming out of his leg that attached to a bar on the outside of his leg. He has healed up just fine though and has a giant scar where the bone came through his leg. It was very nice to have family and friends there to cheer us up and help us get through. And that is why laughter."
292	21078	8	3	We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter can show emotions, but can also go to the distance of strengthening a friendship, or relationship. To many people laughter is a very important part of any relationship.  First, Laughter is very important in a friendship. If you cant have a fun happy friendship then you wont have a good friendship. Building up to a friendship is always sometimes difficult. It can take up to a good laugh, to not laughing at all to determine your friendship. Having a friendship with someone is one of the best feelings. Knowing that you have someone you can trust, talk to, be there for you, and the most important laugh with is a great feeling.  Also, laughter is important in every childhood memories. Thinking back to when i was little i was always laughing. Even though my mom and dad left me and my brothers i always had my grandparents, brothers, cousins, even aunt and uncles to keep my busy and always have a good time. I think laughter is an important thing being a child because its healthy, you can learn to keep others spirits high and keep others laughing and happy, . and its always good to have a strong, fun, happy relationship with your family.  Last, laughter is very important in a relationship. I think it will build character to your relationship and shows everyone that your happy with the person that your with. Laughter will also build a good and strong healthy relationship and will lead to good things. If you think about it laughter is probably the most important in a relationship because when you decide to marry the person your with it will lead to not getting a divorce and fighting and you will have a strong relationship.  So, therefore after pointing out that laughter is important no matter what age, what gender, friendship, childhood, or relationship you should see that my point is that laughter is important no matter the situation. It helps build a strong person and also builds character to yourself. Laughter truly is the glue that holds relationships together and adds joy to life.
293	21079	8	3	Have you ever been in an an awkward situation and lightened the mood with laughter? I have, as have many. I find that laughter makes people more comfortable, which allows them to be their own person. Laughter can even help some to attract a positive, friendly crowd, who enjoy funny, happy people. Laughter may not work in this way for everyone, but here are some ways it has helped me. I was at a homeschoolers' group in my community years ago and didn't know anyone there. After walking around a while, this girl talked to me. She was funny, and being able to laugh made me more comfortable and I had a fun time. I just had to find the right person. Another time where laughter might've helped was when I was invited to a birthday party of a friend I hadn't seen in over two years. Several others were there whom I hadn't seen in a long while. The whole visit was awkward and all I wanted to do was blend in. I acted like everyone else, but if I'd had laughed and been more comfortable I would've been my own person. When I first came to public school, I was nervous to meet new people, and what kind of people there would be. After a week or so, people got to see my personality, the funny, happy, laughable person inside, and that clicked with a lot of people. That's why I'm friends with the people I'm friends with now because our alike personalities matched. Laughter brought me to a good place in life. Laughter can make a lot of people happy and comfortable in awkward situations. It can encourage people to show their own personality and attract people like themselves. I think the world would be a happier place if everyone could laugh.
294	21081	8	3	"@CAPS1 up kids my mother said as she was scrambling to get her stuff packed and ready.I knew exactly what i did wrong, I didn't set my alarm on my phone for six am. I set it for six pm and now we are late. Thinking to my self I hurried to get my clothes packed for the week. six pairs of pants, six pairs of shirts, six pairs of underwear, and six pairs of socks. I put my bag next to the front door realizing now that it was next to my other bag I had already packed the day before. My sisters were worse, as girls they take for ever putting on there makeup and and straightening their hair.Finally everyone is packed, but it was now seven am and we were supposed to be to @LOCATION2 by now and were still sitting here at our house. As my sisters are now done and we are in the car we can finally get off to @LOCATION3. We as a family have been planning @CAPS2 for a month and now it's @DATE2! I was really exited to go. By @CAPS2 point I had butterfly's in my stomach.We lived in @LOCATION1, we were only half way through @LOCATION2 with eight out of ten hours left to get to my mom's cousins house. I feel asleep for the first two hours of the ride and I can no longer sleep. I was stuck in the back seat with nothing to do. so I started to sing the never ending song. @CAPS2 is the song that never ends, and it goes on and on my friends."" @CAPS3 my sister in the front seat yelled at me very harshly to shut up. I didn't stop and she yet again yelled at me to stop singing. For a third time I annoyed my sister and she responded with a punch on my arm. For some reason I started to laugh. It didn't hurt and I thought it was funny that she hit me for just singing a silly song.I had a really strange laugh so my little sister started to laugh because I was laughing, then my older sister quite harshly screamed at me and my younger sister to be quite. My older sister yet again punched me trying to get me to stop laughing. By now I was laughing so hard I could hardly breath and my face was turning into a shade of purple. It really was funny when my mom couldn't hold it back any longer and started cracking up and laughing with me and my younger sister. My mom wears dentures, and she was laughing so hard they almost fell out of her mouth while she was driving, we started laughing harder. My stomach felt like it was going to explode from all the laughter.My older sister now turning a dark shade of blue from yelling at us so hard to get us to shut up. She was throwing her arms into the air and screaming one last time to shut up and threw herself back into her seat with a very nasty look of disgust on her face.over the next minute we all stopped laughing and was quiet for the next hour @CAPS3 we stopped and ate. We enjoyed our lunch and got on the road because we still had a long trip on our hands.I very soon felt tired and fell asleep in the most awkward of positions you could ever find in a car. I had my head against the door, my arm over the front passenger seat, one of my legs was on the seat and the other in between the driver and passenger seats.I thought I was pretty lucky sleeping most of the way for we only now had about a half hour till we got to my mom's cousins house. We were in the middle west of @LOCATION3 and the mountains were so beautiful. They were full of color and life with gigantic trees swinging in the wind, squirrels moving about from tree to tree, planting nuts in the ground. It was the farthest I have ever been away from where I lived in @LOCATION1. I was glad it was with my family.My stay in @LOCATION3 was a blur. I can hardly remember most of what happened there. I played with a neighbor kid around the same age as me playing video games and eating unhealthy junk food. My mom was the happiest of us all to get out of @LOCATION1 for a weekend. She had not seen her cousin in about three years and was very happy to see her.It was now @DATE1 was time to get back to our normal lives, so we packed up our stuff and were headed back to our home. I was doing amazing at not talking and making my sister mad for the first minute or so. @CAPS3 I started to sing the never ending song again. I have never laughed so hard in my life.

295	21083	8	3	The members of my immediate family are known to be both incredibly clumsy and easily startled. Broken dishes are a common occurrence in our house; as are spilled drinks, stubbed toes, and blood-chilling screams whenever the toaster pops up. Though all of us are used to these types of things, not everyone around us is, which can lead to interesting encounters. Many people find pleasure in jabbing me in the sides to hear me scream, and laugh when I trip over the slightest crack in the floor. Though it can get annoying sometimes, it also give me a reason to get over my pride and laugh at myself, thus relieving any tensions I may have been feeling about the social setting. For example, a few years ago I was staying with my Girl Scout troop at summer camp. Any situation involving large groups of people can be intimidating, but it is increasingly terrifying when the group is made up of girls, ages four to eighteen, with only a few adults thrown in to make sure the girls do not bludgeon each other to death. Worse still was that where I was staying, which was a hybrid somewhere between a cabin and a tent, the majority of the girls were in middle school and, needless to say, we did not always get along. Despite the fact that we were not all the best of friends, though, there were times when we were able to get past the petty differences, such as who was cool and who was not, and enjoy the time we had to talk and joke around with people who were in similar places in life. On one such occasion, I was attempting to make my bed on one of the top bunks, and was in the process of stretching my sheet over the petrified mattress which may have possibly been around in the 1800s. Being the intelligent person that I am, I decided to lean against the wall behind me for balance, forgetting, of course, that there was in fact no wall, but only a thin, cloth-like material which could not support my weight. The second I realized what I had done, I reached about frantically for something to hold on to and tried in vain to keep myself from plummeting backwards to the floor and my certain death. Milliseconds before I would smash into the hard wood floor, I managed to grab a hold of one of the bars on the side of the bed and hung on for dear life, swinging back and forth and back and forth. Finally, I let go and propelled myself, almost gracefully, onto the bed sitting underneath mine. It was a very long time before the laughter died down. In that short amount of time, cliques and biases and grudges were all forgotten as we became not just a bunch of random girls placed in a room together, but a group with our own strengths and weaknesses; passions and flaws. Though the adolescent years are incredibly difficult and there are many times when it feels like you are the loneliest person in the world, it is always comforting to know that there are other people who laugh and cry just like you and experience many of the same joys and embarrassments as you do. One of the most essential skills to learn is that you have to be able to laugh at yourself from time to time and let yourself be vulnerable in front of other people. We may not all be the same, but we all have the same basic desires for love, acceptance, and laughter.
296	21085	8	3	"While living in @LOCATION5 I met the two people who are now my best friends, @PERSON1 and @CAPS14. I met them both in entirely different ways. I met @PERSON1 through school and @CAPS14 through paintball. @PERSON1 moved from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1 when her dad was in the @ORGANIZATION1, and @CAPS14 had been transferred to the base close to where I lived. We had two classes and lunch together. At first, @PERSON1 and I didn't really talk much, but after a funny incident during lunch, we became great friends. On the other hand, I met @CAPS14 while paintballing at ""The @CAPS5"". After he managed to shoot me out in a game, we started joking around and became good friends.  Even though @PERSON1 and @CAPS14 live far away from me, we stay in touch through the internet and continue to make each other laugh. I am grateful for their friendship and hope to make more wonderful friends in the future."
297	21086	8	3	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with my cousin @ORGANIZATION1 was a memorable experience filled with endless laughter and joy. From running around the yard to late-night video watching sessions, every moment was filled with uncontrollable laughter and stomach-hurting fun. @ORGANIZATION1's unique sense of humor and constant jokes kept me entertained and laughing non-stop. Despite the muscle pain in my chest the next morning, I couldn't help but look forward to the next visit with my cousin. Our bond grew stronger through our shared laughter, and I realized that life is truly incomplete without moments of joy and humor shared with loved ones.
298	21087	8	3	"One day, it was almost Christmas Eve, and my sister, mom, and I were in the kitchen preparing desserts and food for the dinner. While my mom went to get more ingredients, my sister and I continued working. When it came time to use lemon juice for the lemon blossoms, I asked my sister to extract it from the lemons. She attempted to squeeze an uncut lemon, thinking it would work, which led to a hilarious moment where we couldn't stop laughing. Even when my mom returned, she joined in on the laughter. This incident earned my sister the nickname ""lemons"" in our family, and it brought us closer together. We realized the importance of laughter in strengthening relationships, and since then, we have become much closer. Laughing together has become a bonding experience, allowing us to share more and enjoy each other's company. This event taught us the value of finding joy in the little things and cherishing moments of laughter in life. Laughing together can truly bring people closer and make relationships stronger. Live life to the fullest, laugh often, and appreciate the moments that bring you closer to those you care about."
299	21089	8	3	After a long day at the mall, mom said it was my turn to decide where we went to dinner that night. I chose Red Lobster because I love their seafood. We got crab legs, popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp. After the food we got two slices of double chocolate lava cake. For some reason it sent us into a fit of laughter. We laughed so hard, we started to cry. It was a memorable and enjoyable evening that we still laugh about to this day.
300	21090	8	3	The @CAPS1 of Laughter @CAPS2 friends and I, always find some way to make each other laugh and have a good time. @CAPS2 friends, @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, are very similar, yet completely different. Both are active, humorous girls. You could almost say they are sisters from how close their personalities match, but it's their appearance that show's otherwise. @PERSON2 is tall and skinny, with short, black, curly hair. Her clear skin has a tint of olive green. Her looks make her seem as if she has a deep secret. The mystery is hidden behind her baby blue eyes. @CAPS2 other friend, @LOCATION1, has sunshine glowing from her hair. Each golden curl ends at her belly button. The freckles, that lightly cover her fair skin, only appear on her perky cheeks. Her eyes seem like the deep blue ocean. You can only imagine swimming in such an amazing color of blue.  One @DATE1 @TIME1, while the sun was setting on a cold @DATE2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 girls and I decided to learn the @PERSON1 @CAPS4 dance. After a night of practice, I gave up and laid on the full cushion couch, that comfort every part of @CAPS2 body. Two hours fly by and the girls got it. They both had each leg steps and every movement just like @PERSON1. They were so good that they could have been @PERSON1's back-up dancers. After a moment of accomplishment, we realized how ridiculous the idea was and stopped. @ORGANIZATION1 begged to do the dance once more, but with the camera recording. Minutes after pressuring @PERSON2, I started the music and pressed the record button.  The girls were doing great, but started forgetting some of the steps. Out of nowhere, both girls, full speed, run into each other. It was silent, except for the music playing. Each of us look at each other and start dieing from laughter. @PERSON2, and @ORGANIZATION1, get up, crying from laughing and apologize to each other. All of this happened with me recording. After settling down, we watched the most amazing home video.  Remembering funny moments like this make me realize how thankful I am for @CAPS2 friends. It makes me feel good to know that we can all be ourselves together. Without them I would not know what laughter is.
301	21091	8	3	Life without laughter is plain, dull, and boring. Laughter is an important part of life, creating memories, relationships, and filling in awkward silences. Without laughter, there would be nothing to look forward to, and everyday activities like swimming, dancing, and other fun experiences would lack their joy. Laughter is more than just an element; it is crucial for enhancing our lives and making everything more enjoyable. It has a significant impact on relationships, as it creates bonds and fosters connection between people. In essence, laughter is a vital aspect of life that adds color, happiness, and meaning to our existence.
302	21092	8	3	"The @CAPS1 of Laughter.  Laughing is a huge part of most everyday life. It is a very common emotion that I see hundreds of times a day. Whether it be from something as simple as a funny face, a joke, a picture, and even little things people do or say can bring laughter to even the most serious of people. @CAPS4 friends and I laugh constantly. We can make something funny out of pretty much anything. I think being able to laugh, and joke around are very good traits to have as a person because it makes life so much more fun and optimistic.  I can't even count the number of times I have been in a complete laughing fit because of @CAPS4 friend @LOCATION1. She is by far one of the funniest people I have ever met in @CAPS4 entire life. Though she is extremely funny, she is not exactly the brightest crayon in the box. She asks questions after people already tell her the answer, she says exactly what I say after I say it without even noticing that I had already said it before her, and sometimes she even trips on the concrete while racing someone to her car after practice. The things she does @MONTH1 not be super intelligent sometimes, but they sure can give anyone a good laugh.  I remember not even a week ago I was in the car with @LOCATION1 on the way to volleyball practice, and she just belted out the wrong words to the song we were listening to. What made it even more funny was the fact that even though she knew the words were wrong she kept singing like she knew every word. At the end of the song we laughed so hard we cried. By the time we got to practice her and I had been laughing for about ten minutes straight. During practice our @CAPS3 had been explaining directions to one of the drills. She told us loud and clear to serve the ball to spots one and five @CAPS2. @LOCATION1 not fully understanding the directions, decided she should ask and make sure it was all clear to her. So she put her hand up and asked, ""@CAPS3, so do we @CAPS2 serve to spots one and five?"" @CAPS4 whole team broke out into hysterical laughter. @LOCATION1 who didn't understand stood there looking confused, but when she finally understood why we were all laughing she joined in. That happened about three more times throughout our two and a half hour practice. She even got put in front row which made us all laugh because she is very short and looked really funny next to the six foot one girls standing right next to her. By the time practice was over I think we had gotten a better workout from laughing then from playing volleyball. On our way out to the car, @LOCATION1 decided she wanted to race a girl on our team to her car. @CAPS5 agreed and they took off in a dead sprint. You could see the determination to win in @LOCATION1's face, and all of a sudden they were no where to be found. I ran up the stairs to see who had won, @CAPS2 to find @LOCATION1 face down on the ground with @CAPS5 sitting next to her laughing hysterically. I felt bad, but it was so funny I couldn't help but to laugh. We sat there laughing for a good fifteen minutes, and we laughed about it all the way home. That was the icing on the cake to one of the funniest days I have ever had. I will never forget that day and all the times we laughed together. I think @LOCATION1 and I being able to laugh so much together brings us closer as friends because even if we get irritated with each other, or something bad happens, we can always find a way to laugh about it in the end, and that is something every good friendship should have. Laughter can't always make everything better, but it can bring @CAPS1 so someones day, and you never know the positive effect a little laugh can have on even the grumpiest of people. Laughter truly is the best medicine."
303	21093	8	3	"Many people think that @ORGANIZATION1 is just like any other. These people are very wrong. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 is very different than most. For you see, it is filled with humorous people. These people make up a lot of the bright side of @ORGANIZATION1. Where these people are you might ask? Why, they are every where. The best place to look is in the hallways, especially @DATE1 @ORGANIZATION1, during lunch, @CAPS2 after @ORGANIZATION1. Most of the people I will tell you about are friends of mine. There are also a lot of people I don't even know the names of. There is even a teacher I'll mention something about. Well enough chit chat, lets get to it shall we? I will first start with the teacher. I forget her name but she likes to talk with a @CAPS1 accent. She is also very enthusiastic, @CAPS2 I do mean enthusiastic. She often says, ""@CAPS3 we go!"". It's very funny. I have never seen her without enthusiasm. Many of the students are really disturbed by it. It can be annoying at times but at least she's not all gloomy or other. In fact we might even need more like her at this @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 many others. There is also a student who is also very enthusiastic, not all the time but quite often is he. His name is @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is quite a jolly kid. He loves to sing. I do mean he loves to sing. Even if he doesn't know the words to the song he is singing, he will sing. People always joke about him around him. The jokes are usually mean jokes, but he puts up with them @CAPS2 laughs along. I really do have to give him that much credit. It would be hard for just about anyone to put up with such rude words, let alone laugh with them. But enough of that. He is very jolly @CAPS2 really makes you laugh, which is really great. Don't stop being funny @CAPS4. There is a funny pair of boys who can knock your shoes @CAPS3, perhaps even literally with what they do. These two boys, named @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1, are very humorous, as well as dangerously humorous. Ever heard of a @CAPS6? It is a brand of a toy that is very fun for little kids, as well as big kids. This toy is shaped like a bowl. You turn it inside out, aim the rim at the ground, @CAPS2 drop it. When it hits the ground, it pops up into the air. Well, @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 love playing with the @CAPS6, so much to the point that they found a new way to play with it. Instead of hitting the ground with it, they hit each other with it! They love to hurt each other. Eventually, though, the @CAPS6 got very worn out @CAPS2 tore. It needed to retire from its rough job, but @PERSON3 @CAPS2 @PERSON1 wouldn't let it. They just couldn't stop playing with it. @PERSON2, @CAPS9, @CAPS2 I haven't seen them playing with it lately. We think it might have broke. Ha ha! Never go wondering throught the hallways with @PERSON2, even if you have a destination. Trust me on this, you don't want to! @PERSON2 gets destracted very easily in the hallways. If she sees someone that she's wants to talk to, she doesn't tell you. She just twirls around @CAPS2 rushes over to them. For this, always have her take the lead if you do go with her; at least you'd know when she wonders @CAPS3 the trail. Never the less, @PERSON2 is still very humorous. She makes lots of random sounds. You get completely @CAPS3 guard @CAPS2 just can't help to laugh at how weird sounding those sounds are. @CAPS9 on the other hand, not only does sounds but also does hilarious facial expressions. She always tries to mimic the funny things her goats @CAPS2 pets do when she tells us about them. Together, @CAPS9 @CAPS2 I are very funny. In the @DATE1 finals started, we were drawing such goofy pictures of each other @CAPS2 random things. I drew her as a stick figure going to the moon, but the moon was very far away. We cracked up! She once redrew a little comic her brother thought of more than a year or two again. In the comic"
304	21094	8	3	Everybody knows that long car rides can be both physically and mentally exhausting. Picture a family of four: a mother, a father, and two daughters in a car. The father is behind the wheel, the mother is in the passenger seat, the older sister is on the left side of the back seat, and the younger sister on the right side. The sun is rising, and you're still on the road. The father is tired after driving all night, the mother just woke up, yawning, wondering how much further until the destination, and the sisters are looking out of their windows with extremely bored expressions. Even with cups of coffee and loud music, the atmosphere is still lifeless and dull. What could possibly bring up this lifeless atmosphere? My guess, a form of entertainment.  As a young child, I was always on the road, moving from place to place due to my father's work. Living in a state known for its snow, the winters were long with snow covering the ground like a blanket. Summers, on the other hand, were extremely hot, providing a total twist to someone unfamiliar with the state's weather. A decade ago, the environment might have changed, but it remains a breathtaking and beautiful state.  One cool day, my mother told me to start packing my room as we were due to leave soon. Despite the beauty of the state, leaving was always bittersweet as I had to say goodbye to friends each time we moved. Packing for a long trip, we loaded up a uHaul with our belongings and pets, heading towards our new destination. The journey was filled with mixed emotions as we left behind loved neighbors, coworkers, and friends.  Driving from our old home to our new temporary one, the atmosphere in the car went from chatty to silent as the long journey took its toll. Halfway through, I decided to break the monotony by singing, despite my tone-deaf voice. This sparked laughter and singing from the rest of my family, lifting spirits and making the rest of the trip full of energy and fun.  Spending time with family is always special, but making the most of it with fun and positive activities can truly make a difference. It's important to keep a light-hearted and enjoyable outlook, turning what could be a dull journey into a memorable and exciting adventure.
305	21095	8	3	Laughter can be a powerful tool not just for our own benefit, but also for the benefit of others. It should not be reserved only for times when we need to feel happy, but should be a regular part of our lives. Laughing not only helps us feel better, but also allows us to release pent-up emotions and enjoy ourselves. Whether it's a hearty laugh or a simple chuckle, the act of laughing can lift the weight off our shoulders and boost our mood.   I have fond memories of trips with my family to my great grandparents' land when I was younger. Despite the cramped van rides and cold nights, we always found ways to laugh and have fun. One particular incident stands out to me - a night when I had to use the restroom in the freezing cold, and my aunt played a prank on me. Instead of being upset, I found myself laughing along with her, turning a potentially unpleasant situation into a hilarious memory.   This experience taught me the power of laughter in turning things around and finding joy even in difficult circumstances. It showed me that laughter not only brings happiness to ourselves, but also creates connections and shared moments of light-heartedness with those around us. So, next time you find yourself in a tough spot, remember the power of laughter to bring a smile to your face and those around you. Laugh often, and let the world see the brighter side of life.
306	21096	8	3	Have you ever felt really good after you laughed a lot? Well studies have shown that after you laugh you not only feel better, but it's a great way to lose calories. One time when I felt bad my cousin came over and made me laugh. It was a very important part of our relationship, she not only made the day better but put more energy in it. When people don't laugh how can you have as much fun? Studies have shown laughing does a lot for your health. It increases a certain blood flow in your brain which helps a person to be more energetic and happy. It has also shown that laughing leads to a longer life span. Also every time a person laughs it helps a person burn calories. If it's healthy for you why not laugh a lot? Just think, if nobody laughed how would this world be? It would be dull and full of unhappy people, just like this one time when my cousin came over to see me. One day I was feeling down and depressed. Nothing was going my way and it was ending up a very bad day. Then all of a sudden my cousin came to visit and surprised me. We both started laughing so hard. She made a bad day turn into a fun one. We had a movie night and ate candy and pickles all night. We made songs up and sang them. We had the best time of our lives. All night long we had this party. I don't know what would happen to everybody if none of us ever laughed. If we didn't laugh then our relationship certainly wouldn't be as strong. It would seem like we were sad or depressed all the time. If there was no laughing I wouldn't look forward to seeing her as much if we just sat around and didn't laugh. Laughing for me is a huge part of having fun in any relationship. It shows you're comfortable with the person and are having fun also. If you have ever been down and wanted to give up, you know that's not fun at all. But whether you watch a funny movie or talk to your friend and it makes you laugh, you know what joy it puts in your life. So laughing must be an important part of your life or in any relationship you have. Overall laughing for me is one of the most important things a person can do to make another person feel welcome and comfortable around you. Also a great way to have fun and lose calories at the same time. If you need some happiness in your life then watch a funny movie or hang out with people that make you laugh.
307	21097	8	3	Social people view laughter as a form of emotional expression, but I see it as a mode of communication. Laughter allows individuals to convey messages, indicating amusement or agreement with something said or done. This shared laughter can forge connections and strengthen relationships. In my own experience, laughter played a crucial role in forming a deep friendship. When I met my best friend in sixth grade, our initial interactions were marked by conflict. However, a moment of shared laughter at a school dance transformed our relationship, leading to a lasting bond that has endured into high school. This demonstrates the power of laughter in bringing people together and creating meaningful connections that can last a lifetime. Laughter truly holds a special place in our lives, shaping our experiences and relationships in unexpected ways.
308	21098	8	3	"Entering the classroom as the new student in the fourth grade, I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me. Transitioning from a public school to a private school left me with a multitude of questions swirling in my mind. Stepping into the room with a large white ""4"" displayed on the wall, my nerves caused me to shiver uncontrollably. Surprisingly, no one approached me as I entered, as they were all gathered around a cheerful brunette girl. It wasn't until the teacher looked up that I was acknowledged. After introducing myself to the teacher and the class, I couldn't help but feel envious of the attention the brunette girl was receiving. She seemed to effortlessly draw people towards her, leaving me feeling somewhat ignored. As days passed, my envy grew, and I couldn't shake the feelings of suspicion and dislike towards this girl named @PERSON1. Despite sitting on opposite sides of the classroom, my discomfort around her persisted, leading me to stubbornly avoid her.  As my birthday approached, I grappled with inviting my classmates to a party, including those I was unsure about. Placing invitations in each cubby, I hesitated when I reached @PERSON1's. I realized that I harbored an unwarranted grudge against her and cursed myself for it. The day of the party arrived, and as guests trickled in, @PERSON1 showed up alone, offering a gift and a shy birthday wish. It wasn't until the cake-cutting that I discovered we shared the same birthday, forcing us to blow out the candles together. Initially frustrated, I eventually found myself laughing with @PERSON1 after a playful frosting incident with my brother.  In that moment of shared laughter, my perception of @PERSON1 shifted. We spent the remaining hour playing and laughing, forming a bond that led to a genuine friendship. Despite my initial misconceptions, @PERSON1 became my best friend that day, a connection that has stood the test of time. Our shared laughter bridged the gap between us, proving that sometimes, the people we least expect can become our closest companions."
309	21099	8	3	"My best friend @PERSON2 and I have a tradition that we made up. Every time she comes over to my house we always slide down the stairs in a sleeping bag. We came up with @TIME1 @CAPS4 she was spending the @TIME1 at my house. While sitting on the staircase with nothing to do it suddenly hit me. I turned to @PERSON2 and said""@CAPS1 could two little girls possibly do to have fun in the middle of the @TIME1, @CAPS4 all they have to work with is a long staircase that has been sitting right under their noses the whole time?"" and to @TIME1 she says ""I'm listening."" @CAPS2 we were both getting excited because we finally found something fun to do.I said ""I'll show you. We just need to get all the pillows we can find."" The two of us scampered around the house looking in every room and brought all the pillows we could find back to the staircase.""@CAPS3 @CAPS1 do we need all these pillows for?"" @PERSON2 asked and was surprised @CAPS4 i said ""for padding."" @CAPS4 the pillows were set up at the foot of the stairs, I told her of my brilliant plan. She loved it! We couldn't wait to get started. ""@CAPS5 purple sleeping bag will be perfect for @TIME1"" said @PERSON2.  I ran down the hallway to my room, snatched my sleeping bag, and sprinted back towards the staircase. My purple sleeping bag is super slick and was just the thing we needed to glide down the stairs.  @CAPS2, @DATE1, we are fourteen and fifteen @DATE1 old, we still have fun doing @TIME1. Over the @DATE1 we have improved it, making it nerve racking and loads more fun. @PERSON2 and I have agreed on some safety precautions, which we thought were necessary. @CAPS4 we are just using the sleeping bag we don't need them, but as we have added on to that we have agreed to wear a helmet and sometimes add a few pillows. The helmet kind of scares my mom because it's even needed. One @TIME1, while my parents were out, @PERSON2 and I had been eating way too much sugar and were extremely hyper. The two of us were sliding down the stairs but it was starting to get too easy,and wasn't as much fun as it was @CAPS4 we were about @DATE1 @DATE1 old. We wanted to make it even bigger and better than ever before! We started brainstorming. My brothers room was upstairs and we somehow wanted to incorporate his mattress into our fun. @PERSON2 and I dragged the mattress out onto the staircase. We both sat down on the mattress, pushed off, and went shooting down the stairs. We could barely keep a hold of the mattress. The farther we went down the staircase, the farther we slid off of the mattress. We were laughing @CAPS3 hard @CAPS4 we got to the bottom, we almost slammed into the wall! It was @CAPS3 much fun. After that first ride we decided we had better put an extra pillow up on the wall somehow. One thing we hadn't thought about before we went crashing down the stairs, was how heavy the mattress was. It was very hard to get back up the stairs, but we didn't mind because we were having @CAPS3 much fun.  @PERSON2 and I were getting tired @CAPS3 we decided to take a break. The two of us hauled the mattress up the stairs , it one last time before plopping down on the couch in the opposite room. Not too long ago my mom had bought an inflatable exercise bean. Shaped just like a real bean and had handles on both sides. @PERSON2 started messing around with it, and @CAPS4 she said ""@CAPS6 try it?""We both rushed back to the stairs, ready to have some more of the reckless fun that we love. Our imaginations were bouncing off the walls. @TIME1 time the two of us felt it was time to mix everything together for the ultimate ride. We kept the mattress on the top of the stairs and measured out just where we needed my sleeping bag to be. Our idea was to be sitting on the exercise bean, on top of the mattress, slide down off the mattress, land on the sleeping bag waiting on the stairs to give us a turbo boost, and finally be sent flying into the pillows at the bottom of the staircase. I found some duct tape @CAPS3 the @PERSON2 could tape the sleeping bag to the floor.  @PERSON2 let me go first. I was nervous because we'd never done @TIME1 before. After a minute a finally pushed off. It was a"
310	21101	8	3	THE @CAPS1 A couple of weekends ago me and my cousin were at my grandma's house up in the woods, where we spent our time riding quads, having airsoft gun wars, and building forts. We initially planned to stay for just one night but ended up extending our stay to three days.  On the first night, we constructed a fort in the woods, only to discover the next morning that it was infested with mice. This led us to abandon the idea of ground forts altogether. Moving on, we engaged in airsoft wars, which ended abruptly when I fell from a tree and broke my gun, nearly injuring myself in the process.  After the airsoft wars, we decided to ride quads and dirt bikes on the trails surrounding my grandma's house. Despite running out of gas during one of our rides, we managed to explore new trails and enjoy the muddy terrain.   On our final day, we set out to build a tree fort, utilizing wood from my grandpa's unused stockpile. With the help of the materials and our determination, we spent the entire day creating an impressive tree fort to cap off our adventurous weekend in the woods.
311	21102	8	3	We were all going out into the woods to ride quads and trikes, with @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, and @PERSON1 having quads, while I was the only one with a trike. After loading our rides onto the truck and trailer, we headed off to the woods. Once there, we unloaded our vehicles and got them warmed up, except for the one with a clutch that needed a pull start from the automatic quad.  Wilber offered to get it started while being pulled by @PERSON1. However, as @PERSON1 took off, the hook holding the two vehicles together came loose and hit him squarely on the back, leaving a mark that looked like a hook print. Despite the pain, @PERSON1 tried to hold back laughter, but @PERSON1 noticed and playfully chased him around.  After finally getting the quad started, we encountered a police car, prompting @PERSON1 and I to quickly take off. When we looked back, @PERSON1 was nowhere in sight. Despite @PERSON1 suggesting we leave him behind, we returned and found out someone had tampered with the carburetor, causing the issues.  It was a tough day dealing with the authorities, especially since we wouldn't get our licenses until we were older. @PERSON1, in particular, had to wait until he was twenty-one. After that incident, @PERSON1 vowed never to join @PERSON1 and I on another adventure again.
312	21103	8	3	My family and I went to our vacation house once in awhile to see how things were going. We would spend a couple days or a week there. It was nice, got to hang out with our neighbors, ride quads, feed the rabbits, horses and cows, put on make-up. Sometimes my dad and I would be sitting on the porch and look at the scenery. The beautiful sunset, the trees and their colors. A crowd of deer wandering around, picking on the ground eating the scraps of food. The cows walking along the fence line waiting for dinner to go their way. While we were sitting there we would talk about random things or play jokes on each other and just laugh and have a good time. One evening when we were sitting on the porch my dad asked if I would like to take a walk. I said yes and so we went into the pasture, and somehow he had a camera. We walked and talked and he took pictures of everything. I wasn't looking but suddenly he was taking pictures of me. I looked at him and I saw that the camera was facing me and his finger was holding the button and wasn't letting go of it. I ran in circles and laughing so hard that I was crying and I couldn't stop. He kept going in circles, as me, still taking pictures of me and we were just laughing and laughing. The moment captured on film would forever remind us of the joy and laughter we shared on that beautiful evening.
313	21105	8	3	Laughter has always been a powerful force in my life, lifting me out of the dark moments and filling me with joy. It has the ability to turn my gloomy days upside down, reminding me of all the reasons I have to be happy. In sixth grade, a time when I felt isolated and alone, laughter became my saving grace. Despite facing teasing and rumors from classmates, the sound of laughter became a beacon of hope for me. It was through laughter that I found true friends like @PERSON1, who stood by my side and filled my days with joy. Together, we laughed at the absurdities of life and supported each other through difficult times. Laughter has the power to heal wounds, mend broken relationships, and bring light into the darkest of days. It has shown me that no matter how tough life may seem, there is always a reason to smile and laugh until my sides ache. Through the power of laughter, I have found true friendship and a sense of belonging that I will always cherish.
314	21106	8	3	Water balloons of laughter can be a powerful tool in standing up to bullies and spreading joy. Laughter has the ability to bring people together and create lasting memories. It is important to embrace laughter in our lives and use it to uplift others. Laughter truly is a source of happiness and can make a significant impact on those around us.
315	21107	8	3	Laughter is indeed a powerful tool that can bring people together, even when they are miles apart. In my own experience with my best friend, @LOCATION1, I have witnessed how laughter can bridge the gap created by physical distance. Despite facing challenges such as financial difficulties and lack of communication, the simple act of sharing a laugh has helped us stay connected and maintain our strong bond. The joy and comfort that laughter brings have the ability to erase any previous tensions or worries, allowing two individuals to truly connect on a deeper level. As my best friend and I continue to share laughs, I am reminded of the invaluable role that laughter plays in strengthening relationships and keeping us united, no matter the circumstances. It is through laughter that we are able to find solace, joy, and companionship, making our friendship even more special and enduring.
316	21109	8	3	Laughter is an important part of life, as it brings joy and fun to our days. Whether we are laughing with friends and family or using laughter to cope with nervous situations, it plays a significant role in maintaining our happiness and well-being. While some may find themselves laughing in uncomfortable situations, it can actually help to relieve tension and stress. It is important to find humor in everyday life and use laughter as a tool to navigate through challenges. By embracing laughter, we can strengthen our relationships, stay positive, and ultimately lead a more fulfilling and happy life.
317	21110	8	3	Laughter is an innate part of human life, bringing joy and connection among people regardless of barriers. It has the power to break ice and create bonds, as I experienced when meeting my family in @LOCATION2 after years of separation. Despite language barriers, the warmth of laughter bridged the gap and made us feel like a true family. Through shared laughter, we found comfort, familiarity, and a sense of belonging that transcended words. This experience highlighted the importance of laughter in forging connections and building relationships, showing that sometimes, all it takes is a moment of shared mirth to bring people closer together.
318	21111	8	3	Everyone knows that when it comes to coach @PERSON2 sr., there's always going to be a bunch of laughs, giggles, jokes, and pranks. If you don't experience any of the above, then you are absolutely lame. It all started when my lovely sister @PERSON3 decided to make it to @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, @ORGANIZATION2. Of course, she wasn't going to want to go alone. That is why she brought @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and me. We promised each other that we were going to make the best memories. We arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 on a lovely morning, a little tired but mostly hungry. Coach took us to @ORGANIZATION1 to buy some snacks, and he made a beeline for the @CAPS2.Pepper, his favorite drink. As a cross country coach, he always had one with him. However, he was very protective of his @CAPS2.Pepper, and touching it was a big no-no. Despite this, we decided to play a harmless prank on him. We took all his @CAPS2.Peppers and hid them in our bags, thinking we were the coolest people ever. That night, we found ourselves bored in our hotel room and decided to unpack @PERSON2's pop. We resisted the urge to drink them and went to bed, preparing for the big race the next morning. However, we overslept, and when Coach came knocking for his @CAPS2.Pepper, we pretended not to know what he was talking about. But when he got serious, we returned his drink, learning that messing with @PERSON2 was not a good idea. As they say, messing with @PERSON2 is like messing with a pig - you both get messy, but the pig likes it.
319	21112	8	3	"Laughter plays a huge part in my life, my family loves to laugh. We are always making each other and people around us laugh. @CAPS8 you put two or more @CAPS1's together someone is going to start cracking up. Sometimes the kids in my family have games to make each other start @CAPS4. There is this one @CAPS2 that a couple of us play; no one ever officially gave it a name so we just call it the Laughing @CAPS2. The @CAPS2 starts out with one person standing in front of everyone else that's playing. The goal of the @CAPS2 is to try to get one of the other people to start @CAPS4, and the first one to laugh has to trade places with them to do the same thing. We really don't play that often just @CAPS8 there's nothing else to do. One night my two nephews and I were just sitting around looking for something to do @CAPS8 my little nephew @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 play the @CAPS4 @CAPS2"". His older brother @PERSON1 and I didn't really want to play but there was nothing else to do so we both said that we would. It started out like it always did nobody really wanted to go first, but @CAPS7 somebody finally manned up and just went. @CAPS7 it got started. After that everybody was @CAPS4 and having a good time. It went on like this for a while, but after about an hour or so it started to get boring. @PERSON1 and I were starting to get bored out of our minds so we were going to quit, but my little nephew didn't want us to. @PERSON2 went up to take a turn. @CAPS8 @PERSON2 went up for his turn, he started out like he usually did just making stupid faces and funny sounds to try to get people to laugh. We had seen all of his faces and heard all of his noises so it wasn't going to work. @CAPS7 after he realized that we weren't going to laugh he started telling us a story. He started the story out by saying ""@CAPS6 this guy right; he didn't have anything besides his chair and his box. He loved his chair and his box."" The story wasn't very funny yet but he went with it. ""@CAPS7 the guy went to bed because he was tired and all, and @CAPS8 he woke up his stuff was gone. His chair and his box the only two things that he had in this world were gone. So he went looking for his things. He was searching all day and night but he couldn't find anything not his chair, his box, or even a clue of where they could have gone. So he decides to go to bed and maybe they would be back in the morning like maybe it was all a dream; but @CAPS8 he woke up he had turned into a wild boar."" @CAPS8 he said that @PERSON2 started running around acting like a pig. That got us @CAPS4 but he didn't want to stop there he just kept telling his story. In the story, it turned out that every time the ""guy"" went to bed something strange would change and it just got more and more funny. My family loves to laugh and have others laugh with us. Just like my nephew @PERSON2 he didn't want to stop telling his story because he had us cracking up. Whether we're just hanging out and telling a couple of jokes or making up a @CAPS2 we love to laugh. Laughter has a huge part in my life."
320	21113	8	3	"@CAPS1, do @CAPS2 know where my wax for my skin board is?"" I yelled to my @CAPS1 as I walked out of my room. ""I think it is on the bookshelf, but why do @CAPS2 need it?"" my father replied. ""It's for @PERSON1's birthday present. I don't have any money for him, and I promised him something amazing this year, so I am going to take him to @PERSON2 and we are going to ride our canoe down the giant sand dune."" ""Why can't @CAPS2 just get money from us or something and then buy him a card at the dollar tree?"" my @CAPS1 responded to me with a look on his face as if he were saying, ""You're the stupidest kid I know."" ""You know I don't take handouts, @CAPS1. I would rather work for that money, and I don't have enough time to work for it and hang out with @PERSON1 all day. I mean, it is his birthday after all, and besides, this is more fun,"" I said with a mischievous grin on my face. ""Well, alright. The canoe is already hooked up to the truck,"" my @CAPS1 replied.  ""That's fine with me, pops, but can @CAPS2 give us a ride out there and back?"" I asked him, trying that puppy dog face my sister always makes to get what she wants. ""Only if @CAPS2 stop making that weird face at me. Do @CAPS2 want to drive?"" he asked me as we walked out the door to go pick up @PERSON1. ""Yes, please,"" I said as he flipped me the keys.  Pulling into @PERSON1's driveway, I shut off the truck and stuffed the keys into my left front pocket. I walked into @PERSON1's house and found @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 waiting for me. ""Alright, we're ready now. Tell us,"" @PERSON3 said. ""Not yet,"" I replied with a mischievous grin on my face.  Driving towards @PERSON2, I parked the truck and tossed the keys to my @CAPS1. Putting the canoe into the water, we rowed to the other bank. As we reached the other side, we pushed the canoe up the hill and waxed the bottom. Then, we pushed it to a likely spot to slide down, and all jumped in. We flew down the sand dune, hitting the water with a thud and snapping the canoe in two. As we emerged from the water, I heard the drunk man yell from the other side of the bank, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 THE @CAPS5 @CAPS6 IN THE @CAPS7 OF @CAPS8 @CAPS9!"""
321	21114	8	3	"Laughter has an unusual way of putting people in a good mood or relieving them of their bad moods. Regardless if the laugh is a normal little chuckle or an unnatural sound coming out of someone's mouth, laughter brings people together and it's great way to turn a awkward moment into a memorable moment. Someone once said, ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" and that person knew what they were talking about."
322	21115	8	3	There are many reasons why laughter is an important part of any relationship. In my opinion, you cannot be serious about everything. Laughing is a way of letting yourself go and relieving stress. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. Being serious about everything is not always a good thing. You need to have fun in your life to keep yourself happy. Being around people who make you laugh is always a good way to put yourself in a good mood. Laughing is a good way to take the pressure off and not be embarrassed. Being able to have a relationship with people where you can laugh at things when they are funny is always needed. For me, I know that being around people who can't laugh things off makes me feel like I need to watch what I say. Laughing is one of the best ways to just relax. Laughter also helps lighten the mood and make people more comfortable around each other. If I do not feel like I can joke around and laugh with the people I am with, I usually do not feel like I can be myself. Although if you are not comfortable with the people that you are with to start with, then it might be harder for you to joke around with them. Eventually, if you let yourself go and laugh, you will feel closer to them. Being happy and laughing with people creates a strong connection between people. Making things into a joke is a way a lot of people keep themselves from getting embarrassed. Usually, if you do something that other people think is funny and you don't, then if people laugh, you might feel uncomfortable. But if you start to laugh with them, it takes the pressure off you, and they are no longer laughing at you but now with you. In conclusion, there are many things that laughing can do for you. It makes it so you don't have to be serious about everything, it takes the pressure off and relieves stress. Laughing is one of the best things that people can do together to make a connection. No matter what, laughing can always put someone in a better mood.
323	21116	8	3	Laughter is indeed a crucial component of any relationship, fostering bonds and creating unforgettable memories. In the case of the cheer squad at @LOCATION2, their shared moments of amusement, from getting locked out of the bus to being kicked out of @ORGANIZATION2, culminated in a night of uproarious @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. These experiences, although initially challenging, brought the squad closer together and solidified their camaraderie. Laughter truly has the power to strengthen relationships and enhance the overall quality of shared experiences.
324	21118	8	3	"From birth to young adulthood, kids are raised by their guardians or parents. It is the parent's responsibility to convey to their children good morals, life skills, and to teach them how to cope and thrive in society. Parenting children requires being firm and strictly reinforcing rules. The result of this, however, is the child leaves their parents prepared to live their adult lives outside the home. Although I am still a teenager, I have learned quite a lot about raising kids. My knowledge mostly being based off of stories passed down to me by my parents and grandparents about their life lessons. Being ""in on"" these small, yet significant bits of history is quite enjoyable for me. I'd have to say that although many of the facts about the ""good old days"" are great, it is the almost tangible memories which my family connects with laughter that are the most significant to me. My grandmother grew up in the 1950s living in a small yet average sized house with her parents and four brothers and sisters. The main subject which is the focus of the stories my grandmother retells about her childhood come from memories made at the dinner table. It was her father's (my great-grandfather's) goal, for his children to learn proper manners and standard etiquette. It was expected of the children to practice this by being calm, courteous, and mindful of their physical actions when gathered around the table for dinner. For an average, fun, casual, and not so dignified Italian family, that was a lot to ask. Throughout their childhood my grandmother and her siblings tried their very best to behave and do as they were told at the dinner table. The only common occurrence that was particularly displeasing to my great-grandfather was when someone spilled their milk. This fateful event happened almost every night. When milk was spilled it was either the cause of a child engaging in funny business, or it was a result of reaching too far to retrieve the butter dish. Whatever the reason, it was somehow hysterically funny when this occurred. The only catch was, that laughing at the table was frowned upon for it seemed to break the formal mood the family strove for during the evening meal. Laughing and spilling milk were two actions not encouraged at the dinner table. Spilling milk did not continue to happen as often as the children grew up, but that is not to say that it discontinued its presence at the dinner table completely. One night it was not my grandmother nor any of her siblings that spilled their milk. Instead, it was my great-grandfather. When the initial incident occurred, the whole family was in a state of shock. In an effort to clean up the mess everyone donated their napkin, while their mother maintained a controlled but disgruntled demeanor. When all was cleaned up, the family went on with their meal and on my great-grandfather's face was a subtle yet unmistakable grin. Years later my grandmother, my parents, my siblings, and I grew up, got married, and some even began families of their own. Most of my grandmother's family lives in New York so they enjoyed coming up to visit their parents at the holidays or whenever they were able. During these times when the entire family is able to gather here in New York, there is hardly ever a somber or serious moment at the dinner table. As my grandfather would say, ""we laugh so hard that tears run down our legs."" I attribute the fun we have together to this bond of love that connects us all, and I feel it would not be as prominent without the element of laughter. I feel that my great-grandfather (who is now in heaven with my great-grandmother), accomplished the goal of preparing his children for life. Now that they are all grown up, they can let loose, enjoy each other's company, and feel free to bust out in laughter even if there is a risk of someone spilling their milk."
325	21119	8	3	Laughter and happiness go hand in hand, forming a key to a fulfilling life. When we laugh, we open up a channel of communication with the world around us, spreading warmth and joy wherever we go. Imagine going on a first date with someone who makes you laugh; instantly, the atmosphere becomes more relaxed and enjoyable. Laughter has the power to transform a dull moment into something special, creating connections and forging bonds.  On the other hand, imagine being with someone who is gloomy and sad all the time. By sharing a smile or a laugh, we can bring a ray of light into their darkness, offering them a moment of respite from their troubles. As a waitress in a local restaurant, I have experienced firsthand the transformative power of a simple gesture of kindness. By reaching out to a lady who seemed troubled, I was able to bring a smile to her face and brighten up her day.  In the end, it is the little things in life, like a smile or a laugh, that can make a world of difference to someone who is struggling. Let us not underestimate the power of joy and kindness in brightening up the world around us.
326	21120	8	3	"When I think of laughter, I think back to the wonder years. Although the memories are foggy, I can still recall the times where I believed friendship had no end and that laughter was the common cure to every battle. Thinking back to the time when I was twelve, I remember adventures pushing me upward towards the sky. Free-spirited and lacking reality, I was an unstoppable soul. I was not alone though. Through adventures and explorations, I brought along a trustworthy opponent. Her name was Person1 and she was my best friend. Person1 lived out in the country, where the grass grew tall and the land came in acres. Through forests and streams, you could find our hideaway from the world; We called it our wonderland.  On a typical day in the summer, I drove up to Person2 to Person1's house. Walking in her front door, I automatically smelled fresh cinnamon scones drizzled with honey. The sweet smell sent shivers up my spine. Person1 came down the stairs and greeted me with a hug. She wore her long, dark hair in braids and was wearing a white sundress. Her brown, shimmering skin glittered against the sunlight and her dark brown eyes sent me a happy glare. Next to her, I was just the simple, blond girl with a blotchy skin tone. In one moment, she fled to the window and looked out at the perfect, blue sky. ""Wow, finally summer has come along,"" she whispered and then exploded, ""another day spent with grumpy, sleepless peers and no more stuffy classrooms or annoying teachers... it's the first day of many!"" We burst into laughter as I made fun of her poetic outburst, but we both knew every word of it was true.  Sighing, I looked at her breathtaking dress one last time and ran out to the field in her backyard. Person1 grabbed a red cardigan and followed me, holding a basket in her hand as if she were Little Red Riding Hood. I frolicked through the meadow like I was a radiant fox chasing after its prey. When I stopped for breath, I encountered the wind blowing the tall, wispy grass in rhythmic motions around me. Racing towards our secret place, I looked back only once to find Person1. As I turned towards our destination again, a branch met my vision and knocked me down painfully. Blood trickled down my chin and left crimson droplets of blood in the green grass. I breathed in, choking on the salty fluid and then realized she was standing there. Like a worried hare, Person1 sprang to my side and helped me to the house. We made our way into the upstairs bathroom.  Standing at her bathroom sink, I wept small tears. In the mirror, I could see a belligerent-looking girl with a bloody slash across her chin and red, misted eyes. The pain was what made me cry; it was my appearance that had me down. People would ask for days what was on my face and how did that happen. Person1 came to my side and squeaked, ""How are you?"" My face turned to a bright shade of red in a way that I might explode. I turned to Person1 and in one fluid breath, I burst out, ""Wonderful! Ecstatic! Before this, I had a boring, simple look going. Now, I will look even worse with this terrible blemish! I hate how gorgeous you are, Person1. You are exotic, distinguished, and everything about you seems extremely perfect!"" Her friend just stood there and took in every word. A confused look came across her face but slowly turned to a crooked grin. Suddenly, Person1 burst out into laughter.  Embarrassed, I walked to the door wanting to leave that very second, but she grew silent and took hold of my arm. Shaking her off, I continued down the stairs. ""Wait,"" she called out to me, ""I'm not agreeing with you in any way. You have a small cut across your chin, but you have always been beautiful and I feel like a simple field mouse next to you. The way your blond, thin hair becomes perfect ringlets and the way your freckles highlight your amazing, turquoise eyes. I have always been jealous of you! That's why I'm laughing!"" I took this in for a second and then erupted into laughter. Racing up the stairs, I came to her with a big, bear hug and laughed some more. Everything I had ever thought about her beauty and mine wasn't at all relevant.  Having thought this, the pain of my cut became apparent to me. Lee, her dad, fixed me up with his sewing skills, and with each stitch, I laughed along with Person1 to get through the pain. Seven stitches and a nasty scar remind me every day that laughter gets you through the worst"
327	21122	8	3	"The wind rose and fell, whipping against the side of the house with full force. My mom said she had never seen such a fierce storm before in her life. It shook the house, making it creak in odd places, like the floorboards. My grandma sat at the kitchen table, deep in thought and worry. They had rental houses acres off that were surrounded by trees, the ground so soft and saturated by the rain and flooding that had taken over the valley. There were already hundreds of trees that had been uprooted, and there were bound to be more. The little homesteads that rested off of Oak Valley, including my grandpa's, were well-built farmhouses, most surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres of land. You would be surprised to find someone out there with less than twenty acres of land. It's mostly wheat fields, but you can easily find fields of corn, alfalfa, and rows and rows of blueberries so big only two can fit in the palm of your hand. It is literally paradise on earth, a small piece of heaven that was thrown down to earth either by accident or on purpose. The sun is so bright, and the sky is the clearest, most crisp blue. When weather rolls in, giant fluffy clouds make the sky look like it's dappled with giant pieces of cotton. All this stretches over land so flat you wonder if it could possibly be real. I have spent so many wonderful, laughter-filled summers there. Running barefoot through the fields, playing in the large expanse of lush, green grass, feeding the goats, chickens, and pigs with my siblings.  On that fateful day, my mom said she had never seen a place so beautiful turn so ugly in such a short period of time. My mom says if she had known what was going to happen that day, she never would have let them get in that car. My grandpa, grandma, and Aunt Sarah pulled out of the driveway. Since it was a small car, my grandma volunteered to ride in the back. The storm had been showing its vicious temper for over two hours, and it showed no signs of letting up. They had set out to see what damage had been done on their acres of land, to see what needed fixing once the storm moved on over the mountains. There is no explanation; no one understood why Aunt Sarah walked away with not even a scratch on her body. No one knows how the tree fell or why it only landed on the back end of the car, but it did. God's hand had swept down and caused destruction. My grandma was killed instantly, my grandpa was seriously injured but alive. He spent weeks in the hospital, and during those weeks, the news of the accident spread like wildfire, as news does in a small town. Everyone loved my grandma; she was a social butterfly that fluttered from person to person, laughing, talking, sharing tears, and joy. She knew everybody, and everybody knew her.  The heavens cried and howled that day; raindrops fell so heavily it felt as if the whole world was crying, crying just for you, just to share your grief. It's painful to lose someone so dear to your heart. My grandpa cried; he sobbed until he had no strength left to feel any emotion at all. He loved her so much, he needed her. Lightning struck the giant oak that stood tall and proud in my grandpa's backyard that day. It was the same tree that held my grandparent's initials. The lightning split the top of the giant oak clean in two. Everyone saw it as a symbol, a sign of how my grandpa and grandma had been struck apart quickly and forcefully. But, days before my grandpa returned home from the hospital, my dad climbed that giant oak and chained the severed part back together. With that, my dad had made a symbol of his own, saying you will always be together, just not physically, but you will never be truly apart.  The day my grandpa returned home, he saw the giant oak, and for the first time in weeks, a glimmer of understanding shone in his eyes. A small amount of hope had settled over everything once again. Her funeral was a nice affair, elegant, simple, beautiful, just like her. The whole town came; they reminisced for hours, telling stories about my grandma and her crazy yet lovable nature. Then from across the room, it came. Small at first, then growing ever louder. Laughter. A smile, yes there were tears with that laughter, but it was laughter all the same. I've never seen the saying ""laughter is the best medicine"" put to justice better. My grandma was one person who saw laughter, love, faith, and hope as necessities in life. She brought joy to so many people, and now they were returning the favor."
328	21123	8	3	"When we were little it was watching @CAPS1. In junior high, it was seeing a kid squirt milk out through his nose. But now as we approach our high school years, we stifle giggles, suppress outbursts, and laugh until we cry, for our own reasons; and we can't hold back the inevitable urge to laugh. Some say laughing is the best medicine, unfortunately for my sister an I, this was not the case; laughing just got us in more trouble. No matter how many times we were lectured, someone always found their way back into the other one's room purely because we were nosy. I remember back a few summers ago, I'd seen @PERSON1, my sister, putting a bag of chocolate under her mattress. There was a possibility it was gone, but I had no doubt in my mind that it was still there. But as the mattress was lifted up and as I was beginning to reach for it, the bed was shoved back down, very nearly smashing my fingers. there stood @PERSON1 with a vindictive look in her eyes and two hands placed on her hips. What could I say? What could I do? A shill scream escaped my lips and I bolted for door before she could unleash her wrath upon me. Up the stairs, around the couch, through the kitchen I ran; but not fast enough. Before I could lock myself in the bathroom, she caught my ponytail and yanked, hard. I was in for a nine year old, hair pulling, all-@CAPS2 beating. But lucky me, no more harm could be done because my @CAPS4 had heard my scream and had come to investigate. Fighting was taboo in our house, but that never stopped us. @CAPS4's punishments were minuscule, we could hug and make up, or stand in the corner. The anger in @LOCATION1's eyes was already gone, and a certain, significant smile played across her lips. @CAPS4 was still trying to play the strict parent, but to us, the passed four minutes were just a joke now.  ""@CAPS3,""she had said, one word, one meaning, that's all it took. We exploded in a roar of giggles and laughter. Although there was no way @CAPS4 could have known this, we meant no disrespect, but be couldn't keep silent. Boisterous laughs rang through the hallway, so loud, @CAPS4's words were inaudible. Grabbing our hands and pulling us towards the living room we were half dragged because we were shaking to hard. Ten feet apart we stood, eyes focused on the ninety degree angle in front of our noses. But one look at each other and sent another tremor of giggles through our little bodies. We could have been inebriated if you didn't now any better, but really we were just two rambunctious kids playing around. We all have our reasons to laugh. Maybe your reason is as simple as reading an e-mail that made laugh so hard you cried. Maybe it is because my amateur writing style is a joke to you, or maybe you too have just witnessed a child's nose spew chocolate milk. We all have things in our life that make us want to roll on the floor, or slap our knees; but from my experience it's excruciatingly hard to hold back, so let it out. Laughter is a universal language that brings people together, no matter the circumstances. So, embrace those moments of joy and let the laughter flow freely."
329	21126	8	3	When my friend @PERSON2 and I went to hang out with our friends from @LOCATION1, we had a great time but as it started getting dark, we realized we didn't have a ride back home. After unsuccessful attempts to get our dads to pick us up, my sister @CAPS1 came to the rescue and gave us a ride. Despite a little hiccup with her disappearing to get food without telling me, we made it home safely. The next day, I reflected on the importance of planning ahead but also felt grateful for my sister's kindness in helping us out.
330	21127	8	3	It was a normal sunny day in the country hills of @ORGANIZATION1. The sun was out and shining on the creek that me, my twin brother, and my best friend were swimming in. The creek was fantastic. It was a deep swimming hole that all the neighborhood kids would swim in. Since all the other kids were either too old and busy to swim, or they were too young, it was just us three that swam in the creek that @DATE1. We loved it. It helped cool us down during the heat of the day. We would play games like @PERSON1, and tag in the water. There was even a rope swing off the little bridge that one of the older kids made. The swimming hole was the place to be that @DATE1. Eventually, we got hungry and tired of swimming in the hole for a while. There was this trail we would use to walk back to my house. The trail was the fastest way to get home. From the trail, you could see farm animals grazing in the sun-filled fields. The day we walked this trail was a little different than normal. All the farm animals were making noise. One of the farmhands was walking the trail listening for a bell. He said one of his goats had gotten out. He warned us that the goat was a little mean and if we saw it to keep our distance. So we took the warning and walked on. Once we reached the gravel road that led to my house, @PERSON2 said she heard the bell. My brother and I didn't believe her at all. We thought she was playing another joke on us. We walked on for about @NUM1 seconds. All of a sudden, @PERSON2 screamed run! My brother and I turned around and saw the white goat with big horns chasing us! We ran as fast as we could. I tripped over my feet and fell. I got up as fast I could and sprinted faster. I could tell my adrenaline was up because I was running really fast and I wasn't getting tired. We reached the hotwire fence that surrounded my house. We all stopped and questioned if we could jump over it or not. The goat was getting closer and closer, we didn't have much time to decide whether we could or not. My brother was the first to jump. Of course, he made it and so did @ORGANIZATION2. I was the last one. I started to panic in my head. I backed up a little and ran and jumped over the fence. I thought I was gonna make it but then my foot caught the fence and I flung over the fence and face-planted it. It was super embarrassing. My friend and brother were both laughing hysterically at me. I could tell my face was beet red and I was mad that I fell. Again. Although I still found myself laughing. The goat had stopped at the fence and started to charge it with his horns. That made me jump and run. I dived over a rowboat where my brother and friend were and I said oh my lanta that was the funniest most scariest thing I had experienced all @DATE1. We walked up to the house laughing and talking about each other's faces as we were running and how funny it was that I face-planted it. They made fun of the face I made when the goat started to charge the fence. Even though I was embarrassed that I tripped over the fence, I still found myself laughing and making fun of myself for what had happened. I would have to say that was the best day all @DATE1. We got up to my house and went into the kitchen to find my mom laughing so hard that she was crying. We all asked her what was so funny and she said she saw the whole thing from the window. We all started laughing to the point we all cried. We all told the story to our parents when they all came over for dinner and they laughed and laughed. All of our cheeks hurt by the end of @TIME1. Laughing is great. It mends the soul. Plus, it's a great ab workout!!!
331	21129	8	3	Laughter is crucial in a relationship as it helps alleviate tension and bring joy to both partners. When faced with challenges or stress, sharing laughter can strengthen the bond between two individuals. It allows for moments of light-heartedness and can serve as a reminder to not take life too seriously. Through laughter, couples can find solace, comfort, and happiness in each other's company. So, embrace laughter in your relationship and let it bring you closer together in love and joy.
332	21130	8	3	"I used to love hermit crabs. The cute little creatures who hid in their shells fascinated me. When I was about six my family decided to take a road trip along a coastal area. We were accompanied by another family with four kids. Put together there were four kids for me to play with, but the closest one to my age was a boy named Jack. He was only a couple years older than me. I adored Jack. We explored, swam, giggled, and played tricks on our siblings together. Everything he did, I did.   We went to so many different beaches I can't remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a short and slender beach. On one side there was a cave. The cave was loaded with hermit crabs. Never in my life have I seen so many of them. It was as if our dreams had come true. Jack and I created sand castles, prisons, and water channels to keep the hermit crabs contained. Our older siblings weren't interested in them at all. That was alright though, in our eyes it only meant more for us!   When it was time to leave, Jack and I were devastated. We both knew that we wouldn't just come across another beach like this in the future. It finally hit us that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs. We stayed down on the beach near the cave for hours just saying our ""good byes"". When my mom eventually yelled across the beach saying that it was time to go, we both had made a quick decision. I had watched girls stuff shells into their bathing suits before. I thought why not? Jack liked the idea, so we silently slid two hermit crabs into our swim trunks. His crab in the pocket of his shorts, mine in my one piece swim suit. It sagged at the bottom, but I decided to ignore it and pretend like nothing was wrong. Guilt weighted down my scrawny little body, like I had stuck a ten pound rock in my suit, not a tiny little crab. My mom had asked me directly if I had left all the hermit crabs on the beach. I nodded, but my voice was abse"
333	21131	8	3	"Laughter is an essential part of life, a belief deeply ingrained in my upbringing. I have always been inspired by the quote, ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day,"" which has guided me through various experiences. My mother, a natural entertainer, often regales us with amusing family stories that never fail to bring laughter. Many of these anecdotes revolve around my adventurous and fearless brother, who has a penchant for adrenaline-fueled activities like extreme rollerblading and skateboarding.  One particular story that my mother loves to recount took place during one of my soccer games when my brother had a rather unfortunate mishap in a port-o-potty. Despite the embarrassing incident, my mother's wise words always resonate with me - in times of hardship, finding humor in the situation can make all the difference. Laughter has a way of lifting spirits, bringing people together, and creating a sense of warmth and belonging.  While there are countless tales of my brother's escapades and my own blonde moments, what truly matters is our ability to find something to laugh about each day. Laughter has the power to strengthen bonds and make even the most challenging situations more bearable. In the end, as my mother wisely puts it, ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day."" Embracing laughter as a daily ritual not only enriches our lives but also helps us navigate the ups and downs with a positive outlook."
334	21132	8	3	Laughter is what connects me and my friends. It's a very important aspect in any kind of relationship. I know that almost all the memories I have are of my friends making me laugh, and we have been friends for a very long time. One of my favorite funny memories is the time me and two of my friends went to a restaurant and had a hard time finding the restroom. We were on a road trip to do a cultural performance at an event, and on the way back, one of my friends needed to use the restroom urgently. After a comical search, she finally found the restroom but had a hilarious mishap on the way. Despite the embarrassing moment, we all ended up laughing uncontrollably. This incident just goes to show that laughing together only strengthens our friendship. Laughing is indeed a crucial element in any relationship, whether it's with old friends or new ones.
335	21133	8	3	My uncle was a warm, summer evening in New York City. The stars were out, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. As usual on the weekends, most of the family was over, along with some friends. I was just a little girl who loved everyone and everything, especially laughing. Anyone could make me laugh, smile, and have a good time, but my uncle was the one who could make me laugh for hours on end.  That evening, I was playing with my friends when my uncle came over to join us. He started joking around with me, and I couldn't help but burst into laughter. The laugh attack lasted for about an hour, and even after he left, I couldn't stop giggling. My friend tried to calm me down, but it was no use. I was just too happy.  Despite the laughter, my uncle has always been a constant source of joy in my life. He has always been there for me, especially after my father passed away. Even though we don't live near each other anymore, we still keep in touch and share laughs whenever we can. His presence in my life has been a true blessing, and I know that I can always count on him to make me smile.  Through all the hardships I've faced, I've learned that laughter truly is the best medicine. No matter what life throws at me, I can always find solace in laughter and in the company of my uncle. He has been my rock, my pillar of strength, and my source of endless joy. I am grateful to have him in my life, and I cherish every moment we share together. Laughter has been a guiding light in my darkest days, and I will always treasure the moments of joy that my uncle brings into my life.
336	21134	8	3	"Laughter is always my go-to response when things go wrong, especially when I'm kayaking. Even when I take a beating on the rapids, I find humor in the situation. One particular day on the upper stretch of the White Salmon River stands out as my biggest beat down yet - the infamous ""Beat Down"" day.  It started with a simple problem - my friend brought the wrong size spray skirt for his boat. Despite the challenge, we managed to squeeze it on with all our strength. As we hiked to the put-in, little did I know that this day would be far from normal. The usual routine of sliding down a rock and dropping into the water took a hilarious turn when my spray skirt didn't seal properly, causing my boat to fill with water. Laughing it off, I thought it added some weight distribution to my oversized boat.  As we navigated the rapids, I realized the river's intensity was no joke. I found myself rolling through every rapid, unable to stop laughing at the absurdity of it all. With no way out of the canyon but downstream, we pressed on. Approaching the final challenge - a waterfall known as ""Big Beat Down Falls"" - I couldn't help but chuckle at the impending chaos.  Despite a mishap with a bump from a friend's boat, I plunged over the falls, enduring a terrifying minute and a half in the churning waters. Keeping a positive attitude and laughing in my head saved me, as I emerged unscathed on the other side, heart racing but smiling.  In the end, it was clear that laughter truly can be the best medicine, even in the most extreme situations. My ""Beat Down"" day on the river taught me the power of humor in the face of adversity."
337	21135	8	3	I have always tried to be a happy person, and over time I have learned that laughter is a key component to my happiness. I have succeeded in being a happy girl most of my life. Even as a baby, I hardly ever cried; I was always laughing and giggling. As I have grown up, I have tried to keep up my happy-go-lucky spirits. Sometimes this was not the case, but that is simply reality. There have been many times in my life where laughter was all that surrounded me. I rely on laughter to keep me close with my friends, and so far, this trust has always came through, and it has worked for me. I often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness is really what life is all about. When I was first born, I didn't cry. I never cried very much as a baby. My mom reminds me of this whenever I ask her about my baby years. As a young kid, I wanted to be a part of everything that surrounded me! I was always looking for laughter and exciting events; I didn't want to miss a beat! My mom would have to take drives just so I could take a nap, and even then, I would hardly ever fell asleep. For if I did, @CAPS1 forbid, I might miss a moment of laughter! If someone else was laughing, I was laughing with them. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on, or I wondered why what they had said was so funny, but I loved the feeling laughing with other people. I am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever I look at my baby pictures. I don't have one of those pictures where I am bawling my eyes out, like you might find in most kid's baby pictures. In every baby picture of me, I'm laughing. If I'm not laughing, then there is a wide smile spread from ear to ear! Laughter is what kept me a happy baby! As a preteen, I was still the girl who you would always see laughing and smiling. I sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because I had never felt that type of feeling before. I was always so caught up in laughter that I never had time to think about the negative. Now, I unfortunately know the feeling of sadness and being upset, and I try incredibly hard to go back to when I didn't know these feelings. Whenever I'm feeling down, I attempt to find laughter in each thing I do. When I attempt this, I can always find laughter, and my spirits are brought back up. My friends are always a place I can go to for a pick me up. Especially @PERSON1, who is my best friend. Every time I am with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. @PERSON1 and I have not had the steadiest friendship, but what always brings us close again is laughter. Our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny. Usually, she is the one who finds this, and she makes me laugh. Laughter is what has kept @LOCATION1 and I so close for the past few years. If laughter didn't exist, I can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now! Not long ago, I was in the car with three of my closest friends: @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and @PERSON2. We were all laughing and singing as loud as we could to one of our favorite songs. I looked over to my friends and saw all of their smiling faces, and I found myself smiling too. I realized then, that laughter is truly what life is all about. Laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life. When I was little, I was gravitated towards those who I had the most fun with, and who I laughed with the most. As I've grown older, that same thinking is still there; I want to be with the people that make me laugh. The older I have gotten, the more I've learned about what I need in a friend. My main criteria is someone who can make me laugh. If I'm with someone with a dry sense of humor, and who doesn't talk at all, then I am going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious!  Laughter is something that I am extremely thankful for. It has been the key to making me happy for all fifteen years of my life! From when I was a baby, up until now, laughter is what always has been, and what always will be, what my life is all about!
338	21136	8	3	"A moment that laughter made everything better was when I was with my cousin @CAPS1, in @LOCATION1. He is going off to the @CAPS2 pretty soon, so spending time together was the main goal. @CAPS1 and I have a close bond, we talk as much as we can through the phone. This trip meant a lot to both @CAPS1 and I, we don't know how long it's going to be until we see each other again. Every laughter, and smile was something that we will always remember. My parents and I went to @LOCATION1 for @CAPS4. In @LOCATION1 I met up with my cousins, since my parents seemed to be busy all the time. Of course when there is a group of teenagers, well it's going to be loud. I remember- on our @DATE1 in @LOCATION1- my cousins and I got lost in the town we stayed. Now let me say in that town there is no way someone can get lost, it's so small. So when we got lost, we found it so funny and unbelievable that we got lost. Fortunately it was during the @DATE1, it wasn't too scary. My cousins and I say it wasn't our fault, we blame the taxi driver for not listening to our directions. Because it was such a funny mess, we didn't stop laughing until we got to our destination. In the car all three of us were argued where to go and what turn to take, while the taxi driver just listened and laughed at us. It was so embarrasing, niether of us wanted to see that taxi driver again. @CAPS1 is older and way more taller than me, he was the tallest person in town. Now @CAPS1 is always talking about how he is not afraid of anything and that he is so brave. Until one night all of that was forgotten while @CAPS1 spent the @TIME1. I shared a room with my two other cousins and @CAPS1 stayed in the room next to ours with my brother. It was about @TIME1, when we all went to bed. Out of nowhere we hear a weird noise outside our room. The next thing I hear is @CAPS1 yelling in the other room, wanting to come sleep with us. I was scared also, so my cousins and I decided to let him come in. I turned on the light while @CAPS1 and my brother were coming inside the room. My brother @PERSON3 came in with all the blankets and pillows, while @CAPS1 came in with the airbed. It was such a funny sight so we all started laughing. @CAPS1 said "" I @MONTH1 be big and tall but I get scared easily"", that made us laugh even more. The noise turned out to be two cats fighting in the street. I remember this moment so clearly in my head since it concluded our entire vacation with each other as family. While my parents and grandparents were out in the front lawn with all the guest. My cousins, @PERSON3 and I were in my room- like always the funny moments happened in my room- we were just bored and didn't know what to do. Slowly I was beginning to fall asleep on top of a suitcase. All of a sudden my cousin @PERSON1 comes up with this crazy idea of how I can fit in a suitcase. I thought she was kidding, but when I looked up to see everyone's face, I knew they were serious. So here I am opening a suitcase, taking everything out meanwhile @CAPS1 goes and gets his camera. The next thing I know I'm getting inside the suitcase. I'm no acrobat, nor am I really flexible, so when I notice that I am having no trouble getting inside the suitcase, I freak out. My brother is practically peeing his pants from laughing so hard, my cousins are just baffled at what they were witnessing. When it came to zipping up the suitcase, I told them that was to far, but they convinced me to zip up the zipper so they could roll me around. @CAPS1, @PERSON1 my brother and my third cousin @PERSON2 all took turns rolling me around. They kept saying on how we should go out in the front lawn and surprise my parents. I came out of the suitcase- I felt so dizzy- after my brother dropped the suitcase on the cement floor. We laughed and made jokes on how tiny I am as well as how much fun it was after I felt a little better. Since then @CAPS1 calls me ""@CAPS13"". Saying goodbye to everyone was hard, but saying goodbye to my cousin @CAPS1 was even harder. Knowing that I won't see him in a long time is unbearable. @CAPS1 and I have a strong bond, and I see him like"
339	21137	8	3	My best friend @PERSON2 turned thirteen on a beautiful @DATE1 day. Her family had a boat and, since it the weather was not quite uncomfortably hot but not so cold that it was chilly outside, @PERSON2 decided to have a sleepover birthday party on the deck with some of her closest friends. I was nervous about meeting her school-going friends since I'd always been a homeschooler and wasn't going to know any of the other people there. When I arrived at the boat, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friends @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. I greeted them all and @PERSON2 suggested we go @CAPS2. I was ready to walk down to the beach but @PERSON4 said she wanted to go @CAPS2 right on the docks. @CAPS2 by the boats wasn't allowed and I was certain @PERSON2 would say @CAPS1 immediately but instead she walked over to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sign, tore it down, and tossed it in the harbor. Her friends laughed and I laughed too. I'd never seen people act this way. But their disregard for rules and customs was contagious. As the day went by I watched the way they talked and behaved. The girls used bad language and spoke harshly. Everything they said was loud and shocking and everything they did was to be wild and challenge authority. They acted so free but there was something about their interactions with each other that seemed forced. I wondered if they were truly this way or if they were just pretending. But I understood that to be part of them I had to act like them. It was my first experience with peer pressure and I didn't know quite what to do. But the girls' attitudes were simple, so I adapted and started to behave like them. But it became clear to me that in order for there to be a group there has to be someone who wasn't in the group. That was @PERSON3. @PERSON2' parents had made her invite @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 and @PERSON1 knew it. They would sit close together so she didn't quite have room, they would look with disinterest at her without laughing when she tried to make a joke. I became aware that if I hadn't adapted so quickly to the attitude of the girls, I might have been the one they left out. I also knew that they could still turn on me if I did something wrong. We were sitting on the deck of the boat talking about movies and @PERSON3 was trying to tell the group about one that she'd just seen and was now her favorite. @PERSON1 stared blankly at her, refusing to smile. @PERSON4 looked off into space. @PERSON2 rolled her eyes to me. Suddenly, @PERSON1 cut @PERSON3 off and started talking about a scary movie she'd just seen. @PERSON3's eyes widened, then she looked down at the ground. Without thinking, I laughed and reached out to her arm, telling her I wanted to hear more about the movie. I'll never forget the way she lit up at that simple kindness. She smiled and began to gush about how amazing it was with renewed enthusiasm. @PERSON1 continued her story while watching @PERSON3 and me. @TIME1, when we went to the movie theater and the girls chose to sit in a row that only had room for four, I moved to sit with @PERSON3 in the next row down. We talked about the absurdity of straws for drinks and how we would never, ever wear skinny jeans. It was easy to talk to her. I didn't have to run everything I said through my head to make sure it wouldn't make anyone dislike me. Even @TIME1 when we were back at the boat, I tried to behave in the same way. I'd never had to focus on being myself before but I knew if I could do it, @PERSON3 would have someone to talk to. To my surprise, everyone became more natural. Soon we were all joking about what ridiculous things @PERSON2 should wish for with her birthday wish. I suggested a lifetime supply of marshmallows. @PERSON4 suggested the original @CAPS3 of @CAPS4. @PERSON3 suggested to wish that everyone in America would speak with a @CAPS5 accent on @PERSON2' birthday from now on. Everyone laughed. I saw that day that kindness is more powerful than cruelty. Making someone an enemy or an outsider doesn't make a friendship stronger. Neither does having to worry about saying or doing something that might make your friends reject you. But integrity and kindness can bring people closer. I learned that true friendship is not about conforming to a certain image but about being genuine and kind to others.
340	21138	8	3	"In life, I think that laughter is a very important element. Without it, everything just wouldn't seem as fun. Laughter can be a great thing, or it can be a little hurtful at times. Luckily my story is of great laughter. So, i will be telling a story of one of my adventures of laughter. It all started one day when me and my cousin @ORGANIZATION1 were at home. It was pretty much a normal day. Mom was out and about town, and dad was at work. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were having a great day because it was a @DATE1. Which meant school only went until eleven o' clock. With mom out and about town, we figured she wouldn't be home until much later. That gave us plenty of time to get everything accomplished. First thing we usually do when mom's gone is go get our music, and turn it up @CAPS3 loud. Since it was just the two of us home, we didn't care how loud it was. That particular @DATE1 was a surprise to us though. For it was strange enough to seem as a ""natural high"" day. We felt very positive with high energy. We were practically ready for everything. With the music so loud while we were cleaning the kitchen, we could barely understand each other talking. Then @CAPS5 awhile when the music stopped, it was just silent rushed cleaning in the kitchen. @ORGANIZATION1 and I tend to think a lot alike. It is so weird. Sometimes I feel like she's just my sister instead of my cousin. Anyway, out of no where, and complete silence, we started to sing. I don't think we realized we were singing the same exact song, at the same exact time. Once we realized that we were doing the same exact thing, it sort of creeped us out! We thought to ourselves... ""@CAPS4, how can two people ever be so much alike?!"" @CAPS5 that happened, we went on finishing our work. '@CAPS6 this day, all the time, we do a lot of the same things. We are very @CAPS2, much like sisters. I'm going to miss her so much when she leaves!"
341	21140	8	3	Laughter is what makes the world go round. It plays a crucial role in forming friendships and relationships, often leading to romance and marriage. Without laughter, people would be consumed by sadness and depression, causing them to stumble through life with heavy hearts. Stress would be prevalent, potentially escalating conflicts into wars. The survival of the world depends on the presence of laughter, as it brings joy, connection, and lightness to our lives.
342	21141	8	3	Laughter, an essential aspect of life, holds a special place in our hearts. The simple act of laughing can bring comfort and reassurance, signaling that everything is alright in that moment. It has the power to unite people, serving as a form of communication that transcends words. When one person starts laughing, it has a contagious effect, spreading joy and connecting individuals in shared merriment. However, while laughter can foster a sense of togetherness, it is important that it is not used to mock or belittle others. Personal experiences often highlight the transformative impact of laughter in diffusing tension and brightening the mood. Like a spark that ignites a flame, laughter has the ability to illuminate the spirits of many, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. When the sound of laughter fills the air, it acts as a beacon, drawing others in to share in the happiness and revel in the moment. The universal response to laughter is an eagerness to join in, eager to partake in the joyous occasion. Ultimately, laughter serves as a reminder of the beauty and simplicity of finding humor in everyday life, spreading happiness and forging connections that can uplift the human spirit.
343	21142	8	3	Laughter is truly a powerful tool in any friendship. It has the ability to mend relationships, bring people closer together, and bring joy even in the midst of disagreements. In my own experience with my best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON3, laughter has always been the glue that holds us together. Despite the occasional arguments or misunderstandings, we always find a way back to laughter, which reminds us of the deep bond we share. It is through laughter that we are able to let go of our differences, forgive each other, and move forward as stronger friends. The joy and connection that laughter brings is truly invaluable in any friendship, and I am grateful to have friends who can always make me smile, no matter what.
344	21143	8	3	Laughter is the key to every friendship I have. If a person is really nice, but I cannot seem to make them laugh, or vice versa, it is hard to find common ground between us. When I see my friendships and reflect on them, it reminds me of all of the great memories over the years and months that were filled with joyous laughter. The simple things that make me happy in life bring about laughter. Whenever differences become clear in friendships, it only takes a memory brought up that made us laugh, to trigger that friendship back into place.  Whenever I'm with my best friend, @PERSON1, things that normally would not be funny whatsoever, are. Another element that's put in place is the fact that @PERSON1 and I don't hang out as often as we used to, when we went to the same school @DATE1 @DATE1. So, the absence of each other makes us treasure our times together even more than usual.  Three nights ago, I went to dinner with @PERSON1 and her mom at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had numerous amounts of laughing sessions throughout dinner. Everyone who is ever around us, either think we are very annoying because we cannot stop laughing, or understand what it's like to have a best friend that makes your @DATE2 brighter, and think we're funny.  There has never been a true fight between @PERSON1 and I because of how close we've become over the @DATE1 and realized how much we are like twins. So conflicts are never really brought up. However, one of my other very close friends, @PERSON2, that goes to my previous school with @PERSON1, has been having problems with @PERSON1. The most important thing to me is that they get along, because they are two of the most important people in my life.  I would do anything to make them become friends like they used to be, even though I probably don't have the power to do so. I can get close into both of their hearts and stay on a level of laughter, secrets and wonderful memories. But when they are not getting along with each other, it's not so easy to bring them together.  I had been with @PERSON2 @TIME1, so I knew what she was feeling as well as @PERSON1, who I was with currently. I tried to shortly bring up the subject and at first, she rejected it. I knew that @PERSON2 meant a lot to her, and also that they had only gotten in a small argument over something silly.  The issue was that both of them can be very stubborn, and in any type of argument, neither will say they are sorry first. It's because they both don't believe they have done anything wrong. In this case, it was a small miscommunication.  I ended up going into more detail with @PERSON1 about how @PERSON2 was feeling, because I could completely relate. She later started seeing the other side of things, once I got her laughing. The key to my friendships, is laughter. Especially while we are young.  There is no way I could have gotten @PERSON1 to listen to my view on @PERSON2's feelings unless they were what she wanted to hear. So, I told her what she wanted to hear. Things that made her laugh and giggle. Things that brought back memories of the good times her, @PERSON2 and I had had. She thought about it, and even though she wasn't completely ready to full out run up to @PERSON2 and hug her over and over, and make peace, she was ready to consider communicating with @PERSON2 again. That was enough for me to feel good.  The rest of the @TIME2, we put aside the drama and laid back and enjoyed the @TIME2. We played our favorite songs and were cracking up the entire @TIME2 about the tiniest things, or mistakes we made in our speech when we talked to each other.  I know that as I get older, I will look back on my two best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, and realize how they made my high school years so amazing. They brought a better person out of me, someone who can enjoy life to the fullest by being in the right crowd and having innocent fun.  They taught me that you can be great friends with more than one person, and even if those two don't get along, you can find a balance and not end up excluding anyone. In the end, the important thing is that you were a good friend to everyone and weren't selfish in the mix. Laughter has brought me to that place.  I find that when I'm laughing about sincerely great things, and not making fun of someone or something, I become a lot less selfish and a better friend to people, because my intent is beautiful. I wouldn't get that perspective without true friends that @CAPS3
345	21144	8	3	Close connections are strengthened through shared laughter and fond memories. Reflecting on past moments of joy and laughter with loved ones brings people closer together, creating a bond that withstands the test of time. Laughter not only brings joy to the present moment but also serves as a reminder of the special connections shared with others. Remembering funny and heartwarming experiences with family and friends can bring people closer, fostering a sense of unity and shared happiness. In the end, laughter is a powerful tool that not only creates lasting memories but also strengthens relationships, making the bond between individuals even stronger.
346	21145	8	3	I would say laughter is something that comes from the heart. But really it is what is on the inside and how you really feel about the person and, how they feel about you, that person makes you laugh you know that they really love you and care about you. If someone makes you laugh and they make you laugh, then you are with the one and only true person. Laughter is from the heart and soul. When someone tells you something that makes you laugh, then it is true between you two. Feelings, laughter, is a lot between two people. Laughter is from the soul and deep within your body. It helps clear the mind and body, but what I really think is that when someone makes you laugh, they see the real side of who you really are and what you can become. You laugh about all kinds of things like jokes, funny videos, funny stories, and more. But the real thing is that at least someone makes you laugh. It is said that laughter is the important part of any relationship, emphasizing the need to laugh and have fun. It is a feeling that people have, and when shared, it strengthens the bond between them. Laughter can come from funny jokes, silly actions, or just spontaneous moments of joy. It is essential to have a good laugh once in a while to clear your mind and soul, bringing positivity and lightness to your life. Laughter is a universal language that connects people and brings happiness to their hearts. So, never underestimate the power of a good laugh in your life and relationships.
347	21146	8	3	Laughter is an essential aspect of sharing memories and connecting with others. It creates a bond that transcends differences in age, background, or status. Inside jokes, in particular, hold a special place in our hearts, bringing joy and camaraderie to those who share them. As individuals, making others laugh can be a powerful way to spread happiness and create lasting connections. One memorable experience that showcases the power of laughter occurred when I was seven years old, attempting to make cupcakes with a friend. Despite the messy mishaps and ensuing chaos, we found ourselves covered in flour, laughing uncontrollably at the absurdity of the situation. Even in the face of trouble and reprimand, laughter served as a coping mechanism, easing tension and turning a challenging moment into a cherished memory. This event taught me the importance of finding humor in difficult situations and the enduring power of laughter to bring people together. Reflecting on this experience, I am reminded of the simple joy that laughter can bring and the lasting impact it can have on our relationships with others. The ability to share laughter and create moments of light-heartedness is a gift that we should cherish and embrace in our interactions with one another.
348	21147	8	3	"Laughter is a significant aspect of life, and it was something I cherished witnessing in my grandfather, @PERSON1, especially during his final days. As a child, I had a passion for drawing, and my grandpa was always there to guide me with valuable tips on improving my skills. His smile when I mastered his techniques remains etched in my memory. Spending most of my childhood in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, where my grandparents resided, allowed me to create countless precious memories with them. I recall our visits to @CAPS1 lanes bowling alley, where we had a blast together.   One hilarious incident involved my grandpa mistaking potatoes for his coffee in the microwave, leading to impromptu hash browns and shared laughter. Despite not being able to experience activities like fishing or camping with my grandparents, I treasure the moments we did share, such as my grandpa painting my Boy Scouts derby race car. His unwavering support and presence at my competitions brought me immense joy, even if I often ended up in second place.  Additionally, our collie dog, @ORGANIZATION1, was a beloved companion who brought us closer. My grandpa's dedication to training him resulted in a remarkably obedient and helpful pet. Reflecting on the time spent with my grandparents, from after-school visits to their house in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION2, to morning routines of watching ""@CAPS3 the @CAPS4,"" fills me with nostalgia and gratitude.   As I grew older, I regret not visiting them as frequently, but fond memories captured in home videos serve as reminders of the laughter and love we shared. One particular memory of receiving a mullet haircut from my grandpa showcases his playful nature and willingness to indulge my whims.   In our final moments together, I had the opportunity to bring joy to my grandpa through thoughtful gifts, witnessing his happiness was a priceless gift in itself. Looking back, I realize that amidst life's challenges, laughter with loved ones remains a source of pure joy and connection that transcends time."
349	21148	8	3	Laughter is indeed a crucial element in any relationship, serving as a bridge that connects two individuals on a deeper level. I once witnessed a couple whose bond was strengthened by their shared sense of humor. They believed that without laughter, their relationship would not have endured. Laughter not only brings joy and happiness but also fosters trust and authenticity between partners. It allows individuals to be themselves and feel comfortable in each other's presence. I have personally experienced how laughter can overcome even the most challenging situations in a relationship. It has the power to lighten the mood, ease tensions, and strengthen the emotional connection between two people. In my own relationship, laughter played a significant role in keeping the spark alive, even during times of conflict. It allowed us to communicate without words and express our feelings in a light-hearted manner. Ultimately, laughter is a key ingredient that can bring individuals closer together and create lasting bonds of friendship and love.
350	21149	8	3	Laughter is crucial in any relationship, as it brings joy and lightens the mood, even in difficult times. In my circle of friends, @PERSON2, @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS1, laughter plays a vital role. @CAPS1, also known as @PERSON1, stands out for her infectious personality.   @PERSON2 and I share a special bond filled with laughter. We used to do everything together, from school to meals, always finding humor in any situation. When @PERSON2 faced a tough moment with her @CAPS3's unexpected decision to leave, I was there to support her. Despite our recent disagreements, I knew I had to be there for her.  Listening to @PERSON2's heartbreak, I empathized with her pain, having experienced my parents' divorce. As she struggled with her emotions, I offered a listening ear and reassurance. Inviting her over to distract her, we found solace in playing guitar hero, sharing genuine laughs that lifted our spirits.  Through laughter, @PERSON2 and I rekindled our friendship, realizing that humor could heal wounds and strengthen bonds. Now, we communicate openly, knowing that laughter is not just a source of joy but a pillar of our relationship. In every interaction, we ensure to ask about each other's well-being, understanding that laughter is the key to maintaining a deep connection.
351	21150	8	3	A few years ago, me, my mom, and my sister @PERSON1 were at a sub shop for dinner. While we were in line waiting for our sandwiches, @PERSON1, who was several inches shorter than me at the time, claimed that she was taller than me. I straightened up and insisted that I was still taller. In response, she stood up on her tip-toes, making her taller than me, and triumphantly declared her victory. Not wanting to be outdone, I quickly followed suit, standing on my tip-toes to reclaim my height advantage. This playful back-and-forth exchange caught the attention of a cute guy standing behind @LOCATION1. From his amused expression, it seemed like he thought we were engaging in a playful, childish competition. Embarrassed by the unintended audience, I immediately retreated to my normal height and suggested to my mom that we find a place to sit. As we settled down at a table, I shared the amusing incident with her, and we both had a good laugh. The memory of that lighthearted moment still brings a smile to our faces, and we continue to joke about it to this day. : )
352	21151	8	3	Laughter can create a strong bond that is hard to break. I have experienced how laughter can quickly form genuine friendships and mend relationships. One particular memory stands out to me from when I was a child. My sister and I used to constantly argue and fight, but one day, while cleaning the house, a simple change in music sparked a turning point in our relationship. Despite our heated argument, a familiar song came on, and we couldn't resist dancing and laughing together. In that moment, our anger dissipated, and we realized the silliness of our fight. From then on, laughter became a common thread that strengthened our bond. Although my sister now lives far away, we still connect through laughter, sharing moments of joy and connection. Laughter has the power to transcend conflicts and bring people closer together, forging lasting relationships built on shared happiness and understanding.
353	21153	8	3	"""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" This quote rings true in the context of friendships and relationships. Laughter plays a vital role in connecting people and resolving conflicts. I have experienced this firsthand with my friends. Once, during a mall hangout, two friends got into a serious argument. Feeling helpless, I intervened with humor, recalling fun memories from a recent camp we attended together. This simple act broke the tension, and soon, laughter filled the air as we reminisced about the good times we shared. The conflict dissolved, and our bond grew stronger. Laughter truly has the power to bridge gaps and bring people closer together."
354	21154	8	3	Laughter plays a vital role in life, family, and relationships, helping people navigate tough times and providing a sense of camaraderie. It is a significant part of my life, serving as a coping mechanism and a source of joy. While some may view excessive laughter as inappropriate, I believe it is essential for maintaining a positive outlook and strengthening bonds with others. Making people laugh, even with silly jokes, brings me a sense of fulfillment and connection. In my family, humor is a cornerstone of our interactions, fostering memorable moments and deepening our relationships.  One instance where laughter proved invaluable was during tense situations with my sports team. When conflicts arose, a light-hearted comment broke the tension and allowed us to release stress, even if only temporarily. Similarly, during road trips with my family, shared laughter over inside jokes and silly antics created lasting memories and strengthened our bond. These moments, filled with laughter and joy, hold a special place in my heart and serve as a reminder of the importance of cherishing time with loved ones.  Overall, laughter not only brings levity to challenging circumstances but also fosters connections and creates lasting memories. Embracing humor and finding reasons to laugh, whether in difficult situations or everyday interactions, can help bring people together and make life more enjoyable. Laughing with loved ones is a simple yet powerful way to cultivate happiness and strengthen relationships, leaving a lasting impact on our lives.
355	21155	8	3	The @CAPS1 Of @DATE2 The warm @DATE2 sun, pools to cool down children, parents joining with friends and family to have picnics and potlucks, and late night slumber parties. Then there's my @DATE2 @CAPS1. The sunshine came in bright throughout the window illuminating the whole room, I awoke to see the bright light of the sun. I ran into my brother @PERSON2's room, to make sure he was up and ready to start the day with me. He clearly was; the early riser himself. We left his room and started to smell the sweet aroma of chocolate chip cookies, we booked it down the hall into the kitchen to talk to mom about what we were going to do that day. When we got there mom turned around to show us her gigantic belly, which was holding my soon to be baby brother, we asked her what we were doing that day. Disappointed at her answer she had nothing planned. My brother and I were bummed but we quickly got dressed and went to the backyard where we were pitching together, the ball hit softly on my nice leather glove while on my brothers it made a slap. My mom came outside and yelled to @PERSON2 to go over to the sliding glass door, for a second I thought I was in trouble for pitching too hard to @PERSON2 but luckily that wasn't the case. My mom then called me over as well to let me know my cousin was coming over. My first thought was great @ORGANIZATION2's coming over! Then I started to think, my cousin @ORGANIZATION2 is weird... she is always making up lies, telling non funny jokes, playing with @PERSON1 @CAPS2 cards, and playing weird stupid video games. I quickly ask my mom when she is coming so I can ready myself, for whatever I am going to have to put up with my mom tells me fifteen minutes. I quickly run past her into my room where my phone is, and call my neighbors @DATE1 and @ORGANIZATION1 to see if I could hang out. Their mom answers and says I can come over there as soon as the girls chores are done, excited I tell my mom I will be at the neighbors house for a little while and @PERSON2 would have to hang with @ORGANIZATION2 while I'm gone. Shes tells me that its alright as long as I leave before @ORGANIZATION2 gets here. I await the phone call telling me that I can go over to their house. Noon is rolling around and they still haven't called, @ORGANIZATION2 will be here soon and I am tired of waiting. I decide to go out front where I can roller-blade around the block, I tell @PERSON2 that I am going outside and he tags alone with me. @PERSON2 and I put on our roller blades and head out of the garage, my mom comes out right as we are about to leave and tells us @ORGANIZATION1 called and we can go over there now, we rush in and quickly try to step up the stairs in the garage to the house. Slipping as we try to shove each other out of the way with the roller blades on, I finally get inside and start unhooking the latches. Get them off and head for the door when all of the sudden I hear a knock just as I reach for the door, it's @ORGANIZATION2. I hurry out the the door saying hello to my cousin as I quickly escape to the neighbors house. I get to @ORGANIZATION1's house and we decide to go outside to play, and run with her new puppy. We play for a little while then decide we should go inside and get a snack we do, then the doorbell rings. @ORGANIZATION1 runs to the door with the puppy at her heels and lets the people in, I turn around from the table to see who it is and see @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON2 standing inside the door. They came over to play too, I let @DATE1 know we should watch a movie. She went over to the movie cabinet and pulled out the brand new @CAPS3 movie! We all sit down and start to watch the movie each with a bowl of popcorn. We watched almost all of it when the doorbell rang, the puppy bolted to the door and @DATE1 got up to answer it this time my mom stepped inside and told @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2 and I that it was time to leave. The puppy was ecstatic to see my mother so she peed all over the linoleum floor. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't notice the dog pee on the floor, so she ran for the door to get her shoes on and she went flying backwards into the dog pee everyone was laughing even @ORG
356	21156	8	3	"It was a cloudy @DATE1, but nothing to be sad about when among friends. This circle of friends had just spent the whole weekend together, and they were heading home. I was among this group as a young @CAPS6 who had known this group for three years. Three years before, I was shy, but something changed that. The group was called @ORGANIZATION2. This @ORGANIZATION2 was for teenagers and even some college students. There were very few of us though. It was our last year as @ORGANIZATION2, then we would be kicked out of the church we were meeting at. Together, we made that weekend be our best and last @ORGANIZATION1. The boys were very comfortable around the girls, so much in fact, that they were going to make a deal with us. The deal was that during the car ride, if we rubbed their backs, then they would rub our feet. At @CAPS2 the girls thought this to be a crazy idea, but as time went on, that foot rub seemed really good. Three pairs were made, with a boy and a @CAPS6 in each. The boys sat in the second to last row in the car, and the girls sat in the back. I rubbed @PERSON3's back, but it's okay. Out of all the girls there besides his sister, I know @PERSON3 the best, so I was perfect for the job. This moment was a very giggly time for the girls, and a very relaxed time for the boys. While the boys were falling asleep, the girls were laughing hysterically. Since we had our feet right beside the boys for them to rub, then the easiest way to wake them up was to kick them. This just caused more laughter, and more alert boys. After we had enough with the foot and back rubs, then we needed to find something new to laugh about to make the time pass faster. It was the @DATE1 before @DATE1, so our @ORGANIZATION2 leader gave us each a bag of candy hearts. The little messages on those candy hearts could entertain us for about an hour and a half. We would pick one randomly out of the bag and hand it to someone. I ended up giving both @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 candy hearts that said, ""@CAPS1"". They were very confused, but again it caused more laughter. @PERSON3 accidentally gave one to @PERSON1 that said, ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"". Andrew got hearts multiple times that said, ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"". Once that was beginning to become boring, then we found a new way to make the candy hearts entertaining. We would read the heart @CAPS2, then give it to someone saying it was from someone else. Kyrene gave one to @PERSON4 saying it was from @PERSON2 that said, ""@CAPS7 @NUM1 @CAPS4"". Whenever we had one that said, ""@CAPS9"", then we would give it to @PERSON1 saying it was from @LOCATION1. Earlier she had said to him, ""I thought you were @CAPS10 for a moment there"", but numerous people thought she said, ""I thought you were @CAPS9 for a moment there."" @CAPS11, we try to make it up to @PERSON1 for @PERSON2 by giving him ""@CAPS9"" candy hearts. We ended that @DATE1 with hugs, goodbyes, and laughter of retold inside jokes. A few phone numbers were exchanged, and a few that should have been weren't. The trip ended well, and everyone felt just a little bit closer. We could hug this person @CAPS11, or we could get this person's phone number. Something in us changed that we could be a little closer. In my experience, I would say that laughter is only one element, because to get laughter you need to love who you're laughing with. If I didn't love the people I was in the car with then I would have not laughed with them. They say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I don't believe this is true. I think it's love that is the shortest distance and laughter is just love being shown. The statement that laughter is the shortest distance is assuming that laughter is the cause, but in truth, it is the effect. Love is the cause of laughter. If laughter was the cause of love, then this world would be doomed to never know either. Without love, there can be no laughter. Love is what brings people together, and laughter is just one of the many ways it manifests."
357	21157	8	3	"Sound someone hears something funny, said person begins to laugh. The funny thing being heard was someone else laughing, the whole room begins to engage in laughter. This has happened to myself many times, but the one time I remember most, was I began making strange noises. I normally make sound when I'm bored and want to start a conversation, but I had never laughed and made sounds like that before. That moment changed the way I laugh today. The date was my birthday, it was my party at the water park. I invited my two best friends, to tag along. We love to laugh and just have fun. So, inviting them was a no-brainer. Immediately, we decided that our favorite water slide in the park was the grand and slightly over sized funnel. It was a large funnel with flashing red and lights inside. We went on it over, and over, and over again. The adrenaline was pumping through our veins as the ride would end and we'd leaped from the inter tube and rush to the stairs where the waiting line was held. We talked, chatted, sang, yelled, and most likely annoyed every other person in line. Then, we finally got to the top of the stairs, we became in awe of the lifeguard. But, not because he was gorgeous. He looked as if he was a wee little leprechaun! We stifled a small laugh and got on the ride. asked him to turn the inter tube around so that she could go down the ride backwards. He then began to talk, and we couldn't help but smirk. He began flirting with us by saying in his manly voice, ""want me to ride down with ladies?"" he said that, was the first to break. Then me. Then. We couldn't hold it in anymore. He then awkwardly cackled and pushed the inter tube down the slide. We were laughing so hard that we weren't even paying attention to the ride. Then it hit me. ""That dude looks like."" I screamed to. the ride ended, we thought for a second. Then undoubtedly went again. Truth be told, he look like. We began laughing again throughout the ride, up until I made a strangely abnormal sound. I made a noise that sounded as if a pig had just had it's tail yanked. It was almost a shriek, but more of a squeal. just happened? I seriously just...just...?! Note: A best friend will always be there for, especially if something embarrassing. It's their job to poke fun at one's strangeness. So of course, was the first to say, ""the heck was that?"" followed by's expression of, ""just?"" That's we began to laugh and then I started making even more unusual noises. I started squealing, snorting, and hiccuping. We were still laughing at my crazy squel we got off the inter tube. Later after we had our fill of the water park's, decided we should go in the wave pool. Of course, and I agreed. The speaker system in the area started blaring the song by. is my go-to-gal it comes to breaking out in song. She began singing, then we all joined in. But it got to the chorus, ""I throw my hands up in the air sometimes..."" we all said, ""I throw my banana in the air sometimes..."" ""my, we should totally make a song of our own."" said. We began thinking of different lyrics we could say in our song. At first, we knew exactly to say to fill in the chorus, then we decided that the song needed more lyrics. That was harder to think up. But, then we decided that we should make the song about food and the way we eat it. We had so much fun. Eventually, we came up with the entire song and people were staring at us as we screamed it to the world. Then, the terible noise arrived again. began to laugh, then and I joined in harmony, then a rude interruption by my. and continued to laugh at my sound. I joined in with them, laughing at myself. That night we went to bed, humming the tune of our new song, out loud. Now, whenever we hang out, we begin to sing our song, and sometimes, even dance! People still look at us strange, but then we just start laughing, and I start making sound."
358	21158	8	3	How just one moment can change the entire purpose of one's life. In my case, it was the combination of a friend and a girl that made me see my existence in a whole new light. Reflecting on the past few months, I can't help but chuckle at how quickly my life took a turn for the better. It's amazing how a single person can steer you in the right direction, and in my case, that person was a girl who brought me to church and showed me the power of love. With her by my side, I feel like I am on the path to eternity, guided by faith and affection.  The first time I laid eyes on her, it felt like a jolt of electricity running through my veins. I knew I had to pursue her, and nothing was going to stand in my way. With the encouragement of my friend, I mustered up the courage to approach her, and the rest is history. As we grew closer, I realized that she was not just a passing crush, but someone who held the key to my happiness and purpose.  As our relationship blossomed, I found myself delving deeper into my faith, thanks to a newfound friend who introduced me to the teachings of the Bible. This journey led me to a baptism that solidified my commitment to both my faith and my relationship. With love blooming between us, we decided to take the next step and officially become a couple.  Our time together has been filled with unforgettable moments, from romantic beach outings to thrilling fair rides. But it was a rainy night and a near-fatal accident that truly made me appreciate the precious gift of life and love. As I emerged from the wreckage, battered but alive, her face was the only thing on my mind. In that moment, I knew that I was destined to be with her, no matter what challenges may come our way.  Today, we stand strong together, our love unwavering and our hearts intertwined. I have finally mustered the courage to say those three little words that hold so much meaning - I love you. In her, I have found my purpose, my happiness, and my reason for being. And for that, I am eternally grateful.
359	21159	8	3	"My cousin @PERSON1 and her boyfriend, @PERSON2, had been dating for three years and they had planned a special date for their anniversary. They made reservations at the @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1 and then take a walk on the beach after-wards. For @PERSON1 this was a small step up from an ordinary date but for @PERSON2 this was the biggest day of his life. This late @DATE2 evening was the day he would ask @PERSON1 to be his wife! @PERSON2 pulled up to @PERSON1's house at precisely five-o'clock pm. In his hands he held a bouquet of roses which were handed to the most beautiful girl on the @ORGANIZATION1. She was dressed in a white and pink dress with matching pink heels and her hair was all done up fancy. @PERSON2 was speechless as he handed her the bouquet. After the roses were placed in some water, he escorted her down the steps to his car, @CAPS1 number one. @PERSON2 couldn't start his car. In utter embarrassment @PERSON2 asked @PERSON1 to drive her car to dinner. She giggled and assured him that she didn't mind. When they arrived at @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 they were sad to find that their reservation had been double booked and the other couple had arrived only moments before them. In despair, they set off in search of something else. Everything else that @DATE1 @TIME1 seemed to be full so @PERSON1 decided on @CAPS2's, her favorite restaurant. After a good forty-five minutes of waiting to be seated they were lucky enough to get a window seat. @PERSON2 ordered a burger and fries because he is not a seafood fan. In contrary, @PERSON1 loves seafood so she had a bowl of @CAPS2's world famous clam chowder. When dinner was finished @PERSON2 excused himself to use the restroom before they left but as he was getting up, he knocked over his @ORGANIZATION3 and it spilled all over @PERSON1's new dress, creating a brown, sticky mess. @PERSON1 cleaned up the best she could but there was almost no use. So far so bad, but the worst was still yet to come. When they came to pay the bill @PERSON2 began panicking. He realized that he had left his wallet in his car! @PERSON2's face turned bright red as he watched his girlfriend pay the bill. Good thing we didn't go to the @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2! he thought. @PERSON1 was ready to go home but @PERSON2 was determined to propose to her so he begged her to walk on the beach and watch the sun set. She agreed. With @CAPS6 step, @PERSON2's heart began to beat faster, his throat dry, his hands sweat, and his body shake. They sat on the warm sand and talked for ten minutes. Finally @PERSON1 was really ready to go so this was his last chance. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the lone ring. As he got on one knee, the ring fell into the sand. It was getting dark so after a minute or two of frantic searching, he gave up and began to cry. @PERSON1 was so confused and thought he was crying because she wanted to leave but as soon as @PERSON2 calmed himself he told his story and how this was supposed to be the perfect proposal for the perfect girl but it turned out the be the worst @TIME1 of his life. @PERSON1 just laughed which made @PERSON2 think she was mocking him but he continued anyway. ""@PERSON1, will you be my wife?"" @CAPS4 tears of joy she said, ""@CAPS5! As long as @CAPS6 day can be an adventure like tonight."" @CAPS6 time they mention this story they bust out laughing even though it wasn't funny at the time. Ever since then they have had many hilarious and embarrassing stories that they can laugh at now. From awkward dinner dates to failed proposals, their love story is full of unforgettable moments."
360	21160	8	3	It was another warm muggy day, when my best friend and I decided to go to our friend's house. As soon as we arrived, my friend realized he forgot his phone charger at my house. We didn't want to walk all the way back, so we came up with a risky plan involving a dirt bike. Despite warnings, my friend took off on the dirt bike but was soon stopped by the police. After a ticket and a ride home, I found the discarded evidence and returned it the next day. Despite the incident, it became the talk of the town, and my friend had to face the consequences with his parents.
361	21161	8	3	"It was a day like any other. I was going to chess club to challenge the board one holder. I had never piercingly met him for I was new to the club, but I knew that if I didn't play @CAPS7 best I would lose. I entered the room hoping to see that the holder was not there, @CAPS2 was. @CAPS2 had on a blue baseball cap, a blue t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and a pair of black shoes. His hair was as dark as his shoes and looked as if @CAPS2 had not brushed it in years, his skin was very pale I wondered how @CAPS2 could go out in sun with out some way to block it. The board was set up and ready, @CAPS1 was the clock. the clock had an hour on each side. I walked up to him, @CAPS2 didn't even seem to notice me until I spoke, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS12 guna beat me fast. I know I'm guna lose."" @CAPS2 just sat there, staring at me like I had insulted him. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS2 scoffed, ""your the kid they think can beat me."" ""I guess. I never really thought about it."" I was unsure as to why that would mater, but I was playing him, @CAPS1 I was absolutely sure that it was or was going to mater very soon. ""@CAPS4 please take @CAPS12 seat @CAPS1 we can begin the matches!"" the coach called out, ""@CAPS5, we all know the rules, the black player @MONTH1 start the white @CAPS4 clocks. No talking."" ""@CAPS1."" I said, ""your name is what."" ""@CAPS7 name is @CAPS8."" I hit the clock. Expecting him to be like lightning and move, I moved @CAPS7 piece. Bad move. @CAPS2 called and pointed out that I had moved a piece when it was not @CAPS7 turn. The coach came up to the clock and pressed some buttons, @CAPS2 didn't even look like @CAPS2 cared about the game and if a board ten holder could beat a board one holder. When @CAPS2 set the clock down the clock showed fifty to fifty five. I was already down on time and the game hadn't even really began.  @CAPS8 picked up the kings bishops pawn and moved it up one square. @CAPS2 hit the clock like lightning. That was wired @CAPS2 moved the weakest piece on the board. I had to stop and think for a vary long time or what felt like it. I looked over at the clock to see how I was doing on time. It was terrible I had been sitting there for about ten minutes and I hadn't even moved one lousy piece. @CAPS1 I picked up @CAPS7 king's pawn and moved up two squares hopping @CAPS2 wouldn't do anything that could hurt @CAPS7 in @CAPS13 game. I hit @CAPS7 clock.  We sat there for what must have been half an hour. @CAPS1 I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back I checked on how the other @CAPS4 were doing. Only one game was done it was @PERSON1 and a kid I didn't know. I asked who won, it was the kid I didn't know as odd as that was I had to get back to @CAPS7 game.   @CAPS2 still hadn't moved, for a minute I thought @CAPS2 was having a problem breathing. @CAPS2 let out a yawn and moved his king's knight's pawn up two squares and hit the clock. That was weird, @CAPS2 just did fools @CAPS10. I didn't think for a minute, I piked up @CAPS7 queen and brought it all the way to one square in front of his rook pawn. I said ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10."" in a loud voice.  @CAPS2 started to laugh, at first I was confused for I beat him.Then @CAPS2 said,""I do @CAPS13 with every one I play for the first time, @CAPS13 opening.""@CAPS2 started to laugh again, @CAPS13 time I joined him we both were laughing because I beat him. Then @CAPS2 said, ""@CAPS12 are the first one to see that they could win in the first two."" That surprised me I thought that @CAPS2 won all the time when really @CAPS2 had been giving people games and the didn't know it. We started to laugh again"
362	21163	8	3	Laughter is indeed a vital element in life, bringing people together and creating moments of joy and connection. Recently, I had the opportunity to experience the power of laughter during a fun night out at the bowling alley with my mom, sister, and friends. Despite my lackluster performance in the game, we all found ways to turn the evening into a hilarious and memorable one. From trying out new and unconventional bowling techniques to experiencing comical mishaps, we shared countless laughs and created lasting memories. It was a night filled with laughter and camaraderie, reminding me of the importance of finding humor and joy in even the simplest of moments. Laughter truly has a way of bridging gaps between people and fostering stronger relationships, making life more vibrant and enjoyable.
363	21164	8	3	"The @CAPS1 We @CAPS2 in @CAPS3  Laughter is a usual @CAPS1 used in many different ways, to release tension, to appreciate a funny joke, or maybe just to express a giggly mood. I find that laughter is the key to having a close relationship with people. It could be because each persons laugh is personal and every time someone laughs they aren't thinking about how they look or what they should say next to fill the awkward silence, their guard is completely down for just an instant. Growing up with my father has proven this fact to me by having our relationship based off of laughing our problems, or difficulties with one another, away. Although I @CAPS2 a good relationship with my @CAPS4 the relationship with my @CAPS7 has always been a silent and guarded one because we @CAPS2 been unsuccessful in bringing humor to the relationship. Which proves to me the point that laughter and humor are two very important things in creating a bond between two people.  Ever since I was a young girl my father and I @CAPS2 always been very close and I @CAPS2 begun to realize that whenever I speak of him to an adult or anyone really, they will know him. Everyone always seems to know my @CAPS4. It might be because of his humor, or maybe because older women find him attractive, or maybe because he's nice, either way he's been popular his whole life. Also, ever since I've known my @CAPS4 he has never been much of a serious type of guy, he will make some sort of humorous comment or joke no matter the circumstance. It doesn't matter if I'm sad, or enraged under the spell of my adolescence and hormones, my mood will completely change and because of this it has shown me the power of laughter. The relationship between my @CAPS7 and I, however, has always been a rocky one, for several reasons I'm sure but one of them I believe is we were never capable of laughing together, or enjoying ourselves. See, she comes from @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 and in @LOCATION3 things are done a bit differently. Laughing or fooling around for instance is considered being disrespectful or immature, everyone is to act properly and children are to respect their elders. So when my @CAPS4 married her, I introduced her to sarcasm and jokes. I never got the reaction I was looking for, and since there was never that connection through laughs and humor I felt guarded around her. I @CAPS2 never been able to feel like I can express myself around her. I constantly feel judged and awkward and this has allowed me to see the effects of absence of laughter.  A human beings laughter is emotional and personal, like crying, it immediately allows you to feel happy, sort of like a drug. Once you get someone to laugh you are allowing them to open up to you in a small way, and not only are they opening up to you, but by the good reaction you received you begin to create a connection with them. If there is no laughter in a relationship with two people it tends to get awkward and neither person can feel comfortable opening up to each other. Since I am my @CAPS9 daughter, I tend to apply jokes in the same way he does. When there's tension, when someone's upset and I want to immediately solve the problem, I make them laugh.  Someone once said that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", how I interpret this quote is that laughter is the one @CAPS1 everyone enjoys doing, it can either build or keep relationships going. It's the one @CAPS1 we will always @CAPS2 in @CAPS3. So c'mon guys laugh a little. Laughter truly is the universal language that brings people together, breaks down barriers, and creates lasting bonds. So, don't underestimate the power of a good laugh - it could be the key to strengthening your relationships and making life a little brighter."
364	21166	8	3	"The day was not a fun one. We all just heard really bad news. None of us were even close to smiling. None of us. Even the people that you always see smiling, they had the most serious look on their faces. It was just a bad day. But then one of our friends, @PERSON1, had a great idea of going online to find something to cheer us up. It truly was an amazing idea. We spent hours on the computer just sitting there looking up ridiculous videos that we knew about, trying to make each other laugh. That's when our day started to be a bit better. But it went back down a bit when a few people left to go home. Only three of us were still at @LOCATION1's house. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I were all sitting there watching @LOCATION2 when a show we all loved came on. Psych. It was a new episode too! What a great day it turned out to be. The show is full of really puny and dumb humor, but it fit all three of us, @PERSON1 the most. We were all laughing and having a good time. @PERSON1 was laughing after the show was over. So we asked what was so funny. He just kept laughing. For five minutes, he was laughing. When he finally stopped, we asked again. What was so darn funny? Then he told us, ""I was laughing at my own laugh. I sound really weird."" That's when we all started laughing. How could he be laughing at his own laugh? We soon realized how hard it was to stop. It turned out to be an okay day after all that happened. Now, whenever we are having a bad day, we just bring up that day where we laughed at ourselves for ten minutes. And the day is all better."
365	21167	8	3	Recently over the weekend of last month, I was fortunate enough to meet my uncle whom I have never consciously met. This to me was a major part of learning about my family because I met up with not only my uncle, but my legitimate comedian aunt who I have known since I could remember, and my father at a local Italian restaurant called Bella Napoli. These three were all siblings, and this allowed me to peer into what siblings will joke about, talk about, and bring forth a feeling of nostalgia for each other. I myself have a stepsister, but the degree of nonsense being presented before me was of a much greater magnitude than I could ever fathom. Everyone was constantly in a state of laughter from the stories of the shenanigans that my father and his brother and sister managed to get into. At one point I started having a very hard time breathing. The stories and all-together bad jokes being distributed made me understand that in my family there have been a long line of relatives who inherited some gene that forces us to tell bad jokes. Not even inappropriate but plain stupid jokes. I realized that my children will be telling bad jokes. We dined there for a couple of hours before my dad had to leave for his home up in New Jersey, and I needed to be taken home to my family here in Pennsylvania. But tomorrow was planned for a day of exploration of Philadelphia and plenty of stupid jokes to be exchanged.  I woke up the next day, got dressed, and prepared myself for laughter I was aware I would be keeling over because of. When I met with my uncle and my aunt as well as my uncle's girlfriend, we set off towards the fish hatchery on what I believe was the Schuylkill River. All the jokes started slow because everyone was tired and still waking for the rest of the day's trip. We arrived at the hatchery and we began by feeding some fish they have out in a pond. We watched the fish as they swam around in their concrete canals for at least twenty minutes. We then progressed through the hatchery and soon returned to the car and made our trip to Valley Forge. Once we had parked outside the park, we could hear the beautiful sound of rushing water, so beautiful I really needed to pee. We walked along the paths and eventually climbed up an outlined path to get a closer view of the river and we were enthralled. I was being tortured by the thought of using the restroom. I was able to hold it, but it shortened our visit to the park which was an inconvenience to everyone else but they obliged. I will remember Valley Forge for its pure natural beauty.  After visiting the park, we were going to the very tourist-friendly town of New Hope. We drove by and I nearly lost my mind when I saw the alpacas. Before we did anything at New Hope, I first found a restroom and we were later all in agreement that we should get something to eat. An Italian themed restaurant was an obvious choice and we decided to satisfy our hunger at this fine establishment. They seated us and our host was a very nice young woman. We scanned the menu for something that sounded appetizing. I had found this restaurant was a winner of tastiest pizza awards. Falling into temptation I had to order one of these pizzas. I do not regret doing this because it was one of the best pizzas I have ever had the delight of eating. After satisfying the hunger plaguing us, our group began to browse the gift shops and the silly novelties that they carried. From bookstores to art galleries to a shop that sold nuts and spices until we came upon an ice-cream shop. After walking around for the day, ice-cream was the best thing in our minds to have at the time. I had a very peculiar flavor with berries in it. But I've yet to try a significantly better flavor. When we got our ice-cream, my uncle began to share stories of New York City which is where he was visiting from. Quite honestly I wish I could have gone back with him to NYC, it sounded like a grand city with plenty of places to explore. Sadly I could not, but it is now my goal to eventually visit him where he is living in NYC. We finished our ice-cream and then made our way toward the car and drove to Philadelphia to eat at a very good Mexican restaurant Los Camaradas. We dined there and our stomach was full of exquisite food, almost an entire day of very tasty and savory delights. That was my uncle's weekend in Pennsylvania. I now wish he would visit more often because of the good time we had on our little expedition across the state with the plethora of bad jokes and stories along with it.
366	21168	8	3	"I was late like usual for the bus; barely having any time to sit before it moved. I saw my friends sitting in seats directly behind one in other, and I stopped and said to them, ""Guys make it hard to choose."" I smiled sarcastically. Person 1, who was sitting behind Person 3, motioned for me to sit with her. I gave Person 1 a quick smile and told her that Person 3 and I would turn around and talk with her. Person 1 smiled as Person 3 leaned her head against my seat. Person 3 and I gave Person 1 about five minutes of quiet, then we started talking with her. About the time we arrived at the middle school, we all were having a swell time. Until then, Person 3 and I were fine! But as soon as the bus left the middle school, we were in an uproar of laughter! Everything Person 1 said made me laugh and everything I said made her laugh too! After we left the middle school though, a little sixth grader came to sit in front of us and boy was he annoying! He kept turning around, giving Person 3 and I weird stares and asking us how many joints we had smoked. Of course that made Person 3 and I crack up even more! I was blabbing about how I had stuff in my biology book. But I was talking about notes! The boy obviously thought I was talking about joints. Well for one, I will not smoke, try it, or let it ever come near me. I thought it was absolutely hilarious that he thought I meant joints. Person 3, who was sitting to the left of me, had her head on the seat crying because Person 1 was laughing so hard. Seeing this, I laughed even harder that the sounds coming out of both of us were the silent and deadly laughter. The boy still turned around with stares and added eyebrows. As soon as we passed the fruit packing company, he started talking in Spanish to us. Now I'm trying to learn Spanish, so I didn't have the faintest idea of what he was saying to us. Neither did Person 3. Of course he didn't know what he was talking about either. He was leaning over in the aisle to talk to these native Spanish speakers who were also watching us with huge smiles on their faces. Being the comedian that I am, I decided to start talking about how he could know more Spanish than me when he was only in sixth grade! He of course quieted right down, but the Spanish speakers were howling with laughter. I mean I was shedding tears by the time Person 3 got off the bus. After Person 1 got off, I decided to check in on ol' Person 1. She looked like she was trying to sleep, so I gently nudged her and she looked up at me. I had personally forgotten about Person 1 in the back until Person 3 got off at her stop. ""Are you okay? Do you need a doctor?"" Person 1 asked with a confused grin on her face. I tried to talk, but was laughing in between all of my words, so it came out as pea soup! ""Okay, now you really scare me!"" Person 1 retorted with a serious face. ""Oh come on Person 1! I'm supposed to scare you! The freshman scare sophomores, sophomores scare juniors, and juniors scare the seniors?"" I explained, laughing in between it all. Still my voice sounded like pea soup. ""Sorry, but you still scare me personally. Don't do that!"" she belted out laughing. I had put my face over the seat, then lowered my head so that all she could see were my eyes. I then did my eyebrow thing in which I move my eyebrows from one side of my forehead to the other, in a wave motion. I thought that I was making her laugh! Which I was, but the outburst made even more people look at us. I mean the attention was fine. But the boy still would interrupt Person 1 and I. He would just blurt out, ""Está bueno? Está bueno?"" Person 1 and I again would just look at him. He of course was soaking all the attention in. He then, I think, insulted my mother, which Person 1 pointed out. But I didn't care at that point because I was in such a happy mood that I wasn't going to let someone who I didn't even know ruin it. Both Person 1 and I looked up to see her stop coming up. It was really something to think back to all we have done together on the bus. The famous disappearing bus driver ride was a hilarious day and so was the proofreading my paper bus ride. Good times. I told her this as she was getting off the bus. She laughed"
367	21170	8	3	I met my best friend @PERSON2 when we were in kindergarten. At the time we were both shy, and we looked to one another for comfort. Little did we know the acquaintances we made with each other would soon blossom into a wonderful friendship full of good memories, and plenty of laughter. Last @DATE1, my family took a trip to my grandparents' house in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3. My grandparents usually only used the house once a year in the @DATE2, so while they were home in @LOCATION4 my parents decided to take advantage of the empty house. Both of my siblings are in their twenties and are busy with college, so my parents invited @PERSON2 to attend. We were so excited, for this was our first time to @LOCATION3 together. @PERSON2 and I had many activities planned and I couldn't wait to show her around @ORGANIZATION1 (@LOCATION1 @PERSON1). The only downside of the trip was that we would be driving, we would be in the car for about @NUM1 hours. I had known this since we used to go to @ORGANIZATION1 a lot when I was little so I brought along a notebook that we could draw in and write in. By the time we got to @ORGANIZATION1 that notebook had been filled from cover to cover with drawings and funny sayings that @PERSON2 and I had quoted each other for. @PERSON2 and I have an odd kind of humor, we think everything is funny when we're together. It can be the most ridiculous thing and we will burst out laughing and no one will know why. Finally, a good @NUM1 hours later we arrived in @LOCATION2, it was late though and we had to unpack, therefore I wouldn't be showing @PERSON2 around until the next day. That didn't mean our night wasn't exciting, in the backyard of the house there is a pool house, and in order to keep someone at the home when no one is there my grandparents rent out the pool house. My parents had known that a man named @CAPS1 lived in the pool house. None of us had met him, only heard stories from when my brother lived in the main house when he attended college in @ORGANIZATION1. That night my mom asked me to go get my dad from the back yard because dinner was ready, it was dark outside so I made @PERSON2 come with me. When we got outside we saw my dad had introduced himself to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 looked exactly how I imagined him, he had on red shorts, no shoes and a peach colored t-shirt. He had sandy blond hair and was pretty scruffy, he looked like a big beach bum. @CAPS1 quickly made his way over to me and @PERSON2 and introduced himself. He was pretty nice and very goofy. Throughout our whole conversation @PERSON2 and I couldn't keep straight faces. @CAPS1 said that he had to go so he wanted to teach us a handshake that he made up. He stuck his hand out and curled his index, ring, and middle finger so that they were in towards his palm and the only remaining fingers sticking out were his pinky and thumb. He gestured us to do the same thing. We all did as he told us and stuck our hands in the center of where we were standing and he tapped his pinky and thumb against our pinkies and thumbs, he said good evening and ran back to the pool house. It was very odd, but so funny that my dad, @PERSON2 and I still do this on occasion. The next day, I took @PERSON2 downtown, and showed her around. When we were on our way back we stopped inside a craft store, that I, nor @PERSON2 had ever been in. When we walked in it looked like any other average craft store, but as we explored a little more we noticed there was a huge section of armor and helmets that @CAPS3 soldiers wore. Us being big dorks decided that we had to put them on, so we put on the helmets and armor and stood by the windows in the front shop and waved at people. The ladies working in the craft shop were laughing at us and it had us laughing at ourselves too. We fell down from laughing so hard, at this point the people who were working were not laughing anymore they were mad that we had fallen while wearing the armor. They came over and told us to take it off and that we needed to leave. We did what they told us to do. By the end of the trip we had made so many memories, and we couldn't wait to return the following year. In my opinion laughter is very important in relationships, it is healthy and it means that sometimes you don't need words to express how you feel. This @DATE1 @PERSON2 and I
368	21171	8	3	In the @DATE1 on the month of @DATE2, I experienced laughter on a grand scale. If I recall the memories correctly, the event began on the day of @CAPS1, when my family gathered for a celebration. The day began normally as any @CAPS1, when all were busy attempting to prepare for a feast, and I lobbying around, careless and oblivious to the world around me. Even so, I am able to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day. It was a sudden burst of joy that finally did me in. A burst of laughter and joy came to me without reason or sanity, I just enjoyed. People, my family, looked upon me with confused eyes, bewildered by my actions and expressions, kept distance from me. Though I continued I still felt a sense of worry, for if I had lost my mind they too would lose faith in my social prowess. For that very day, I noticed a different side to me, a side that I wish would vanish from my being. Never again will I look into a mirror and unto myself, see the sane person I use to acknowledge. The day after the bizarre and unkind gesture I had made among my peers, I attempted to apologize for my actions. Although the first attempt seemed to startle them, seemingly due to the nature of my conversations and excuses made during the short interviews. So onward I continued in my life, again oblivious to my surroundings, yet it differed in my earlier life. I felt a kind and gentle side of myself be released, a relentless stress was lifted from my shoulders and allowed me to continue in my daily life. This is when I noticed another person burrowed into my soul, my alter-ego coming to light and possessing my body. This other being, this alter-ego, I gave the name @PERSON1, and with these new emotions that came with I accomplished great feats. Even today he sometimes comes out in times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance. He gives strength to me, by providing a promise of laughter to me and all peers surrounding me. I view him, as not another person so to say, however as another part of my being. Never before that day did this other side of me come into light so clearly and with such promise. I do believe that we all have this person, this personality within us, empowering us to drive forth and never look back.
369	21174	8	3	Laughter is a powerful tool that brings people closer together. It has the ability to break down barriers, ease tension, and create bonds between individuals. In my own experience, I found that laughter played a crucial role in forming connections with my teammates during volleyball tryouts. Initially feeling like an outsider, I realized that by engaging in conversation and sharing jokes, I was able to build relationships with my peers. This experience taught me the importance of laughter in building relationships and fostering a sense of camaraderie. Today, I continue to value the role of laughter in my interactions with others, as I believe it is essential in creating positive and meaningful connections. Laughing together not only brings joy and happiness but also strengthens the bonds between individuals, making life more enjoyable and fulfilling.
370	21175	8	3	Day after day, people laugh for various reasons that may not always be apparent to others. Laughter can serve as a coping mechanism, a way to break the ice, or simply a means to connect with others. When I was hired at @ORGANIZATION1 at the age of @NUM1, I felt out of place among my older colleagues. However, a spontaneous trip to the river with my coworkers changed everything.   On a scorching hot day, my coworker @CAPS2 invited me to join them, and I decided to go along. During the ride, I discovered that what I thought was coffee in his bottle was actually chew spit, leading to a good-natured teasing exchange. At his house, I met his adorable dog @ORGANIZATION3 and borrowed a pair of shorts.   As we reached the river, laughter filled the air as we enjoyed the company of each other. I even attempted a backflip off a log to impress everyone, only to end up belly-flopping into the water. Despite the mishap, we all had a great time jumping off the log and soaking in the sun.   After a fun-filled day, we ended up at @ORGANIZATION2 for dinner, where my coworkers joked about my quiet demeanor. However, a playful wink towards @CAPS6's cousin showed that I was starting to feel more at ease with the group. As the night ended with jokes and banter, I realized that humor truly does bring people together.   Reflecting on that day, I understood the power of laughter in building relationships and creating a sense of belonging. Through shared jokes and light-hearted moments, I found my place among my coworkers, forming bonds that would last beyond the workplace. Laughter truly is a universal language that can bridge gaps and forge connections among people.
371	21176	8	3	Laughter is how me and my friends connect most of the time, and that's how i became friends with a lot of them. You know when your in a new class and you don't know anybody in there so its kinda awkward because you feel like your a loner. I try to make the best of a situation and try to make new friends but I'm not always the best at it, so when i get a chance i make them laugh. First we take baby steps and the more we laugh together it seems like the closer we are to each other. By the end of the semester you don't really like the class but you don't want it to be over because you made such a good friend. The next semester you find out you have a class with that person but they don't like the class so they move out. Then you realize you guys kinda grow apart because you never see each other and if you never talk then it gets kinda awkward. The way we started off our friendship was really by accident but i didn't know many people in the class and the people that i did know weren't really my friends. We sat by each other, and after so long of awkward silence between us two she made a joke and i started to laugh. The next thing we know is within a week and would talk to each other and soon enough we hung out some. About half way through the semester we would get in trouble in class for talking to much and we started to realize we were starting to be best friends. The semester went on and we were hanging out more and more and she was the only one i would hang out with sometimes. By the time the semester was almost over we didn't know what our classes were so we thought we would be split up. The day we got our schedules we talked to each other and seen what our classes were. We seen we had one class together and we were excited. The first day of the second semester we went into the art class that we had together and we were laughing the whole time. At the end of the period she told me she didn't want to be in that class because shes not an artsy type of person. I went to my sixth period and was wondering if she was actually going to switch out like she said or not. At the end of sixth period I seen her and she told me that she got switched out and went to a class that she wanted. I know people in that class still but its not the same because I knew we were going to lose our friendship because we would never see each other. Its a couple weeks into the last semester and we hardly ever talk sometimes it gets awkward just to be around her because its not like how it used to be. Laughter is how me and her became friends and classes is what tore us apart. Laughing together created a strong bond between us, but the separation caused by different classes led to a gradual drift in our friendship.
372	21177	8	3	"The mood was sweet and the room was warm with most of my family and friends, except for my brother. At the time, I was only about 4 or 5 years old. I was looking all around our two-story house trying to find my brother, but for some reason, this time it just seemed impossible. All I could hear in the background was my family laughing as this little 4 or 5-year-old ran full speed up and down hallways, opening and closing doors to rooms he had never been in before. He was shouting at the top of his lungs, ""Where are you? I can't find you!""  With one more door to open at the beginning of the hallway where everyone was gathered, this little boy came running down the hall in a panic. He couldn't find his brother. He opened the door, and out popped his brother, wearing a scary monster mask, saying, ""I will get you tonight if you don't eat all your dinner."" So, I did just as he told me to do. I ate my dinner so fast that I ended up throwing up because I was so scared that he was going to come after me that night!  This continued for the rest of the night, with me eating quickly out of fear. It was a funny and memorable experience that I will never forget."
373	21178	8	3	Laughter is undeniably important in life, relationships, and overall well-being. It has the power to connect people, improve communication, and bring joy to everyday interactions. In a world without laughter, everything would feel dull and lacking in warmth. A sense of humor is a valuable trait that can enhance relationships and create lasting bonds. Being with someone who can make you laugh is a gift, as it lightens the mood and strengthens the connection between partners. The ability to share laughter and find joy in each other's company is essential for a fulfilling relationship. Ultimately, laughter plays a vital role in bringing happiness and positivity into our lives, making it a precious and irreplaceable aspect of human interaction.
374	21179	8	3	When i think of a day where laughter was the element, i think of @DATE1. That was one of the worst days of my life. I had plans to break up with my girlfriend.  That morning, my decision was final, and i was going to do it. For some reason when i woke up, i felt sick. That day, everything was falling apart. Around @NUM1 @CAPS1, i went to my girlfriends house, and broke up with her. The next day, i couldn't smile to save my life. The whole day my friends were making me smile, and showing me they cared. The next day i felt so much better. I was smiling and laughing like nothing ever happened. All day my friends were telling me jokes, and being really stupid. They made me laugh so much.  Throughout those upcoming weeks, i met another girl. I couldn't be anymore positive about my life. All i do now is just smile and laugh. I don't need to live my life with sadness. All i can do is just be positive, and smile. Laughter is very important. No one should go a day without it. Just lets just lives our lives to the fullest, and put the past behind us. Just think on the bright side, and smile.
375	21180	8	3	My high school basketball team may not be the most talented, but we have a special bond that sets us apart. When our team went on a retreat to the beach, we found ourselves sharing laughs and creating memories that would bring us closer together. Despite not being the closest group off the court, our time at the beach allowed us to connect through shared experiences and inside jokes. One memorable moment involved a teammate's hilarious rant about the lack of food in the house, leading to fits of laughter that brought us all together. Even as we settled in for the night, the laughter continued as we recalled the events of the evening. This trip may have seemed like just a fun getaway, but it ultimately solidified our team chemistry and strengthened our bonds. The memories we made that night in the kitchen have become a cherished part of our shared experience, reminding us of the joy and camaraderie that basketball brings into our lives.
376	21181	8	3	"It was a regular day in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That special day we were supposed to start our state writing tests. I wasn't necessarily worried about it due to the fact that I have always done good on state testing, and never failed at test for state testing. @CAPS22 it was pretty much a regular day for @PERSON1. But I didn't know @CAPS18 awaited me in the computer lab..... Thanks to new @ORGANIZATION1 state testing laws, we have to take the writing test on the computer. The only place in the school that has enough computers for the whole class to take was the either the @ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, or the old computer lab (I don't know why we used the @ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, but we did). @CAPS22, I was already in a hyper mood because @CAPS1's sense of humor normally cheers me up and puts me in a hyper mood. @CAPS22, as we were walking to the computer lab, me and @CAPS1 started cracking jokes about @PERSON3 mainly because everyone else does, @CAPS22 we just add to the effect. @CAPS19 we reached the computer lab, but the door was locked. @CAPS22 while we waited for @PERSON2 to lock her door and come down to the computer lab, me and @CAPS1 made a few more jokes about @PERSON3, but little did I know the real humor was awaiting for me in the computer lab. When @PERSON2 got to the door and unlocked it, I was the @ORGANIZATION1 to come in and sit down in the seat I desired. @PERSON4 followed next to me, and @CAPS4 next to him. I remember a trick with the computer when you push @CAPS5 @CAPS19 @CAPS6 @CAPS19 @CAPS7 and when it goes to a different screen, you push @CAPS8 and it will put the computer to sleep. I tried it a couple times while he was looking and he would always swat my hand away. After a while, I decided the best way to pull this trick was to make him forget about it, @CAPS19 do it when he was least expecting it. @CAPS22 about @NUM1 minutes later after I planned my trick, I tried it again. I caught him looking away at @CAPS4. @CAPS22 I pushed @CAPS5 @CAPS19 @CAPS6 @CAPS19 @CAPS7. @CAPS19 it went to a different screen and I pushed @CAPS8. My plan had worked. @CAPS19 @PERSON4 turned around right as soon as the computer was going to sleep and freaked out. He started cussing and hitting me. I thought this was mildly funny @CAPS22 I got a couple laughs out of it, but nothing could have prepared me for @CAPS18 was about to happen. After @PERSON4 woke his computer up and got started with his test, @CAPS4 asked @CAPS18 I was laughing about. I told him, ""@CAPS15, you should have seen it. I put @PERSON4's computer to sleep and he flipped out on me."" @CAPS4 laughed and went back to his test. Two minutes went by and @CAPS4 tapped on my shoulder. I looked at him and asked, ""@CAPS18 up kid?"" @CAPS19 @CAPS4 said, ""@CAPS21 this."" @CAPS22 I sat up straight and looked at him. @CAPS19 he asked @PERSON4, ""@CAPS18 did @PERSON1 do to your computer? This?"" and he held the power button down and shut the computer off right in the middle of @PERSON4's test. I thought I was going to cry. It was @CAPS22 funny me and @CAPS4 started laughing as loud as possible. @PERSON2, of course, wasn't happy about it. @CAPS22 she told me and @CAPS4 to quiet down. But it didn't matter. A little scolding didn't compare to how funny it was. @CAPS22 we ended up going back to our own tests. I hope I do good on this. I really need the grade to pass. After the unexpected computer mishaps, I knew that the writing test would be a memorable one, to say the least."
377	21182	8	3	@CAPS3 and @PERSON1 share a special bond filled with laughter and friendship. Their constant giggles and inside jokes brighten up their days, especially in the classes they have together. Whether it's saving each other's lives in a humorous manner or passing notes during lectures, their connection is undeniable. Their shared interests and sense of humor bring them closer together, making @PERSON1 a valuable and cherished friend. Laughter truly does bring people closer, and in the case of @CAPS3 and @PERSON1, it has solidified their bond even further.
378	21183	8	3	Hi, my name is @CAPS1. I am just an ordinary girl with a story like every other girl. I'm writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share it. Honestly, I depend on a good laugh during my day. Without laughter, life would never be the same for me. Laughing has brought me to who I am today. Not only has it made me the person I am, but it has brought me to all my friends and the people I love. For example, I use laughter between me and my boyfriend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and I are just like any other couple. We have fun, do stuff together, and we argue. The worst part is when we fight. Just like everyone else, we have hard times and good times. Our hard times always start when we wake up. When I wake up, it's still really dark outside. The smell of fresh morning air makes me feel refreshed. I always feel like the happiest girl in the world. A little while after I wake up, I text @PERSON1 good morning, and we usually talk throughout the day. Sometimes he comes to see me, or I just see him at school. When I see him, I am happy and my toes curl. We will go for a walk and talk about everything and anything, just life. At this point, he thinks it's time to say something funny. So he does, he will make fun of how I look, what I am wearing, and what I say. He doesn't find it hurtful, but to me, it is. Many times I might even say something mean back, which doesn't help, it just makes it worse. Not long goes by, maybe a few seconds, and we start to fight. He doesn't understand he has hurt me or he doesn't care. He tells me he has done nothing wrong. So I try to explain, and he doesn't listen. I just stop trying, and if he realizes how he hurt me or what happened that bothered me, that's fine, but I am not going to fight anymore, so I just stop explaining things. Enough has gone through my mind, so I cry, and he gives me a dumb look. This just makes everything worse, so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse. There is yelling and screaming with tears and mean, rotten words tossed all over the place; it's a mess. I usually storm off in the middle of it because I can't take any more. Finally, time goes by, and we haven't talked all day. We don't have anything to say to each other. Eventually, someone gets the nerve to talk or say something to another. Still, each of us is on edge, so I say something stupid or funny to lighten the mood. I will do anything to see a smile on his face, even if we have done each other wrong, I still love him and can't stand for it to be like this anymore. Of course, he smiles, just what I was looking for; this makes me happy and laugh. He will then ask for a hug, and so he hugs me even if I don't answer or if I say no, it doesn't matter to him. He apologizes and explains a couple of things to me. I feel bad because I hate the stress and the fight, so we work it out. Now you can see if I didn't have laughter, I might be depressed. Without laughter, things would be harder and more complicated. But a good laugh or a simple joke can ease things and make them a lot better in life. I just want people to understand what a small laugh can do to your day. If it can change your day in such a big way, then it can change your life in a major way. Things may come across as hard or rough. When I look back on my life and see what it has done to me and for me, I realize I laughed at something each one of those days even though I was down, and it brought me back up again. Laughing truly is the best medicine, and it has the power to heal even the toughest of situations.
379	21185	8	3	"It's true @CAPS8 they say, time flies when you're having fun. On a particularly warm @DATE1 @TIME1, a rehearsal was in session for the wonderful production of ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2"" and I was bringing my best friend, @PERSON2 some cheap but delicious food. We talked and ate for a while but eventually it was time for me to go. @CAPS3 we were walking down the stairs to get to the back doors of the building I asked if they needed any help with the play. ""@CAPS3 a matter of fact we do!"" @CAPS7 said enthusiastically. ""We need a ladies costume @CAPS4.""I had absolutely no idea @CAPS8 that meant, but I felt that the position had potential. ""@CAPS5, I can do that. Just one question..."" I said a little confused.""@CAPS6?"" @CAPS7 replied, slightly amused.""@CAPS8 exactly am I going to @CAPS12 doing?"" I asked her.We changed course and headed for the costume room so that @CAPS7 could introduce me to, @PERSON1 who would @CAPS12 my boss for the next two weeks. We arrived to find that @CAPS7 had already gone home for the night. A little exasperated, @PERSON2 told me the basic idea of the job.""@CAPS9 basically @CAPS8's going to happen is that you are going to @CAPS12 in charge of the changing rooms and the costume changes on stage."" @CAPS7 said quickly.""@CAPS11 okay, I can do that."" I replied with confidence.@CAPS3 I began to talk to her more about @CAPS8 I would @CAPS12 doing @CAPS7 said that @CAPS7 had to go because break was over. ""@CAPS12 here at @NUM1 tomorrow morning and you'll learn everything you need!"" @CAPS7 said hurriedly.@CAPS3 @CAPS7 ran off into the theatre I could hear the lead of the play beginning his lines. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice....""I left feeling more happy and excited than I have felt in months.  The next morning I made my way to the theatre which is located at the school which I previously attended. It felt odd going back there but at the same time so completely normal. I was even more comforted by knowing that I could see my friends everyday. I could hug them and laugh with them, I could have social interaction! Something that because of online school I have been lacking. I walked into the theatre and @CAPS3 soon @CAPS3 I did I was bombarded with excited people asking why I was there while hugging me tight. ""I'm helping out with the costuming!"" I said just @CAPS3 excited @CAPS3 they were. I broke away from the group of people and found, @PERSON2 who was on stage directing the lighting people. We talked for a while and then @CAPS7 took me to the costume room where, @PERSON1 was waiting for me. @PERSON1, was a classy looking lady. @CAPS7 wore a light grey cardigan and a colored top with some corduroy pants and sensible shoes. Immediately @CAPS7 started to tell me @CAPS8 my duties were and @CAPS8 I was going to @CAPS12 doing that day.""I'm just going to have you watch the rehearsal today, just to get a feel of @CAPS8's going on."" @CAPS7 handed me a pen and a pad of paper""@CAPS15 notes about where the lighting ques are and that kind of thing."" @CAPS7 said.I walked out and wondered to the auditorium and took my seat in the second row of seats. The lights were lowered and rehearsal began. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice...""@CAPS16 I knew it, the end of the day had come and I wasn't in any hurry to leave. The actors and crew were doing such an amazing job with the play but I knew I had my work cut out for me. In the end it all worked out beautifully, we had some good shows and some @CAPS1 shows but the most important part of this experience was the time I got to spend with the people I love. I am going to miss them so much when I'm sitting in my room all alone doing the school work that consumes my happiness and laughter into the internet. on the other hand, I am all lined up to help with the next two productions going on at that old school of mine.  I am looking forward to continuing to be a part of the theater community and creating more memories with my friends"
380	21186	8	3	In life, we share many moments laughing and enjoying the sweet sound of laughter with the people in our lives. Laughter has the power to bring instant joy, even in the midst of struggles. One particular moment that stands out for me is the Christmas before my grandpa passed away. It was a special day filled with happiness and laughter, as we gathered as a family to celebrate. My grandpa, a kind and loving man, always had a way of making us smile, no matter what. On that day, his laughter and love filled our hearts with joy. We shared stories, played games, and enjoyed each other's company, creating memories that would last a lifetime. As we sat down for dinner, my grandpa looked out at the snowy landscape and shared some wise words with me. He reminded me to cherish every moment, especially those spent with the ones we love. His words have stayed with me, serving as a reminder to always find joy in life's simple pleasures. My grandpa may have passed away, but his laughter and love continue to live on in my heart. Enjoy every moment, especially the ones with the ones you love.
381	21188	8	3	Laughter is an essential component of any relationship, as it can brighten someone's day and provide much-needed support during difficult times. When we see someone struggling or feeling down, a simple act of kindness such as sharing a smile or a joke can make a significant difference in their day. By offering a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on, we can help others navigate through their challenges and find comfort in knowing that they are not alone. I once witnessed the power of spreading happiness and laughter to someone in need, and it taught me the importance of being there for others during their darkest moments. It is crucial to offer support, love, and laughter to those who are facing tough times, as it can truly make a positive impact on their well-being. In times of sorrow and pain, a genuine smile and a shared moment of joy can provide healing and solace, reminding us all of the strength found in human connection and compassion. So, let us always be ready to spread happiness and laughter to those who need it most, for it is through these simple acts of kindness that we can truly make a difference in someone's life.
382	21189	8	3	Building the bond with Laughter From a very early age, my uncle introduced me and my brothers to the joy of funny cards on our birthdays, just to see our reactions. Even when he moved closer to us on the west coast, we continued to tease each other to lighten the mood. We developed a keen sense of knowing when one of us was having a rough day and how to bring a smile back to their face. As we celebrated birthdays together in our hometown, the tradition of exchanging humorous cards continued, bringing endless laughter and joy to our gatherings.   When my uncle relocated to a new city, my older brother and I carried on the tradition of finding the most amusing cards to surprise him with on his special day. Our competition escalated, leading to cards with outrageous jokes and cheeky humor that never failed to elicit a chuckle. Despite working in the same building but in different roles, our daily interactions always involved humor and lighthearted banter. Whether he was stressed or in high spirits, our exchanges never failed to lift each other's spirits and bring a sense of camaraderie to the workplace.  Our shared love for adventure led us to purchase season passes to Mount Hood, where our skiing and snowboarding escapades became yet another opportunity for laughter and friendly competition. Initially struggling on the slopes, I eventually surpassed my uncle's skills, turning the tables and reveling in the chance to tease him good-naturedly. The roles reversed as he faced a string of falls, allowing me to playfully poke fun at his expense and savor the sweet taste of payback.  Through his influence, my uncle has instilled in me a deep appreciation for laughter and the ability to find humor even in challenging situations. Our bond has evolved from a traditional uncle-nephew relationship to that of close friends, built on a foundation of shared jokes and joyful moments. His presence in my life has not only brought endless laughter but also shaped my outlook on life, filling each day with warmth and happiness. I am grateful for the laughter he has brought into my life and look forward to a future filled with shared moments of joy and humor.
383	21190	8	3	"When I was in what I believe to be the sixth grade I went to @ORGANIZATION1. This year I felt as if I was old enough to ride the ""big kid"" rides which I had never done before. I remember walking up to the entrance of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 hotel with my mom, older sister @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1 little sister @CAPS3. We had to go though there because it was the fastest way in to the park. There were to giant stain glass like windows that led into the lobby of the hotel. The door were beautiful. They had an outdoor seen on them there were bears, fish, trees, rivers @ORGANIZATION1 mountains. We all walked in to the hotel. The ceilings must have been twenty feet tall. We walk all the way though the lobby @ORGANIZATION1 followed the signs till we got to the park entrance. There was a man made mountain in the middle shaped like a grizzly bear that one of the rides was built around. It was early in the morning so the @LOCATION1 heat had not yet set in completely. We started out with the smaller rides @ORGANIZATION1 side attractions like it's tough to be a bug @NUM1,shopping in the park @ORGANIZATION1 parades. My mom was determent to get back in time to see @LOCATION2 on stage but we never made it back in time. It was about noon @ORGANIZATION1 the sun was hot. We were making our way to the pier. the song @ORGANIZATION3 by the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 was playing in the back ground. There were old sunscreen advertisements painted on the fence that was surrounding that end of the park. on the opposite side of the pier was a man made ocean that was so blue from all the dye it was unbelievable. It kinda looked like the water in the toilet when you put the blue cleaning product in it. The air smelled like fried food @ORGANIZATION1 popcorn, it was making me @LOCATION3. We continued walking until be got to the roller coaster @ORGANIZATION2'. There was a fifteen minuet wait time for the ride which wasn't long. my older sister @ORGANIZATION1 i jumped in line @ORGANIZATION1 began to wait. I had never been on a roller coaster this big before so I didn't know what to expect. I had butterfly in my stomach, I was getting nervous but didn't want to back down. finally we came to the front of the line. the man standing there working the ride asked ""how many?"". my sister held up two fingers @ORGANIZATION1 the man pointed at the ground next to him @ORGANIZATION1 said ""row eight"". The next set of cars came in @ORGANIZATION1 they ushered us into the the eighth car in the row. I pulled down the safety bar. The ride began. The roller coaster cars pulled around the corner @ORGANIZATION1 stopped. There were speakers on both sides of my head that i had not noticed until the moment sound began to come out of them. It was a mans voice @ORGANIZATION1 some background music. the voice did a count down form ten @ORGANIZATION1 the yelled ""blast off"" @ORGANIZATION1 the ride took of at high speeds. It was going so fast my face was being pushed back into a smile. The ride then slowly climbed to the top of a giant hill @ORGANIZATION1 plummeted to the bottom. There were so many twists @ORGANIZATION1 turns the ride even when upside down! when it came time to take the picture at the end I was crying I was laughing so hard. my sister @ORGANIZATION1 I exited the ride @ORGANIZATION1 walked over to the booth were they show the pictures that they had taken of the people on the ride. Both of our faces were priceless. We then road the ride five more times before heading back to the hotel for dinner. From that day on I was addicted to roller coasters, @ORGANIZATION1 have ridden many since. After that thrilling experience, I couldn't get enough of the adrenaline rush that roller coasters provided. My fear had transformed into excitement, and I continued seeking out new, more exhilarating rides to conquer. That day at @ORGANIZATION1 marked the beginning of a new passion for me, one that would stay with me for years to come."
384	21191	8	3	It was a hot day in west @LOCATION1, and a group of friends decided to go out for some ice cream and relaxation at hamburger hill. However, their plans were ruined when they were attacked by older kids who had been bullying them for some time. Determined to put an end to the abuse, the friends came up with a clever plan to fight back. They gathered allies, prepared water balloons and rotten food, and strategically sabotaged the bullies' bikes. The initial retaliation seemed successful, but they underestimated the bullies' numbers and soon found themselves overwhelmed. Luckily, their parents intervened and the bullies were finally held accountable for their actions. In the end, the friends were able to play in peace, free from the fear of being bullied, thanks to their perseverance and unity.
385	21192	8	3	Have you ever laughed so hard that you peed? That @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not have happened to me. In my story I'm going to talk about the funniest time I have ever had with my best friend @CAPS1. How it all started was that it was my best friends birthday and she was going to spend the night at her grandmas house. She invite only me to come with her so I couldn't say no. @CAPS1's grandma owned a @CAPS2 @CAPS3. She was old and was in a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club. I don't know about you but it always seems to me that old people have to be in some kinda of club. So anyways in her her club what the did was go on trips. @CAPS1 and I thought that would be fun to go on a trip. So we meant everyone at @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS1's grandma let us go intro the store to buy drinks for that trip. I wanted @CAPS4. The bottle was really cool. It had a top like a water bottle would have. I got the red kind cause it the best. We got are drinks and @CAPS1's grandma said to go to the car while she talked to the adults about the trip. So here is the funny part of the story. I got into the car first. I was pretty thirsty so I decided to unscrew the cap it pulled open to paper back on the sell. I twisted the cap back on and took a drink. Mean while @CAPS1 got into the car and closed the door behind her cause her grandma was talking to the adults. While she was closing it she got her hair caught in the door. She was laughing and yelling at me to come help her. I was laughing too hard to come help her. I had my drink between my legs and the cap was open and remember its like a water bottle cap. I laughed so hard that I squeezed my legs together and my juice went straight into the front seat. It didn't get and were else just into her grandma seat. It was like a rocket it was so funny. @CAPS1 with her head still stuck in the door asked what that notice was on the seat. I told her it was my juice. Then was both started laughing. I don't know why but @CAPS1 just pulled on her head and her head was no longer stuck. The was like ten pieces of her hair stuck in the car door. She looked at the seat and said we have to tell her grandma about it. I didn't want her to be mad at me cause her seats were white. I thought it would stain. But we ended up telling her. She told us to go get napkins from the bathroom. The whole time we were going to the bath room me and @CAPS1 were just laughing so hard. We cleaned up the mess and I didn't get in trouble. I guess that I have never peed my pants laughing but I almost did that day. After that day me and my best friend @CAPS1 always laugh at that story. I am so glad we went on an old people @CAPS2 @CAPS3 club trip.
386	21193	8	3	For a year and two months, I devoted my life to horses, school, and @CAPS1. We started off as friends in @CAPS2 grade, and it escalated to a relationship in @LOCATION1 grade. We ended up breaking up later on that year, but we continued to remain 'friends'. Obviously I still cared for @CAPS1, but I didn't believe he'd felt the same. But apparently I was wrong, we began a new relationship on @DATE1 at @NUM1 pm. It was the perfect start to our 'perfect relationship'. He and I were inseparable from the get-go, we literally did everything together. I was @PERCENT1 irrevocably in love with @CAPS1.  Between the two of us, we shared some crazy memories and inside jokes. I could probably write a best-selling novel of all the memories we had, and I honestly believed that @CAPS1 and I were going to be together forever. I thought everything was going fine, till he had to lay it out, he liked someone else.  At that point, I had no idea where our relationship (or I) stood. I didn't want to know. I couldn't keep putting my heart in the open if it was going to get stomped on, but I loved @CAPS1 and was willing to do anything to make it work. I stayed the night with @CAPS1, and we talked till @NUM2. He and I decided to attempt to make it work, but there was no guarantee it was going to.  The next day, everything seemed fine. I was still extremely irritated that he liked another girl, but I was using all my power to make the best of what we had. We decided to take his dog, @CAPS3, on a walk. We held hands as we walked, but it was too quiet. Why? He was texting @CAPS4. By that time, I decided that was the final straw. It felt like I was getting in the way, so I felt that the only choice I had left was to leave @CAPS1.  I walked in the door an hour later absolutely devastated. I cried till I felt I couldn't cry anymore, and then I would cry more. At the time, I truly felt that the world was ending right before me. My life was over. My days became long and depressing, and I felt that all I could do was give up. My heart shattered every time I saw @CAPS1, and it made it even worse when people constantly asked about what had happened. I couldn't tell them; it wasn't a moment I would want to relive. I couldn't stop thinking about @CAPS1, and about all the memories we'd shared. That year and two months has been the greatest period of my life.  Almost every time I thought about @CAPS1, I would cry. I couldn't stand the thought of not having @CAPS1, and thinking about @CAPS1 all the time made me into a walking zombie. I couldn't eat, I couldn't drink, and I would vomit because of the stress. But as I sat there alone thinking of the memories, a miracle happened: I laughed. I was shocked, but it made me realize that I needed to keep living. I don't regret any of the time I spent with @CAPS1; he changed my life. He taught me so much about loving someone. I knew from that small laugh, that things were going to get better. A spark of hope, I would be happy again.

It is a vital element in relationships and can bring people closer together. Overall, laughter is a precious and invaluable part of life that should be cherished and embraced.
388	21195	8	3	"There will always be moments in your life when your emotions will take control and motivate you. whether your happy, sad, angry or frustrated. At times like this I use my gift, the gift of laughter. My best friend, @PERSON1 looked at me with her big blue eyes, they were swelled up with tears. We had just finished packing the rest of her clothes and we knew it was time to say goodbye. It hurt me deeply to see her go after five years of friendship but, we had postponed this moment long enough. There the boxes sat waiting, each with their own label, they had all of our memories inside. We were never very serious, we liked to joke a lot and she always knew how to make me smile, today that would be hard though. After we put @PERSON1's stuff in the moving van I noticed her dog, @PERSON2 wasn't outside like he normally is. When I went inside I found out he hadn't been hiding in there either. This was strange because @PERSON2 was the type of dog that liked to have a lot of attention so he was always near you. When I told @PERSON1 that @PERSON2 was missing, we went to look for him.    It was @DATE1 time, my favorite time of year and the sun felt warm against my skin. I remember this moment very clearly, it was a memory I was sure I would want to savor. As we walked along @PERSON1 and I talked about all sorts of things, this made me almost forget she was going to have to leave in a few hours. Just then I noticed a shinny silver object laying in the ground, from where I was standing I couldn't quite read what the engrave stated but I could see the one letter that said it all, the letter @CAPS1. It was @PERSON2's red and blue collar, I reached down and picked it up I figured he must be somewhere near. Fate must have been with us that day because as soon as we glanced up the road we saw @PERSON2 riding in the back of someones old @ORGANIZATION1 truck. We started running after that truck as fast as we could and we were screaming, ""@CAPS2! Finally the truck stopped in front of our local store, the guy stepped out and he seemed aggravated with us.""That's my dog."" @PERSON1 stated, and I just shook my head in agreement. The strange man looked at us in wonderment and then looked at @LOCATION1. His face turned red in embarrassment as he too realized the dog in the back did not belong to him. This whole situation was funny and all we could do was laugh. With @PERSON2 beside us we started walking home, taking our time, dreading what would take place when we arrived back at @LOCATION2's house. That night I stayed up thinking about @PERSON1 and @LOCATION1, I was great full to that dog for running off so we could spend more time together. Also I was thinking that maybe he had a reason for leaving, maybe he knew that we weren't ready to say goodbye and we had to have one last adventure, one last laugh. When we laughed together for the last time that day, I knew that we would truly be friends forever no matter if she lived near or far."
389	21198	8	3	On the year of @DATE1, my brother had the worst birthday headache ever. We lived in a nice big brown house with great and loving parents. We had a nice big backyard that my brother and I loved the most. @CAPS1 was downstairs making my brother and me school lunches for school. It was my brother's first day of school, and he was so happy. I mean, it's his birthday, and he also starts school on the same day, that's awesome. @CAPS1 let my brother walk to school with me, as it was only down the road. The school we attended was called @LOCATION1. When we arrived at the school, I could tell my brother was worried. School didn't seem that bad to me, but I wasn't the one who was caught eating glue during arts and crafts before lunch.  As I walked to the office, I saw my brother through the window, with glue all over him. Despite the mishap, my brother and I always shared a good relationship, constantly making each other laugh. Laughter was a vital part of our bond, allowing us to express emotions positively and showcase our sense of humor.   After school, we returned home to celebrate my brother's birthday with the family. Grandma brought gifts for both of us, and we all enjoyed a birthday cake together. My brother was overjoyed, and nothing could make his day any happier. We ended the day playing kickball in the backyard, sharing laughs and creating unforgettable memories.  As the day came to an end, we bid farewell to our family members, expressing our love and gratitude. While getting ready for bed, my brother mentioned his headache to @CAPS1, but even that couldn't dampen the joy of the day. Despite the headache, we all shared a moment of laughter before drifting off to sleep. Looking back on this day, we still cherish the memories and the laughter shared with our loved ones.
390	21199	8	3	"Laughter, what is the meaning; to show mirth, joy, or scorn with a chuckle or explosive vocal sound. People without laughter in their life go through stages of depression or feel a sadness inside them; they never seem to be able to find the light at the end of the tunnel, ""the light being happiness."" The days turn into months or even years, life seems to be at a standstill. When you feel there is no happiness you begin to have doubts on your decisions in life; the choices you have made in life seem to all be wrong. This is what my life felt like when the world turned around and I found out my best friend just flipped her car. I was traumatized, in shock; I didn't know so many things could rush through your head in that given moment. I instantly started to ask a million questions to see if she was okay. All they could share with me at the time was that she was being rushed to the hospital. All I could do once I got home was lay in my bed and think; what could I have done so she would not have been in that car-- all I felt was guilt! That night was wretched my mind just kept wrapping around all the times my best friend and I spent together, the laughter we shared between each other, stupid fights, and all the dumb pranks. What was eating at me most though was we had gotten in a fight not too long before she wrecked; the worst part was it was over the stupidest thing. I had got irritated at her for constantly ditching out on our plans we had together to go spend time with her boyfriend. Now that I look back at it, all I felt was jealousy. If only I could take it all back, then maybe she would not have been distracted while she was driving and missed her turn. That next morning her mother called me and said ""she is asking for you, you come to the hospital and see her if you please."" I was ecstatic, I got ready faster than I ever have before; within a few minutes I was ready and in my pick-up driving myself to the hospital. It only took me thirty-five minutes to get there, when it should take you around forty-five. I instantly jumped out of my truck, rushed into the hospital and went to the check-in desk to see what room she would be in. They told me she was in room right down the hall on the left. I got to the room, there was a crack in the door so I peeked in before trying to open the door the rest of the way; I finally got the confidence to open the door and go talk to her. She instantly had a smile on her face when she saw me, I pulled up a chair and sat right next to her. We talked for about an hour just about random things; including the wreck. She told me she had a few broken ribs and a minor concussion, so she should be able to be out by that afternoon. When she told me that, I was one of the happiest people right at that moment. All I could do was laugh when she told me everything was fine; almost like laughter of relief. It did not take long before both of us started laughing, most of it was out of excitement and having nothing else to say; except the beautiful sound of laughter coming out of our mouths. I have to say it felt good just to be by my friend's side again being able to share happy moments with each other. So what is the meaning of Laughter to me; shall you ask? It is the most meaningful thing that anyone could possibly do. Laughter is to show signs of happiness, a giggle or an outburst; sharing unforgettable moments with a loved one. Without laughter, your life cannot be complete, make jokes, just laugh make life have meaning again. Do not go through life being sad, instead be happy. Go ahead test it out and see what laughter can do for you in your life!"
391	21200	8	3	Throughout my whole life, I've always been someone who finds joy in existence, even after facing challenges like falling through a metal roof. Growing up in a low-income household with a single mother and two siblings was tough, but I made it through with the help of my best friend, who was like family to me. My mother's best friend and her daughter became our family, and even though they left for a while, our bond remained strong. When I had a mishap and met a cute boy on the way to get help, laughter helped us cope with the situation and brought us closer together. No matter the circumstances, laughter has the power to heal, connect people, and make tough times a little bit easier. Laughing together with my cousin reminded me that even in difficult moments, finding joy can make a world of difference.
392	21202	8	3	Warm laughter is not only the best medicine but also the best glue in relationships. When we laugh with others, we share a sense of relaxation and happiness that brings us closer together. Laughter is a release from overthinking, allowing us to open up and connect with one another on a deeper level. Flirting, often involving humor and light-heartedness, can lead to laughter and a stronger bond between individuals.   I experienced this firsthand in my relationship with my girlfriend. After a painful experience with someone else, I had closed myself off emotionally. However, my girlfriend's kindness and humor helped me to let my guard down and laugh freely with her. Our shared laughter has been a cornerstone of our two-year relationship, creating a comfortable and joyful atmosphere for us to grow together.  Being able to laugh at oneself is key to building strong relationships. By being open, compassionate, and willing to be a little silly, we can connect with others on a deeper level. Laughter is a powerful tool for social bonding, breaking down barriers, and creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.   In social gatherings, laughter plays a crucial role in bringing people together and creating a sense of comfort and relaxation. Just like warm honey, laughter is easy to spread and mix with other ingredients, making it a versatile and essential element in fostering strong relationships.  My relationship, built on a foundation of laughter and warmth, has been incredibly fulfilling and rewarding. By making each other laugh, we have strengthened our bond and created a space where we can be ourselves fully. Laughter truly is the best glue, holding us together through challenges and moments of joy.
393	21203	8	3	The Importance and Benefits of Laughter   Laughter is an essential element in life that can lighten moods and bring happiness. Children tend to laugh more easily, while adults often struggle to find reasons to laugh due to their serious nature. However, laughter has the power to connect with other positive emotions like joy and happiness. In a story about a girl named Lily, her ability to bring gladness to others through laughter led to improved health and overall well-being.   On a gloomy day, Lily's household was filled with grumpiness and discontent. Despite her own bad mood, Lily decided to bring laughter and cheer to her family and school. Inspired by a story about a simple orphan girl who spread happiness wherever she went, Lily realized the power of laughter in brightening people's lives. By spreading joy and laughter, Lily transformed her home and school into happier places, even on the darkest days.  Through Lily's example, we learn that laughter is a simple yet powerful tool for improving our lives and the lives of those around us. By choosing to laugh and spread happiness, we can create a more positive and joyful environment for ourselves and others. Laughter truly is the best medicine, and its effects can be felt in every aspect of our lives.
394	21204	8	3	"It was the first day of sophomore year. I had just moved to a new town during the summer so I was nervous about the new school just like any kid would be. I walked into the school and checked out my surroundings. Everything seemed normal enough until I saw it. Near the middle of the sea of tables in the cafeteria was about four tables with around ten people at each one, but it wasn't the fact that they were there that caught my attention it was what they were doing. They were dueling with Yu-Gi-Oh! cards right there in the middle of the cafeteria where all could see! I was baffled, I mean I used to duel when I was younger in elementary school when the game was newer, but I had to quit cause everyone in my old school stopped dueling, and here I am looking at at least twenty high schoolers just dueling away. What surprised me most of all was that they were right there in the open where everyone could see, and worst of all judge. I moved to a table nearby them and began to watch a kid named Joey (who later has become one of my best friends) mop the floor with his opponent. I quickly caught back on to most of the rules, and went home that day thinking ""I'm gonna get back into that game!"". So I bought a deck, and continued my recon of the tables, my deck sitting in front of me waiting for someone to challenge its master. A few days went by as I continued my silent observation of the duelists. Finally a duelist named Kaiba (another one of my now good friends) challenged me. I accepted and began. He then proceeded to thoroughly kick my butt in the space of what seemed like five rounds into the game. Joey then taught me how to play better and we became best friends. He is a really funny guy, and to this day I cant hang around him without laughing. Through him I have met tons of great friends. Even now I wonder what my high school life would be like if they didn't attend my new school."
395	21205	8	3	Laughter is essential in any relationship, as it has the power to lighten up the mood in just a few seconds. Whether it's because something is funny or simply out of tiredness, sharing laughter with loved ones can create unforgettable moments. One of the best memories I have of laughing with my cousin happened in a store. We had a hilarious time playing a prank on our friend, pretending to be ninjas and hiding from her while she searched for us. The joy and laughter we shared during that silly moment are just one example of how laughter can bring people closer together and create lasting bonds.
396	21206	8	3	One day I woke up staring out my window and was listening to the birds chirp outside. I usually leave my window open to sleep with fresh air because I hate breathing in my own breath; it's too warm. As I woke up, I walked out and ate some rice crispy treats with my two sisters. I was late for school, so I quickly got dressed and urged my sisters to hurry up and get ready. My sister in second grade and my other sister in third grade took their time with makeup and hair, as girls usually do. Our schools were next to each other, so we headed off to school, ready for the day with my teacher, Ms. Hawk.  Ms. Hawk wasn't the nicest teacher, but I enjoyed her class because she made learning fun. We started the day with a book about ghouls and monsters, which she read in a captivating way. Math followed, and she always challenged me with harder problems, saying I was different. After school, I tried to find my sister to walk home together, but she hurried off with her friends, leaving me behind.  My dad was waiting in the car, and as I rushed to reach it, a speeding car came dangerously close to hitting me. I was hit and left bruised, but thankfully nothing was serious. My dad rushed me home and then to the hospital, where they assured me I would recover but might have trouble with sports due to a fractured hip. Despite the injury, my family pampered me with treats, and I returned to school the next day, albeit limping.  When my teacher accused me of faking my injury, my mom intervened, and the lady who hit me ended up covering my medical expenses. It was a tough experience, but I was grateful for the support of my family and the consequences faced by the reckless driver.
397	21207	8	3	"My knees were weak and my hands were slightly shaking as my rapid heartbeat was causing my breathing to increase speed and time. I wanted to get this over with, but at the same time, I hadn't the intentions to ever start a conversation, yet alone, approach him. It had been a whole year since I had seen my dad and I wasn't sure whether to expect a relaxed, laid back man, or an uptight, cranky one. So, I closed my eyes, took deep breaths, and decided to put this in the hands of fate. It was obvious that once I saw my dad, it would be a natural thing to talk to him, but I was suspicious of his mood and if it would affect mine at all. If for any reason this did happen for the worse, we probably wouldn't be the best of friends for a matter of weeks. He'd then continue to pull the, ""Do you think now that you're a teenager, you can do and act however you want?"" Or the, ""I'm your father, I deserve more respect!"" The funny thing is, I never start any of these things. He chooses to start them when he's bored, I guess. Then, he continues to make me feel bad for his wrongdoings.  When my mother, sister, and I arrived at the airport, I (I'm not going to lie) wanted to go home. My sister would crack a few jokes here and there and my mother would let her wittiness shine on me; even in the midst of all of this, they could only get a small giggle out of me because I let my nerves get the best of me. I didn't want my past three months to be ruined by his coming home. But once I looked back at all I had done: two weeks in Europe, rafting, etc., I realized that I did miss him and did want him back. Don't get me wrong, my dad is a super nice, funny, and hardworking guy, it's just hard to work with him sometimes.  My dad's flight had landed, and after a solid hour of waiting for him, he came out of the airplane. We could see his eyes frantically scouring the airport for us, and when he found us, he gave the warmest, friendliest smile I had ever seen upon his face. Tears welled up in his eyes as my sister raced for him and my mom quickly walked behind. My legs carried me toward him, and I soon found that my sister and I were competing to be the first to hug him! One hundred feet never felt so close yet so far away. Panting, we reached him with heavy legs and full hearts, now that we were with him.  The good thing is, an awkward moment never appeared. It knocked, but we didn't let it come through the door; instead, laughter came in its place. All of my troubles and worries were gone when he opened his mouth, and those soothing waves of laughter came out and were welcomed into our ears. My heart was lifted, and my smile brightened. I knew that my father could not have been gone any longer. I love him! Laughter soothes the soul and brings joy to any situation. It is kind and has no regrets. The only mistake is not taking the chance to laugh in the first place. Laughter is one of the many things that holds me so close to my father today. Our sense of humor when we're together is never dull and is unforgettable. I trust him with my life and ever since I was born, he has found a way to make the best out of every situation by laughter. I can count on his laugh to make anyone smile, and it is without a doubt, the most contagious thing I'll ever hear.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" including me and my father."
398	21208	8	3	"The first day I met her, I knew @CAPS4 was the right dog for me. Her black and white fur was as soft as cotton, and her eyes as brown as the bark on a tree. @CAPS4 had a genuine personality no other dog could possess. Which was something I could tell right away @CAPS4 was the dog for me. Over the next couple of months, our friendship grew, as I taught her to talk, smile, and stand on two legs and dance with me. A black lab @PERSON1, instantly became her best friend, as the two ran over the property barking and playing. Every night the two would cuddle up next to each other and sleep. The times @CAPS1 (my new dog) would lay on her side and relax, I would call her an oreo. Her middle belly was white and her sides were black, making her look like a large-breathing oreo @CAPS1. @CAPS5 her name had come from. The seventh month had come along fast, but it was enjoyable every day with my @CAPS1 at my side. @CAPS4 gave me the best comfort when I needed it, always giving me a smile when the day was rainy, or sleeping next to me when I didn't feel the best. It was kind of like @CAPS4 was my own special dose of medicine, her presence made me feel well again. Her love had grown deep into all of our hearts at that house, and @CAPS4 was one of a kind, but something began to change about her as the days went on. Her food bowl would be nearly full every time we fed her, @CAPS4 wouldn't run with @PERSON1 anymore, @CAPS4 wouldn't talk, and @CAPS4 wouldn't smile. I knew something was wrong. We didn't know @CAPS4 was sick until it was too late. The first day @CAPS4 had thrown up blood. That was when the worrying began between my boyfriend, his mother, and I. We wanted to find a vet to help her, but none of us had the money to do it. The second day in the @TIME1, I couldn't find @CAPS1 anywhere on the property. I thought that maybe @CAPS4 had just gone for a walk around the outskirts of the house, until it reached @NUM1 pm and there was still no sign of her. Panic spread throughout my body, and I gave up looking for her and turned towards @PERSON1. ""@PERSON1,"" I looked at her straight into her eyes, ""I know you can hear me."" @CAPS4 looked at me with big brown eyes and wagged her tail. ""@CAPS5 is @CAPS1, @PERSON1?"" I knew @CAPS4 understood me as @CAPS4 began to sniff around the areas of the property and suddenly as if @CAPS4 had picked up a trace, had followed a line of scent to an old opal car. @PERSON1 wagged her tail looked at me and looked back under the car. There @CAPS1 was sick looking. So I pulled her back up onto the property for my boyfriend's mother to look at her. We weren't sure if it was poisoning or something else. So we called an animal expert and asked. @CAPS4 said it sounded most likely like parvo, since we hadn't gotten @CAPS1 her parvo shot yet. So over the night to help her feel better, I and my boyfriend stayed up shooting water into her dehydrated body, and spinach juice hoping it would help, but all @CAPS4 wanted to do was sleep. So we left her alone in peace and decided we would check up on her in the @TIME1. In the @TIME1, my boyfriend had to go to work, and I was left alone with @CAPS1 to take care of her. I sang songs to her as @CAPS4 laid on the porch sad looking and in despair, I stroked her on her head telling her how much @CAPS4 was my best friend and my favorite dog that meant so much to me, and I told her I loved her. I tried getting her to eat, but @CAPS4 would only puke it back up. Finally, after a day of crying next to her, I noticed @CAPS4 kept walking to the pond behind the house and sitting in it. It gave me the incentive to check her butt. As I pulled up her tail, I noticed a large bloody hole @CAPS5 flies were flying out of. @CAPS4 was rotting from the inside out. I cried. It was time to decide whether to put her down or not, and I, my boyfriend, and his father just looked at her watching"
399	21209	8	3	Fishing has always been a significant part of my life, starting from my childhood days spent fishing with my dad and brother at the lakes. As I grew older, my trusty fishing pole began to show signs of wear and tear, leading me to save up money to buy a new one for my tenth birthday. Equipped with my new fishing pole, I eagerly joined my dad for a fishing trip to a river after attending a family wedding. However, a comical mishap occurred when a flock of birds swooped down and carried my new fishing pole away, causing it to land in the middle of the river. Despite the unexpected turn of events, we managed to retrieve the pole downriver, and the incident became a memorable fishing tale shared between my dad and me.
400	21210	8	3	@DATE1 my birthday, my boyfriend @PERSON2 took me to @LOCATION1 to @ORGANIZATION2's. I had never been there it was exciting and a new food experience for me. My dad had promised me that he would take me because it was my @NUM1 birthday and he wasn't there for my @NUM2 birthday. But he forgot so my dad's girlfriend called the restaurant and told the manager that it was my birthday and to give me anything that I wanted and just to charge it on her credit card. This is where mine and @PERSON2's adventure started. The beginning of our adventure. Driving on the old back roads of @CAPS1 in the old @ORGANIZATION1 on our way to @LOCATION1. Just @PERSON2 and I, the roads were damp with the mid-afternoon dew, the trees with their beautiful leaves of all different colors of reds, greens, and oranges. Bouncing around from the dips in the old road. @NUM3 bumping on the stereo, only singing the parts we know. When we got to @CAPS2 we got lost because we took the wrong exit and ended up in @LOCATION2, the other side of where we were supposed to be. Being lost in a way bigger city than @PERSON1 or @CAPS1 wasn't good, we had no clue where we were. First place we went to was a strip mall that had a big party store. We went inside and there were decorations as far as the eye could see - monsters, witches, and goblins. We got sidetracked by all the scary things, but then I realized that I had to go to the bathroom. While I went to the bathroom, @PERSON2 asked one of the store clerks where we could find this @CAPS5. The guy said he had never heard of a place like that. So we got back into the @ORGANIZATION1, there was a lady getting out of her car so we asked her. She said yeah, it's just down a couple of streets. As we drove down the highway, we couldn't find it anywhere. Somehow we were lost all over again, so we found another convenient store up this really big hill. We didn't think that the little @ORGANIZATION1 could make it up such a big hill. We made it to the top, went inside, and had the clerk look up on his phone where we needed to go. As we waited, all I could think about was how bad my feet were hurting in those shoes. We got the address and took off again for our search. About twenty minutes later, we still had no luck at finding this restaurant and to top it off we had a reservation so we couldn't be late. We found another convenient store and @PERSON2 ran in to ask. The clerk told us to get back on the highway but I insisted we stay on the current road. We followed the empty road and right around the corner, there it was @CAPS5. We were happy to have found it finally and we weren't even late. All @PERSON2 and I could do was laugh because we had gotten so frustrated to find the stupid place that it was just so funny you couldn't help but not to laugh. It brought @PERSON2 and I just that much closer, we had gotten through that by laughing instead of fighting. And that was our funny adventure story.
401	21211	8	3	Ever since I was born laughter has been a big part of my life without it I would be a very boring and grumpy person. Even tough I have experienced many moments full of laughter one specific moment always comes to mind. About a year ago my mom and I went on a trip down to @LOCATION1 to visit her family. It was the first time we had been there in over twelve years because my mom and I could not go visit them do to immigration problems. After all toughs years had past by my mom and I managed to get our legal residency in the united states. As soon as we got the residency we were free and could go visit her family without having to come back illegally. When my mom and I got to the airport in @LOCATION1 my mom started crying because she was full of emotions, for the first time in twelve years she was going to see her mom, dad, brothers, and sisters. As soon as we had gone trough all the airport security and baggage claim we made our way out to the exit where my grandpa had agreed to pick us up. When we got outside the airport a small little red @ORGANIZATION1 started getting closer and closer driving towards my mom and I. The car was no further then forty feet away when my mom suddenly dropped her luggage and started running toward the small red car I had no idea who the elderly person driving the car was. When the car parked an aged man stepped out of the vehicle and gave my mom one of the longest and most emotional hugs I had ever experienced in my entire life they must of been hugging for at least fifteen minutes just crying on each-others shoulders. When they had finished hugging my mom calls out my name and I start walking toward her. When I was face to face with my mom and the older man my mom tells me that the man was my grandfather then she looks at her dad and tells him to meet his grandson. For the first time in a very long time I had a grandfather I stood in shock for a while and so did he. He was amazed of how big and how much I had changed in toughs long twelve years that he had gone without seeing me or having contact with me. When I reached out to hug him he griped me hard and didn't let go he told me that this day had been the happiest day of his life.  Me and my grandpa started loading the luggage into his car so we could head home to meet the rest of my family. When we got done loading everything into the car we headed home. The long ride home was a bit weird and uncomfortable because there wasn't much talk in the car. It was about a fifty minute ride home when we reached our destination in a small little town out of the @LOCATION1 called texcoco. It was a nice little clean town with a lot of small stores and lots of two story middle class houses the streets full of cars and people walking or on bicycles very different to what I was used to back in the united states. When we got to our house there was a group of about twenty people that were family and friends outside the gate waiting for us. When we were done seedling in and got done meeting all our relatives we got together and had a family dinner. One of my uncles really stood out because he was really funny and always was acting like a clown he was the one that set the mood in the house or wherever he went. As days past by I was getting more and more comfortable with the people around me and started having fun. About two weeks past and my uncle @CAPS1 invited me to one of his stand up comedy shows. that day I experienced more laughter then ever before his jokes where original and true. In conclusion, laughter is one of the elements to life without I could not be happy.
402	21213	8	3	"It's my sophomore year and some of my friends were going to try out softball. After thinking about it, I joined, and I fell in love with this sport. I am not that good, but like they say, practice makes perfect. We all laugh and have a good time, and everyone likes everyone. It's fun to be a part of a team that is always laughing and having a great time together. This is about a time when my friends and I started laughing so hard we almost started crying, and now it's one of our little jokes between all of us girls.  Once my friends and I were out catching pop fly's, and it was my turn to go catch the ball. I went out there skipping and just being my normal weird self. They hit the ball, and it started to come towards me. I went running for it and slipped and fell right on my butt. Everyone, including me, started laughing because I fell in the mud and got all dirty. About ten minutes later, we were all standing there and talking about how funny it was when I fell and how it made everyone's day. Then I saw some mud on the ground and I wanted to roll in it, but didn't want to just lay down and start rolling in mud. So I asked my friend to push me into the mud so I could fall in and roll in it. After she pushed me into the mud, I got up and started laughing my head off. My knees were covered in mud, and so was my butt and legs. They all started to say, ""Who shied on you?"" because we are not allowed to curse, so we made something else to replace it.  Now when I walk in the hallways and see someone from the softball team, we both just start laughing and say, ""Who shied on you?"" in the middle of whatever we are doing right then. This is the first year I have ever played a sport in high school, and I am glad I did it because I am having so much fun. When it ends in a few months, I am going to be really upset. All these girls and I have become so close in the last few weeks that they are like family to me now. Most of us used to just know each other and not really be friends or talk at all, but now we all do. We love to do silly things like sing in the locker room randomly or make the dumbest jokes ever. But we all have fun, and we don't care. We have had lots of laughs and many more to come this season, like when we have games on the buses or even at practice.  We have an amazing coach that makes us laugh and makes jokes every day. This season should be interesting with all of us because we all like to laugh, make jokes, sing, and just have a great time with each other. That's all that matters to make a good softball team and a great season."
403	21214	8	3	The Benefits of Laughter  Laughter has always been a major part of my life. Most of the relationships that I have with my friends are great, because I can make them laugh and cheer them up when they feel down. When a person laughs, it makes them completely forget about anything that brought them down, and now they just focus on what made them laugh and feel that joy and happiness. When you laugh, the only thing on your mind is the thing that made you laugh, nothing else.  Laughter, in many cases, has brought people from an absolute low self-esteem to a high self-esteem in a very short amount of time. An example where laughter was very beneficial to a person happened with one of my friends. One of my good friends seemed to be really down and didn't want to talk about what was going on with anyone. With him not telling anyone what was wrong, it kind of leaves you guessing, what could have happened?  After about a week of pretty much isolating himself from others, he was ready to talk and hang out with some of his close friends, which included me. Me, and two other people that were friends with me and him, decided to go golfing, which was a new hobby of ours. It was that day that he told us how his mom was cheating on his dad for over a year, and how she was also hiding alcohol in all different kinds of places and was over-drinking.  By him just being around his friends, laughing and having a good time, he found himself focusing on other things other than what was going wrong in his life. Even laughing at yourself can be a good way of coping with your problems. Even when there seems that nothing will go right in your life, something always will, you just have to give it time.  The moral of the story that I have just told is that no matter how sad you feel, laughter can always help ease the pain. Even laughing about a bad situation could help you to feel better. Remember, laughter is truly the best medicine.
404	21215	8	3	Laughter is a significant aspect of human life, serving as a means to express various emotions and connect with others. It plays a crucial role in forming bonds, breaking down barriers, and creating a sense of camaraderie. Personal experiences with laughter, such as sharing jokes with friends and family, can strengthen relationships and create lasting memories. However, while laughter is generally positive, it can also have negative implications when used inappropriately, such as when mocking others or encouraging harmful behaviors. Overall, laughter is a powerful tool that can bring joy, foster connections, and uplift spirits, but it should be wielded with care and sensitivity to avoid causing harm.
405	21217	8	3	So my friends and I got into a heated discussion on how we need to keep things to ourselves because one of my friends told people some personal things about us. He caused us a lot of problems in school and around town. He started to lie to us, and one of my other friends lost it and went after him, tackling him down and telling him to quit lying. After he let him up and we all got back in our seats, he started to spill his guts to us, confessing the rumors he started about us and other things he did. We all kind of lost it. After calming down a bit, we took turns talking to him. When it was my turn, he kept interrupting me, and I finally got mad and grabbed something off the floor to throw at him. I reached down, picked up something soft without looking, and threatened to throw it at him. He started to point and laugh, and I turned my head to see what was in my hand. It was a stuffed fairy from his floor. I couldn't help but laugh and playfully threw it at him. The laughter helped to ease the tension and make things better for him and all of us. The moral of the story is that even when you're mad, something will always make you smile and make your day better.
406	21218	8	3	"Every fiber of my being was urging me to talk to her, but my gut churned with anxiety every time I gathered up the courage to do so. Then she glanced at me. Just for a second, but enough to gather information about me. Enough to tell that I wasn't just looking around the room vacantly, but I was focusing on her dark brown eyes, and hers only. I sheepishly flickered my eyes away, quickly counseling myself, why did you keep looking at her? You knew that she was going to notice! But somehow I knew I wanted her to. I wanted her to look back at me. I didn't feeling her gaze upon me anymore, even though it was only a second before that we made eye contact. I darted my eyes in her direction again. This time she was looking at me first and I fell into her sight. I didn't know what to do about this, I haven't been in this situation before. No girl has ever beaten me to first glance. She smiled, a cute little smile, I've noticed you noticing me, I don't see why you need to hide it. I have my eye on you. All I could do was focus on not looking like a moron. I willed myself to smile, but only slightly, enough to let her know I saw her smile, and it was at me! There was she, smiling at me, giving me a chance to show her what makes me a guy for her. Then the day came. The ice rink in our town was about 20 minutes away, which seemed short because of the four friends that were howling and talking crap about each other in the back. We drove up and parked next to the rink. As we stepped out of my mom's minivan we could all hear the hustle and bustle of kids strapping on their rental skates and awkwardly walking towards the thick glass doors that lead to the oval arena of dry frigid air accompanied by a thick bed of cut up ice. Our group of friends all traded in our money and received our own pair of worn, probably never cleaned, ice skates. Absently we slide on the uncomfortable bladed shoes and waddled for the glass doors. One-by-one each of us stepped cautiously onto the ice, making sure we didn't look silly by sliding forward and performing the splits in front of everyone around us. When we finally conquered that challenge we proceeded to slide our way along with the current of skaters flowing in the counterclockwise loop around the rink. Every once in a while we'd race each other for a lap around the rink, but besides that we just talked about our game of choice: Overwatch and the various other games that held our interest. But as usual, that conversation turned into a debate about ""overpowered classes"". One side complaining that they can never win against that class, the other saying that it's very easy to ""destroy"" them with a simple trick. I proceeded to daze off out of the fight, looking around the rink, watching people stumble along their path or glide gracefully through the awkwardly skating participants. Then I saw her again. Her hair was the first thing that caught my eye, it acting as a blanket would being hung on a clothesline out in a summer's breeze. Then as she looped around the end of the rink her face started to be revealed, just as beautiful as before. She wasn't having the hardest time skating, but every once in a while she would slide a skate too far to one side, lose her balance, but was able to regain her composure within a second or two. I smiled as she looked around, checking if anyone had seen her little mishap. ""Ana the sniper is OP in Temple of Anubis, you don't know what you're talking about!"" my friends sneered at one another. I had no interest in being pulled into this argument. As I sped up away from my friends, and weaved my way through the crowd, I eased my way towards her. As I approached her I was running one-liners through my head to use as an icebreaker with her. I noticed her feet slide outwards on both sides of her, and I smiled at what I could do to be able to engage her. As she began to stumble, I had to time my entry perfectly as to seem like a random bystander just there to help her back up, rather than an anxious boy trying to find a way to talk to her. Right when she was about to fall over I sped up and placed my hand on her back and gave her a little push upwards. But she was too far gone. She tumbled on top of me as we fell to the hard ice. As the commotion ceased, she quickly jumped off and apologized for her clumsiness. But all she noticed was my hysterical laughing. All"
407	21219	8	3	"Laughter I have many friends. My friends and I are always doing silly things to have a good time, and pass the time. We are laughing all the time. There is not one day where we are together and we do not laugh. My friends and I believe that laughter is an essential element of life. One, blazing, @DATE1 day my friends, @PERSON2, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, and @PERSON3 , all came over to my house. We were all bored, and hot, so we wanted to decide on something exciting to do. @LOCATION3 said, ""@CAPS1 don't we go swimming you guy's?"" We all agreed. My friends and I could not agree on where to go swimming though. We couldn't go to the pool near my house, because it was to crowded. We also, could not go to the lake, because it was too far, and we had no way to get there. My mother was working, so she could not give us a ride. @CAPS6 then said, ""I know you guy's! @CAPS1 don't we just have a water balloon fight right here at @CAPS2's house?"" We all responded, ""@CAPS3 let's do it!"" A little after, the @CAPS4 went to the store nearest by, which was @ORGANIZATION1, to buy water balloons, and water guns. Once they got back, they started filling them up right away. While us ladies changed into our bathing suits. After, we all decided on who was going to be on what team. The first team was @PERSON2, @PERSON3, and @LOCATION1. The second team, and the best team, was @LOCATION3, @PERSON1, and I. Both teams were all ready to go. Each team had buckets full of water balloons, and water guns. The teams were on different sides of my mom's green suburban. We were going to start throwing water balloons at the count of three, but the opposite team cheated and threw a water balloon before. Oh, but they did not realize that we had the hose on our side. @PERSON4 chased @PERSON1 across the yard. She caught up to her and soaked her with her water gun, but @PERSON1 threw a huge water balloon at her. It exploded right on her face. We all started laughing. Then, @PERSON2 and I started throwing water balloons at each other. We ran out, so we started using our water guns. Those too eventually ran out. @PERSON2 was all out of resources. I grabbed the hose, and I turned it up to full power. @PERSON2 tried to run but he slipped and fell. I completely hosed him down. My team had won the first @CAPS5. It was time for @CAPS5 two now. We had filled up more water balloons, refilled our water guns, and gone to our sides. We all counted, ""One! Two! Three!"" @CAPS5 two had started. @LOCATION3 started chasing @PERSON3. They went around the suburban at least five times before he caught up to her. He caught up to her on the grass. The grass was really slippery from when I got @CAPS6 wet, so they slipped, and fell down. @PERSON3 slipped first, but she took @LOCATION3 down with her when she was trying to get back up. We all started throwing water balloons at them, which made it harder for them to get up. @PERSON3 managed to get up she went on the side where her team was. They started throwing everything they had at us. They soaked us up. We had lost the second @CAPS5. Now it was time for the final @CAPS5. The @CAPS5 that decided who won, and who lost. We filled up double the water balloons, and double the water guns. No one got the hose that time. We thought it was not fair. Both teams lined up on different sides of my front yard. My team was on the right side, and the opposite team was on the left side. We were against who ever was lined up in front of us. I threw the first water balloon at @LOCATION1. Then @LOCATION3 threw at @PERSON2, and after @PERSON3 at @LOCATION2. Who ever moved out of line lost. @PERSON1 was the first to lose. @PERSON3 had thrown a big water balloon at her that knocked her out of line. We moved a step closer. It was now three against two. @LOCATION3 then water gunned @CAPS6 down. We walked another step closer. @PERSON4 and I were going back and forth at each other, but @PERSON4 had no more water balloons after a while and her water gun was empty"
408	21220	8	3	"Well it all started with the day he came to the airport. Missing him so much hardly ever getting to see him or have him return your phone calls like a brother should, but it is always a blessing to see him and have him over for the holidays. It's amazing how he found time during the holiday season to come and visit us. It was well fortunate because now I didn't have to hear him complain all the time about how cold and wet it was out here. So it was pretty good, but because it was the holiday season, it was normally about the time I go out and hang out with my friends and girls. Now that I started talking to this really beautiful girl that lives right around the corner from my house, I was dying to go out and be with her. But since time was really short with him, I had to put my brother first before anything. But every chance I got, I left and sneaked away to go see her. She was so beautiful, so funny, she was perfect to me, it was like a dream. I would tell my brother all the time about her. He would always tell me that even if she was real, it was impossible for a girl to be like that.  It was the first day he spent the night, and everybody was so happy in the house. From the time we picked him up from the airport to the drive home, talking, making jokes about how much he had changed, how tight his clothes were. It was good, we even stopped at Burger-Ville to get a couple of burgers because the boy was so hungry all the time, non-stop eating. We shortly arrived home and the look on my little brother and sister's faces was priceless. Their mouths were open so wide, like they had just seen a god. They came running towards him, and he wasn't prepared for it, slowly putting his bags down by the door, he got tackled and overrun by a 1-year-old girl and a 2-year-old boy. It was funny seeing them so happy and excited; it was a surprise for them, as we were only supposed to get gas. Then, we sat down and talked all night, watched movies as a family, but like my family, nothing ever happens accordingly or on time.  You know when you're having fun and laughing, you don't want it to end. You forget about everything, let time go by, and keep on doing what you do. But as time catches up to you and you're running on low energy because you've been excited all day to see your brother and share stories, tell jokes, and laugh, you get sleepy and in need of some rest. You dream of food and girls, most of the time they are put together in one whole dream after dream. Then we woke up, had a great time, shared some laughs in the morning, cracking jokes non-stop, talking, hanging out. I got to take my brother to some parties of mine, which really scared my parents, but it was funny at the same time.  Before we left, my mom said, ""Okay, we're letting you go out, don't get yourself into any trouble, alright? Your dad's going to be picking you up, so don't be acting stupid. Look after your brother, okay?"" And right after I said, ""Yeah, alright, bet,"" I questioned it and thought, ""Why do I have to look after my brother? He should be looking out for me."" But I guess that's what made it funny. Ever since then, we had a good time, and that's where this story ends, with me saying goodbye to him at the airport, hoping that one day soon, I'll see him again soon."
409	21221	8	3	My Laughter Story @CAPS1 you know that laughing really adds time to your life? Well you do now. Laughter is a great thing to have, because without laughter our world would be dull and pointless. On a day to day basis you should laugh everyday. Laughing can really help you get through a tough time.Me, @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and @PERSON4 were just hanging out up at @ORGANIZATION4's house one day and @PERSON4 was being really funny, all of us were laughing hysterically at what @PERSON4 was saying, then suddenly @PERSON2 calls us and wants to hangout and for us to come to @LOCATION1, but she said only @NUM1 of us can go. So we all debated on who was going to go. We came to a decision and @PERSON4 was the one having to stay back, but @PERSON1 gave him something to keep him occupied. So @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and I were mobbing the bus to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. There was a tweaker on the bus and he was making us laugh so hard, but he wasn't even trying. So we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1. We were all hungry so we decided to get some @ORGANIZATION2. When we got to @ORGANIZATION2 we all just got a dollar burger which were rip offs so we all saved our pickles that were on the burger so when we left we could stick them on the windows. We @CAPS1 and it made us laugh so hard we could barley run away. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION3's apartment we knocked on her door, no one answered, so we knocked again, no answer again. We were just about to call her when she walks out of a different apartment and we all just started laughing because we pounded on someone elses door. When we walked in there was a party going on so we were like nice. When we got there we all had a couple of beers. We were having such a good time we were all just laughing and have the greatest time. That next morning we woke up at @NUM2 a.m because we had to ride the bus back to @LOCATION2 early because it was @DATE1 and the buses run only for a little bit. When we got on the bus the bus driver was making weird faces like he was constipated or something but he made me laugh really hard.When we arrived back in @LOCATION2 we called up @PERSON4 to see what he was doing, he was just hanging out in town so we just went and kicked it with him for the rest of the day and later we all went home. It was a good weekend. Laughter truly is the best medicine and can make any day brighter.
410	21222	8	3	Laughter is indeed a powerful tool in various aspects of life, especially in relationships. It serves as a bonding agent between partners, creating a sense of unity and shared joy. Being able to laugh together not only strengthens the emotional connection but also lightens the mood during difficult times. In times of sadness or stress, a good laugh can work wonders in lifting one's spirits and providing a momentary escape from negativity. Laughter is not just beneficial on a personal level; it can also contribute to a more harmonious society by promoting understanding, reducing conflicts, and fostering a sense of community. Ultimately, incorporating laughter into our lives can have far-reaching benefits, enhancing our relationships, well-being, and overall quality of life.
411	21223	8	3	"Most of the time when you are laughing about something you are with someone else. I believe that laughter brings two people closer because it's something you guys both share, a moment you and that other person can think of and picture over and over again in the future. Even if that person is miles away. I can remember it as if it just happened a couple weeks ago. I had just finished a conversation with @CAPS3 mom. I went into @CAPS3 room and unplugged @CAPS3 little black phone from the charger. I opened it and a blinking light flickered saying ""@NUM1 missed calls from @PERSON1."" I called her back to apologize for missing her phone call. I heard someone pick up, but nobody talked on the other end. "" @CAPS1, @PERSON1 you there?"" I had asked hoping I would get a reply out of her. I sure got a reply just not the one I was wanting. She started bawling. Trying to catch her breathe, the words barely escaping her mouth. ""@CAPS2, @CAPS3 grandpa just died.""  @CAPS3 heart sank into @CAPS3 stomach. @CAPS3 eyes started to water up and @CAPS3 throat started to close, making it harder to breathe. @CAPS3 voice was all shaky and rough. I said, ""I'm sorry @PERSON1."" and I started crying. Us both crying wasn't make anything better anytime soon. She then had explained that he had a heart attack and asked me how something could happen to someone that didn't deserve it. I didn't have an answer to give her though. I had never been in the position she was in. Who was I to know what to say, or do to help her? So I thought hard of what to say to her that would clear her mind a little bit. @CAPS3 brain started hurting when I finally found something from the heart to tell her, something I would want to hear if @CAPS3 grandpa passed away.  I said in a low calming voice, ""there isn't much I can tell you because I don't know from experience, but you're family needs you right now as much as you need them. Think about the good times you had with you're grandpa @CAPS4. The laughs you guys enjoyed together. I heard a slight giggle underneath her sniffling. She started telling me a story about how every year her family would take a weekend beach trip. How it was a time for her family to bond and how she would miss it. When she told me that story @CAPS3 heart warmed and the corners of @CAPS3 mouth went up a little. I was proud of myself for sticking in there and being strong for @CAPS3 friend. Even though @PERSON1 will never see her grandpa @CAPS4 again she will always have him with her. Through memories, with in her heart, and by laughter."
412	21224	8	3	"Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. The sound of laughter is as unique as the sound of crying. There are many things that can cause people to laugh. And once you start laughing, you can't stop. Laughter is caused by something that is humorous, so it's mostly the cause of laughter that makes it so much more fun. And it usually depends on who you are with, where you are, and in what kind of situation you're in before you can actually start laughing. Kind of like the time when I was in @LOCATION2 baking a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was a nice warm evening in @LOCATION2, and I was making a pie with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had out all the ingredients necessary to make the pie until my @CAPS1 points out there's no more sugar. She tells me to go to the covers and grab a jar of sugar. So I went, and there were two jars when I opened the covers I asked her which of the two jars is the sugar because they had no labels on them. ""I think it's the jar on the left,"" she said. I grab the jar on the left side without another word. Later on while everyone was sitting down talking with one another, my @CAPS1 and I go and get the pie to serve to the family. They all looked at the pie in awe as we took it out and started slicing it. After everyone was served they all took a bite out of it. Immediately in just seconds everybody starts spitting it out like it was the worst thing that they have ever put in their mouths. Suddenly my @LOCATION1 makes a comment saying that the pie is too salty, not exactly the kind of comment I was expecting. Then my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 goes and checks to see the jar that I had grabbed from the covers. She sticks her finger in the jar and tastes it. Luckily enough, it was the salt jar. Then out of nowhere everyone starts to laugh into tears at the thought of what just happened. It was the most fun I had that evening, nobody could stop laughing. Clearly, the situation with the pie was something that I will surely never forget, and it'll probably never happen again. And after all that happened with the pie ended up being the kind of situation that makes you laugh. This shows that the three causes of laughter are real. First, I was with my @CAPS1. Secondly, I was in my @LOCATION1's house where there has to be at least one funny thing that can happen there. And also what happened with the salt and the sugar was a completely unexpected situation that turned out to be unmistakably hilarious. And to think that this event happened all because of the three main causes of laughter. Laughter is one of the most amazing things that the human body is able to do. Laughter will always be one of those things in life that cannot ever be destroyed. If you are a person who says that they've never laughed, then you are a liar and a hypocrite. Being able to laugh is good for you and your health. It gives you extra oxygen in your lungs to help you breathe easier and it's a lot of fun. So if you ever notice that you haven't laughed, stop immediately and take the time to have a laugh. Laughter is truly a gift that brings joy and connection to people, making life more enjoyable and memorable."
413	21225	8	3	Laughter is a powerful force that brings people together and enhances happiness. It has a contagious nature that can uplift spirits and create bonds between individuals. When shared, laughter can create lasting memories and strengthen relationships. During a state writing test, a student found himself struggling to come up with a story about laughter until a younger classmate's exuberant announcement of passing his test brought joy and laughter to the room. This simple moment not only brightened the student's day but also provided a perfect story to share in his essay. It goes to show that laughter can have a significant impact on our lives, creating moments that are meant to be cherished and shared with others.
414	21227	8	3	For me, laughter plays a significant role in my life. It brings me joy and happiness, especially when I am feeling down. My friends are a constant source of laughter, always finding ways to make me giggle even on the toughest days. Whether it's through jokes, funny facial expressions, or just being themselves, they never fail to bring a smile to my face. Even my exchange student, @PERSON1, surprised me with her humor, adding a new layer of laughter to my life. And let's not forget about my best friend, @PERSON2, whose quick wit and playful banter always leave me in stitches. Overall, laughter is a vital part of my life, shared with those I care about and making every moment a little brighter.
415	21229	8	3	"As warm autumn days turned into chilly winter nights, the girls (@PERSON3, @PERSON5, @PERSON2, @CAPS1 and @PERSON4) and I were wondering what we should do to add a little pizazz to our lives. No one knew what was to come or the laughter we would experience. It was one of the biggest games in the @ORGANIZATION1 season. It was to determine whether or not they would go to the playoffs to compete for the @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is the biggest @ORGANIZATION1 fan known to man. She was, of course, all decked out in @CAPS3 attire. We watched the game, had a few shots of apple juice, and pigged out on @ORGANIZATION2. Halftime was coming right around the corner and to say the least, the halftime show wasn't going to be all that and a bag of chips. I pulled my camera from my @PERSON1 look-alike bag and pressed record. While I was walking around in a circle trying to get everyone in the video, @PERSON3 was having a little too much fun on a red exercise ball. She was bouncing up and down at least two or three inches into the air. A light bulb went off in my head. I handed the camera to @PERSON4 and slowly moved over to where @PERSON3 was bouncing. Just as @PERSON3 screamed, ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7!"" I kicked the exercise ball out from under her, and when she came back down, she was straight on her back! @PERSON3 was too busy laughing and trying to breathe to tell @CAPS5 how stupid I was. I was on the floor curled into a ball trying really hard not to pee my pants when all of a sudden, I hear this bang sound. I look up, and the camera was lying on the floor next to @PERSON4, @PERSON5, and @PERSON2 who were laughing along with @CAPS5. @PERSON3 finally got the strength to get up. She came over and smacked @CAPS5 across the head and said, ""@CAPS8't ever do that again."" I'd say we had a better halftime show than the @ORGANIZATION1 did. As the game ended, the weather changed, and it began to snow. While everyone scurried to find their shoes, knocking into one another, I grabbed the camera not worrying if I got sick or not. We spent the last hour doing two of my favorite things; taking pictures and making memories. We went back inside and slowly went into slumber after drinking a little too much hot chocolate and apple juice. @PERSON3 has always been an early bird. I felt this sharp pain in my back, and I shot straight up. Only to quickly realize that it was only her fist. Soon after everyone else arose from their warm blankets. Everyone @CAPS9 @CAPS1. We let her sleep and wandered outside again. It snowed. A @CAPS11. We thought of a plan and began to gather all the snow into one giant pile. @CAPS1 is a heavy sleeper so we picked her up, opened the door that led to the backyard, and plopped her right down in the center of the pile. @CAPS1's eyes opened big and wide. Her mouth followed doing the same thing. She used every bad word she could possibly think of, including some in @CAPS12 that even she didn't know the meaning of. Soon, we were all in the snow laughing so hard we couldn't even @CAPS6 our breaths to apologize. @CAPS1 came to realize that it was an exceptionally good joke and began laughing along with the rest of us. In the end, we all had a good laugh and a cold to share that night. Laughter is the most important element in any relationship. It makes the bond between you and others stronger. Whoever said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" was @PERCENT1 right."
416	21230	8	3	FUN TIMES WITH MY BEST FRIENDS  I've had the same best friend for about three years now, and laughter has always been a big part of our friendship. Whether it's just us thinking we're funny or if others find us amusing, I'm not quite sure. My two best friends are Sarah and Alex, whom I've known since we were kids. Although we only became close in sixth grade, we have shared many hilarious moments together.  One memory I have with Sarah is when we used to throw eraser bits across the room in class, narrowly missing our teacher. With Alex, I remember goofing off in the playground back in third grade. Despite attending different schools now, we still manage to hang out and have a great time whenever we're together.  One particularly memorable day was when we went to the skate park for my birthday. Alex's grandma drove us there, and on the way, we made a pit stop at a fast food restaurant. Alex decided to prank his grandma by placing his order at the drive-thru window, causing quite a commotion. I recorded the whole thing on my new camera, capturing the hilarious moment forever.  When we arrived at the skate park, we spent hours skating and filming each other's tricks. We explored the various stair sets and enjoyed each other's company until it got dark. Afterwards, we headed back to my place, where we watched movies, played video games, and listened to music.  Towards the end of the day, Alex accidentally broke my camera tripod while goofing around, but we couldn't help but laugh at the situation. Despite the mishap, it was a day filled with laughter, fun, and strengthened our friendship even more. I'm grateful for the moments shared with Sarah and Alex, and I look forward to many more adventures with them.
417	21233	8	3	Laughter is a powerful tool that can make a difference in people's lives, no matter their age. It has the ability to bring joy, comfort, and healing to those who are in need. I have personally experienced the impact of laughter on my own life, especially during times of sadness or loneliness. A simple joke or a funny moment can turn a bad day into a good one, and it can help mend broken relationships. Laughter is a universal language that can connect people and bring them closer together. So, don't underestimate the power of laughter - it can truly make a difference in the world.
418	21235	8	3	A great day for an adventure! My sister invited me to her Christian school called Crossroads Academy. It was a nice sunny day, perfect for exploring. Waking up early, I joined my sister in all her classes, meeting her teachers and friends. However, things took an unexpected turn during her P.E. class. The teacher announced we would be running up a mountain, so we had to put on our running shoes. In the rush, my sister forgot hers, and we had to go back to get them.  Deciding to take a shortcut, we found ourselves on a scenic route that led us down a steep hill. My sister ended up sliding down on her butt, covered in dirt, while I tumbled down like a wild tumbleweed. When we finally reached the class, everyone was shocked at our appearance. After cleaning up, I had a mishap in the shower, slipping on a wet floor and injuring my pinky.  The accident made me pass out, causing concern for my sister and her friends. When I woke up, I was comforted by my sister, who reminded me never to scare her like that again. Despite the minor injuries and the scare, we both shared a laugh about the chaotic day we had experienced at Crossroads Academy.
419	21236	8	3	Every summer, my family, friends, and I embark on an exciting trip to Lake Tahoe. We always bring our jet ski, and boat along with us. We rent a spacious cabin right by the water's edge, where we stay for about a week and enjoy the scorching one hundred-degree weather. Most of our days are spent swimming in the refreshing water. Lake Tahoe is just an hour's drive from our home in Sacramento. The lake offers a plethora of activities such as paddleboarding, kayaking, aqua cycling, biking, boating, and more.  This year, my brother obtained his boating permit, adding an extra thrill to our water adventures. I was thrilled to have him take us tubing, as he brought a whole new level of excitement to the experience. He would take turns with us on the jet ski, ensuring that we had a blast. One memorable afternoon, my friend and I joined him for a tubing session. As the day progressed, the water became rough and choppy. My friend was the first to take a tumble off the tube.  When it was my turn, I eagerly hopped onto the tube, ready for an adrenaline-pumping ride. Signaling my brother to go faster, I soon found myself flying in all directions, experiencing the exhilarating rush of the wind. Despite signaling him to slow down, he mischievously sped up, sending me into a series of flips before plunging into the water. The impact was intense, feeling like my skin might peel off from the force.  After resurfacing, I realized my bikini bottoms were nowhere to be found. Panic set in, but my family quickly came to the rescue, bringing me a pair of shorts to cover up. Despite the mishap, I had an unforgettable time at Lake Tahoe and will cherish this wild tubing experience for years to come. Looking forward to returning next year, I'll be sure to pack some secure shorts for future tubing adventures.
420	21237	8	3	When my brother and I finally established a close relationship, laughter played a key role in strengthening our bond. Growing up in a complex family dynamic, we found solace in humor, using it as a means of connecting and showing our care for each other. Despite our occasional disagreements and past conflicts, laughter became the bridge that brought us closer together. Through shared jokes, video game sessions, and everyday banter, we learned to appreciate each other's company and support. Our laughter not only lightened the mood but also created lasting memories that we fondly reminisce about. As we continue to laugh and tease each other, we understand that our relationship thrives on the joy and connection that humor brings. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people, and in our case, it has paved the way for a stronger and more meaningful bond between siblings.
421	21238	8	3	"It seems like everyday of everyone's life they are being tested in every way shape and form and it seems like it will never end. It gets to be stressful and complicated but this is what makes us human. Something else that makes us human is laughter but no matter how bad things get to be it can always be changed by a knock knock joke, comic ad, or just one word from a best friend. Iv been with my dad and a couple of his high school buddies as they are telling stories about some of the crazy stuff they did when they were in high school. My dad and his friend @CAPS1 went off into a story about when they bought a @NUM1 @LOCATION1 tempest for @MONEY1. It turned out to be the greatest life lesson and some of the funniest stories in my life.  This was my dad's second car he ever had with a @NUM2 and a @NUM3 speed anything was possible. It started out when my dad first drove it to school which didn't last long, because an hour later. @CAPS1 and my dad left doing a burn out on speed bumps in the school parking lot. This car was a burn out animal backing up then side stepping the clutch to second and it would all be up in smoke. One day my dad was sliding around gravel corners and one of the rear bias ply tires blown out it thrown that car into the ditch and messed up the side pretty bad. Joe enders pulled him out and half a gallon of dera glass a hammer and a can of paint later it was ready to go again.  The next story I heard was when my dad's friend borrowed the car he needed something to get him back and forth to work. So my dad hands him the keys and says ""keep it on @NUM3 wheels"". Two weeks later on a weekend he was out messing around and the car slid off the road and rolled a few times and buckled the roof. I never heard how he got out but somehow he did and returned the car to my dad. After that it had an organ transplant of a roof from a @CAPS2 that hit a tree, @NUM5 weeks later and it's ready to go again. Now it's just something about a rear wheel drive car and snow that makes us kids again. sliding around in snow was the last thing this car ever did. My dad and @CAPS1 were driving in the snow having fun when the back end decided to trade places with the front. They lost control as they slid across the winter wonderland to a lonely telephone pole. The car slid into the pole and it was the end of fun. Finally the car had died and my dad had brought the car back home. He decided not to fix it and parted it out he sold the @NUM3 speed for @NUM7 @MONEY1 the engine for @NUM8 and the rear end for @NUM9 the trunk and hood weren't far behind for another @NUM9 the seat, steering column and radio my dad kept, the rest was scrap. So all in all my dad had some of the greatest moments of his life for no more than gas money and a few spare parts. God bless @LOCATION2 and I hope someday soon I can have memories like that. Life is full of unexpected twists and turns, but it's in those moments of chaos and laughter that we truly learn, grow, and create memories that last a lifetime."
422	21240	8	3	I think that laughter is a very important part of life. One time, my cousin was feeling stressed and upset, so I comforted her and told her it was okay to cry. Then, I shared a humorous analogy with her, comparing life to a jar of jalapenos. This made her laugh, and she was able to relax and enjoy the rest of the day. Laughter has a way of lifting our spirits and helping us through tough times. It's a simple yet powerful way to bring joy and positivity into our lives.
423	21241	8	3	Laughter is important in building relationships and creating lasting memories. The anticipation of reuniting with family members and meeting new ones can bring about feelings of excitement and nervousness. However, through the power of laughter, awkward moments can turn into joyous ones. In the case of reuniting with a long-lost father and sister, the tension was broken by sharing stories and reminiscing about the past, leading to genuine moments of connection and understanding. Laughter truly has the ability to bridge gaps and create bonds that last a lifetime.
424	21244	8	3	So one time my friends Chad, Justin, and I ding dong ditched this old man. The reason we did this is because we would walk by his house every day, and he would turn on his sprinkler and an annoying alarm. At around nine or ten at night, we walked over to his house, banged on his door, and ran. When we got back to our friend Taylor's house, we were sitting in the garage, reveling in our prank. Suddenly, we heard banging on the garage door. Startled, we ran into Taylor's room, only to burst out laughing when the old man started screaming and banging on the door, yelling for us to come out.  He eventually went to the front door and continued his tirade, waking up Taylor's mom. We ended up coming out and talking to the man, who claimed he called the cops because this happened frequently. Despite it clearly being us, we denied any involvement, unable to contain our laughter at his appearance - resembling a turtle crossed with an elderly criminal, complete with liver spots and a failed comb-over. By the time the cops arrived, the man had disappeared, and we managed to convince the officer that he was confused and mistaken. We got away without any consequences, finding the whole situation funny and exhilarating.
425	21245	8	3	"According to @PERSON1's @CAPS1, laughter is a cause of merriment. In other words a light heart-ed fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships, but plays a big role in life itself. An example of laughter being important in relationships is, when a very good friend of mine stopped speaking to me over this empty-headed quarrel we had about some animal becoming extinct. It had been almost two years exactly since her and I haven't spoken. I thought nothing would bring us together, until one day when I was at the store and we ran into each other. We just looked at one another and just started laughing. Right than and there we figured out that the argument we had was pointless, and not worth talking about. Without laughter, my friend and I would have never been reunited.  When you meet new people, what's the first thing you tend to do to get them to enjoy you? You usually tell jokes, or say something funny just to get a chuckle or two out of them. This is where laughter ties into life, physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual. When you meet a new person you often see those individuals have at least one thing in common. I guarantee that in every single friendship, laughter is the most common thing people share together. There is no possible way of getting around it.  Another example of why laughter is important in life is when someone is looking for a job, or going to a job interview and the one who is in charge of making the decision of whether or not you get the job has no personality. What do you most often do in this type of situation, either show your serious side or possibly crack a few jokes. If this doesn't work well at least that person has a good idea about your personality.  Learning how to handle life can become very stressful, also trying to handle it mentally can be quite a challenge. A friend of mine just graduated from college and she was struggling on trying to find a job that she studied in. She was very stressed out, and also very depressed because her grandma was in the hospital and ready to pass on. She didn't know what to do, no money was coming in yet, and she couldn't find an apartment she just was a mess. Until one day she told me that she received a call from her sister and her sister mentioned that their grandma couldn't hold on and she was ready to pass. She rushed to the hospital and went to go see the last of her grandma before she passed. Her grandma grabbed her hand and told her, ""I know life can be mean and just give you no chances but you have to get through that and enjoy life. Life's too short to be worrying about what tomorrow will bring. Just put that smile on your face and laugh when life gives you the worst."" And there she realized that what her grandma had said was true. You can't live through life in a drag, just have to get up and take it. She was very devastated about her grandma's loss, but again she felt it was meant to happen because without her grandma telling her about this she wouldn't have never known that her grandma experienced the same thing as she did. She didn't feel like she was the only one in the world that was going through these difficult crises. She will always love her grandma.  When you learn how to take life as it comes, people tend to notice it is indeed a very hard step to achieve. Individuals learn in many other ways or some just don't learn at all. For example, she learned from experience going on with school and struggling with trying to find a job. Her grandma told her right before she passed on because her grandma probably most likely experienced it as well. Other people learn from meeting new people, and just having fun with life, or like me, I learned the hard way by not talking to a very good friend of mine over an empty-headed argument. Laughter comes in different shapes and sizes, we as human beings have to approach it, whether it's an argument or learning it as it comes. One way or another it will come and we have to be ready for it, it's not a scary thing.  The benefits of laughter are that it makes you happy and people tend to be having a good time. Laughter is a positive thing, and people shouldn't ignore it, it's a good stress reliever as well. Laughter is a cause of merriment, a light-hearted fun spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships but plays a big role in life itself. Laugh when life gives you the worst, as it's a way to overcome challenges and find joy in the midst of difficult situations. Embracing laughter can bring people together, uplift spirits, and help navigate the ups and downs of life with a positive outlook."
426	21246	8	3	Laughing at @CAPS1 bell with my best friend is always a great time. We share so many funny and hilarious memories together, always finding something to laugh about, whether it's silly or genuinely funny. We enjoy poking fun at funny-looking people, laughing at people's silly remarks, and even finding humor in our own antics. One memory that stands out is the time we went to @CAPS1 bell after school. As we sat down to eat, my burrito turned out to be scalding hot, causing me to spit it out in a fit of laughter when a man wearing a clown mask walked in with a dog in a tiara. Despite the embarrassing moment, we couldn't stop laughing. The day took a turn for the worse when I accidentally ran into someone while getting a drink, leading to a choking incident that left me spitting out my drink everywhere. Despite the mishaps, the day at @CAPS1 bell will always be a cherished memory full of laughter and good times with my best friend. We continue to create new funny memories every day, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
427	21247	8	3	There is a difference between right and wrong. Most of us learn from it and most of us don't. We all have a choice either to face what we have done wrong, or just lie about it and get into even more trouble than you already are. Ever wondered when you are about to do something wrong and you don't think first? Well, this was one of those times when I wasn't thinking first.  I was nine years old, playing at the park with my friends, joking around and having a good time. @ORGANIZATION1 suggested we throw rocks at two rusted, broken-down cars in the park. Despite some initial hesitation from @PERSON1, I went along with the idea. We ended up causing significant damage to the cars, laughing it off at the time.  However, a few days later, we were confronted by the owner of the cars, and I was faced with the consequences of my actions. I learned the hard way that we should always respect other people's property and think before acting impulsively.  This experience taught me valuable lessons about right and wrong, the importance of telling the truth, and the consequences of not thinking before you act. It's crucial to consider the impact of our actions on others and to always strive to do the right thing, even when faced with peer pressure. I will never forget the lesson I learned that day at the park.
428	21248	8	3	Dozing off into space, relaxed as I could be in a hot stuffy room, @CAPS1 lay next to me, both pondering activities we could do. With nothing coming to mind, we resigned to the idea of lounging in bed all day, wilting in the heat. Suddenly, @CAPS1 suggested playing video games. We cranked up the music, inserted a game, and began our virtual killing spree, dominating the game. However, as fatigue and the sweltering heat set in, @CAPS1 mentioned feeling tired. Attempting to fix the AC, time seemed to drag on endlessly. Just as boredom crept in, @CAPS1 cracked a cheesy joke, sparking laughter between us. The jokes grew stale, leading us back to sitting on the bed, drifting off with only the sound of passing cars outside. Then, out of nowhere, @CAPS1 let out a loud, noxious fart, setting off a chain reaction of laughter. Amidst the laughter, @CAPS1's fart took an unexpected turn - she confessed to having pooped her pants. In fits of hysterical laughter, I watched as she hurried to the bathroom, exclaiming about the unfortunate incident. The unexpected turn of events brought a wave of uncontrollable laughter, concluding a day filled with unexpected twists and turns.
429	21249	8	3	It was the first day of the ninth grade, that terrifying day when one must choose how they are to be perceived for the next four years. I walked into my first class looking like a hippie on steroids, just over six feet tall and nearly two hundred and sixty pounds of long-haired, freckled teenager. I was a giant, and that made it difficult for bullies to muster up the machismo to treat me as the freshman that I was. I sat down in my designated seat, next to one of the girls who seemed to think too highly of herself. Despite this off-putting first impression, I attempted friendship, only to be met with confusion and disgust.  As I turned to face the front of the class once more, there stood the teacher, announcing our first assignment - to create a presentation that would showcase who we are. Excitement filled me at the prospect of a presentation. I have always been a showman, and the limelight is a very dear friend. With my love for acting, singing, and entertaining, I knew humor was my crown jewel. I designed a presentation full of twists, turns of phrase, punchlines, and puns that had the entire class in stitches. Laughter filled the room, drawing in other teachers to witness the spectacle.  Taking a bow after my performance, I looked around at the beaming faces of my new friends. In that moment, I realized that humor would be my tool for navigating high school. I could make others forget their troubles or brighten someone's day with just a few words. While I may not have been a star athlete or top student, I found that humor was my ticket to collecting friends like a magnet. The joy of camaraderie and laughter became my guiding light, ensuring that as long as I had humor, I would never be without the warmth of friendship.
430	21250	8	3	I met my best friend, @PERSON1, in the third grade. Best friends are the people who come into your lives and stay with you for the rest of it, through the easy moments and the hard times. We learn from our best friends and share experiences with each other. No matter the distance, their friendship is always there for you, even if you are thousands of miles apart or just a few houses away. The laughter between two best friends is an element that bonds them for life, because when two friends truly laugh together, they will always have a small moment in their lives intertwined for as long as they live. @PERSON1 and I have grown up together. We were there for each other from learning how to jump rope at school through broken bones, school-girl drama, crushes, boyfriends, heartbreaks, weddings and funerals. We helped each other get through everything from hard classes to family pets dying. We offered advice and brought hot chocolate, but this is only the beginning of our friendship. After the problems were solved, we learned how to laugh at our mistakes and move on. Together, we have gotten past slip-ups in what we say, to slipping on the floor. After we have giggled over what the other did or said, we helped them up and moved on. @PERSON1 and I know that, no matter what situation arises, we will always be there for each other, because we have the each others backs. @PERSON1 can make a joke out of any occasion. She is one of those friends that can make you smile just by seeing her face or hearing her voice. Most of the best moments in my life have usually involved @PERSON1 in some way. We have memories from lying in the driveway and watching the stars at night, to cracking up while working backstage for the local drama club. @PERSON1 can always crack me up with her perfect imitations of anyone, no matter how bad of a mood I am in. I crack @PERSON1 up all the time, usually unintentionally, by saying or doing something ridiculous, which shows my true blond side. We laugh over lines from our favorite movies and write down the funniest moments. We have shared so many memories together that we laugh over everything from driving around town and listening to music to being followed by the kiosk workers at the mall. One of the funniest times we ever spent around each other was while we worked backstage during a production by our local theater club. We laughed about everything from building sets to mistakes on stage. We had to open and close curtains in the dark, while wearing full black. I stubbed every single one of my toes that week while rolling the sets on and off stage. My hair was impossible to miss from the audience's point of view, even though I kept cramming it under a black ski hat. @PERSON1 would always have a problem opening one of the curtains that would get stuck when it was halfway open. She had to frantically tug on the rope even thought it kept getting caught in the pulley. I would laugh at her mistakes and she would laugh at mine. We both had a lot of fun watching the audience, director, and actors all at the same time. @PERSON1 and I got to stand in the back and watch all of the actors mistakes, giggling silently with each other. Every time one of the actors would make a mistake, we could watch the audience laugh and the director's face, which was usually horrified for a moment. Now whenever we mention any word or line from that play, we both start cracking up and remembering the entire weekend. There were more jokes then could ever be written down, and every time it is brought up, we remember even more funny moments.  When we are near each other, one quick look or a single word muttered under our breath can crack us both up. We can make each other laugh without even explaining what we meant, because we have shared so many experiences that we can read each others minds. Just one key expression or a twinkle in our eyes can crack the other up. Most other people around us probably would not even notice the small crinkle in the corner of our eyes or a slight smile. Those are the best codes ever imagined, because only the person that it is meant for could figure it out. The messages shared through the eyes a best friend can silently bring up subjects never spoken about and make us laugh. This is why true best friends are bonded by laughter, because it keeps them close no matter what comes, and for every moment of sadness, there are two moments of laughter and happiness. Our friendship is a treasure that we will always cherish, and I am grateful to have @PERSON1 by my side through thick and thin.

434	21256	8	3	"Boy says to his friend, ""Do you weigh too much?"" His friend laughs and says, ""What?"" The boy replies, ""I just wanted to say something to break the ice!"" Laughter is a powerful tool that can bring people closer together in any kind of relationship. It can help ease tension, create bonds, and make moments more enjoyable.   One day, I decided to take a friend I hadn't seen in a while to a concert to mend our strained relationship. As we were driving to pick her up, I thought of a funny prank to make her laugh. When we went through a car wash, I left the window slightly open, causing water to flood in unexpectedly. My friend burst into laughter, and I couldn't help but join in. This silly moment helped break the tension between us and set a positive tone for the rest of the day.   Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. It has the power to bring joy and happiness in any relationship, whether it's between friends, family, or romantic partners. In times of conflict or unease, a good laugh can work wonders in strengthening bonds and creating memorable experiences. So, don't underestimate the power of laughter in building and nurturing relationships."
435	21257	8	3	Laughter is a crucial element in life that can help brighten even the darkest of days. Whether it's a simple joke or a hilarious mishap, laughter has the power to bring joy and create lasting memories. I remember a funny incident from my fifteenth birthday when my sister unintentionally made a humorous remark at a Chinese restaurant, causing the whole family to burst into laughter. Despite her embarrassment, we continue to tease her about it to this day, turning it into a cherished family joke. Laughter has a way of uniting people and lifting spirits, even in the face of difficulties. It is important to find humor in life and share it with those we care about, as it can truly make a difference in someone's day. So, embrace laughter, no matter the circumstances, and remember that a good laugh can be the best remedy for a tough day.笑声是生活中至关重要的事情之一，即使只是一个简单的笑话或是发生在历史上值得分享的令人难以置信的事情。这有助于您度过艰难时期，或者让某人的一天变得更美好，让他们脸上露出微笑，或者给他们一个笑话，让他们继续通过人们之间的连锁笑声。有时候，它可能是人们记住你的最尴尬的事情，但最终笑你的人很可能很久以前也做过类似的事情，所以最后他们笑的其实是他们自己，甚至自己都没有意识到。我记得在我的十五岁生日那天，我的奶奶带着全家人去一家中餐馆吃饭。除了成年人讨论应该点什么家庭餐之外，场面是相当安静的。我坐在我姐姐旁边，看着菜单上的饮料，而她的注意力却放在其他事情上了，突然间，你听到的就是“他们没有鸡”。每个人都笑翻了，即使是站在隔壁的服务生的儿子和他的母亲也是如此。这让大家的心情都变得愉快起来，因为那时候并不是最好的时候。但你可以看出她很尴尬，但她自己也笑了，对全桌说的话是“我以为我是在心里说的”，我看着她说“不，你不是”，所以她只是耸了耸肩。到今天，每当我们去中餐馆，我妈妈都看着她说“他们没有你的鸡”，所以她看着我妈妈说“那会不会结束啊”，我们都看着她说“不，这将传给你的孩子，他们将听到有关他们母亲的鸡的故事”。这是一个如此突然发生的事情，以至于她会为此而感到沮丧，但仍然给我们每个人带来了笑声。尽管这是很久以前发生的事情，我们的父母笑称这将成为她的婚礼祝酒词，内容大致是这样的：“只要你给她，她的鸡，你@CAPS1 就会天长地久”，这并不是对那天发生的事情说的最好的评论，但对我们其他人来说，这仍然是件有趣的事情。这是一件将会在家族中延续多年的事情，并希望能够传承给后代。即使她不希望这样，只要想想在时间中，与其告
436	21258	8	3	I think that laughter is a key element to any lasting relationship, because if you didn't have laughter then that would be one boring relationship. Let me share with you a personal story of my own. I recently just started dating my boyfriend and his name is @CAPS1. We first met here at school and then he transferred and moved away, then a few months ago he added me on Facebook and we started talking again. At the time we had started talking he had a girlfriend but shortly after finding me again he realized that she was not the one for him anymore. It was rough for him to break up with her but he did it and I am proud of him, because she treated him very bad. In the beginning of our relationship we were both really shy and didn't talk much but the more and more that we hang out the more we start talking. We want to be the type of couple that can talk to each other about anything in person the way that we do in texts. Every time I see him I get really nervous and it almost seems as if my heart skips a beat. Whenever we are walking down a street I cannot help but to smile. And when we lay on the couch and watch movies I can't help but to laugh when he tickles me. We laugh at each other all the time, whether it's when one of us makes a mistake or what not. I believe that laughter and the way we get along is what keeps us going strong. Every time he leaves I cannot wait to see him again. Laughter is what keeps most relationships going because without it I feel like it would be a really boring and if it is boring then you wouldn't want to spend time with one another. I personally think that every moment with your significant other should be fully taken advantage of. Laughter truly is the spice of life and the glue that holds relationships together.

I myself was one of those people but with a slight difference than some others. I had what I like to call a biological father who in actuality in my biological father. Up until I was seven years old I thought that my dad was my quote on quote ""real dad"", but one evening I heard my mother down stairs yelling at someone on the phone. My mom was yelling at this unknown figure about child support and signing over his rights to my dad. I had no idea that who she was talking about was me and in fact the one on the other end of the line was my biological father. The moment I heard your son deserves better than this I ran upstairs to my room and began to weep because I thought that my dad was my dad but now this new figure in my life is claiming to be. My mom had heard me run up the stairs and came to tell me the story of what was really going on. As it had turned out my biological father had rights to my last name and unless he signed these over to my dad, my mom would take him to court and force him to pay the thousands he owed her for child's support. During this little story that she was unveiling I had learned that I have other siblings out there in the world. Over the next eight years of my life I would spend countless hours running through old phone numbers and email addresses trying to find my other siblings. It wasn't up until my freshman year that I met a guy who went to my school and was in the same grade as me, named John. He quickly became one of my good friends and we hung out every other weekend. On one occasion that he was at my house playing video games with me, he chanced upon a question of what my last name was. I thought to myself that this was a peculiar question but in the end I told him. All of the sudden a smile crept across his face and he asked if I had a biological father named David. My mind started to reel over this sudden question. John started to explain to me that he was half brother to my sister Lily who was one of the siblings that I had been searching for. Almost before I could think to ask the question of how; he had called my sister and explained to her he had found her brother. As it had turned out, she had been looking for me just as hard as I was looking for her. John asked her if she would like to meet me and I heard a high pitched squeal of joy from my sister saying yes on the phone. I to was overjoyed at the thought but I had no idea of how awkward it would be to finally meet her the next weekend. On the day that I met my sister, Lily's mom had come to pick me up to take me to her house. As we were driving so many thoughts were racing through my head that I thought I would puke in the car. When we finally arrived at her house, Lily's mom urged me out of the car and into the house where my sister that I realized looked almost the same as me was sitting on the couch looking just as nervous as I was. During the next four long nerve racking hours, my sister and I played 20 questions with each other to get to know one another. After doing this we were more comfortable with each other and she looked a lot more accepting that I was truly her older brother. By the time we were telling jokes and laughing hysterically. We realized that we even had the same obnoxious laugh (that everyone hated) and that to made us hit the floor laughing. At one point in time her mom had to tell us to quiet down because we were going to wake the baby if we didn't and by the end of the day we had connected with each other so much that she even gave me a hug before I left. Lily and I connected most through our laughter the first time we met and from that day to even now; every time we see each other we giggle and smirk. Since we found each other or in my case her brother found me; I have gone to her house every other weekend. My sister is one of the most precious people I have in my life and that will never change because nothing we say or do will ever stop the laughing and joy we hold towards one another."
438	21261	8	3	We couldn't control ourselves, our eyes watering, and our stomachs hurting so much we can't move. I was choking on my words as I talk to my best friend @PERSON1. Every time we talked to each other some one would say something that we thought was funny and we would start laughing and laughing. When I look back on the things that we talked about most of what we said didn't make any sense at all and I don't know why we laughed so hard. One day at our bus stop @PERSON1 said something very funny and we laughed until the bus came. Than I said something funny and we laughed the whole bus ride to school. This happened almost every day for us. On this particular day we couldn't stop laughing not even when we got to our class room. Our @CAPS2 grade teacher had lots of pets in her class room and one of her pets was a tree frog named @CAPS1. That week was @PERSON1's and my week to take care of him. When we went to feed him @PERSON1 grabbed him and made him dance all over his cage. We both thought this was the most hilarious thing ever. Our eyes started watering and we were chocking on our words as we took our seats for class. We laughed through the teacher giving instructions and while we were doing our class work. Eventually our teacher had to come up to us and tell us to be quite. This didn't stop us from laughing. We tried and tried to stay calm and do our work but we just couldn't stop. On this day lots of people in our class were chatty but no one was laughing as hard as @LOCATION1 and I were. We were so loud I thought the people in the class below us would hear us for sure.  It wasn't just us being loud it was the whole class. Our teacher stood in front of the class and yelled at us to be quite but that didn't stop us. In fact it made @LOCATION1 and I laugh even more. I thought I was going to pee my pants I was laughing so hard. Now @PERSON1 and I weren't the kind of girls who giggled quiet about things. We were the kind of girls who laughed really hard and loud with our eyes watering and our stomach muscles hurting us for the rest of the day. Our teacher wanted the whole class to be quite so she got in front of the class while we were doing our math problems. She told us to put down our pencils, push in our chairs and stand behind them, so we did. Then she told us to take a really big deep breath in, and we did. Next she told us to let out our breath as big as we cold. Lastly we were suppose to do that five times and then sit back down in our chairs and do our math problems silently with out talking to anyone. When @PERSON1 and I were taking our five deep breaths we did them very fast and very short to get them over with. We thought it was very funny and so did the rest of the class that saw us. The class started to laugh there heads off and the teacher didn't know what to do so she told us we would all have to stay in at recess if we didn't behave. Eventually the class settled back down and started doing there work quietly. Except for @PERSON1 and I. We kept laughing until the bell rang for school to be over.  We got on to the bus and started talking about how much fun we had that day and how funny it was when we were breathing really fast and not slowly like we were suppose to. Even to this day every time a teacher or someone tells us to take deep breaths for something @PERSON1 and I look at each other and start laughing, and than we breath really fast. Now we are sophomores in high school and we still have times where we laugh uncontrollably for no reason at all. I think its just a part of being best friends with someone. Some times we even laugh all day long like our day in the @CAPS2 grade. Through out our friendship we have learned to be much quieter when we do our breathing and when we laugh during a class or something important. I believe that @PERSON1 and I will always be best friends and we will always have our laughing moments together weather it's in a class, on the bus, while we are driving, at college, or on the phone. Laughing is something that everyone needs to experience in there life time. Not a giggle or a small laugh out loud but a really hardy laugh were you can't control yourself, your eyes are watering and your stomach hurts to bad to move just like @PERSON1 and I did in @CAPS2 grade. Even now, as we journey through high school, the memories of our uncontrollable laughter continue to bring us joy and strengthen the bond of our friendship. La
439	21262	8	3	It all started one afternoon after school, when my girlfriend and I missed the bus and decided to walk home. As we strolled down the ramp from the high school, hunger struck, leading us to stop by a nearby fast-food joint. We indulged in some food and drinks, and a playful soda-shaking prank ensued, causing a bit of chaos.   While attempting to retaliate, I ended up tripping over some goat heads, much to the amusement of my girlfriend. Despite the pain, I managed to pull myself up and continue our journey home. However, things took a comical turn when my girlfriend playfully hit me in the shin and took off running. I chased her only to slip in mud and fall into a puddle, resulting in a messy situation that left us both laughing uncontrollably.  Upon reaching my house, I found myself in yet another mishap when my girlfriend locked me out after a playful chase. Determined to get back inside, I attempted to force my way in, only to end up covered in fresh poop. After a quick shower to clean up, we decided to have some target practice shooting glass bottles in the backyard. The fun turned a bit painful when I got shot in the butt, prompting a lighthearted retaliation that led to a minor accident.  Despite the series of misadventures and mishaps, the day spent with my girlfriend was filled with laughter and memorable moments. Although I endured some pain and embarrassment, the joy of making her smile made it all worthwhile. As we look back on this day in the future, it will undoubtedly be a cherished memory of our youthful antics and shared laughter.

441	21264	8	3	"I tend to always get myself into awkward situations with the people I love, but that's just life, right? When you're a kid, you tend to be dramatic about every little thing, and those who love you are trying to teach you something or lead you the right way. Or maybe that was just me, haha? I moved out of my dad's with a horrible bang. I wanted to live life my way, which was only pushing the people I needed most away. I realized that a little too late. But again, that's just life, right? Just about a month ago, I finally ""rekindled the flame"" with my dad again. It was the hardest thing to do, considering my stepmom hates me, and that's obviously never going to change. So that's just something I'll have to deal with. My dad and I still had the most awkward relationship until a few months ago when we went on a fishing trip together. Standing there, casting away, there was nothing said. We both consider ourselves fairly humorous people, but even our jokes weren't breaking through the ice. We finally started making conversation, and he started to tell me about when I was a kid going on a visit to my mom for the first time, then coming back to my grandma's and calling her a... bad word, but I won't say which one. My dad hasn't ever really cursed around me before, I guess that's time away for you. It was pretty funny, all these stories he was telling me and the way he was explaining them. That brought pretty happy laughter to us both and really brought us back together again."
442	21265	8	3	Have you ever laughed so hard that you couldn't really breathe or you started to cry? well I can tell you that I do that all the time and that laughter is a big part of my life. I remember when my family and I all went out to eat for dinner one night. My grandpa wanted to go out to Chinese food in @LOCATION1, so my mom, little brother, my grandma, grandpa, my friend @CAPS1 and I all went out to the Chinese @CAPS2. That night was memorable because that was the night that we had the whole table laughing at @CAPS1 and I. When @CAPS1 and I got done ordering our food the waiter brought us our appetizers and that's when the tears and laughter came out. It was ten minutes of talking to @CAPS1 about this boy that she liked and when she said the name my crab puff went launching toward her i couldn't help but laugh so loud and hard. As @CAPS1 and I sat there and laughed about what had just happened, I had seen that @CAPS1 couldn't really open her mouth because she was laughing too hard and her cheeks hurt from laughing. She ended up drooling into the little sauce bowl that had soy sauce in it, and when seeing that I knew that I couldn't help but not tell her at all. The night came to an end when @CAPS1 ended up dumping her water all over the waiter's son. I had to apologize to the waiter that night and her son too. Her son said that it was okay because it happens to him all the time. Laughter is a big part of people's lives because laughing can make you happy, bring smiles to people's faces, and make memories. Laughing is truly a wonderful thing that can bring people together and create unforgettable moments.
443	21266	8	3	"This is the second time I have been to @ORGANIZATION1 and I can't wait to go on all the rides. The lines are extremely long but I am with some family that I haven't seen for a while so we talk and catch up. My uncle who is there with us tends to play tricks on the kids and embarrass me. He has given me wedgies, put his kids diapers under my pillow, and many more crazy tricks. I knew this trip would be no different so I tried to stay clear of any plans he had in mind. @CAPS1 was going to be a rather warm day today so I put on some basketball shorts and a t-shirt. We headed out with five kids under the age of @NUM1 so I knew we would be going on some smaller rides. After we went on ""@CAPS1's a small @ORGANIZATION1"", we decided @CAPS1 was time to go to the bigger rides but we would need some lunch first. We went to a burger shop and were waiting to get our food, so me and my uncle decided to have a spit ball war. We were shooting across the isle from table to table trying to dodge people walking by. I hit him twice in the side of the cheek so he told me I had won.  Once we ate our food and went outside to leave he told me, ""@CAPS2 see who can hold your little brother above their head for the longest"". I not thinking about @CAPS1 said, ""That's easy!"" and lifted my brother up. Little did I know that was a big mistake. He walked over and pants-ed me in the middle of the walk way. I stood there with a kid above my head and my pant's at my ankles. People sitting down at tables stared and laughed as they saw all this happen. I was so embarrassed, how could I be so stupid to fall for his trick. I couldn't believe I had fallen for @CAPS1 again. @CAPS1 happened so fast and I didn't know what to do other then chuckle inside. After that we decided to head to space mountain to get some fast passes. They allowed for you to not have to wait in line and go to the front, but they could only be used for certain times. We had to wait for about twenty minutes and @CAPS1 was raining. So we put on our blue @ORGANIZATION2 ponchos and the kids were playing tag. My brothers were the loud crazy kids that always have energy and don't stop running. They would keep coming up behind me and hitting me in the back and running away. After about the fifth time I couldn't take @CAPS1 anymore so I told them if they hit me again, they were going to get hit back. After about two minutes I got hit in the back again so I turned around and walked up to a kid in a blue poncho and hit him on the back of the head. Little did I know I had just hit a random little kid in the back of the head. I felt horrible as the kid looked up at me with a blank stare wondering what had just happened. I was so embarrassed that I ran and hid behind a tree as my my uncle and parents were apologizing for what I had done. Although my family was embarrassed for what I had done they were laughing hysterically inside at the same time. I had no idea that the kid wasn't my brother and could only imagine what that kid was feeling like.   As we left the theme park, I couldn't help but feel a mix of embarrassment and amusement at the crazy events that had unfolded throughout the day. Despite the embarrassing moments, it was a day filled with laughter and unforgettable memories with my family. I knew that no matter what tricks my uncle played or mishaps occurred, these moments would be cherished and remembered for years to come."
444	21268	8	3	Laughter is a crucial component of relationships, as it brings happiness and strengthens connections between individuals. I have personally experienced the power of laughter in my friendship with @PERSON2. During times of sadness, laughter has served as a healing mechanism, allowing us to talk, understand each other, and ultimately come closer together. Despite experiencing moments of anger or disagreement, the laughter we have shared has sustained our friendship over the years.  One particular memory that stands out is when @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I were at @ORGANIZATION1's house on a @DATE1. What started as a casual gathering soon turned into a hilarious dance-off initiated by @PERSON2's nephew. Watching @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 join in on the fun, creating their own dance routine, brought uncontrollable laughter and joy to all of us. This spontaneous moment of silliness not only lightened the mood but also solidified the bond between us.  Reflecting on this memory, I am reminded of the significance of laughter in relationships. It acts as a glue that binds people together, creating lasting memories and fostering a sense of unity. Through laughter, friendships are enriched, conflicts are softened, and connections are deepened. In essence, laughter is not just a source of amusement, but a vital ingredient in nurturing strong and enduring relationships.
445	21269	8	3	Middle school can be a challenging environment, with the rapid academic advancements and maturing social dynamics. The need for social dominance and ego inflation often leads to a breeding ground for bullies. The pressure to fit in and climb the social ladder can take a toll on one's self-esteem and academic performance. I personally experienced the stress of trying to navigate the social hierarchy and constantly being subjected to insults and criticism from my peers. However, I realized that laughter was key to surviving in this environment. By learning to laugh at myself and take the criticism as a way to improve, I was able to secure my place in the social scheme and make new, genuine friends. Through the power of laughter, I not only survived middle school but also learned valuable lessons that have helped me navigate through life. Laughing off the negativity and embracing the humor in situations can truly make a difference in one's social and emotional well-being.
446	21271	8	3	"They say laughter is the best kind of medicine there is. So to tell you the truth on that quote I will tell you a true story on laughter and how it's a medicine. I already have recognized in believing it myself. I also will explain its key element in part of the world. So to start us off I will tell you a story that has laughter in which fixed a few issues between my grandpa and my cousin. To start off it had happened about some time during the day. We were all having a blast. There was my cousins, and his little brother, my cousin and I. So my cousins and I were minding our business playing games while our grandpa was watching us play and then out of nowhere we hear a loud smack and then crying and screaming. So it had turned out that my cousin ""slipped"" and smacked his little brother who is only seven years old. Then our grandpa starts yelling and trying to figure out what the heck went down. After seeing his little brother's back with a big red hand mark on it that's when grandpa really let loose and just started going ballistic all over my cousin but then my cousin went home all upset. So later on my cousin came back and then grandpa and I sat at the table talking to him. That's when I mentioned something that started to make everyone laugh so hard that they all forgot what happened then he said sorry to his little brother and we were all happy by the time grandma got home from work. So to conclude my story I wish to remind you on why laughter is an element or if it plays a part in something which was a true story in part of my life. So thanks for listening and when you or someone is down in the dumps or just really mad, laughter is the medicine for the job."
447	21272	8	3	"I have heard people say that a smile makes a big difference in a first meeting, a relationship, or just walking past people on the street. If someone has had a bad day, not only should a smile make it better, but also some laughter along to accompany that sincere smile. I enjoy walking down the street on a nice, beautiful day and walking by locals I know that smile, laugh, and give a little wave to show that they are enjoying the day as much as I am. Walking past someone I do not know also has its positives. One look to see their face can tell me if they are having a good day or a bad day. Either way, I give a smile. A smile to show that it is a good day or a smile of encouragement to let them know it will get better. I enjoy the feeling I get when I meet someone and I know that we connected great. A good first impression is very important for me because it can determine how the friendship will go and how long it can last. I now know that I enjoy being around someone like me who enjoys to smile and laugh. I can't really seem to see myself around a serious person and I know if I was, we would clash and have problems because I am loud and if they are serious, there would be problems and not be able to collaborate on decisions. When I first met my friend Alex, I was nervous and scared because we were set up as a blind date by a mutual friend. It was a friend's birthday double date with our friend and my cousin. When the guys first picked us, I got into the car and the first thing that I remember was seeing a big smile on this guy's face. I ended up getting more nervous and began to stutter as we started to talk. As the date went on, he seemed like a down-to-earth guy and always seemed to have a smile on his face and laughter seemed to flow right out of him. As time went on, we became closer than what I would have ever thought of. I was not sure where our friendship would lead us, but soon after, it became noticeable that he liked me and I liked him. We took it slow, not rushing into things. We had long conversations that would last us hours at a time and we always seemed to laugh about everything. He made everything seem better and better each and every time we talked. Pretty much having the same personality and both always smiling and laughing helped us connect right away. Just the other night, Alex and our mutual friend, Sarah, came over to visit my cousin and me at her house. We were all laughing and enjoying each other's company when Sarah and my cousin decided to go to the store and buy some things using Alex's car. Since they weren't going to be gone for long, Alex and I decided to wait inside. Minutes after that, as we sat, talking to each other, Sarah and my cousin ran into the house looking flushed, out of breath, scared, and nervous about something. Sarah wouldn't look at us, so my cousin told us to go outside, something had happened to the car. As we stood there, I realized that the car was nowhere in sight in the driveway, so I became suspicious. We asked them where the car was and they pointed to the road, and in the dark all we could see was the faint outline of a car in the ditch. I was expecting Alex to get mad and say something to Sarah, who seemed to not know what to say, but instead he smiled, walked towards the car, and said, ""Don't worry, the car is fine."" As soon as he said that, he started laughing, his amazing laugh. I was still in a state of shock, and so as soon as I heard that laugh of his, I turned and looked at him, and realizing that he was happy and didn't seem to mind the accident, I began laughing as well, and in less than a few seconds of him beginning to laugh, not only was it us four laughing, but also two of my other cousins that had joined us outside. Laughter made the situation better, and I enjoyed the fact that we could all laugh about the smallest, the unexpected, and the worst as well as the best. What also made me happy was the fact that that very same night after the incident, Alex asked me the question I was hoping to hear, and the way he said it made me laugh, which then caused him to laugh. I answered his question with a hug and a yes, and he brought out a bouquet of roses. As we walked inside, my cousins and my aunt started to applaud, and we all started to laugh with smiles on our faces."
448	21273	8	3	Most people believe that laughter is essential for living a longer, happier life. Laughter has the power to strengthen relationships, mend broken hearts, and bring out the true essence of a person. In my own experience, laughter has been a saving grace, especially in challenging situations. I have found that sharing laughter with friends, family, or even strangers can make any circumstance more bearable.   There was a time when my mother and I were at odds, struggling to see eye to eye on certain matters. Our relationship was strained, and we found it difficult to communicate without arguments erupting. However, after a particularly heated disagreement, we both decided to take some time apart to cool off. Despite the tension between us, I was determined to mend our relationship and make things right.   When we finally came together again, we found that laughter was the key to breaking down the walls that had formed between us. As we shared jokes and lighthearted moments, the tension dissipated, and we were able to open up to each other in ways we never had before. Laughter brought us closer together, allowing us to move past our differences and strengthen our bond.  Through this experience, I learned the power of laughter in healing relationships and overcoming obstacles. Laughter has the ability to bring joy, understanding, and connection to even the most challenging situations. I am grateful for the laughter that has brought my mother and me closer together, and I believe that laughter truly has the power to heal and transform any relationship.
449	21274	8	3	Laughter is important in many ways. It can help solve arguments, improve health, and lighten awkward situations. Relationships benefit from laughter, as it prevents unnecessary feuds and tension. A personal experience highlights how laughter diffused a heated argument between friends, leading to a positive resolution. Not only does laughter help in resolving conflicts, but it also has significant effects on physical and mental health. It releases endorphins, boosts energy levels, and improves overall well-being. Learning to let go and laugh is essential for maintaining sanity and building connections with others. In essence, laughter is a powerful tool that brings people together, promotes emotional release, and contributes to a happier, healthier life. Letting go and laughing is the key to overcoming challenges and embracing a more positive outlook on life.
450	21275	8	3	"There is nothing more fun than going to a friend's house after church. It is like a comic relief in life after a rough message to the heart. In fact, going to your friend's house is even better when your friend is, to say lightly, kind of crazy like we are. Which for my story, could be interpreted as a bad thing, but for me it is nothing but a great thing. My friend and I have had some of the craziest times together, and the funny thing is we don't have to be doing anything illegal! It's such a bonus! We get our giggles from cleaning, playing with magnets, watching ""The Vampire Diaries,"" and much more. Strange? Yes. Fun? Too much. Let me tell you some things that have happened to my lovely friend and me.  First, like always, there is a Sunday and I'm heading over to my good friend's house. It's a very short walk, I leave my church by twelve and am there by twelve o' five. I'm up the steps, I'm to her door, I open it. Bark bark bark! ""Wake up, Sarah,"" she yells from another room. The schnauzer pup comes to greet me. He knows her better. The dog even eats rocks for goodness' sakes. But today, Sarah has her reasons to yell and be a little grouchy. ""I didn't realize how many dishes there were! My sister will freak if she knows you're here and they are not done."" ""Don't worry, I'll help you, and we'll get them done before your sister notices."" So, we are off. Sarah wonders the house frantically for dishes and putting them in the sink, while I work on putting the clean ones in the dishwasher away. We hear a sound from her sister's room, and we jump. Sarah's sister sounds like she is waking up, but then I snort and the noise ends. So we get back to work. When we got done, we slumped on the couch and looked at each other. We were tired and our hearts were still pounding. Then, her sister snorts again. We laugh hysterically, and her sister tells us to quiet down. Another day, I come over and we are both really hungry. We haven't eaten all day long and go into her kitchen. ""What do you wanna eat?"" Sarah asked me. ""I don't know. What do you wanna eat?"" I replied back. ""I don't know,"" the endless cycle. But then, our eyes cross paths with a bag of chocolate mint chocolate chips. I am delighted, ""Yes!"" we shout in joy of the idea. We get everything together and begin making pancakes. Now, neither of us are really ""great cooks,"" so when we were faced with ""who should flip the pancake,"" it was a no-brainer. ""You do it!"" ""No, you do it!"" We argued until I realized the pancake was about to burn, and so I did indeed ""do it"" for the sake of chocolate mint chocolate chip pancakes. But when I flipped it, it didn't really want to end its embrace with the hot pan and broke into pieces. Many ""stupid pancakes"" were said and spread all over her kitchen. But eventually, we ate and were happily full.  Then came another Sunday, and this time Sarah had a surprise. ""I found this really cool show!! It's called The Vampire Diaries!"" I thought for a moment, ""Really?"" She immediately dragged me to her computer where she had them downloaded. I thought to myself, ""Are these a cheap knock-off of Twilight?"" We began watching them and they did seem cool, I liked them a lot. The vampire brothers were in turmoil with each other, yelling and interrogating each other. ""I can't get enough of how her blood tastes!"" I paused, the non-existent thought in my head, ""Did he say?"" ""I can't get enough of how her blood tastes,"" Sarah looked at me. I crack up laughing, ""Oops. I thought he said, 'I can't get enough of how her butt tastes,' wow I feel bright!"" Both of us start laughing like crazy at the very stupid thing I had said. We laughed the rest of the night with just that. We finish watching a couple episodes and then my mom shows up. I get my coat and the rest of my stuff and head out the door. The dog is still barking, but Sarah comes out the door with me, we give each other a hug and say our goodbyes. ""I'll talk to you later, Sarah,"" I say heading down the steps. ""Yeah, see you at school tomorrow."" ""Sure. And see you next Sunday!"" I yell from the car window. She yells back, ""Definitely!"" There is nothing more fun"
451	21276	8	3	"""@PERSON1, @CAPS1 up! It's almost time for you to go to school!"" @CAPS2 mom yelled at me with my fuzzy hair, half-opened eyes, and a yawn. Today marked the first day of my new middle school, following our family's recent move to a new place. As I prepared for school, I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness, knowing I didn't know anyone at this new school.   Upon arrival, the school buzzed with energy as students either lamented the return of school days or rejoiced in reuniting with friends. I, on the other hand, felt overwhelmed by the hyperactivity around me and the unfamiliarity of the new environment. Navigating through the crowd, I finally found my classroom and settled in, drawing curious glances from my classmates as the ""new kid.""  The stern teacher's arrival set a serious tone, and I observed various reactions from my peers. One student, who had recently transferred from a private school, struggled to adapt to the public school setting. His disruptive behavior and confrontations with classmates eventually led to his disappearance from school, highlighting the importance of first impressions in forming relationships.  Learning from these experiences, I decided to approach my new school with a positive attitude. By putting on a smile and actively engaging with my classmates, I was able to break the ice and forge new friendships. The shift in my demeanor not only changed others' perceptions of me but also led to my emergence as a class leader.  Through this journey, I discovered the power of positivity and laughter in building connections and fostering a sense of belonging in a new environment. Embracing this mindset, I found joy in my interactions with classmates and took pride in my newfound role as a leader in the school community. As I reflected on the transformative impact of a simple smile, I realized the importance of approaching new experiences with an open heart and a willingness to connect with others."
452	21277	8	3	You know how people say that school is the most fun place to be during the day? Well, I have to agree because when I'm at school, I laugh all day long when I see my friend @PERSON1. We have fun together in our classes, always laughing in the halls and classrooms, sometimes even at people we don't know. Last year was a blast, but this year is not as much fun since @PERSON1 moved away. It's just @LOCATION1 and me now, and while we still have some fun, it's not the same without her. I remember when @PERSON1 first came to our school; she quickly became my best friend. She has a way of turning anyone's bad day into a good one, always spreading positivity. There are moments when she feels down, and @PERSON2 and I try to cheer her up, but sometimes she gets upset with us. Despite that, we always find a way to laugh together. One memorable day, we were painting in class and ended up making a mess, getting paint everywhere, including on each other. The laughter that followed stayed with us throughout the day, even spreading to my sister @LOCATION1 when we shared our candy-induced giggles. Those moments with @PERSON1 are the ones I cherish the most, where laughter is a constant companion. Whether it's our inside jokes or simply being together, we always find a reason to smile. @PERSON1 is the glue that holds us together, making every day at school a joy. Laughing with her and @LOCATION1 is something I'll always treasure, a reminder of the happiness found in simple moments with good friends.
453	21279	8	3	@DATE2 was a warm day, and @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 were on their way to a family reunion in @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2. The car was crammed with @CAPS3's mom, grandma, cousin, and the two girls, making it unbearably hot. Despite the air conditioning, the heat was intense. Finally stopping at a rest stop, they stumbled out of the car, seeking relief. @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 went to get a drink, drawing curious looks from onlookers. As @CAPS3 took a drink, a hilarious mishap occurred with the drinking fountain, leaving her drenched and sparking laughter between the two friends. Their day continued with more laughter and fun at the family reunion, culminating in a memorable moment by the pool. Sometimes, shared laughter is the best way to enjoy the good times.
454	21280	8	3	Laughter is an essential part of life, bringing joy and happiness to relationships. Personally, I cannot imagine a life without laughter, as it plays a significant role in shaping who I am. Laughter has been a cornerstone in my relationship with my dad, creating unforgettable moments filled with joy and tears of happiness. We used to watch shows together and laugh so hard that we would wake up the entire family. These precious moments of shared laughter have strengthened our bond over the years. Even though my dad has moved away, I hold onto these memories and cherish them dearly. Laughter has the power to change our attitudes and bring us closer together. It is a vital component of any relationship, providing a sense of light-heartedness and connection. Without laughter, life would be dull and relationships would lack depth. I am grateful for the laughter that my dad has brought into my life, teaching me the importance of finding joy in the simplest moments. Laughter truly is the best medicine for the soul, and I will always treasure the laughter-filled memories shared with my dad.
455	21281	8	3	"Laughter: the Key to Sibling Relationships  Laughter, they say, is the best medicine. We all know that every relationship needs a heaping dosage of medicine every once in a while. My younger brother, Jake, and I have a pretty good relationship. Sometimes we argue, other times we can get along like we are the best of friends. When we were going to the same school together, I would go out of my way to say hi to my brother. Almost every time I would get shut down and ignored, by my own brother. Jake is going to be a freshman next year and I will be a junior, so we will be attending high school together.   One night, at the dinner table, my family was discussing what the change would be like with both children in high school. I brought up the fact that Jake never says hi to me or even waves at me and how I didn't really appreciate it. Somehow we got to talking about how he would be known as Jake's brother because I am so awesome. The next thing I know Jake blurted out, ""yeah, Sarah, I'm going to embarrass you because I am so butt-ugly."" My parents and I looked at each other and instantly started laughing and couldn't stop!   When we had semi regained our composure, we asked Jake why he would say something like that about himself. Jake said he didn't really know why he said that, he thought it would be funny. Yes, Jake, it was! It was my turn to pray for dinner that night. As much and as hard as I tried to compose myself long enough to pray, I couldn't do it. Every time I thought I had pulled myself together again, I would start busting up yet again. After a while, my parents asked me what was wrong. I replied, ""I was going to ask God to make Jake more beautiful so he wouldn't embarrass me.""   I started laughing so hard that I was crying. I couldn't see anything because the tears had blurred my vision. Now, after what I said, it took me twice as long to control my laughter. My parents calmed down before I did, so my mom had to pray because I couldn't contain myself. The whole time my mom was praying, I had to clamp my hand over my mouth to keep from laughing. My grip was so hard that it made my teeth hurt. That night I think my whole family got a few spoonfuls of medicine. Probably enough to last us another week or so. I can't wait until I get 'sick' again and need another serving of medicine!   Laughter truly is the key to sibling relationships, helping us bond and create unforgettable memories together."
456	21284	8	3	The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in @ORGANIZATION1 is the shortest distance between two people. They express happiness, belonging and they let you forget your worries for a few seconds. Who does not like to laugh? I will be writing a true story in which laughter will be one important part. My story will be about myself, who is an exchange student and @CAPS1 in high school, and how I got to know my today's best friend.  It all started in the morning of my first day in a @CAPS1 high school. I remember clearly how nervous and excited I was. I was not able to focus on my breakfast because my mind was full of thoughts and questions. How is the school going to look like? And what are the students going to think about me? I have never been in the @LOCATION1 before and I have never been an exchange student. Because of all the worries, which were running through my mind, I did not even notice that it was already time to leave the house. This moment which I have been envision for month, finally arrived. My host-mom said good-bye to me and wished me a great day. Now I was totally by myself. I walked in the high school and went to my first class: @CAPS3. On the way to the classroom, people stared at me, but nobody said a word. Have you ever felt like you are alone even though hundreds of people are around you? This is exactly the way I felt in that moment. My first class went well, as well as my second class: @CAPS4. During @CAPS4, some guys asked me if we have cars in @LOCATION2. Although this question seemed really stupid to me, I answered nicely with yes. My next period was drama. I had trouble finding the drama room, but luckily I met a girl on the way who showed me where I was supposed to go.  Her name was @PERSON1 and she told me that she moved here last year from @LOCATION3. From the first moment I saw her, she seemed really nice to me. On the way to the classroom, she asked me questions about the difference of @LOCATION2 and the @LOCATION1. She also appeared quite interested to me. While our drama teacher was preparing a scene, we continued talking. I had the strange feeling that I have known her forever. The whole nervousness I had at the beginning of the day was gone. I told her that some guys asked me if we have cars in @LOCATION2. She answered that they asked her the exact same question, but about @LOCATION3. Suddenly, she started to laugh. It was a happy and friendly laugh and soon I started to laugh as well. It did not feel awkward for me, sitting next to a girl I just met and we were laughing so hard. I knew that this moment, this laughter was special. I felt so happy and belonged and it let me forget all the fear and doubt for a few seconds. What I did not know in this moment, though, was that she will become my best friend. This was my true story, in which laughter was an important part. It is not easy to be @CAPS1 in school, especially if you are an exchange student. My story showed that a laughter is able to change people's thoughts and to short the distance between two people. In my case, it made me feel more comfortable and confident, which was the start of a great relationship, as well as an awesome time in the @LOCATION1.

457	21285	8	3	High school years are tough for many teenagers if you don't have a friend that is always willing to put a smile on your face during the worst times. I had a great friend named @PERSON1. She had that special power of making me laugh no matter what. We stopped being each other's friends around the end of our sophomore year. It was both our faults for letting our friendship come to a close. It wasn't like we made enemies with each other. But we didn't end our friendship nicely and peacefully.  The beginning of my junior year came, and I had forgotten why we weren't friends anymore. If I couldn't remember why we weren't friends anymore, then obviously it was a silly thing to fight about. But words were exchanged, making it harder to reconcile. I didn't want to be the first to apologize. As days passed, I didn't see @PERSON1 around, and I started to worry. However, on the first day of my junior year, she walked into my last class. I was relieved to see her, but our unresolved issues lingered between us.  As the semester went by, I saw her every day, but we still didn't talk. She seemed to have moved on, making new friends and leaving our past behind. Although we crossed paths in cheerleading and with mutual friends, we remained distant. One night, feeling alone and in need of a friend, I gathered the courage to write her an email, expressing my regrets and longing for her friendship.  The next day at lunch, @PERSON1 surprised me by sitting next to me. She brought up a funny memory, and we laughed together, breaking the tension that had been lingering between us. We caught up on each other's lives, and the laughter flowed freely once again. I was grateful to have my funny best friend back, and I realized the importance of acknowledging my mistakes and making amends. Our friendship was rekindled, stronger than before, and the joy of laughter filled our days once more.
458	21286	8	3	Laughter is a crucial aspect of life as it brings happiness and joy. In my personal experience, my friend @CAPS1 plays a significant role in bringing laughter into my life, especially during times of sadness and stress. Whether it's through tickling me relentlessly, telling funny jokes, or engaging in video games that I struggle with, his efforts never fail to make me laugh and lift my spirits.   Whenever I find myself feeling down, @CAPS1's tickling antics never fail to elicit uncontrollable laughter from me. His ability to sense when I am feeling sad and use tickling as a way to cheer me up is truly remarkable. The sheer joy and laughter that come from these tickle sessions never fail to bring a smile to my face.  Moreover, @CAPS1 has a knack for lightening the mood with his humorous jokes and quirky questions. His ability to find humor in everyday situations and share them with me never fails to brighten my day. Whether it's a witty comment about the weather or a humorous observation about a movie we're watching, his jokes always succeed in making me laugh.  Additionally, engaging in video games with @CAPS1, where I often struggle with the controls and gameplay, never fails to bring laughter into our interactions. Despite my lack of skill in certain games, @CAPS1's playful teasing and ability to effortlessly navigate the games always lead to moments of shared laughter and enjoyment.  In conclusion, the laughter that @CAPS1 brings into my life through tickling, jokes, and video games is invaluable. His efforts to make me laugh during times of sadness and stress serve as a reminder of the importance of laughter in fostering happiness and well-being. Through his humor and playful nature, @CAPS1 plays a crucial role in bringing joy and laughter into my life, which ultimately contributes to my overall happiness and well-being.
459	21287	8	3	For the longest time, I never thought I could find happiness. It seemed like every time I tried, something or someone would come along to snatch it away from me. Whether it was being dumped, cheated on, or losing a close friend, disappointment seemed to follow me. But then, unexpectedly, my wish for someone to truly listen, care, and understand came true. And that someone was Person2.  Person2 had a way about him that drew me in. He was a great listener, always there to offer support and make things right when they felt wrong. What I cherished most about him was his ability to bring a smile to my face even in my darkest moments. Despite the physical distance between us and our limited interactions, he had a knack for making me happier than I had been in years. It was then that I realized the power of laughter in bridging the gap between two people.  As a freshman, I was navigating the complexities of high school life, yearning for popularity, friendship, and romance. My focus often revolved around boys, and when I first laid eyes on Person2 in math class, I was immediately captivated. Through a series of ups and downs, from dating to breaking up, we eventually found our way back to each other as best friends. It was during these moments of vulnerability and shared experiences that our bond grew stronger.  While my previous boyfriend had not been the best partner, Person2 was the opposite. He not only listened and cared but also shared his own struggles, making me feel understood and valued. Our late-night conversations, filled with tears and laughter, solidified our connection. Despite the challenges we faced, our ability to support each other through thick and thin only strengthened our friendship.  Looking back on the transformation I've undergone since meeting Person2, I can't help but wonder how different my life would be without him. Laughter, it seems, has been the thread weaving our friendship together from the beginning. What started as strangers soon blossomed into a deep bond, founded on shared experiences, understanding, and, of course, laughter. In the end, I've learned that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people, bringing us closer and keeping us connected through life's challenges and joys.
460	21288	8	3	Sometimes, when life throws me lemons, instead of making lemonade, I pucker up my lips at the thought of how sour they are, and I frown. Although laughing did not automatically make my new school a fun and welcoming place, it made it a little more bearable. Laughter truly is the best medicine, no matter what the illness or problem is, and it can make two strangers into friends almost immediately.
461	21289	8	3	"I once learned something very valuable in school. I didn't learn it in a classroom, or even from a book. I learned this lesson in a hallway near the copy room. One may be prompted to ask, what kind of lesson could you possibly learn in a hall? All I will tell you is this, it's not one I'll be forgetting any time soon.  In order to completely understand what exactly I was doing roaming the halls and learning lessons, you're going to need a little bit of background. I was in my third period class; which was leadership at the time. Leadership isn't really your conventional class from the perspective of an outsider. Kids running about the school like loose mice can give off an appearance of impropriety, but an appearance is all it was. We weren't doing anything bad, it's just that most of the time you would have to leave the classroom in order to do what needed to be done that day.  Another girl from the class, and myself were working on a special project. We had to retrieve something very important from my car. We waited for the teacher to finish talking and asked if we could go, he said yes. We walked out the double doors of the classroom and into the main hallway, we then proceeded on down toward the parking lot.  After I had said bye to a former classmate, the teacher poked her head out the door and said to me, ""I hear you don't like my class!"" I must have been as red as a tomato. I just stood there with the dumbest look on my face. The lesson I learned that day was to never insult an alligator until you've crossed the river. Or at least make sure the alligator isn't in the next room. Especially if the alligator teaches your next class."
462	21290	8	3	Laughter is an essential element of relationships and human connections. It has the power to break down barriers, bring people closer together, and create a sense of warmth and comfort. In my own experiences, laughter has played a significant role in forming and strengthening my bonds with others. Whether it was breaking the ice with a new acquaintance or overcoming sadness and anger with a friend, laughter has always been a powerful tool for building connections. Without laughter, relationships would lack the same level of intimacy and trust. It truly is the shortest distance between two people, bridging gaps and fostering a sense of closeness. In essence, laughter is a vital component of human interaction and plays a crucial role in shaping our relationships and experiences.
463	21291	8	3	"My friend @ORGANIZATION2 received a random phone call in the @TIME1. It was his friends from high school there were three of them. The weird thing about that is they haven't talked much since high school. Surprised @ORGANIZATION2 asked what was going on and how they were doing: assuming they were in jail or something in that matter. Instead the friends replied and told him how they was doing and then told @ORGANIZATION2 they wanted to go on a road trip. @ORGANIZATION2 thought to himself ""why the heck are you telling me about this"", and then said cool. what do you need from me? The friend replied saying he needed @ORGANIZATION2 to plan the trip because they did not have computers and they couldn't read maps. at the end of the phone call @ORGANIZATION2 finally said he would help and plan the trip out. Then asked the friend were he would want to go for this trip, The friend replied I don't know i wanna see a professional baseball game and were ever @ORGANIZATION1 land is i would love to go there. A week and a half went by later @ORGANIZATION2 called his friends back to tell them the plans. Proudly he said after his hard work of planning for them. its a ten day trip for you guys starting in @LOCATION1 then driving down to @LOCATION2's @ORGANIZATION1 and on the way down and back hit up (watch) a game from all five of the professional baseball teams down in @LOCATION2, then go to six flags another amusement park like @ORGANIZATION1. The friends replied what do you mean you guys? You are coming with us. @ORGANIZATION2 was super surprised and told them :you guys haven't talked to me in about five years and then you randomly want to go on a road trip with me he said sounding kind of confused. The friends replied well we need your car and we don't know how to drive and again we don't know how to read maps. Thinking hard about the situation @ORGANIZATION2 finally caved in and told them yes but then gave conditions. He split up tasks for his friends so he wouldn't be stuck with all of the work.For example he gave one of the guys the task of finding hotels and places to stay, another was finding gas stations, and the other friend had to find all the restaurants they were going to eat at. The trip had started and for @ORGANIZATION2 the vacation was much needed and unexpectedly fun and relaxing. At lest for now. Everything was going through and working according to plan they hit up and joyfully watched four of the five baseball games and had a great time, then @ORGANIZATION1 land went above and beyond expectation, and even six flags was exiting and brought @ORGANIZATION2 and his friends back to feeling like they were in the good old high school days.The only slight bit of worry for trouble was one of the friends became behind on his task of finding hotels and places to stay for everyone. the friend had the nights were they stayed at a relatives or friends lived mostly setup. but for the hotels they were kind of last minuet. Last few days before heading back plans were still going accordingly.They just had one more event. the giants baseball game, then stay with there old high school buddy who moved down to @LOCATION2. making sure they would have a place to stay for sure @ORGANIZATION2 asked the friend in charge of finding places to stay. The friend replayed with a""no i haven't talked to him yet. i will call him later.""this made @ORGANIZATION2 a little uneasy, so he told his friend no call him now.the friend did.There other friend picked up to bring bad news he was back in @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION2 thought to him self I knew this trip was to good to be true. On the @TIME1 of the baseball game things felt rushed. @ORGANIZATION2 and his friends had to leave really early because the traffic in @LOCATION2 is so random and bad. Mean while @ORGANIZATION2 for got to use the restroom and two hours into the trip to the giants game things started to take a bad turn. @ORGANIZATION2 had to go bad. But his friends kept him going saying the traffic is good we need to keep going. which @ORGANIZATION2 listened and kept going. Then traffic came to a stand still. @ORGANIZATION2 was going to go in his pants!so he pulled off and drove down the side of the high way surprised he didn't get pulled over he miraculously ended up at giants stadium then he saw a portable potty he pulled over and raced to it,it was locked. @ORGANIZATION2 looked around and saw another one. he takes off as fast as he"
464	21292	8	3	Laughter has the power to transform any situation, serving as a form of communication that transcends language barriers. Through various experiences, I have come to appreciate the ability of laughter to connect people, whether they speak different languages or come from different cultures. One memorable example is my time spent with an exchange student named @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3. Her infectious laughter and joyful personality made every moment spent with her a delight. Whether we were doing chores, putting on skits, or touring a serious location, laughter was always present, bringing us closer together and creating lasting memories. The simple act of laughing with someone can truly make a difference in how we feel, reducing stress and bringing a sense of happiness to our lives. In the end, laughter is not just a reaction, but a powerful tool that can bring people together and uplift our spirits.
465	21293	8	3	What's a genuine laughter? Would me and my best friend ever stop laughing? That would be a negative. I truly believe laughter is essential to friendship. What kind of friendship is it if two friends never share a laugh? People who don't laugh probably don't have true friends. I feel sorry for them. I can't imagine life without laughter. My friends and I laugh all the time, especially when I'm with my best friend. When we're together, it's non-stop laughter. We have countless inside jokes that only we find funny, and they never fail to make us burst into laughter. If we never laughed, our friendship would suffer. I'm grateful for the laughter in my life, and I can't imagine a friendship without it.
466	21294	8	3	@ORGANIZATION1 When considering a relationship, laughter often plays a significant role. Whether it is sharing moments of merriment or using laughter to connect and understand each other better, it can truly enhance the bond between partners. Laughing together creates a sense of enjoyment that makes spending time with each other more appealing. This shared laughter builds a stronger connection, allowing couples to have a better understanding of each other. As a result, relationships benefit from the joy, connection, and increased quality time that laughter brings. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the importance of laughter in fostering a stronger and more fulfilling relationship. So, the next time you find yourself laughing with your partner, remember the positive impact it has on your relationship.
467	21295	8	3	"It has been said that ""Laughter is the spark of the soul."" I agree with this statement wholeheartedly. Laughter can do wonders for the soul; it truly does ignite a spark. And once that spark has been ignited watch out, it will burn like a wild fire. As the fire burns it will go on a rampage throughout the body. First its that uncontrollably smile that brings an ache to your cheeks, then the butterflies that marvelously flutters through your stomach, next comes the tingling sensation deep within your toes, and last but not least the tears of joy come streaming from your eyes. Had these feelings before? That's the rampage I'm talking about; let the fire burn. Laughter is an extraordinary thing--it can turn an awkward or embarrassing situation into a much more relaxed one. Unfortunately, in my story about laughter I wasn't the one laughing...About three weeks ago while my sister was at gymnastics, my mom, my best friend, and I went to visit my grandparents and to see how the work on our new barn was progressing. After spending some time at their house it was time to pick up my sister. My grandpa ever so kindly offered to go pick her up but then I mentioned that my friend and I could go do it. As we were driving to town in my grandpa's truck, everything seemed fine; just another ordinary day. After we had arrived at the gymnastics center we headed inside and waited for my sister to finish. However, as we were walking out my sister said she was hungry and asked me to stop at a fast-food restaurant. I pulled up to the order board and ordered her food. The lady then asked me to drive around to the first window to pay. After doing as she asked, I received my change, put the truck in drive, and began pulling forward--when all of the sudden I heard a loud crunch! My heart dropped as I looked in my side mirror. I hadn't pulled out far enough and had hit the side of the building. Now before I go on I just want you to know that I have been driving since I was about seven and am usually a very good driver. But hey, that first crash happens to all of us, right? Well back to my story, as I was driving back to my grandparents' house it took everything I had not to cry. After we arrived back at their house my friend and I ran into the house and got a cup of hot water, soap, toothbrushes, and a pad. We scrubbed and scrubbed until all the red paint from the side of the building was gone. The dent didn't look so bad once the paint was gone and the truck was back to white. I was absolutely terrified to tell my grandparents about the truck! After waiting about an hour I finally got up the courage to tell them what had happened. My grandpa put on his shoes and we went out to look at the damage. As I started crying because I felt so bad, my grandpa just started laughing and reminding me that it was just a truck and it can be fixed. The fact that he just laughed really made the situation a lot less stressful. Laughter brings people together and creates bonds that will last a lifetime. So no matter if you're laughing about something that makes you happy or a situation that maybe isn't so good, let the fire burn."
468	21296	8	3	School had just gotten out. It was the summer before my senior year. We had been planning this camping trip for the past few weeks. We were so excited about it that that's all we could talk about. This would be the first camping trip we had been on without our parents. It would be the best four days of our lives. Sand, the beach, friends, quads, no parents; how could it possibly get any better than that? We invited as many people as we could think of. The more people that were there, the more fun it would be. My friend and I did all the shopping the day before. We got lots of yummy stuff to make. After we got home from shopping we had to load all the bikes in the toy hauler. We each took two bikes, and we took our friend's boyfriends bikes over so he could just drive over after work. We were up almost all night packing, trying to figure out the perfect outfits to wear each day. It was going to be a nice weekend at the coast, we could already tell. It was the middle of summer, the sun was shining and it was beautiful outside. The next morning we got up and double checked everything to make sure we had the most important things like flags, helmets, clothes, and those sorts of things. Then it was off to get gas and finally head to the coast! Once we got on the road the music was blaring and the windows were down, just like always. The trip there seemed to take forever because we were so excited to get there. When we finally did get there, there was a really cute guy setting up his tent in one of our camp sights. I asked my friend who he was and she told me it was her boyfriend's best friend, Jake. We parked the toy hauler and got out to unload and he came over to help. The second I layed my eyes on him, I knew he had to be mine. In the next hour or so we got all unloaded and set up. By then many more people had shown up.We helped everyone else get all their things unpacked and set up so we could go on a ride. Our first trip out on the sand was absolutely perfect. It was warm enough to ride in t-shirts. We didn't stay out for long though. People started to get hungry so we went back to camp, made dinner and sat around the fire. There was probably twenty or so of us sitting around the fire, talking about everything from the stars in the sky, to the sand on the ground. Every time I would look up I noticed that Jake was looking at me. He would just smile, and look away like it was nothing at all. As usual, my friend started telling us about a funny incident that had happened to her in the past (she was such a klutz.)We all started laughing as she was showing us her bruises from falling down the stairs. Jake and I locked eyes. Later that night Jake asked me if I wanted to go on a walk. We walked all the way on the sand trail out to the dunes, and all the way to the top of a giant dune called Sunset Hill. When we got to the top we sat there, staring at the stars, talking. We realized we had lots of things in common. We liked to do all the same things, and we had the ability to make each other laugh. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. If you can make someone laugh, it means a lot. No one has ever been able to make me laugh the way that he does. I never knew that laughing could bring two people together the way that it did that one night at the dunes.
469	21297	8	3	It all started at the playground when me, my friend, and two girls from school decided to go on an adventure to the woods. Little did we know, we would encounter a mysterious creature living in the trees. Despite the initial fright, we managed to have a fun and memorable day filled with laughter and donuts at a nearby deli. It was truly an unforgettable experience that we will always cherish.
470	21298	8	3	One stormy winter night my girlfriend and I wanted to go to dinner, so we did. When we got there the restaurant was almost full so we got a table fast. While waiting for food we started talking about our friends and having a good time. I then said something really mean about someone she knew and did not know it. She got really upset and stormed out of the place leaving me alone. I finally got up and went home after paying to bill for the food I did not eat. The next mourning I got up and started cleaning up the house, mowing the yard and doing all my chores. She came over to my house and apologized for what she did, so I apologized for saying something mean about one of her friends. I told her that I will call her after my chores where done and go out for lunch. Finally I finished the chores, took a shower, and got dressed. I then called her and told her to meet me at the restaurant of her choice. About an hour later she shows up finds me waiting for at the table farthest from the door. She then sat down and asked if I was going to be mean again. I said that I will be nice and considerate today and not be mean. I then proceeded to tell her about a funny memory. She laughed and tell told me one. This went on until we left. Up until she broke up with me for my friend, laughter was to one thing that held us together. Laughter truly is the best medicine for a wounded relationship, helping us to heal and find joy in each other's company.
471	21299	8	3	Laughter is indeed the key to happiness, and having friends who can make you laugh is a true blessing. I remember a time when my friends and I had a memorable day filled with laughter at my house. We started with a game of backyard football, where our attempts at catching the ball as linemen turned into a hilarious spectacle. Later, we engaged in a playful battle with junk around the property, followed by a comical attempt at making a scary movie. Despite our lack of acting skills, we found ourselves laughing uncontrollably at every scene. The night ended with a spooky surprise from my sister, causing us to jump in fear before bursting into laughter once again. These moments of shared laughter strengthened our bond as friends, creating lasting memories that we still cherish. Laughter truly brings people closer together, and I am grateful for the joy and connection it has brought to my life.
472	21300	8	3	"Bright blue waves of morning light streamed over the hilltops as the waking sun began to rise to its daily position. The crisp, chill air roused the slumbering birds. Soon, the dusk setting transformed into a vibrant morning where the birds chattered with their melodious tone of song. Gentle breezes swept through the trees causing the leaves to dance. The green grass appeared to flow like an ocean while the cracked gravestones remained stationary; just as anchored ships at sea. Any spectator would agree that this particular graveyard scene presents a prodigious feeling; however, when one catches a glimpse of the stoical man who stands before the silent tombstone, the spectator's heart fills with empathy and despair. Motionless, young @PERSON1 stood before the tombstone. The gentle, but quick breeze began to accelerate into a harsh wind. @PERSON1's teary eyes and wet face began to dry. Although the windy weather was not uncommon for @PERSON2, @LOCATION1, a long-lost memory interrupted @PERSON1's thoughts for an unknown reason. For a split moment, his mind drifted back to sixteen years ago when @CAPS5 was still alive. His eyes closed as the wind began to calm. He could nearly hear her voice. ""@CAPS1, I would like you to meet someone,"" @CAPS5 yelled from upstairs. It was @DATE1, and six-year-old @PERSON1 came zealously running up the stairs. Breathing rapidly, he arrived at the top of the creaky staircase and skipped to his parent's room. ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3?"" he asked as he began to turn the cold, brass doorknob. He opened the door just a crack and peered into the room. His blue eyes sparkled with curiosity. He observed how the midwife gracefully glided to his mother's bedside to prop her head up with another pillow. His attention then shifted to his father who was sitting on the edge of the bed cradling a small bundle of pink blankets. ""@CAPS4 hello to your new baby sister,"" said @PERSON1's mother. Still clutching the brass knob, @PERSON1 pushed open the door with the palm of his left hand. The door moaned as @PERSON1 began to place the tip of his @CAPS7 light-up sneaker onto the roan-colored carpet in his parent's bedroom. Carefully and cautiously, he advanced to the foot of his parent's bed where his father sat. He stood in front of his father with wide eyes. ""@CAPS5 was born less than an hour ago,"" said his father. @PERSON1 then looked to the heap of pink blankets. He nervously reached out his clammy hand and gently pinched the top layer of blankets to uncover the face of his little sister. All was silent except for the wind outside. Inch-by-inch, he slowly began to peel back the top blanket; but before @PERSON1 could even finish this task, the newborn baby let out a startling exhale. @PERSON1 lurched back and slammed against the bedroom door. His father jumped because of @PERSON1's reaction, but was careful not to wake the baby. @PERSON1 felt as if his heart was about to jump out of his chest. Wide-eyed and out of breath, he looked to his mother. To @PERSON1's surprise, he found his mother quite amused. The corners of her mouth began to curl up and a slight giggle leaked out. Soon enough, both his parents were immersed in hypnotic laughter; their bodies shaking rhythmically. @PERSON1 began to relax and smiled at his mother. ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5 scare you a little?"" @CAPS5 asked. His father chimed in, I would think so!"" The three of them laughed for the next five minutes while the midwife simply smiled and the baby lay sound asleep in the strong arms of her father. @PERSON1 could feel the overwhelming essence of reality rushing back to him; just as the wind flowed through his brown hair. He missed her. He cried for her. He wished @CAPS5 could have won the ferocious battle fought between the human body and cancer; but, @CAPS5 didn't. Now @CAPS5 was gone. He would never see his mother on @LOCATION2 again. Although this memory succeeded in bringing him sadness, it failed to push @PERSON1 into depression. Instead, he suddenly recalled an ancient saying: ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @PERSON1 then, suddenly realized how unbelievably close he was to his precious mother. He possessed eight years of memories made with his mother and many of these memories involved laughter. @PERSON1 tilted his head to the sun as tears of joy rushed down his face. Now he understood the fact that love is never dependent on time. Granted, he only knew"
473	21301	8	3	I was selling some cookie dough for school and went to this elderly guy's house. Despite my efforts to raise money for the school, he initially showed no interest. However, as we started talking, I managed to make him laugh. It seemed like my humor resonated with him, as he eventually changed his mind and decided to buy some cookie dough. Laughter played a crucial role in influencing his decision, showcasing the power of humor in connecting with others and achieving goals.
474	21302	8	3	We all understand the benefits of laughter. I believe that laughter is an important part of life that everybody should experience. The time that I remember most where I have laughed and enjoyed myself was when my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION3.It all started with @DATE1. We were opening our presents when my @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 told me and my siblings that they had one last present for us but it was a surprise; in order to know what it was we had to find it. So they told us as a hint, that it was someplace that we sleep. As soon as they told us that I knew exactly where to look, our bedrooms. So we raced up the stairs to our bedrooms and looked around. To our delight, sitting on our nightstands where four packets full of info about @ORGANIZATION1. We were so excited and happy. My little sister said that it was the best @DATE1 present ever. We ran down the stairs, hugged @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, and told them that they are the best @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 ever. What made it even better was that we would miss school. Then we found out that the trip was scheduled for the month of @DATE2. So we had to wait for four months. Those four months were the longest of my life. Four months later it was finally time to go. We had to wake up around @NUM1 a.m because our plane was scheduled to depart at @TIME1. Before we left our house I asked my @CAPS1 if I could bring my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 with me so that I was not bored on the plane. She told me that I could, only if I share it with my little brother. Once we had finally left home I started feeling like I had butterflies in my stomach. I guess it was because something fun and exciting was about to happen to me. When we got to the airport it was @NUM2 so we had about an hour and fifty-five minutes till the plane left. Luckily I had my @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Since my brother was only six years old he easily gets bored, I let him play my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 till we had to board. When it was finally time to board one of my sisters had to use the restroom. My @CAPS1 ended up taking her while my @CAPS2 stayed with us and boarded the plane .My other sister did not like that my @CAPS1 was not on the plane with us yet. So my @CAPS2 told me to keep my brother and sister in their seats while he went o find my @CAPS1 and sister. Five minutes later they all came back, and just in time too. The plane had just finished refueling and we were on the way to the runway. One of my favorite parts of being on a plane is when it's speeding down the runway at amazing speed. And when we finally reached the speed we needed to be at, we launched in to the air and my stomach felt like it was in the open air. My little brother is holding on to my hand so tight that his little knuckles turn white. It gave me the impression that he was scared so I told him to just think about it as a really fast car that goes over a bump. That seemed to help a lot because he started laughing when the plane left the ground. He said that it was fun and wanted to do it again. I reminded him that once we got to @ORGANIZATION1 we would go on all the rides that we want. Three hours later we arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. Once we got off the plane we went to pick up our bags from the baggage claim. My @CAPS2 went to see when the next @CAPS11 @CAPS12 was scheduled to arrive. As he came back the @CAPS12 was just coming down the road. The @CAPS12 was blue with @CAPS11 characters. The driver showed us a lot of cool things and places. The @CAPS15 that we were staying in was called The @CAPS14 @CAPS15. It had a huge pool shaped like a guitar. Once we were settled in we went in to @LOCATION1. It was really fun because my sisters and I got all the @CAPS11 characters autographs and pictures. My favorite one was @CAPS17 because he reminds me of myself. We got to stay in the park for about three hours when we started getting hungry so we left and went back to the @CAPS15. After dinner we went down to the pool to go swimming. It seemed to be funner than @ORGANIZATION
475	21304	8	3	My best friend and I have been friends since third grade. We've shared many laughs, memories, and tears, yet to this day we're still closer than ever. One of the key reasons we've been able to stay friends for so long is because we make each other laugh. We joke around and we make any boring time into a good one. It started in third grade when she asked me to play with her on the playground, and from that day forward, we hung out as often as we could. In fifth grade, we declared ourselves best friends, and our bond only grew stronger as we shared many laughs and moments together. Throughout middle school, we may have grown apart at times, but our ability to make each other laugh always brought us back together. Today, we are as close as ever, laughing together every weekend and making each other's lives brighter. Laughter has been the foundation of our friendship, and I am grateful to have her as my best friend. Laughing together has not only helped us become friends but has also strengthened our relationship through all the challenges we have faced. I hope that we will continue to share laughter and stay friends for the rest of our lives.
476	21306	8	3	"Don't speak, laugh. I love my little brother. We're four years apart in age but from the way we act, you'd think we were twins. No matter how close we are, we still are siblings, and we still fight. Usually, they're just petty little fights that we get over in a matter of seconds, but this one was one I could not back down from. I beat him at a game of tennis.  It was a warm afternoon, and my brother and I had just gotten back from school. We usually relax for a little before we do our homework by challenging each other at playing games. ""You cheated,"" he said firmly. ""No, I didn't!"" I snapped back. I could tell that he was getting really upset about this, but I didn't care. I wasn't going to let him win this one. ""Yes, you did. You always do! It's not fair."" ""I didn't this time."" My brother was telling the truth. There are times when I cheat by distracting him during a game, but I won fair and square. ""You're just mad because you lost. Get over yourself and take it like a man."" That's all I had to say to make him throw down his controller and make him run upstairs crying.  ""What did you do to your brother?"" my mom yelled. ""I beat him at a game and now he's mad."" I knew he would do that and report me to my mom hoping that she would save him and get me in trouble. ""It's just a game. You can't win every time."" ""It's just not fair!"" he said before slamming the door of his room. Sweet, sweet victory. I love when I win. But of course, that little feeling of guilt of making my little brother cry came over me, so I went to him and apologized.  ""I'm sorry for making you cry. It's just a game though. You win some and you lose some. Don't be mad."" I gave the most heartfelt apology I could think of at the moment. ""Go away. I don't want to talk to you."" Away? I walked all the way upstairs to tell him I was sorry for something that I didn't even need to say sorry for, and he tells me to go away? Oh well. After processing what had just happened all that could come out of my mouth was, ""Fine."" And I walked off.  The rest of the day went on. We passed each other many times without even acknowledging one another. I couldn't believe that he was this upset about the game. It was probably one of the longest periods of times he didn't talk to me by choice. I started feeling really bad, even sad that he wasn't talking to me. I decided to try talking to him again. Only problem was, he was downstairs playing the game again and I was upstairs this time. I came out of my room and started to walking down the stairs. He could hear me coming, so he turned down the volume of the game.  ""Listen. Are you really not going to talk to me over a game I-"" Whoosh! All of a sudden, I was sliding down the stairs. Crash! He was laughing at me! I landed at the bottom of the staircase and started to laugh too. We were both laughing! That's all we needed to start up conversation again. Just a little laugh."
477	21307	8	3	Laughter is an essential part of life that should not be taken for granted. It has numerous health benefits and can bring joy and positivity to your daily routine. Whether it's sharing jokes with family at the dinner table or watching a comedy show, finding moments to laugh can significantly improve your overall well-being. It may not solve all your problems, but it can certainly help you cope with them better. So, remember to laugh often and cherish those moments of joy with your loved ones. After all, a good laugh can truly be the best medicine for the soul.
478	21308	8	3	During the @DATE1 I decided to join @ORGANIZATION2, I raised a market pig and was determined to sell it at the @LOCATION1. Raising a pig was time consuming and hard work. Without patience, great teachers, and having fun I wouldn't have been able to do it. That @DATE1 I had some great experiences and some of them, not so great. This was my first time being involved with @ORGANIZATION2, also my first time raising a pig. I never thought that I would have so many awkward moments. One of my awkward, yet funny moments happened when I was shoveling pig poop with my friend @ORGANIZATION1. This was also @ORGANIZATION1's first time being involved with @ORGANIZATION2 and raising a pig. @ORGANIZATION1 and I were just trying to hurry and get our work finished so that we could go back to our homes and shower. Turns out I was in too much of a hurry. My boots sank into the mud and poop which made me lose my balance, I tried using the shovel to catch myself but it was too late. I was covered in pig poop and mud from head to toe, I had fallen in it. @ORGANIZATION1 and I looked at each other for what seemed to be two minutes, but was only about six seconds, then we busted out in laughter. After our laughing was under control she helped me get up and we went to go find our agriculture teacher @PERSON1. When @PERSON1 saw my once blue pants now brown, he couldn't help but laugh at me. He got his camera out and took some pictures of me that are very embarrassing but make myself and others smile. After all the joking, laughing, and pictures were finished @PERSON1 gave some old clothes to wear for my ride home. I had to roll the window down because the car got pretty smelly. When I arrived home, I headed straight for the shower. This is an experience I will never forget. If I didn't have friends around me I don't think I would have thought of the experience as something positive and funny. Because @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 were there to help me and laugh with me, I got some pretty fun memories out of that @DATE1 raising a pig. Without the laughter it might have been a little negative, I might have been mad, or embarrassed, or sad. Laughter is an important element to have in a positive healthy lifestyle. The camaraderie and humor shared with friends during challenging or embarrassing situations can turn what could be negative experiences into cherished memories.
479	21309	8	3	"Some people say that laughter is the best medicine. I strongly agree with these people, because I believe that any funny situation in which there is laughter can put anyone into a better mood. Just taking the time to laugh at something or yourself is something that every person should do. Having a good time with friends and family and laughing with them is truly something to be grateful for. I have had several situations filled with laughter that I am grateful for. My two best friends, Sarah and Emily, and I, well let's just say there is hardly a time when we are together that there is not laughter involved. So many times we've laughed at ourselves and each other I've lost count. It's so amazing to have these two great friends to laugh along with. There are so many times that we have laughed at each other I don't even know where to begin. One time we were all at Sarah's house and we were playing hide and seek in her back yard. It was my turn to be the seeker. I came out of the house after counting to 20. As I searched the yard I found everyone eventually, except Emily. As I wandered the yard looking for her, the others started helping me look for her. We could hear her laughter coming from somewhere, but we couldn't tell where. She started talking to us saying things like ""over here!"" or ""this way!"". After getting frustrated and giving up, she finally revealed herself... on the roof of her house! We all laughed so hard, not even knowing how she got up there in the first place. Another time we had gone to pizza for my sister's birthday party. We went into the arcade room with the money we had ready to play some games. We told ourselves to avoid the claw machine, because we knew we would not want to stop and waste all of our money. But of course Sarah had to try it just once. Next thing we knew, we were using all of our money trying to win at that game. We each eventually won something, screaming, cheering, and laughing hysterically like kindergartners. We had also played a race car game at least ten times and we were running out of games to play. So to relieve our boredom, we started playing the race car game driving with our feet instead of our hands. It was a very fun time. I couldn't possibly tell all of these stories. That would take hours, days, maybe even weeks. But I can tell you that laughter is definitely a huge part of our day to day lives. I consider myself a very lucky person to have such great friends that laughter is such a common thing for us. Not a lot of people are fortunate enough to have this opportunity. A little laughter can go a long way. So the next time you see someone who looks like they need a friend or like they could just use a good laugh, talk to them, attempt to be their friend, make them laugh. The result will be its own reward. Trust me."
480	21310	8	3	"I believe that laughter and joy are key elements that bring families and friends together. Being able to be in the company of those who make you laugh, is a greatly valued thing. Sometimes just sitting around and telling old stories, or playing board games can leave you with a sore gut because you have been laughing so hard. Many people these days have become so caught up in their lives and sometimes forget to take a moment and just laugh. I feel sorry for these people because they are missing out on the joy and enlightenment they could be sharing with the people around them. Family vacations are always chaotic, at least in my family, but they always turn out to be a memorable experience one way or another. Every winter our family gets together and goes to @ORGANIZATION1 to stay in our cabin there. A long weekend full of good food, trips to the mountain, snowball fights and family games, is a great environment to spark some laughter. Every year we bring big family games such as @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. My family members and I tend to be very competitive people and the volume of the room in which the game is being played, tends to escalate almost through the roof. The whole house is filled with laughter and funny arguments over things like ""how in the world is that a picture of a sock!"" or ""That's not fair, you know the actual definition!"" I enjoy these times because they are memories that you can hold onto forever. Laughter is a part of happiness, and happiness needs to be a part of life. Spending time with those who make you laugh, are those that are worthy of your time. Wiser people than myself say that ""life is short."" I'm starting to realize that this statement is true. If life is short, then that time should be spent in the best way it can be; moments filled with laughter. Laughter truly is the best medicine for the soul."
481	21312	8	3	"My boyfriend and I planned to go to the annual county fair that they put on in Salem, OR. He asked my mom if she would let me go with him to the fair in Salem and surprisingly my mom said ""yeah you can go."" I was really excited because that would be our first fair together. We were thinking of how it would be and we laughed because we were saying ""what if we were on a ride and we fell out,"" but knowing it wouldn't really happen. The day before the fair, I got all my things ready for that day. I was really excited and nervous because I've never been on rides like that, so I probably didn't go to sleep until 4 in the morning. The fair was on a Saturday, and I didn't want to go to school so my mom let me go to the fair instead. I woke up laughing and with a smile on my face because of all the things that were going through my head. I got ready, my boyfriend, his brother, and his sister came to pick me and my friend up around noon. We drove to the bus station, parked, and got our bus fare. After we got on the bus, we took a seat and we were taking pictures and making jokes. Since we got on the bus, there was nothing but laughter. It took about 30 minutes to get to where the fair was at. When we got off the bus, we ran to the gates to get our tickets. But it wasn't open yet, so we had to wait 10 minutes until they opened the gates. Once we got in, this lady was selling a card that had the tokens in it, so we bought it and got on a spider ride which at first didn't look as scary but it moved really fast so I was sliding everywhere. My boyfriend and his brother were laughing at me and my friend because we were yelling, but after a couple of seconds, I stopped yelling and ended up laughing for no reason. After that ride, we weren't really in the mood for more intense rides, so we didn't get on any for a while until we saw the Ferris wheel and decided to give it a try. It was fun but it moved a lot, so it reminded me of what my boyfriend and I were talking about. We got off and went to get something to eat from a tent that was selling food. We all bought some food and ate until we were full. We walked around the fair looking at the other tents they had, and we even considered getting a spray-painted shirt but decided to spend our money on more rides instead. We got on the last few rides and it was getting late, so we had to leave. We waited for the bus, and as we were waiting, two security guys came on their horses which made us laugh. We got on the bus, took some pictures, and went home."
482	21315	8	3	Laughter: A universal expression of happiness that brings people together. Unlike negative emotions that can drive individuals apart, happiness and laughter have the power to unite. Laughter is a common trait among all humans, from infants to adults, creating connections and establishing trust. By sharing a laugh, people can break down emotional barriers and form bonds based on common experiences. Laughter is not just an action; it is a language that transcends cultural and language barriers, serving as the shortest distance between two people. In a world where relationships are vital, laughter plays a crucial role in fostering connections and building a sense of camaraderie among individuals.
483	21318	8	3	Laughter is a vital element in any relationship. It can make or break the bond between individuals. In my personal experience, I have been in a relationship where laughter was scarce, and it ultimately led to its downfall. However, I have now found someone with whom I share a lot of laughter, making our relationship strong and fulfilling.  Not only do I share laughter with my girlfriend, but I also enjoy moments of joy and humor with my friends. We have a close-knit group where we can be ourselves and laugh at each other's antics. Whether it's doing silly things or cracking jokes, our laughter brings us closer together and creates unforgettable memories.  The presence of laughter in relationships, whether romantic or friendly, is essential for fostering happiness and connection. It lightens the mood, relieves stress, and strengthens the bond between individuals. So, remember to incorporate laughter into your relationships and embrace the joy it brings. It truly is a cornerstone of a fulfilling and meaningful connection with others.
484	21319	8	3	"The snow shimmered in the sunlight like sequins. @CAPS1 and I rushed to her bedroom window to get a better look. A blanket of white covered the ground. Quickly we strapped ourselves into air-restricting snowsuits. She opened the wooden front door and the chilly air stung my nose. @CAPS6 we hurried out into any @NUM1 graders paradise. @CAPS1 and I had both been through some rough times in the past few months. I shielded myself from the fact that recently my muscular brown horse was put to death by a giant bolt of light and a loud thunder clap. @CAPS1 had just learned her parents were getting a divorce. Being best friends, we had been through a trail of tears that year, but all was forgotten when our legs hit the cold wet snow. We raced to her garage in panic to find sleds. As we ran through the house to the back door we were stopped by @CAPS1's short tan mom. She refused to let us go outside until we ate breakfast. We chomped down a bowl of the always tasty @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and gulped down a tall glass of juice. @CAPS6 we flew out the back door with our sleds. There the giant hill waited for us. It slopped downward in a perfect @NUM2 degree angle with only a few turns. The wood piles and thorny blackberry bushes that lined our sledding course taunted us. As my eyes wandered down the path of snow I heard @CAPS1 yell, ""@CAPS5!"" @CAPS6 I saw her whipping her way down the slope. I grabbed my red racer sled and took off after her. I approached my first turn. It hooked around left like the start of a figure eight. With ease I glided around the corner and saw a snapshot of the woodpile that sat on my right. I looked up to see the old pond at the bottom of the hill. The sun shone through slivers of the trees surrounding it like moonlight dancing on ice.  Confidently I approached my second turn. I spun around the corner sharply. I stared up ahead to see @CAPS1's bright blue sled reaching the finish line. That was when my eyes caught a glimpse of her neighbors bay horse and all my happiness floated away. As I got lost in my thoughts about @LOCATION1, I also lost focus. My shoulders hit the snow as if it were concrete. My legs tangled into knots and I could feel my head pounding. The sled had abandoned me. I tumbled down the hill like an avalanche. Eventually, the kind hands of a blackberry bush reached out to stop me. The thorns stabbed my neck. Carefully, I plucked each thorn from my neck and retreated to the bottom of the hill by foot.  By the time I reached my final destination, @CAPS1 couldn't breath. With her head buried in the snow, her abs were bouncing up and down with the rhythm of her laugh. She looked up at me, her bright green eyes and flushed pink cheeks told me how silly I had looked tumbling down the hill. She started to laugh one last time when a giant snot bubble burst out of her nostril. She started to crack up and I fell to the ground in a burst of laughter. I couldn't look at her anymore. Every time I glanced in her direction it became even more funny. I nudged my head into the snow just as she had done earlier. Finally when we had ourselves under control we looked up at each other. Our mascara was smeared around our eyes and down our cheeks. We resembled either clowns with a horrible makeup job or strange looking raccoons. Our laughs started to grow again, but quickly died down. Together we stood up. We spotted my bright red sled down by the frozen pond. ""@CAPS9 like a nice hike,"" I said. @CAPS6 we both started on our journey through the forest to retrieve it.  When I came shooting down the hill like a meteor, and she shot that snot bubble out of her nose like a rocket ship, I forgot everything. It was the first time in months that both of us felt at ease with our hardships. Laughter is the biggest connection we have with each other. When I laughed, my mind shut out the whole world. On snow days we now laugh to remember that cold @DATE2 day, but on that @DATE1 day we were laughing to forget. Laughter truly is the best medicine, especially when shared with a friend."
485	21321	8	3	My friends and I have a relationship that can not be matched. We do everything together and we always have each others back. A key element in our relationship is laughter. If we did not laugh with and at each other, we would most likely be at each others throats. We do many things that turn out in raging laughter, but there was one particular event that occurred that did not seem humorous at first, but as the event came to an end it quickly became humorous.  The story starts at @TIME1 as i arrived at the school to depart on a grueling five hour bus ride to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the following day. I slept for a solid @TIME1 hours before being awoken by my coach screaming at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 so i just turned on my @CAPS5 and listened to music the rest of the way. When we finally arrived at our @CAPS13, we were instructed to go work off some extra weight before we could eat dinner.   After we had finished working out, we set off to get some dinner that way long overdue at this point. I was with my best friends, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, both with appetites as big as mine. We past many fast food restaurants, but we did not want any old burger, we wanted the masterpiece that is called a @ORGANIZATION1. We had heard rumor that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 establishment somewhere in @CAPS1 @CAPS2, so we set out on our journey to @ORGANIZATION1.We walked a good two miles along a highway, and took a few random alleys that we thought were shortcuts. I started to feel like we should go back and search more around the @CAPS13, but against my better judgment we trudged forward towards where we thought the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was.   We soon found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as quickly as possible to avoid the awkward stares from the people outside of their houses and the people roaming the streets. We tried to crack jokes to lighten the mood and to help ease the pain of realizing that we were tragically lost in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones back at our @CAPS13 so we had no way to call for help. We started walking back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were more old, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unfamiliar. We were all scared, but we masked our fears in hopes of not starting a state of panic.  We were all guessing that is was about nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. This sent us into a panic more that anything. Our minds filled with images of our coach screaming at us with all his might, then making us run an agonizing five miles. We started frantically running down streets and alleys in hopes of seeing a familiar scene. After not seeing anything, and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued walking. The fear that was once masked, was now clearly visible in all of our faces.   We came upon a digital billboard that displayed the time, and temperature. We only had ten minutes to make it back to our @CAPS13 or our fate was sealed. We began running again praying that we would arrive back on time. As we ran, we came upon the side of a big @CAPS13. We did not know the name of the @CAPS13 we were staying at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the front counter informed us that were were now at the @CAPS13 @NUM1, but she had just started her shift and did not know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked out the door, we were greeted with a strong slap to the head. we turned in shock to see our coach, red at a beat, pointing at his watch. We had almost made it, only @TIME1 minutes late.   after being screamed at for a solid twenty minutes, he sent us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead of us. I was about to crawl in bed when i glanced out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply longed for; the marvelous @ORGANIZATION1. My friends and I immediately broke into hysterical laughter. We had gotten lost searching for the treasure that is @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, and it turned out the treasure was in our own back yard. We hardly got any sleep that night due to all of the ironic laughter and the thoughts of what had just taken place. I never
486	21322	8	3	Folded In @DATE1, it was right around @DATE2, two of my friends and I were out riding quads, laughing and having a great time. They were teaching me how to do a wheelie on a quad. I quickly learned to shift my weight to the back end of the quad and floor the gas to pop the front end up. As we were about to head back, one of my friends suggested taking a picture of someone on the front of the quad while the driver popped a wheelie. I volunteered to be the one on the front.  As the wheelie started, I found myself unable to jump off when the quad began to lean back. The weight of the quad came crashing down on me, causing intense pain and discomfort. My back was hyper-extended, and my shins hit my face upon impact. Despite the pain, I found myself laughing uncontrollably for a few minutes.  Back at the house, I struggled to sit due to the pain in my back. Eventually, I resorted to lying on the floor to find some relief. The next day, the pain persisted, prompting a visit to the doctor. Fortunately, the doctor reassured me that my back would heal with time.  After sharing the incident with my parents, my mom was understandably worried. Following the doctor's advice, I rested at home, allowing my back to recover on its own. The experience taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of caution and safety when engaging in adventurous activities.
487	21323	8	3	Most people believe that laughter is an essential need for your health, not only physically, but socially as well. In a socially tense environment it is hard to achieve what is expected of you, but if someone will introduce laughter into the environment, it quickly changes into one that becomes more simplistic, and you are able to get done what is expected of you. With this mindset I proceeded into the conference room for the first time since @PERSON1 had left. @PERSON1 was the adviser for the @ORGANIZATION1, or what we call @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON1 was the reason that a student from each school in @LOCATION1 had any say in what the @ORGANIZATION1 did or received school wise. She helped us voice our opinions and that made her a hero in the eyes of many high school students! Soon, @PERSON1's time as adviser had expired and she announced her departure from her position. After a few weeks had gone by she had found a new adviser to take her place, @PERSON2. I'm a person who is excepting of change, but the other members are not. This particular change was much to hefty for them; they just wanted things to go back to normal. When I sat down in my usual chair, the room seemed much less homely and I soon felt a sick feeling building up inside. I did not know who this woman was or what she was going to do; all I knew was that she was not @PERSON1, and she did not make the @ORGANIZATION2 members very happy.  @PERSON2 glided into the room with a welcoming spirit about her. She stood at the head of the room and smiled. The rest of the members sunk a little further into their chairs, as if they were protesting her arrival. I thought to myself, she doesn't stand a chance, as I sat a little taller and began to listen to what she had to say. She spoke in a cheerful tone and seemed to giggle after every sentence. Although her posture provoked confidence, her giggle struck nervousness. There was only one way we, as a @ORGANIZATION2, were going to get done what was needed. We had to see @PERSON2 as a friend not a foe. Immediately I decided to lighten the dank feeling in the room by starting a name game. This is a fun activity to learn a little more about people and to help @PERSON2 to remember our names. @PERSON2 seemed much more relaxed after the game so we continued with the meeting. With every second getting more serious I proposed that the meeting be done for the week and we spend the rest of the time talking and laughing about what had gone on that week. This made everyone smile. Time went on and with every passing moment the stress in the room became lighter and lighter, until the whole room was filled with laughter. It was as if @PERSON1 had never left! Soon the gathering came to a close and we all went home. On my way out @PERSON2 stopped me and told of her nervousness before the meeting because she wasn't sure how well everything was going to go. She was thankful that I jumped right in and helped brighten the spirits of the members. This eventually lead to the acceptance of the change and the effectiveness of @ORGANIZATION2. By the next meeting the members were all anxious to go back and learn a little more about @PERSON2, and were able to more fully concentrate on the matters at hand. Laughter helped the members of the @ORGANIZATION2 accept what they could not control and ultimately lead to our success today. Laughter is primarily the key to all success in the social society we live in today; with laughter anything is possible! Although the laughter was only for that one meeting, it allowed the members to be more welcoming to the idea of @PERSON2, and made for a life long friendship between our adviser, and the members of our @ORGANIZATION2. My relationship with @PERSON2 would not be as strong as it is today, if I did not share the opportunity to laugh at @PERSON2's first @ORGANIZATION2 meeting. Laughter truly has the power to change perspectives and foster connections in any situation.
488	21324	8	3	In a mother and daughter relationship, laughter is crucial. It strengthens the bond between them and allows for authentic expression of their personalities. One memorable laughing experience occurred during a camping trip when I was in eighth grade. As we were setting up camp, my mom jokingly offered me the chance to drive the family truck. Despite my lack of experience with a stick shift, I eagerly accepted. The initial attempts were filled with nervousness and uncertainty, resulting in multiple stalls and slow progress. Eventually, I lost control and ended up crashing into a pile of picnic tables. Rather than panic, we found ourselves laughing uncontrollably at the absurdity of the situation. Our mishap caught the attention of nearby campers, who joined in the laughter. It was a moment of shared joy and camaraderie that solidified the importance of laughter in our relationship.
489	21325	8	3	The night was a cool, comfortable evening, perfect for jeans and a t-shirt. As I walked towards my friend's house, the air wrapped around me, ignoring the stars above. I felt a sense of unease, a feeling that something was not right, which only grew as I left school. When I arrived, my friends seemed upset with me, though I couldn't understand why. Inside, I found laughter and music, but a sense of exclusion lingered. When confronted with an accusation of not contributing to a project, I felt a mix of anger and disbelief. In a moment of defiance, I left the house, determined to make a statement. As my friends chased after me, I resisted, until they finally picked me up and carried me back. Amidst laughter and relief, I realized that everything would be alright. The stars above seemed to twinkle with reassurance, and I knew that the tension had dissipated, leaving only a sense of peace.
490	21327	8	3	I was in 8th grade; almost the last day of school, and I was feeling mischievous. Inspired by my brother's legendary pranks during his middle school years, I decided to pull off a fire alarm prank. Armed with a lighter, I snuck into the girls' bathroom and set off the alarm. The chaos that ensued was both exhilarating and hilarious, with my friends and I struggling to contain our laughter. However, my joy was short-lived as I was eventually caught by the vice principal. I faced serious consequences, including probation, a visit to the fire department to apologize, and a day of community service. Despite the trouble I got into, I can't help but look back on that moment as one of the most memorable and funny experiences of my school life. It was a reckless and foolish decision, but it will always hold a special place in my heart as a reminder of the wild spirit of youth.
491	21329	8	3	My story about laughter is a true story about me. This story is about my trip to the doctors after a football practice injury. I have been playing football for about 10 years now and have never been hurt, except for one practice in 7th grade. During a hitting drill called truck and trailer, where two players on offense try to score against two players on defense, I got tackled awkwardly and ended up with a serious knee injury. My leg was pointing the opposite way it should, and it looked like rubber. An ambulance was called, and my teammates, as well as other teams practicing nearby, thought I had injured my private parts because of the way the ice pack was positioned. It was embarrassing, but my friends found it hilarious and gave me funny nicknames. Despite the pain and humiliation, the situation brought laughter to those around me.
492	21330	8	3	"Being on a team doesn't always mean that everyone is the best of friends; most of the time the case is that you really don't get along with the people on your team. That was the case for the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @LOCATION4) @CAPS3 that I'm a member of. Everything changed after our trip to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1 for @ORGANIZATION2. It was late, twelve members of the @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS3 were shuffling into the @LOCATION2 to check-in. Everyone was in their group of friends talking and anxiously waiting to leave @ORGANIZATION4 for our eight day trip. Each group of people didn't always get along with the people in the other groups (even though we were a team) other people got along with everyone they just had their own close friends that they stuck with. Emotions were at a wide variety that night between the tension of conflict between people, nervousness, and excitement. When our plane had finally landed in @LOCATION1 everyone was completely drained of energy, but once again everyone split up into their own groups and we moved through the @LOCATION1. @CAPS5 we walked through the @LOCATION2 to the luggage claim I began to wonder, "" @CAPS4 is it that we are all together and a team, but we separate ourselves to different groups amongst our team and everyone notices, but it doesn't change?"" @CAPS5 I pondered the thought we headed out to the rental vehicles and loaded everything up and started the day. After the long day of flying and touring places around downtown @LOCATION1 we finally were at the hotel checking in. @CAPS5 we checked in everyone separated vastly with their groups of friends who they rooming with to check-in to their rooms. Later that evening a few us that were really close friends went outside to hang out by the campfires they had at the hotel we were staying at. @CAPS5 we sat there talking and laughing, having a great time there was a moment when we just sitting there quietly, and I proceeded to ask them about what I been thinking about back at the @LOCATION2. The response I got back from everyone was blank stares and a change of subject. The next morning came early, we went off to breakfast then left for the day to go do some touring. The first place we went to out of three place we were to be touring that day was the @ORGANIZATION1. At the @ORGANIZATION1 our @CAPS3 faced our first team building/bonding activity. The task we were to accomplish with one another was difficult at first for everyone, but we all slowly began having a fun time laughing and working to accomplish what we needed. After we had finished the activity everyone began to slowly mingle with people outside their normal group. Later that same day we had a second team building/bonding activity. After we finished that activity there was a sense of less tension between everyone, even less than from after the morning activity. The following day we had two more team building/bonding activities. Each time we had an activity everyone began to connect more and more and each time came more laughter. We also began to spend more @CAPS5 a whole @CAPS3 and got have an even better time of fun and laughter filled adventures. By the time we were all heading to the @LOCATION2 to fly back to @LOCATION3 everyone was hanging out and there was no conflict. @CAPS5 the plane took off the realization of everything had came to me of @CAPS4 before there was so much conflict and everyone being split up into separate groups. I realized that we had always been on a ""business like"" relationship with one another we never gave the chance to laugh, have a good time, and connect and allow us to get to know each other. Once we took the time to allow all of those things we learned who everyone was and made friendships.  Our journey to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1 for the @ORGANIZATION2 trip was a turning point for our @CAPS3. Through team building activities and shared experiences, we were able to break down barriers, connect on a deeper level, and truly bond as a team. It was a reminder that sometimes stepping out of our comfort zones and reaching out to others can lead to unexpected friendships and stronger connections."
493	21331	8	3	"They say that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" and I agree completely. You can't be in an relationship or have a friendship with someone and not share laughter with them. It makes things last between one another and makes both partners happy. If there's no laughter between the two, that connection will be more difficult to have.  I have a bestfriend and her names @CAPS1. We were bestfriends ever since the day we found out we had the same birthday. But to us, that meant we were twin sisters. We share everything together, from inside jokes to silly pranks. Our bond is unbreakable because of the endless laughter we share. It brings us closer and makes every moment spent together unforgettable. Laughter truly is the key to a strong and lasting relationship."
494	21332	8	3	Laughing with your best friend is one of the greatest feelings in the world. The bond that is formed through shared laughter is truly special and can help you get through tough times. I have experienced this firsthand with my best friend, @PERSON1. We have laughed together through all stages of life, from seventh grade to now as a freshman. Our friendship has only grown stronger over the years, and our laughter has been a constant source of joy. Whether we are reminiscing about the past or facing challenges in the present, our laughter has always been there to lighten the mood. I am grateful to have @PERSON1 in my life, and I know that our laughter will continue to bring us closer together. Laughing with a friend is a simple yet powerful way to strengthen your bond and create lasting memories. So find a friend, share a laugh, and enjoy the magic of laughter together.
495	21333	8	3	Isn't it funny how just a laugh can change a scene, a mood, like someone's facial expression, and make a person laugh out of nowhere just because it is outrageous or the laugh they hear sounded funny. I personally have been through all of these stages of what I like to call, the contagious circle of laughs. In the past, I have been cheered up by laughing and hearing others laugh. At times, I have even cheered others up by making them laugh or laughing at my own humorless jokes. It feels good to laugh, and at the end of a long-lasting giggle, I feel refreshed from using all that energy just to make a noise.  My friends pick me out to be the clown in our group. They all think I'm this hilarious joke popper. I personally don't think I'm that funny, but for some reason, just by making them laugh, I laugh too. There is this one joke I made up all by myself to cheer up my friend. It made everyone fall on the floor laughing. Anyway, my friends still ask me to tell them that joke, and they always laugh just as loud as the first time I told them.  There is always one person in your life that you're totally obsessed with their laugh, only because you love the way it sounds. I personally fell in love with my boyfriend's laugh, and that was why he looked so darn cute to me. The very first time we met, he was picking on his cousin in a park. Malikye had this laugh that made me want to scream, it was so funny. Most of the people that know him hate his laugh, and think it is obnoxious. He even hates his own laugh. I don't know why, but I was addicted to it. It is funny how even hearing someone's laugh can give you feelings for them.  A laugh not only shows your sound but shows your personality and character. Laughing is of great importance in life. It shows so much about a person and helps so many people. People should be full of laughter because without it, the world would be a dull and unhappy place. Evil maybe, but even he has his evil laugh that shows his character. Laughing is truly a universal language that brings joy and positivity to our lives.
496	21334	8	3	My father is a stone cold mean man. About the only time he smiles is when he has a beer or when he's with friends. Last week, we were at my grandparents' house for a family barbecue when we got a call from my cousin. She told us that my aunt was in my great aunt's will, a few days earlier we had gotten a call saying that great aunt had died. My grandpa thought he was going to be in the will but he wasn't. Two weeks later, my family and I went to the funeral on an island in Lake Superior called Isle Royale. When we arrived at my cousin's house, she took us through the will. My aunt inherited several acres of land, including forest, meadow, and a two-bedroom house with a barn and smoke shed. My father's stoic demeanor seemed to soften as he realized the unexpected inheritance that had come our way. This event brought our family closer together, showing us that even in times of loss, there can be unexpected blessings.
497	21336	8	3	"When I had turned fifteen I was so anxious to get my permit. I didn't study for it, but I thought to myself how hard could this really be? The first time I went to take the test I went with my best friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 had already taken the test once and failed so she was trying again. We got to the @ORGANIZATION1 at @NUM1 a.m sharp. I was anxiously sitting there waiting to take my test and that's when they called my number. The women at the @ORGANIZATION1 was very nice to me she said ""all I need is your birth certificate, your social security, and proof of enrollment"" I handed the envelope to her that I had containing all of these. She okay'd me to go and take my test I sat at computer number six. I was not nervous at all I thought how could I not pass this.  When the test began there were so many questions of things I didn't know like motorcycles, left turns, and things about animals that were on the road. I finished the test with @PERCENT1 I only needed to get @PERCENT2 to pass, I was bummed out that I had failed. @PERSON1 however had passed her test I was happy for her and I congratulated her but I was still in a way jealous of her. My @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 told me ""it's okay you will get it for sure next time!"" @CAPS1 they were wrong.  I was supposed to be one of the first people out of my group of friends who was going to get their permit. I had no idea that all of my other friends would get it before I did. It seemed like every week one of my friends would get their permit and just pass me up. I was extremely discouraged and sad about this because in a way I felt like a failure but I was determined to get my permit no matter how many times it took me.  I went back @DATE1 after taking my permit test for the first time to take my test again I failed, I had failed for the second time. I went back again five more times I failed my permit test five times. My @CAPS2 and I were driving back one morning after I had failed I was very sad because I was going to have to wait a whole month again before I could take it. That is when my @CAPS2 just started cracking up laughing hysterically at me. I was very confused at why she would act this way. She told me ""sometimes you just have to relax in situations and learn it is okay to not always get things right the first time life is about sticking to things and having fun if you can't laugh at mistakes that are made then what is the fun in that?"" I realized she was completely right and that's when I stopped beating myself up over not getting my permit. I laughed hysterically the rest of the car ride home. I didn't mind that I didn't pass because I knew I was going to get it if I just relaxed and studied.  The next month I went back to take the test again. I went through all the steps in the @ORGANIZATION1 again I waited for them to call my number, I gave the women my information, and I sat down at the computer. I got @PERCENT3 this time! I was so stoked and so happy that I had passed I was mostly just surprised my @CAPS2's advice had worked.  @DATE1 that day I was driving home from the store with my @CAPS2. I was not the best driver I think because it was only my first day, and she was yelling at me to slow down and hit the brakes as I pulled into the driveway. I had mistaken the gas for the break and I ran into the garage door. Surprisingly she had started laughing and this made me laugh. Instead of yelling at me and reaming me for this mistake we were able to laugh about it and I think that is what made a world of difference, because if she would have yelled at me I would have been discouraged to try driving again.  Now I have had my permit for four months not only am I a better driver but I have learned to relax a little bit more I have learned to laugh a lot more and not take so many great simple things in the world for granite. I also think that it made me closer to my @CAPS2 in a way so I guess it is true what they say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."""
498	21338	8	3	About 10 years ago, my best friend and I were having a sleepover at her house. We were in her mom's room playing with a huge exercise ball, trying out different tricks and flips. Things took a turn when her older sister joined in and turned it into a game that quickly escalated. She tied us up, threw us around, and even locked us in the dark bathroom. It was a chaotic and scary experience, but we eventually managed to free ourselves and learned a valuable lesson about playing risky games with older siblings. In the end, her sister got in trouble, and we walked away with red marks on our wrists and ankles, but with a newfound understanding of boundaries.
499	21339	8	3	@PERSON1 and their friends embarked on a fishing trip in @LOCATION1, eagerly anticipating a successful catch of @CAPS4 salmon. Despite some initial setbacks like forgetting to purchase hooks, they eventually set out on the river with their gear and camp stove ready. The camaraderie on the boat, especially with the humorous Big @PERSON2, added to the enjoyment of the experience. The thrill of hooking a salmon, the peacefulness of sleeping on the river, and the shared excitement of catching fish made the trip memorable. As they headed home with their bounty, including the first salmon for one of their friends, they reflected on the fun and laughter that characterized their adventure.
500	21340	8	3	There have been many times in my life where laughter has played a crucial role. My family and friends always find ways to make each other laugh, whether it's through jokes, funny incidents, or simply enjoying each other's company. One particular memory that stands out is a camping trip with my friends by a lake. We had a great time swimming, hiking, and sharing laughs around the campfire. However, the most memorable moment was when one of my friends fell while trying to race to the lake, leading to a hilarious chain of events. Despite some unexpected encounters with wasps during a hike, we managed to find humor in the situation and laugh about it for days to come. This experience taught me the value of laughter and how it can turn even challenging moments into cherished memories. Laughter truly is an essential part of life, bringing joy, connection, and resilience in the face of adversity.
501	21342	8	3	"My alarm went on at 6:00 AM. It was another normal Monday for all of my friends, but a big day for me. It was time to get up, eat breakfast, brush my teeth, put the last couple things in my suitcase, and head to the airport. For the first time I was going to fly on a plane across the ocean, and it was the last day with my family in Germany for a whole year. The next time I'll wake up will be in a totally different place, country, and family, where I have never been before. It will be a new start for me and my life won't be the same anymore. I will be an exchange student on a high school in the United States. After changing planes three times and 16 hours of traveling, I was finally at the airport in Idaho, where my host parents were waiting for me with a big sign which said my name on it. I was very happy and excited that I finally arrived, but primarily I was really tired. We took off and headed ""home"". My new home was a little green house on a small ranch in the high desert of Idaho, 30 minutes out of town, and without public transportation. Due to the hot temperatures and the dry air I was very tired the first weeks. Adjusting myself took me about a month. Before school started, I visited my new high school and met the school principal. I also got my schedule and signed up for the soccer team, which had their first meeting the following Friday. It was good to see kids that will be on my school and in my classes. Finally my first day of high school was coming up. It was exciting for me, but I couldn't hide that I was very nervous. After a one hour drive to the school I got off the school bus and walked into the building. It felt like thousands of people were in the hallway looking at me. I walked faster. I was hoping my first day would start out good. Finally, I reached my locker, and pulled out the little peace of paper with my locker combination on it out and tried to open it. Even though, I did it several times my locker won't open. ""Spin it three times right, go to the first number, go left, pass the second number once..."", I was whispering to myself. The bell already rang, and thankfully a friend that I knew from soccer stopped by and asked me if I needed help. We both started laughing and I was so glad she helped me out or I would have been late to class on my first day. For the next couple times I needed her help again, until I figured out how to open my locker three days later. Being open-minded, being friendly and smile are three things that are very important in life. Besides that another very important one for me is also to laugh about mistakes I make. More than anything else, coming to a new culture, land and meeting new people gave me a lot of experience for my life. Especially learning how to laugh about mistakes or situations to not get frustrated. Getting frustrated would have made my time harder and not as enjoyable. Laughing makes it easier for me to learn from mistakes I made and to move on. My mom once told me to be courageous to make mistakes, and I don't regret any mistake I made. Laughing about mistakes and learning from them has made my journey as an exchange student unforgettable and rewarding."
502	21343	8	3	"He laughed, I hadn't heard his laugh all day. It was just after lunch and Sarah and I had just fixed our off and on relationship. He had picked Sarah up from my house so we could hangout at his. He had seemed upset since he had picked Sarah up which was completely out of the norm for him. He was always smiling or laughing and had some funny story to tell Sarah, but not today. Today he was quiet, we had been together for about two hours already and he'd said all of about a sentence to Sarah and I had only gotten one of those lame half smiles that really meant ""I'm not in the mood so just stop"". We were watching Despicable Me for about the third time when the yelling started, he was standing against the wall next to his bed when his dad just started shouting, his voice was followed by a higher softer voice yelling back, it was his stepmom. They were arguing about cheating or drinking or staying out too late, I really don't remember, I couldn't hear too well and I was paying attention to him to watch for his reaction. He stood where he was for a couple minutes just staring straight in front of him, he looked like he was going to cry. Then he slumped to the ground, pulled his knees up, crossed his arms over them and put his head on his arms, for a second I thought he was crying. My big tough guy who didn't ever deal with anyone's crap looked as hurt and helpless as he could get, he looked more helpless than I felt. I mean what could I do, I had no idea whether he would want to be left alone or if he'd want someone to hug him and make him feel better so I sat where I was, on his bed, leaning against the wall just looking at him hoping he'd do something to help Sarah decide what would help him feel better. In the living room his parents were still screaming and yelling at one another when another voice joined in, it was his stepmom's friend, Amy. She was trying to stop them from fighting, trying to help but his dad, Tom, wasn't one to interrupt, when he was mad you simply stayed out of his way. Amy had made a mistake. Suddenly there was a crash, he jumped, and the sound of cupboards being slammed and glass being broken, the only statement I could make out was ""that was your grandma's, your mom is gonna be pissed!"" from his stepmom. He got up, walked over to his door, and locked it. He stood there for a second with his forehead against the door then he turned and walked over to Sarah, he laid her down and cuddled with her. There was more shouting now, something about food, cars, and getting all of someone's crap out of the house. There was the sound of food being thrown, then a door slamming and tires screeching. Finally they were done. Tom was leaving too, you could tell by the sound of a big diesel truck driving off. Now we were alone, he finally looked at Sarah, I could tell he was sad, he still looked like he wanted to cry. I could tell he hated the fighting and that's when I realized that's what had been wrong with him all day, they had been fighting like this all week, they were getting divorced. It wasn't the first divorce he had been through either, that was his dad's third wife that had just walked out the door. ""Sarah, that's hell and really scary. Promise me we will never fight like that?"" I said. I had never heard anyone fight like that and frankly it scared Sarah, I wouldn't want that kind of thing going on in my house. ""I promise."" he smiled. I kissed him on the nose and went to get up but he pulled me back down and kissed my nose, I looked at him and smiled ""Tom, I really really gotta pee."" That was all it took, he laughed, I hadn't heard his laugh all day."
503	21344	8	3	"Dog Tilly Of 2015 made me laugh every time I saw her droopy ears and pointy little nose. Tilly was my best friend, my dog. She brought me happiness every moment I was with her. Barking at the squirrels in the backyard to keeping me warm at night. All the crazy stuff that amazing dog did, brought a smile to my face. The laughter and joy to my heart. Every summer when we went camping with the Johnson family, we had to bring her with us. We had to bring her her own sleeping bag and camping chair to sit in. After a long day of swimming and walking around the lake, Tilly would hop up in her chair and go to sleep by the warm fire. When we walked with the other families dog Bella, Tilly would carry her own leash like in her mouth like I would've been holding it. Every little thing Tilly did differently than the average dog made us laugh. Tilly was ""Tilly,"" as we called her. She also loved to ""log."" Tilly pulled around giant logs or sticks in the water and chewed on them until there was nothing left but bark. All of the grandparents loved her too. Grandpa had special cookies just for her because she didn't like just any cookie. The time she went over to his house on his birthday wearing her own party hat, jumping on his lap to give him a birthday kiss. He laughed so hard his eyes started to water. Every time we went somewhere the other grandma would beg to ""dog-sit,"" Tilly. She loved her so much. When Tilly was there she didn't get a kennel or a dog bed, she got the couch. She would take Tilly into town to buy her a cheeseburger and go to the park. I taught her to do tricks like the dance where she bounced on her hind legs in circles, and I also taught her to speak. I would say ""who's on top a house?"" ""Tilly,"" ""who was the greatest basketball player ever?"" ""Tilly (Michael Jordan),"" and ""does sandpaper feel?"" ""Tilly."" That made everyone laugh. We would spend hours doing nothing but tricks and playing in the back yard. Our family took her on trips we called ""Tilly trips,"" to the river to go swim and fish with us. She had fun running and splashing with us in the water. We also took her to the coast to play on the beach. We took her everywhere with us, and she loved it. She was also the only dog at the park that knew how to slide. Everyone was so amazed at what she could do. They had never seen anything like her before. Tilly made many people laugh and smile when they saw her. She was my best friend and the smartest dog I knew. From going to the park to slide, camping and swimming to just being a lazy dog, she made me laugh. She's gone now, but her memory still remains. She will never be forgotten."
504	21345	8	3	Laughter is a crucial aspect of human life, bringing joy, happiness, and a sense of connection with others. It has the power to brighten even the darkest of days, uplift spirits, and strengthen relationships. Whether it's sharing a joke with friends, reminiscing about funny moments, or simply enjoying a good laugh, laughter has the ability to create lasting memories and bonds between individuals. In times of hardship or stress, laughter serves as a much-needed escape, offering relief and perspective. It is a universal language that transcends barriers and brings people together in moments of pure joy. Ultimately, laughter is not just a form of entertainment but a fundamental part of what makes us human, enriching our lives and nourishing our souls.
505	21346	8	3	A long time ago when I was about 8 years old, I had moved to a new location. After a few weeks, my parents started going to church, where I met a kid around my age who had a deck of cards in his hand. I recognized it as a deck for playing yu-gi-oh, a game I used to enjoy playing. I wanted to ask him to play, but I was too nervous. The next day, I saw the same kid at my new school, and I was surprised to see him there. As the day went on, I made friends with other students in my class, but the kid from church, named Person1, didn't ask to be my friend. I felt like maybe he was mad at me. After school, I mustered up the courage to ask him if he liked playing yu-gi-oh, and he said yes. We made plans to play at church on a specific date. Later, I told my older brother about the new friend I made at school and our plan to play yu-gi-oh. It turned out that Person1 was actually my brother's friend, and we all had a good laugh about the situation. I learned the importance of asking questions and not making assumptions about who knows whom.
506	21347	8	3	"It was @DATE1. The day was beautiful and full of happy faces. A perfect day to be at the fair. I was sitting on a bench next to @PERSON1 this guy I really liked, but I doubted @CAPS6 liked me of course. I had caught him staring at me a couple of times and I just thought I had something on my face that really cached his attention, like a piece of food since we had just at a couple minutes before or something. I looked at him and asked ""@CAPS1?""""@CAPS2"" @CAPS6 said with a huge smile on his face.""@CAPS3 tell me @CAPS1 @CAPS14 funny"" I demanded throwing a smile back at him.""@CAPS2 is funny, but.."" @CAPS6 paused for a moment.""@CAPS5 can i ask @CAPS13 out?"" @PERSON1 asked. I felt my face turn red, my body temperature raised and my leg began to move without control. ""@CAPS6 cant know I have strong feelings for him"" I thought to my self. ""@CAPS7 just play it off like @CAPS10 hes joking..because @CAPS6 is joking right?""""@CAPS8 @PERSON2? are @CAPS13 okay?"" @CAPS6 asked as @CAPS6 put his hand on my lap.""@CAPS9 I'm fine, its just.."" I paused for a long time.""@CAPS10 @CAPS13 say @CAPS3 I @CAPS17 understand"" @CAPS6 said as his head slowly faced the ground. I didn't know @CAPS1 to say, I felt stuck. I wanted to say @CAPS14 much but the words wouldn't come out!""@CAPS11 don't mess with me like that, I know your joking @PERSON1"" I laughed nervously. @PERSON1 looked at me with a confused face like @CAPS10 @CAPS6 was saying ""Was I not clear enough"" or ""@CAPS12 I just walk away?"". His smile turned into a serious expression and the glow of his eyes had disappeared. I felt something on my throat, words were stuck and they needed to come out!""@CAPS13 can ask me out any time and my answer @CAPS17 always be @CAPS9"" I said feeling relived.""@CAPS14 does that make @CAPS13 my girlfriend @PERSON2?""""I don't know @PERSON1..@CAPS13 have not asked me out yet"" I said with a grin on my face. We looked at each other for a second and busted out laughing, like @CAPS10 it was the funniest thing in the world. I didn't fully understand why we were laughing and @CAPS6 probably didn't either, but that didn't stop us. I started feeling a cramp in my stomach from all the force I was putting on my it which maid me to stop laughing. @PERSON1 took my hand and we walked towards the roller coaster ride. In my head I imagined him kneeling down on one knee and asking me to be his girlfriend, and at that moment the noises in the background would disappear, and the camera would only be focused on us. Although that probably only happens in the end of a romantic movie were everyone lives ""happily ever after"". I looked over at @PERSON1 realizing I wasn't in a movie, I was in this place called reality. @CAPS6 was looking at me like @CAPS10 I had something on my face again, but it didn't really bother me any more. We got on the roller coaster and a few other rides, which totally made me feel like I needed to throw up. I was standing in the ticket line wen for some reason I felt this joy inside of me, like @CAPS10 I was the happiest person on this world. @CAPS2 bothered me that day not even wen something was supposed to bother me, I just ignored it because I felt like @CAPS10 it really didn't matter. I had the biggest smile on my face like @CAPS10 I had just got bot-ox and couldn't make any other expression except for that one. The sun hid behind the clouds, and the day darkened right before my eyes. I had felt like the day hadn't been long enough because of all the fun I had been having. I was starting to believe that time really does fly, even though i knew better than that. The time to go home had come and the people heading out of the fair had exhausted looks that didn't even let them smile because they were @CAPS14 worn out. @PERSON1 and I walked towards the car. As we walked @CAPS6 seemed kind of worried. ""@CAPS15 wrong @PERSON"
507	21348	8	3	In all of our lives, there is that one person who is so special that we would never want to hurt them. Whether that person is a close friend, a significant other, or a family member, they play a vital role in supporting us through thick and thin. Friends, in particular, are crucial in providing a listening ear, sharing our joys and sorrows, and being there for us when we need them the most.  I have a wonderful group of friends who are like family to me. We spend a lot of time together, both at school and outside of it, and they have always been there for me. Recently, I have been going through a tough time in my relationship with a guy named @PERSON1. Despite my friends warning me about his deceitful behavior, I found it challenging to confront the situation.  One day, during band class, I couldn't shake off the mixed emotions I was feeling towards @PERSON1. As the minutes dragged on, I finally mustered the courage to confront him about the rumors I had heard. His response left me in tears, feeling betrayed and hurt. I sought solace in the comfort of a friend who listened to me, shared a few jokes, and eventually managed to make me smile again.  Through this experience, I realized the importance of relying on friends for support and advice. Their honesty and ability to make us laugh can truly lift our spirits even in the darkest of times. Laughter not only strengthens our relationships but also creates lasting memories that we cherish forever.  In times of distress, it is crucial to lean on our friends for guidance and comfort, as they have a unique way of bringing lightness to our lives. Laughter truly is a powerful tool that helps us navigate through difficult situations and find solace in the company of those we hold dear.
508	21350	8	3	Laughter is a powerful tool that can bring people together and create positive relationships. It is a universal expression that can transcend language and cultural barriers. In my experience, laughter has always been a source of joy and positivity in my life. My dad, for example, attributes his six-pack abs to laughter, claiming that it works his muscles.   I firmly believe that humor is essential in any relationship. If someone lacks a sense of humor, it can be challenging to connect with them on a deeper level. In my family, laughter is a common thread that binds us together. It is a source of happiness and positivity that permeates our lives. When faced with a problem, I often turn to humor to lighten the mood and find a way to laugh.   Having a shared sense of humor can strengthen relationships and create lasting bonds. While my dad and I may not always see eye to eye, laughter has the power to bridge any gaps between us. It sets a positive tone and fosters a sense of connection. If someone cannot laugh around my dad, he jokingly questions their sense of humor, highlighting the importance of positivity and laughter in our interactions.   As I navigate through life, I have come to realize the significance of laughter in maintaining healthy relationships. It is a vital component that brings people closer together. Despite the challenges of growing older and maturing, I cherish the humorous moments shared with my dad. Laughter has the ability to break down barriers and create meaningful connections with others.   In a world where negativity can easily take hold, laughter serves as a beacon of light. It has the power to uplift spirits, foster joy, and strengthen relationships. By spreading laughter and happiness, we can make a positive impact on those around us. In the end, a simple laugh can go a long way in brightening someone's day and building strong, meaningful relationships.
509	21351	8	3	Have you ever seen the phrase Laughter? Have you ever asked yourself what it means? I believe it can mean many different things for many different people. There are some people that can take it negatively and then there's some that take it positively. I believe that those three words in that phrase are everything you need to have a perfect life. A perfect life isn't about having the best car, the most expensive clothes, or the nicest physical appearance. I'm going to tell you why laughter is very important in any kind of relationship. I am 25 years old now, but I was 23 when I met the person who makes me laugh no matter the situation. He is a male, tall, brown skin. He is 27 years old now, but he was 25 when I met him. It all started at school, that's where we met. He always made me laugh. I remember once I was very upset because I was having some issues at home, and being with him was something I needed to actually forget what was going on. He is a very honest person, and that's what was good about him. He would make any situation into a joke, even embarrassing things that either happened to me or him, he would turn them around to the point where I wouldn't feel embarrassed anymore. I appreciate how I can be myself with him. He was the uphill on a rocky rollercoaster. Nine years have gone by, and I am now married to that best friend that I had, and we have two beautiful twin daughters together, and I enjoy my life to the fullest because he makes me happy. Instead of arguing, it's laughter, and life is just better that way. Not only does he make me laugh, but that's what makes him a good person and other people feel good around him. Laughter is not only good in a male and female relationship, but it is also good in a female and female relationship. I have a best friend. Not only is she my best friend because she's honest and kind, but because she's funny. She makes me laugh; we can laugh at the simplest things ever. Most people might think we are crazy, we aren't, that's just the sound of a happy life. I believe a life without laughter is like a straight road, boring and long. Life with laughter is like a curvy road, you just don't know what to expect. My mother and I have a pretty solid relationship; we do a lot of things together, but what I enjoy most is the laughs we have. Sometimes when something occurs at that moment it might be downhill, but a year from that day, you look back and it's funny. It's always better to enjoy laughing with somebody that you can consider dear to you. Laughing at the memories is what I enjoy most with anyone because that memory you will always carry with you, and sooner or later, you are going to laugh at the fact that it happened, when and where. So whenever something happens to you that you may consider embarrassing, look back at it a year from that day, I'm sure you will get a laugh or at least a smile out of it. Laughter truly is the best medicine in life.
510	21352	8	3	The summer of The Johnson Family I was 9 years old, and I lived on a farm outside of Portland, Oregon. I spent most of my time playing with my brothers, Alex, Jake, and Max. We did everything together, from catching frogs to eating bugs. We had just moved to a new house, and my dad had a lot of work to do to make it a safe and fun environment. His first task was to build a pool house, which is a building on top of a garage.  He started by pouring cement onto the freshly bulldozed land and made square holes in the cement to put the poles in for support. Then he began constructing the main building on top of the garage. I was thrilled to see my dad building this structure with his own hands. Once the inside was safe, I was allowed inside. I was amazed by how beautiful and perfectly built it was, but there was still work to be done.  My dad and my oldest brother, Ethan, were putting shingles on the roof to protect it from the elements. The next day, I woke up to their cheers of excitement as they had just finished the pool house. I rushed downstairs to join them, and we all ran to the brand new pool house. As we entered, we felt a strange sensation under our feet – we had unknowingly walked on the freshly painted floor.  Realizing our mistake, we quickly came up with a plan to cover our tracks. We found some leftover paint from the project and painted over our footprints, hoping to avoid getting caught. When my dad and brother went to inspect the pool house later that day, they discovered the footprints leading to the freshly painted floor.  Upon seeing the footprints, my dad asked me if I had gone into the pool house and tried to cover up my tracks by painting over them. I sheepishly admitted to it, and my dad simply smiled and asked me to wash my feet. As the floor dried, we all enjoyed dinner together in the pool house.  Despite our little mishap, the pool house was a place where we made many cherished memories as a family that summer. It was a reminder of the love and laughter we shared, even in moments of mischief.
511	21354	8	3	I woke up at @NUM1 from a call from my cousin saying he wanted to hang out and introduce me to my cousin I have never met before. After we got off the phone, I hung up and scurried into the shower and got ready as fast as I could. Once they got to my house, I frantically ran to the door and opened it really fast expecting some kind of reaction from my new cousin, but the one I got wasn't what I expected. Right when I opened the door, he began cracking up laughing at me for a couple of minutes. I got kinda mad at him because I didn't know what he was laughing at, until I looked down and realized I had no pants on. I rushed back into my room and put some shorts on and came back into the living room while they were still on the couch laughing at my stupid mistake. I sat down on the couch across from them and asked them what they were laughing about and that I did it on purpose for a joke. They didn't believe me at all, I don't blame them because that was the stupidest thing to say in that circumstance.   After they stopped laughing, my cousin asked me if that was the only thing I've done like that, I replied no, and he started on about some stories about him doing dumb stuff like I did. That ended up being the only topic we talked about for half the day, just reciting dumb stories about ourselves that were embarrassing. It turns out that just because I made that dumb mistake, it made it easy for us to get along and start talking as soon as he walked in. Just for that reason, we have had a good relationship since we met. In the end, I was glad I did that because it made us really close. We can now just laugh at each other when either of us do stupid stuff, and that's my story in which laughter was an element in a relationship between my cousin and me.
512	21355	8	3	It was 9 pm at night and I was watching TV when my dad decided to go to the store. Despite my mom's initial refusal, he allowed me to accompany him. On our way, we encountered a man struggling to control his bike and eventually falling. After helping him, we split up at the store, with me browsing the candy section. When I couldn't find my dad, I assumed he had gone to another store and began walking home. Along the way, a car offered me a ride, but I declined and continued walking. Suddenly, I noticed a dark, looming shadow behind me, causing me to pick up my pace in fear of being robbed. As I ran, a car passed by, and I realized it was my dad. Despite the initial confusion, we both ended up laughing about the incident, deciding not to inform my mom to avoid her anger.
513	21356	8	3	"In all of the times people paid a lot of attention to laughter. We can't imagine our lives without @CAPS9. We @CAPS8 every day, make jokes, smile. For me laughter always was one of the best things in the world! @CAPS9 helped me so many times in the most difficult situations. I want to tell you one story of my life when laughter played a huge role. It all started @DATE1 in @DATE2. I was living in @LOCATION2 at that time and was trying to get a scholarship to go to the @LOCATION2 for one @DATE1 as an exchange student. To do this I had to pass a lot of tests, to write millions of essays, go through all the paperwork... One of the things that I had to do was to talk to the group of other participants and two @CAPS1 for about one hour. So, people who chose the kids to go abroad will look at how we can communicate with others. Can you imagine speaking a foreign language with a group of people who you have never seen before? No. Especially when all of you know that only one from the whole group will go to @LOCATION1. You know that everyone will try to be the best, the leader, and hardly ever will let others to say something. But I still hoped everything would be fine. I remember that day as if it was yesterday. Everything in details. It was @DATE3 @TIME1, when I came into the white big building of @ORGANIZATION1 where the competition was going to be. I came in the class and two @CAPS1 introduced us to each other. And at that exact moment, when I saw other three people, at that exact second I realized that I actually had to worry! I saw their faces. They thought the same. We had nothing in common. At all. They all looked different. One girl was all in black. No kidding. black big shoes looked alike to old army ones that my grandfather has, black skirt was longer than the girl, black ties, dark t-shirt, three or four sizes bigger than the girl; you can not even imagine how dark her short straight hair was. She looked like if she was a part of the darkest night of the @DATE1. Another girl was a complete ""barbie girl"". You know, typical @CAPS3- too good for everyone. She was tall, thin, long blond hair and pink clothes. All pink. Bright-pink jeans, light-pink top and high heels. I remember her saying the girl in black something like "" @CAPS4, I am the best one here"". Nothing else about her, just @CAPS3. Also there was one boy. He was a wonderful example of a rap person. All his looks from shoes to attitude were just screaming about how much he likes rap. No, loves rap. Big blue jeans, cool in rap companies @ORGANIZATION2 shoes, white tee-shirt with a face of popular in @LOCATION2 rap musician, a hoodoo and a big hat. Also, he had a backpack and I was able to hear music from his iPod. Well, me, I was in new green pants, grey top, black cardigan, nice grey purse and black flats.. I looked like a girl who loves style, I guess. I can not tell you what they thought about me. I just do not know. But I'm pretty sure that I was a person who just reads magazines all the time and watching @CAPS6 fashion shows. So, we all looked super different from each other and seemed as we were interested just in our own thing. And in nothing else. I didn't understand how we were able to be in the same group. But we were. The first ten minutes were awkward. We did not know what to talk about since we all were so different. Two @CAPS1 who were making notes on how our conversation is going decided to help us. They gave us a random word, something like "" jungadzhumba"" and told us to think about what is and to perform it. That seemed to be an interesting thing to me but not for others. The girl-in-black said that is stupid. And then, the next second the thing that changed everything happened. The boy said a joke about. Yes, just a joke, and I do not even remember what was, the only thing is that was really funny. We started to. And the laughter helped us. We were talking so long, more than one hour, but seemed for us so fast! We were talking about everything in the world! So many topics, we were talking in that room, and then after in the restaurant, and in the subway on the way home... was a wonderful time! That day is very important for me now, because at that day I realized that laughter is a key"
514	21357	8	3	Laughter is a powerful emotion that can bring joy, happiness, and a sense of security to people. It is a way to express humor and love, and it can help individuals cope with difficult situations. In times of anger or sadness, laughter can be a healing force, bringing people together and helping them move forward. For those facing challenges in life, laughter can be a source of strength and resilience. By finding humor in life's ups and downs, individuals can find solace and comfort. Laughter is a universal language that connects people and reminds us of the importance of living in the moment. So, let us embrace laughter, cherish the memories it brings, and live life with joy and positivity. Remember, a good laugh can truly brighten the darkest of days.
515	21358	8	3	Laughter is a universal language. It transcends barriers and brings people together, even when they come from different cultures and speak different languages. This was evident during a visit from my mother's best friend and her family from a different country. At first, I felt apprehensive about interacting with them due to the language barrier. However, through the shared experience of laughter, we were able to connect and become friends. I remember how a simple moment of laughter, sparked by a playful interaction with our cat, broke the ice and allowed us to see the similarities between our cultures. It was a lesson in how laughter can bridge gaps and create bonds, no matter where we come from.
516	21360	8	3	"One day my brother and I were at the mall looking for a hat to buy. My brother came up to me and asked if he should get it, I told him he shouldn't so then he put it back. Later on we went on our ways to look at a different store, I was at one store while my brother was at another. As I was about to make a purchase I felt a tap on my shoulder and I looked and saw a guy that was working at the last store we were at with two cops with him. I was curious why he was talking to me. He said to me ""hey where is the hat you stole from my store?"" ""I didn't steal a hat bro"" I answered back. ""You did, we got it on tape that you had the hat."" said the guy. ""Dude I did not take a hat"" I replied. ""Ok then what about your brother, where is he?"" questioned the guy. I told him where he was and he went there with one of the cops while the other stayed with me while I was making a purchase. At this point I was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing a hat. The cops started to ask me questions that were personal. I told I wanted to talk to my dad and tell him what is happening. My dad was pretty upset that my brother and I were accused of stealing. My dad was asking me questions of what happened, I told him the truth of what happened. As the cop, my dad and I were walking back to watch the film of the whole incident. We saw my brother walking back with the other cop. ""I'm good to go, the video shows me putting the hat back on the rack"" said my brother. I was still upset that the guy who worked at the store did not watch the whole film only bits and pieces of it. The guy apologized to my dad and I. I was still mad, because the guy did watch the whole film, and I didn't want the people who saw me with the cop to think I was a troubled kid. As my brother and I look back at this experience we laugh about it and make jokes. There is no reason to be mad about we didn't steal the hat and we knew it. Laughter makes us forget about it. I think without our laughter about it this, could have been different. Laughter makes experiences more fun there is always something to laugh about. It feels like you are take a bunch of weight of your shoulder makes you relived. I could have called the manager about how I felt, and what the guy did with the video, but I just forget about it and crack a few jokes to make myself laugh about it."
517	21361	8	3	@DATE2 turned out to be a day filled with confusion for the protagonist in the story. The beautiful weather and unexpected turn of events led to a series of misinterpretations and misunderstandings that left them feeling frustrated and puzzled. However, a simple phone call cleared up the confusion, and they were able to see the humor in their mistake. Sometimes, it's easy to get caught up in our own assumptions and overlook the simplest explanations. In the end, laughter and a realization of the truth brought a sense of relief and amusement to the situation. It's a reminder that sometimes, all it takes is a different perspective to see things clearly.
518	21364	8	3	"""Laughter is a key aspect of my life, bringing joy and connection in various situations. Whether sharing a moment with family and friends, creating memories with loved ones, or even spreading laughter through online platforms like YouTube, the power of laughter is undeniable. It has the ability to bridge gaps, strengthen relationships, and brighten even the darkest of days. While laughter may not always be positive, the moments of shared laughter and joy are what truly resonate in our hearts. Embracing laughter in our daily lives can bring us closer together and create lasting bonds that transcend distance and time. So, let's continue to find reasons to laugh, share those moments with others, and spread the infectious joy that comes with a good chuckle."""
519	21365	8	3	"People say ""laughter can cure anything,"" and I wholeheartedly believe in its power. Throughout my sixteen years of life, laughter has been a constant source of healing and comfort. There is one particular moment that stands out to me, a time when laughter was all I needed to find my way back to reality. My best friend, who always knows how to lift my spirits, played a crucial role in this experience. It was a challenging time for me, as I was dealing with unrequited feelings for a boy I had liked since seventh grade. Despite my efforts to win him over, nothing seemed to work, and I was left feeling defeated. In my moment of despair, I reached out to my best friend for support. Her words of encouragement and humor helped me see the bright side of things and brought a smile back to my face. As I navigated through my feelings and attempted to win the boy's affections, my friend's unwavering support and comical perspective kept me grounded. Despite the ups and downs, her laughter and positivity helped me accept the situation and move forward. As time passed, I realized that there are plenty of opportunities for love and happiness, and that I didn't need to fixate on just one person. Although my romantic endeavors did not unfold as planned, the friendship between the boy and me flourished. With my best friend by my side, I learned to find joy in the present moment and embrace the laughter that brought light into my life. Through her humor and unwavering support, I discovered the healing power of laughter and its ability to mend a broken heart. I am grateful for her presence in my life, as she helped me navigate through challenges with a smile on my face and a renewed perspective on love and life."
520	21366	8	3	"I slowly got up and watched as paint dripped off my face, my hair and clothes. A trail of paint followed me as I tried to hop from one clear spot on the floor to the next, but there weren't many clear spots. All that I could think of, was if I was going to make it to high school, or not. Trying my hardest not to get anymore paint on the ground, I opened the door carefully, and called out. ""Mom?"" I yelled half-heartedly, as I glanced back at the ""painted"" room.  ""Hey sweetie, what's going on?"" she hollered back up the stairs.  ""Mom, you see... I've had a paint mishap with the paint pan,"" I replied softly, hoping she wouldn't be too upset.  ""A paint mishap?"" she asked in a confused tone, as she walked up the stairs to see what had happened. I closed my eyes in fear as she turned the corner.  My mind raced as I tried to prepare myself for a lecture about being more careful, but instead, she burst out laughing. I couldn't help but giggle too, realizing how ridiculous I must have looked covered in paint. After a few minutes of laughter, we both composed ourselves and started to clean up the mess.  As we worked together to clean up the spilled paint, my mom joked about how lucky it was that she had put down plastic covering before letting me paint. I couldn't help but laugh along with her, grateful for her understanding and sense of humor. Once the mess was cleared up, we both looked back on the situation as a funny memory and a bonding experience.  I now know that no matter how big my mistakes are, my mom will always be there to forgive me and help me through them. This mishap taught me the importance of being careful and the value of having a supportive and understanding family."
521	21367	8	3	Making trips to the school's office was a common occurrence for me during elementary school. I had a habit of pretending to be sick in order to go home early, although my acting skills were starting to fail me. By fourth grade, the staff knew me well, and it became more challenging to deceive them. One day, my cousin and I missed the bus home, leading us to the office where the familiar office lady sat, ready to hear our explanation. However, a misunderstanding occurred, and I was wrongly accused of lying by my math teacher. Despite feeling ashamed at the time, looking back now, it brings a smile to my face. Years later, when reminiscing with my cousin about our childhood antics, we share these memories with laughter, strengthening our bond as family and friends. These moments of shared laughter are truly precious, reminding us of the joy found in the simple, silly moments of our youth.
522	21369	8	3	Laughter is truly a key to happiness in life. Being in a happy relationship where laughter is present can make all the difference. When meeting new people, sharing jokes and making them laugh is a great way to show that you are a happy person. Laughter can bring people together and create strong bonds. I always strive to make my family and friends laugh, as their happiness brings me joy as well. Even in tough times, finding humor and making light of situations can help lift spirits. Personally, I have found great fulfillment in bringing laughter to others through stand-up comedy. Seeing people leave a show with smiles on their faces is a rewarding experience. Overall, I believe that laughter and happiness can make the world a better place, and I hope to continue spreading joy through humor in my life.
523	21370	8	3	My smile is a mask. It disguises all the past tragedies, future mishaps, and current mistakes--loss. Life is a puzzle I cannot figure out. I am lost, and I am losing myself more as I delve into life. I isolate myself from the world, sleep in a bed of tear-soaked tissues, and stare at my face in the mirror that I despise so much. Laughter or even just a smile goes a long way--too long. It sends the wrong message to those who cannot tell if the mask is real or perfectly put on. That is the message I want to give, right? Eventually, my laughter diminishes, my smile fades, and my lips begin to quiver. It feels as though my heart is bleeding and being squeezed at the same time. My eyes become moist, they sting, and redden as if infected. Do not ask me if I am okay, ask to do anything for me, or hug me. Only pushing me to a breakdown, which is something that is unacceptable. Peace is the only thing needed at the moment, and of course, my best friend, tissue.
524	21373	8	3	In the ninth grade, I had to give a persuasive speech about a book. I was usually terrible at giving speeches, feeling nervous and experiencing physical symptoms like clammy hands and nausea. However, this time was different. The majority of my class was female, which created a more accepting atmosphere. As I stood up to speak, I felt a sense of readiness and support from my classmates. They listened intently, making eye contact and giving me their full attention. Using puppets and a cardboard box as a makeshift TV, I began my speech. To my surprise, the audience laughed in a positive way, encouraging me to continue. At the end, they clapped genuinely, showing their appreciation for my well-delivered speech. This experience taught me that laughter can be supportive and encouraging, rather than hurtful. It was a significant improvement for me, meeting all the requirements and receiving positive feedback. Laughter, in this case, had a positive impact on my confidence and performance.
525	21374	8	3	Love in a small town was a timid young boy named Alex, who lacked confidence due to constant teasing and taunting from his peers. Despite his intelligence, he felt isolated and longed for companionship. His heart was set on a girl named Sarah, who captured his attention with her beauty and charm. However, Sarah was often seen with her friend Emily, which fueled Alex's envy towards Emily for being close to the girl he admired.  Determined to make a connection with Sarah, Alex reached out to her on a social media platform and nervously asked to meet up. To impress her, he made an effort to improve his appearance and demeanor. When they finally met at a local park, Alex mustered the courage to express his feelings for Sarah, and to his delight, she reciprocated his affections.  As they spent more time together, Alex and Sarah discovered a deep connection based on shared interests and a similar sense of humor. Their bond grew stronger with each passing day, and eventually, Alex took a leap of faith and asked Sarah to be his partner for life. Overjoyed, Sarah accepted his proposal, and they embarked on a journey of love and companionship.  Their relationship blossomed, leading to a commitment to build a life together. Through laughter and shared experiences, Alex and Sarah found a love that was built on a foundation of genuine connection and understanding. Their story serves as a reminder that sometimes, all it takes is a little laughter to pave the way for a lifetime of happiness and fulfillment.
526	21375	8	3	Moving schools is never easy, especially for a fourth grader. I had been dreading going back to a new school all @DATE2 and the day had arrived. My @CAPS1 reassured me as I reluctantly walked onto the bus. As I scanned the seats it became apparent to me that I needed to try to make new friends or live out my fourth grade career a loner. The bus ride was a quiet one, I did not talk to anyone nor did they talk to me. The school day started like any other. First the teacher assigned everyone their seats in groups of two, I sat by a boy named @PERSON1. At first I thought my school life would remain a solo one, I wasn't sure what my seating partners problem was but no words were being exchanged. The rest of the day went by rather fast, before I knew it it was over. I had made it though my first day of school. The bus ride home was not much different than the ride to school, as I got off the bus at my house my mother was there to ask how my day went. After telling her all about it she said that I should try to just be myself and eventually I would make friends. It was @DATE1, I got up that morning with a sense of new found motivation. I got ready for the day and waited at my bus stop, I kept waiting for almost a half hour before I went to my mom. After phoning the school we discovered that my bus had been in a minor accident so I had to be driven to school that day. My mom was surprised but told me to get into the car and she would take me to school, just as we were pulling out of our driveway I notice @PERSON1, my seating partner, was waiting at his bus stop oblivious to what had happened. Screeching to a halt my mom rolled down her window to ask him if he wanted a ride. At first he seemed unsure but he took us up on the offer. The car ride was spent in silence, listening to the radio. We made it to school and me and @PERSON1 start walking to class. I don't know what got into me but I felt like running down the sidewalk to our classroom. Sprinting down the sidewalk while @PERSON1 is watching, I almost made it to class until one of the teachers decided to open their door. At full speed I ran head first into the door and fell backwards onto the sidewalk. After rubbing a major bump on my head I turn around to see @PERSON1 laughing hysterically. I got somewhat mad at first until I thought about it, and it was probably funny to the onlookers. Scraping my self off the cement I walk over to @PERSON1, We laugh about the incident and head to class. That day we spent the entire class talking, even getting into trouble a time of two. Ever since that day @PERSON1 has been a good friend of mine, its been eight years since we met and there is no end in sight. Overall in my opinion laughter is an important part of daily life, and a great way to make friends.  After that incident, @PERSON1 and I became inseparable. We shared many laughs and created countless memories together. Through thick and thin, we supported each other and navigated the ups and downs of school life. Looking back, I am grateful for that fateful day when our paths crossed, leading to a lifelong friendship built on laughter and camaraderie. Moving schools may have been tough, but it ultimately brought me a cherished friend for life.
527	21377	8	3	When I was young, me and my friends would play at the lake in the middle of an orchard. It was a place where we spent endless days swimming, laughing, and making memories. I remember one particular day vividly, the last day of school. We couldn't wait to get to the lake and jump in. The water was freezing cold, but that didn't stop us from having a great time. We laughed, swam, and played until the sun began to set. It was a day filled with joy, laughter, and friendship. As we gathered around the fire, roasting marshmallows, we made a pact to never forget that day and to always cherish the moments we shared together. That summer was one of the best of my life, and it all started with that unforgettable day at the lake with my friends.
528	21379	8	3	It was a sunny day in May, perfect for a parade in the bustling town of Springfield. I was excited to be part of the parade, marching alongside my best friend and her family on their float for the local animal shelter they owned. The float was filled with children in adorable animal costumes, handing out candy to the crowd.   As the parade went on, we couldn't help but laugh and enjoy ourselves, forgetting about the hundreds of eyes on us. We took turns holding twin babies on the float, who surprisingly behaved well despite the excitement. However, our laughter and exhaustion led to a mishap when the wooden rail we leaned on broke, causing us to fall in front of the amused crowd.   Despite the embarrassment, we managed to laugh it off with the help of our friends and family. We learned that laughter is essential in overcoming embarrassing moments and strengthening relationships. Looking back on that day, we cherish the memory of how laughter brought us closer together and helped us navigate through life's ups and downs. Laughter truly is the key to resilience and bonding in any relationship.
529	21380	8	3	When I was fourteen years old, my family and I started riding four wheelers out in the sand, thanks to my parents' friends who introduced us to the activity. The first time I went out, I had a small four wheeler that made me stand out among the group with their bigger vehicles. Despite the size difference, riding that little four wheeler was a blast, especially watching my brother push it to its limits. After that initial ride, we upgraded to a larger four wheeler, which I was excited to take out to the dunes for the first time.  On our dune adventure, my brother stole the show by fearlessly jumping his four wheeler, even attracting some spectators to film his stunts. His confidence and skills were impressive, but it all came crashing down when he tried to impress us further and ended up wiping out. It was a hilarious moment that we still laugh about today.  During another ride, my brother's need to show off led to another comical incident when he lost control on the concrete, resulting in a spectacular crash in front of a group of onlookers. His road rash served as a reminder that sometimes trying to be the center of attention can have embarrassing consequences.  Despite his knack for accidents while showing off, my brother's antics always add an element of humor and excitement to our rides. His mishaps have become a source of entertainment for us, making our outings to the dunes even more memorable and enjoyable. So, even though his attempts to impress may lead to some spills, they ultimately contribute to the fun and laughter we share as a family.
530	21382	8	3	"Have you ever had a friend who when you're with them you seem to be able to do nothing but laugh? I have, his name is @PERSON1. Together, him and I do nothing but spend countless hours making jokes, smiling, and enjoying ourselves. In any relationship, or friendship, laughter is an important quality. In the next few paragraphs I will explain why laughter is so important, and how it made his and our friendship so strong and compatible. To begin with, @PERSON1 is my closest friend. We both are very fun and outgoing people. We tend to put tense situations at ease by our sense of humors. This is important because without laughter you don't enjoy things as much. Someone once told me ""for every minute you laugh, it adds a year to your life."" That is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life. Together we make the @CAPS7 of the worst situations and move on from them. Laughing is something that no one can live without. It is one of those things can make the biggest change in someones life, whether that be in a good way, or even in a bad way. Laughter in our relationship is like glue. When things between us ever got rough, or just things in general got hard, we made it a point to make a joke out of it and try to forget what was wrong. One of the ways our sense of humor came in handy was when we found out he was getting deployed. If you have never been through that before, let me tell you, it's hard. I remember everything about that day, I was outside fixing our fence when i got a call from @CAPS1. When I answered his voice was timid and shaken, I had never heard him sound like that before. He then told me that he was going to come over and that he had something he needed to tell me. At first i wasn't too concerned because he has a tendency to joke around and almost never be serious, this time I was wrong. Within twenty minutes I could hear the roar of his red diesel pulling in our driveway. When he got to the door, instead of just walking in like normal, he knocked. To my surprise, as he peeked his head in, his face was as red as a cherry, eyes swollen and watering, and his voice quivering with sadness. I knew then that this was serious. After a miserable three hours of sobbing and hugs he explained to me that he would be leaving in four days to @LOCATION1. Taking all that in at once was hard. I knew he was in the army but I guess I just never thought that day would come. Finally we began talking more and more about it the exact details. We then started to @ORGANIZATION1 things that he could find there that would remind him of home. This turned into a day of jokes. Our first mission was to find a @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2, fail. Our second mission, @CAPS3-@CAPS4, another fail. And finally our third mission, was to find anything that reminded him of me. We came to the conclusion our @CAPS7 idea would be @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In return we got in his truck ad drove to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and purchased two high-tech @CAPS5 cams, and went home to set them up. That in itself was a memory I will never forget. When the day finally came to an end we realized that yes it would be hard for us, but we would not let that break us down. We then spent the next four days doing things he convinced himself ""he @MONTH1 never get to do again."" We spent hours playing @CAPS9-box, hours playing football in the yard, and even hours playing in a park swinging and sliding. The reality of it is, without laughter and fun, we would have most likely not have been able to deal with it. To this day we still plan a specific time, and ""@CAPS6 it up"" together. In conclusion, although things get tough and overbearing, there is always an escape. That escape for me and my @CAPS7 friend is laughter. When worse comes to worst, turn your favorite cartoon on, call the person who can always make you laugh, spend hours doing pointless, yet fun things, enjoy what you have at your fingertips, and laugh, you @MONTH1 never know when those things can up and walk away. Laughter truly is the best medicine for a happy and strong friendship."
531	21383	8	3	Many things are said to bring people together, but nothing can bring two people as close as a good laugh can. Laughing lightens the mood, brings out a winning smile, and can create tears of joy. It makes bad days manageable and great days fantastic. In my perspective, the world wouldn't go around without a good laugh every now and then. I cherish moments of laughter, especially one that happened during a school day in study hall. Sitting with my friend @PERSON1, we found ourselves in fits of laughter that made our eyes hurt. The idea of eyes hurting from laughing so hard, particularly for a blind person like @PERSON1, became an inside joke that we treasure. This humorous moment only strengthens our bond and brings joy whenever we recall it. Laughter truly brings happiness, joy, and love, and it can cure just about anything. Everyone should make sure to get their daily dose of laughter for a brighter, more positive outlook on life.
532	21384	8	3	It was the next day and my friend Sarah was going to come home with me. We talked about our plans for the week all morning. Some of our ideas included going to a movie, doing our nails, or going on an adventure around my neighborhood. We decided to try to do all of them since we had a few days to hang out. After school, we met at my locker and headed home. We ended up having to walk because my mom was working late. On the way, we stopped at a gas station for a snack. We finally made it to my mom's work, where she gave us money for coffee. We grabbed some coffee and headed back home, laughing at the sights along the way. We watched a movie, had dinner, and played games until we fell asleep. The next morning, we had breakfast and went to the mall with my mom. After shopping, we went home, played games, and talked about our crushes. The next day, we texted about our fun time and planned for more adventures ahead.
533	21385	8	3	"All of the memories that I've shared with my friends over the years are marked by the expression of an emotion. Usually they include an abundance of laughter and happiness, just enjoying life and being teenagers. But on the other hand, sometimes these memories are tinged with sadness: day-to-day frustrations, vital playoff games that we've lost by small margins, or the passing of important people in our lives. I think that these highs and lows are remembered most in our minds because they are accompanied by things that are auditory (laughing and crying) and our brains recognize them as being more important than a typical day. As children we're very impressionable, so if something makes us extremely happy or unusually sad, it's going to have an effect on us and be remembered.  I think it's known by everyone that teenagers aren't necessarily the most logical thinkers. Some people speculate that it is genetically programmed into our unborn brains that when we reach our teen years we will make a few silly decisions and possibly get into a small amount of trouble. I'll speak for my generation when I say that our actions aren't always completely thought out and sometimes we simply don't have a reason to explain the strange things that we do. For instance, my friend @PERSON1 has a peculiar and almost obsessive need to keep her car clean at all times. She washes it on multiple occasions throughout the month, and is convinced that driving slower helps to keep the dirt and debris from her mile-long gravel drive away from the candy-apple red paint on her @ORGANIZATION1. This wouldn't bother me, except that every day after school I go to her house along with our other friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON2, to kill time before practice. The group is always anxious to get away from school because we're tired, hungry, and just want to get to her house and relax, but @PERSON1 never gives in to our persistent begging and is perfectly content to drive at turtle speed. One day, @PERSON2 became fed up and said that she could probably run faster than @PERSON1 was driving. @PERSON1 decided to take her up on the offer, stopped her car, and @PERSON2 proceeded to get out and jog down the driveway alongside the car. Soon she was a good distance ahead of us, dancing and skipping toward our destination. However, she soon changed her mind and since the car was going slow enough, she climbed on the hood and we continued driving, slowly. We were about two hundred feet from @LOCATION1's house, just one small bend before we'd be there, when @PERSON1 realized that if her grandparents, who live right next door, saw us, then she'd be in trouble. She didn't care to enlighten the rest of us with the details of her mental observation and suddenly stopped in the middle of the driveway. @PERSON2 slid off the hood, granted we were only going about eight miles an hour, and momentum pushed her forward at a trot. She slid on the gravel road, landed on her rear, skipped across the ground, and then stopped.  Those of us who had remained in the car were in shock, our mouths agape, and we stared at her for the few seconds she remained sitting. She then stood up, turned to face us, and burst into hysteric laughter. We all let out a collective sigh and burst into hysterics as well, remaining in the same spot for a good five minutes. All of us were near tears and out of breath from laughing about the sight, we laughed randomly together throughout the rest of the day, and told all of our other friends about it.  We had realized that it was a stupid thing to do, and @PERSON2 could have been hurt. But she wasn't, and so we all shared in the camaraderie of the moment. Laughter has that ability to connect people. It takes effort to make someone laugh, to spark the emotional trigger inside them that tells their brain, ""@CAPS2, I'm having fun."" @CAPS3 crying is a sign of extreme sadness, laughter is a sign of joy and elation, an indication of happiness. It shows that you're enjoying what you're doing and want those around you to recognize it. I really enjoy my memories that involve laughter, and when I think of those memories I always laugh again. I think that laughter is one of the rare simple joys in life. You don't have to spend money or drive somewhere, there's virtually no expense. It's timeless, simple, fun. Laughter is infectious, and it has the power to bring people together in moments of shared joy and happiness. It transcends language and cultural barriers, creating bonds between individuals that can last a lifetime. In a world filled with challenges and uncertainties, the ability to laugh and find joy in the simple things can be a powerful tool for building resilience and strengthening"
534	21386	8	3	During the sixth grade, my parents decided to get a divorce. The news hit me hard, and I couldn't bear to face the reality of it. I found solace in staying at my best friend's house, where I felt safe but not truly happy. The concern in my mother's eyes when she came to pick me up after two weeks at my friend's house was evident, and I knew she was worried about me. The tension and silence on the ride back home only added to the heaviness of the situation. Things started to look up when my mother sent my sisters and me to our aunt's house, where I felt a sense of security. However, it wasn't until a fun day at the river with my friend that I truly felt a moment of joy and laughter amidst the turmoil of my parents' divorce.
535	21387	8	3	@CAPS10 you made someone laugh today? Laughter is often considered the best medicine, as it has the power to relieve stress, strengthen bonds, and create a positive outlook on life. When we share moments of joy and humor with others, it brings us closer together and helps us navigate through life's challenges with a lighter heart. So, take a moment to share a joke, a funny memory, or a smile with someone today, and spread the healing power of laughter.
536	21388	8	3	Family trip @CAPS1 the @DATE1 my family and I decided to have a trip to @LOCATION2. My father, who had recently woken up from a comma, was in a state of depression. The doctor recommended that my mother should start planning family activities and do some over the @DATE1 break. I was twelve at the time, and noticed how my father was coping with the fact that he had both of lost his arms. He tried to hide the fact that it was too much for him to handle, but that only worried us more about his health. My mother, along with my sister @CAPS2 and I decided to go out on a trip -to distract my father- and hopefully get him out of his depression.  On the day of the trip we headed out at about @NUM1 am from the apartments. My mother was the type of person who would always be early for anything. Overnight we had packed our bags and already had the stuff in the car. Since we lived in the upper apartments, my mother and I helped my father -since there was no way for him to keep himself balanced- while going down the stairs. He didn't seem enthusiastic about the whole trip, but I made sure to get my sisters excited and they kept on talking with my father in the car. A few hours later, one by one my sisters started falling asleep then my father started sleeping. My mother was starting to get drowsy so I stayed up and started talking to her about random subjects. As I kept her company she began telling me stories about her childhood - the laughs she would get when her cousins pranked one another- and so on. Some of the stories were so funny we tried not to wake everyone up with our laughter. Even though she had lived a rough childhood, her cousin @PERSON2 was the one that had always known how to make her laugh.  My father and sisters woke up and started to get carsick, so my mother ended up exiting towards @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. As we began to look for a gas station we began to hear loud music, and as we got closer we noticed that there was a carnival in the middle of the city. My sister @CAPS2 who was @NUM2-years-old at the time began complaining along with @PERSON1 who was eight-years-old. I tried to convince my parents, and my mother agreed but my father only got mad. That was until my sister @CAPS4 who was @NUM3-years-old began on ranting on and on, until my father finally agreed.  My mother parked the car at the nearby park and my sisters ran ahead of us to the carnival. My mother tried to catch up with them while I locked the car from the inside. As we arrived to the carnival, we saw stands filled with jewelry, clothing, and other small items. We kept on walking and saw a group of gypsies dancing on stage. Later on a comedian went up and he made everyone laugh in the audience. After watching the gypsies and the comedian, we started to look around. We ended up buying three @CAPS5 parasols and the fourth parasol was free. We thanked the saleswoman as we opened our parasols for some shade. The @DATE1 heat was starting to get worse, so we headed towards the car.  As we reached the car, my mother's face turned pale, she had left the car keys inside. She began arguing with me, and I began regretting the whole trip. I was exhausted and didn't want to argue. My father finally interrupted by telling us that he was going to search for a wire hanger from one of the stands in the carnival. As he left with my sister @PERSON1, the rest of us began walking towards the park. @CAPS4 began pouting and my mother kept on blaming me for locking the car, meanwhile I pretended I was deaf. After my father came back with a wire hanger, I began straightening it out and bending one side to create a hook. After many tries I still couldn't open the car, and my arms began to hurt. An old couple riding on a motorcycle parked next to us and asked us what we were doing. My father told them we had left the keys inside car. The old man helped us open one of the car doors. We thanked him and said goodbye as we went inside the car.  We decided to head home, exhausted from the whole trip. Even though the destination had changed we enjoyed the trip, and everyone quickly forgot about the incident with the keys. My mother and sisters started joking around, and for the first time since coming out of the hospital my father began laughing.

539	21391	8	3	I have been waiting a whole year for my special day to come, which is today, my birthday! I am turning a year older, and I am so excited to celebrate with my friends. While waiting for my mom to come home from work, I decided to go swimming and then on a hike. My older sister's friend was visiting, and they thought it would be fun to toss me into the pool, which upset me. Eventually, my mom arrived with pizza, and we prepared for my birthday party. To my surprise, my mom had organized a wonderful party with my friends. Despite a mishap with the birthday cake getting burnt, we had a fantastic time. The next day, I enjoyed playing in the pool with my new toys. However, a small mishap with the oven taught us a valuable lesson about checking before preheating. Overall, it was a memorable birthday filled with laughter and fun memories.
540	21392	8	3	"Gym clothes @CAPS1 People say laughter can bring together anyone. I do not know if that is true but, I do know that it can bring together two very unlikely @CAPS1. Me and my best friend are complete opposite yet we became best @CAPS1 over a simple joke in the locker room. It happened on a @TIME1 that was not going to great for me, or her. It was @DATE1 @TIME1 I had to go to school. I had woken up late just the missed, walked all the way to school and had already dropped my lunch in the hallway about three times when, I walked straight into @PERSON1. (my soon to be best friend) ""@CAPS2 where your going."" she said to me in a catty voice and stuck me with a pointed glare. Me being shy, i just ducked my head and kept walking. @PERSON1 was one of the prettiest girls in school and hung out with the "" In "" clique I, well I didn't. Most of the time I hung out by my self. Her @TIME1 had been going just about as well as mine was. Her @CAPS3 had broken up with her ,for her best friend, at the time,she also had stayed the night in the hospital with her brother who had been in a car accident. So she was in the same mood I was. What was even worse was our next class was @CAPS4.E.! I got into the locker room and as soon as I walked in I realized I had forgotten my gym clothes. @PERSON1 had just entered behind me and by the sigh she let out I knew she had forgotten hers to . We were going to have to use some from the bucket... The bucket was where all lost or unwanted items ended up @CAPS5 there was cool stuff like sweat shirts and @CAPS5 neat tee shirts but you could never be sure if they were clean. Today though, it looked like there was only guy clothes. I walked over to the bucket and @PERSON1 came over next to me. We both began to dig through the bucket. Finding nothing but over sized sweat pants and extra large shirts we @CAPS6 out the ones we thought were the best. We changed and as soon as our eyes met we both started cracking up. We looked like two little kids playing in their dads clothes. She could not let go of her pants or else they would drop around her ankles and the shirt I was wearing hung down past my knees. Neither of us stopped laughing until our sides ached and there were tears running down our faces. When the @ORGANIZATION1 teacher banged on the door we walked out of the locker room and the whole gym stared at us but we had found confidence and friendship in each other so, we didn't care. Sense that day @PERSON1 and I have been glued to each others sides as best @CAPS1. We have been through many fights but every time I think about that day in the locker room I can't help but to laugh. That is how laughter brought @PERSON1 and I to be best @CAPS1. Laughter truly has the power to bring people together, regardless of their differences."

We headed out from the house at about 2 o'clock PM. When we left the house, we headed for one of our friend's houses because we had asked them earlier if they wanted to go. So when we left, we had to leave fast so we were not on the road for a long time. When we got to our friend's house, we hung out for a little while then asked them if they still wanted to go on a ride with us. They got all ready, and then at about 2:45, we all headed out. All together now, there were about seven of us about to head up on Gillhooly on this ride. When we finally got to the top of the mountain, it was about 4 o'clock PM. So we just hung out until 5 o'clock. By the time we were all muddy, it was about 4:55 PM. So we set up some fireworks to shoot off. Then at 6, we shot all of them off. We started to head back home at about 8 in the evening, but one of our friends got stuck in some snow off the side of the road. We spent about a half-hour digging him out before we finally headed back home. We arrived back at the house at 9 in the evening. We all got something to eat because we were all hungry, then we watched a little TV and headed to bed for the night.
542	21394	8	3	I believe that laughter is a crucial element in building strong relationships and creating a fun and positive atmosphere. When we laugh with others, we bond and connect on a deeper level, making our interactions more enjoyable. Laughter can help diffuse tension, resolve conflicts, and strengthen our relationships with friends, family, and romantic partners.   In my own experience, I have observed how laughing together can enhance the quality of time spent with others. When I am with friends who share my sense of humor and enjoy laughing, our time together is always filled with joy and lightheartedness. On the other hand, interactions with individuals who are negative and lack a sense of humor tend to be more strained and less enjoyable.   I have also noticed the impact of laughter in my family dynamics. While my mother's cheerful and light-hearted nature creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, my father's more serious demeanor can sometimes dampen the mood. This contrast highlights the importance of positivity and laughter in fostering strong relationships within a family unit.   Ultimately, I believe that cultivating a sense of humor and a positive outlook on life can greatly enhance our relationships and overall well-being. By prioritizing laughter and fun in our interactions with others, we can create lasting bonds and memories that bring joy and fulfillment to our lives. Life is too short to dwell on negativity, so let's choose laughter and happiness as our guiding principles in all relationships and interactions.
543	21397	8	3	When I was in third grade, my parents decided that we should move to where my grandmother was born and raised, and where my extended family lived. I, being a determined third grader, was angry and adamant that I would not move. I even sat on the floor and refused to go. Despite my protests, we ended up moving three hours away from my hometown, leaving behind my friends and the familiar surroundings I had grown up with.   Being the new student at a different school was daunting, especially for someone as shy and quiet as I was. On the first day, my teacher took me around the school and then had me introduce myself to the class. It was a nerve-wracking experience for me, as I was not used to speaking in front of a group of strangers. The silence that followed after I spoke made me retreat into my shell even more, and I remained quiet for the rest of the day until lunchtime.  At lunch, a girl with freckles and glasses, similar to mine, approached me and we quickly hit it off. Her friendly demeanor and willingness to break through my shyness made me feel more at ease. We laughed, played, and had a great time together, making me realize that maybe moving wouldn't be so bad after all. She became my first best friend at the new school, and I am grateful to her for reaching out to me when I needed it the most.  Laughter played a crucial role in our budding friendship, bringing us closer together and making the transition to a new school less daunting. Without her kindness and willingness to make a new friend, my first days at the new school would have been much lonelier. The laughter we shared that first day at lunch set the tone for the rest of my time at the school, helping me find my place and feel like I belonged. It showed me the importance of reaching out to others and making an effort to connect, even in unfamiliar situations.
544	21398	8	3	From @CAPS1 to @CAPS2, laughter is an essential element in living life to the fullest. It keeps the soul young, the heart happy, and the spirit joyful. Without laughter, there may be a sense of emptiness that cannot be filled. One of my most memorable and hilarious moments involved a golf cart mishap that ended with a friend under the cart. Despite the initial shock and fear, we were able to laugh about the incident and continue enjoying our time together. This experience taught me the importance of making smart decisions while also embracing life's spontaneity. By following our instincts and finding humor in unexpected situations, we can truly appreciate each moment and live without regrets. So, laugh, take risks, and make the most of every opportunity – for life is meant to be enjoyed to the fullest.
545	21399	8	3	Laughter is a powerful expression that can convey a range of emotions and bring people together. It serves as a way to connect with others and show affection. However, laughter can also be used to mask true feelings of pain or vulnerability. In relationships, whether friendships or romantic partnerships, laughter plays a crucial role in understanding and supporting one another. A simple laugh or giggle can bridge the gap between two individuals and turn a situation around. Ultimately, laughter is essential for communication and emotional connection in any relationship.
546	21403	8	3	Laughter united us on our middle school music department field trip to a concert at a distant location. The journey was filled with bus rides, bathroom breaks, and unexpected incidents like a pretzel mishap. Despite some challenges, we enjoyed each other's company and shared moments of joy and laughter. At the concert, we showcased our musical talents and bonded over the experience. As we headed back home, reminiscing about the trip, we realized that laughter had been the thread that connected us all throughout the adventure. In the end, the memories we created together were filled with laughter and camaraderie, making the trip a truly unforgettable experience.
547	21404	8	3	Laughter is truly a wonderful thing that can bring so much joy and lightness to a relationship. I personally have experienced the positive impact of laughter in my own relationship with my boyfriend. Our ability to make each other laugh has strengthened our bond and helped us navigate through challenging times. Laughter has a way of relieving stress and adding a sense of fun and playfulness to our relationship. It is an essential ingredient that keeps our connection strong and our love alive. So, don't underestimate the power of laughter in a relationship, as it can truly make a difference in creating a happy and lasting partnership.
548	21405	8	3	"I don't think people today laugh enough. Laughing is said to be one of the healthiest things out there. I've heard that the more you laugh, the longer you live. If that's true, I should live forever! I believe laughing really is healthy for you.  I have a friend who's really sick right now, but when I'm with her I can make her laugh like crazy and it seems to make the pain go away. If I could cheer her up @NUM1 I'd be happy to do so. Yesterday her and I were together and I can't remember what we were talking about but it must of been good because she got me to laugh to hard that I threw up! I know that doesn't sound very fun, but even as I was coming up from doing that we were both still laughing. Times like that I can definitely look back and smile on. I love the effect laughter has on people. I've been sitting down at a bus stop and giggling or laughing for absolutely no reason and the people next to me will start laughing! That only makes me laugh harder then everyone's doing it! Also as long as you're with friends, or anyone for that matter, and you can laugh, that means you're having fun and enjoy each others company. I don't see the point in being friends with someone who can't at least make you giggle a bit.  The other day me and my friend were sitting in the car, it was dark, quiet and we were just talking. Out of no where my mom pops up saying, ""@CAPS1!"" (this always happens though.) @CAPS2 did we scream our lungs out. I guess we should have expected her to do something like that though. After we caught our breath, we both looked at each other only to start laughing hysterically at how silly that was.  Laughter really does bring people together, whether you're strangers or best friends. When you're laughing with someone you're usually laughing for the same reason, right? Just as my friend and I were in the car. That's what I love, because that means we have things in common."
549	21407	8	3	The laughter of my childhood brings back fond memories of my beloved puppy, named Buddy. Buddy, the runt of the litter with a quirky personality, never failed to make me laugh with his clumsy antics. Watching him tumble down the hill in our backyard brought endless joy to my sister and me. Reflecting on those carefree days, I realize the importance of laughter and joy in life. We should embrace the simple pleasures, appreciate the beauty of the world around us, and cherish the love of those close to us. Life is a precious gift, and we should live each moment with laughter in our hearts. Laugh, love, and enjoy the blessings that life has to offer, for we never know when our time on this earth will come to an end.
550	21408	8	3	In life, every individual experiences both good and bad days. On those tough days, it can be challenging to find reasons to be happy or to laugh. However, it is important to look beyond the immediate circumstances and consider the people around you. Surrounding yourself with positive influences can help lift your spirits and make the time you spend more enjoyable. Laughter is a powerful tool that can bring joy and excitement to your life, so it is essential to choose to be around people who bring out the best in you. By understanding and connecting with others on a deeper level, you can find a wellspring of laughter and happiness within yourself.
551	21409	8	3	Growing up with both of my parents and having my dads parents (my grandparents) has been the best thing for me. I spent a ton of time at my grandparents house when I was young. Every afternoon we got out of school an hour early, and my grandpa would be waiting for me without fail. We would go out for lunch, and I always looked forward to spending time with him. My grandma, on the other hand, was my homework buddy. She would help me with my schoolwork, and after I finished, I would join my grandpa in the yard for some quality time together.  One particular memory that stands out is when I accidentally sprayed my grandpa with the hose while watering the flowers. I was terrified that he would be angry, but to my surprise, he found it hilarious. We ended up laughing about it for hours, and that evening, we had one of the best dinners together as a family. My grandpa and I had a special tradition of enjoying root beer floats and watching movies, which I cherished deeply.  After my grandpa passed away, he left me his truck, which I now drive every day. The sound of the engine and blinker remind me of him, and I know that he is watching over me from above. I miss him dearly, but I am grateful for all the wonderful memories we shared together. Life may not be the same without him, but his presence continues to be felt in the little moments that we once shared.
552	21410	8	3	"When people think of football they think of the quarter back. When people think of basketball they think of the point guard. When people think of soccer they think of the goalie. Well when people think of softball they think of the pitcher. All these sports have one position where they are automatically put in a leader position. In softball the game always starts with the pitcher and usually ends with the pitcher. The pitcher is in every single play. Sometimes the pitcher pitches it and the big @NUM1 inch softball comes darting back at you before you even blink your eye and then the ball that you just threw underhand you now have to throw overhand to any of the four bases in a matter of seconds. To play a major position on a team and be a successful leader you need to be encouraging, helpful, and most importantly when the game is not going the way you want it to go, be able to stay calm and laugh and joke about the situation.  I have been pitching fast pitch softball for ten years, and the compliment I get the most often is ""you have the best pitcher's mentality I have ever seen"". It is so stressful to be in a really competitive game and have the whole game on your shoulders. Three people on base, one bad pitch right down the middle and it is over the fence. One pitch can completely change the game! At times like these when the pitch just didn't go the way it was supposed to go and your whole time just looks at you with this gloomy expression on their face. As the leader on the team you can't just act defeated as you feel. I have observed numerous pitchers who just completely give up and look defeated. By being a leader, the other athletes look to you to see your reaction. If you look like you have no hope, then players assume that the game is over and the very next play they will mess up and so on and it will just get worse. By smiling and encouraging your teammates, they see that the leader hasn't given up and neither should they, this is always better in the long run. Players tend to look at who as the most authority on the field and respond the exact same way as they do.  I play for a team that most of the players this is their second to third year. We are not a very good team but we practice hard and we never give up, it doesn't matter what the score is. In our league out of the seven other teams four are in the top ten in the entire state. One team in particular is @LOCATION1, they were first in state last year and were are very first game last year. By the third inning we were losing @NUM2. Even though I knew there was no possible way we were going to catch up, my goal was not to let them score again. In between innings I talked to every single player on my team, I tried cheesy jokes, inside jokes, anything to get rid of the tension. It worked and we played much better by having fun and being relaxed. Being in stressful situations people just have to find a way to laugh it off and see the bright side of any predicament and be able to get through it.  In conclusion, being a successful pitcher in softball requires more than just physical skill. It also demands strong leadership qualities such as encouragement, positivity, and the ability to remain calm under pressure. By setting the right example and maintaining a positive attitude, pitchers can inspire their teammates to perform at their best even in the toughest situations."
553	21411	8	3	We all need laughter in our lives to bring joy and happiness. Laughter helps us connect with others, whether it's friends, family, or romantic partners. It creates bonds and memories that last a lifetime. Laughter can make tough situations easier to handle and can bring people closer together. So, let's embrace laughter and cherish the moments of joy and happiness it brings to our lives.
554	21412	8	3	During my graduation day, I experienced a moment of embarrassing laughter that almost led me to pee my pants. It all started when my brother and friend were telling jokes in the park, and one particularly funny joke nearly made me lose control. Despite my pleas to stop, they continued, and I was left desperately searching for a bathroom. After a long and frantic search, I finally found a store with a restroom, but not before getting water on my pants. Although the situation was embarrassing, looking back, I can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. Laughter truly is the best medicine, even in the most awkward moments.
555	21413	8	3	Laughter is the only characteristic a person could perfect. Laughter is the element that could bring a group of people into a tight bond of friends. Laughter is the ultimate answer to success and happiness in life, and this is what the story of mine demanded me to say about laughter. Many times my family of four departs to go camping during the summer. Family friends enjoy coming along with us on these vacations. A couple summers ago while on a camping trip with my family and lots of friends, I experienced and learned what true, rich laughter could do that changed my life. Whether I learned from the telling of funny stories at campfire, playing little practical jokes on each other, or just some old friendly card games of hearts, I really began to realize what the these times had meant to me. My best gal friend and I were expecting these three boys to join us all week. When the time came that they should arrive my friend and I started plotting out our secret plan. It was the boys duty before they could go out to the lake and start boating, to set up their tent. They managed to make a ten minute task take two hours, bravo to them. The three lost boys were at the water now as they had finally finished and could stand not to be anywhere but the lake any longer. While they were down swimming my friend and I took their hard worked tent and ripped out the stakes to collapse it first, only to then turn it inside out second. What better way to welcome new comers then to start off things with a good sense of humor. The boys however didn't think it was quite so funny, however by noon fall they had a plan rising within them that my friend nor I knew was coming for us. Wake up call rolled around at about four in the morning for us two girls in a non-sound proof tent. We had a very loud wake up call that sounded as if the ducks were in a war zone against each other. We found out later, that the ducks found sandwiches mysteriously placed in a direct circle all around our tent. It was game on after the boys pulled that prank. It's hard for guys to get you back, if they're stuck in a tent. A zip tie would do the job. In the middle of the night, sneakily crawl over and zip tie their zippers together. Just as my friend and I thought this was the perfect way to get the boys back, one of our co-partners went and told the guys our plan. The three amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first. The next morning my friend and I woke, we tried to climb out of the tent and that was a little hard to do. Our zippers were tied together and that's not so great of mix when you have us girls that really need to use the restroom. One of the boys had a pocket knife with him and he was playing like cat and mouse with us, barely letting the knife out of our reach. When I finally had hold of the small blade, I ripped open the zippers, gently tossed the knife to the ground and ran to the ladies room. When I got back to blood on the ground, I found that it wasn't as gentle of a toss as I thought it was. The same guy that gave us the knife to use, put his foot in the way of the ever so slightly tossed knife. Once he was home his mom took him to the hospital to get stitches. Campfire that night was a hoot. Cards together was hilarious too because by the end we knew how each person was going to play, pretty much we knew who would win and who would come in dead last. Even with someone having a cut open foot we were on the ground rolling around because we're laughing so hard. My gal friend and I took off the make up and jeans, put on a baggy sweatshirt and up do with our hair and really just had a great time that night. It was the time together there on the camping trip and it was nice to know we were having a good time laughing, with just being our self's and expressing without trying to impress. Later as we're all talking about these stories and jokes pulled on each other, we came to recognize that these are the kinds of moments people live for. Laughing brought us closer together, we weren't friends before and now after our times shared we're exceptionally close best friends. Our friend relationship with each other was brought into contact by laughing in harmony together, by the time spent together, by harmless little jokes played on each other, by turning a camping trip into something much more meaningful.
556	21414	8	3	"Can you imagine life without laughter? Life would be so serious, and relationships would be so boring. That favorite comedy? Not funny. America's funniest videos, how can you not laugh! Laughter is a way to express emotions in a positive manner. What is it that relationships are built off of? Honesty, trust, understanding, and humor. Do you really want to be around someone who is boring? Because I don't. I believe strong friendships and relationships need laughter in them to keep them interesting. Many of my relationships have begun from a joke, laughter, or me being clumsy. I remember being in a class where I knew no one, and this is a very awkward situation to be in. I sat in the back of the class, with one other person, her name was Sarah. It started off quiet and no one saying anything, so I decided to tell an extremely cheesy joke. As soon as I told it, there was a silence afterward, where we just stared at each other. Seconds later we busted out in laughter, you know the kind of uncontrollable laugh, where you cannot breathe, and your tear ducts are overwhelmed to the point where tears slide down your cheeks? When this happened there is a sudden bond, a spark of friendship between the two of us. From that point we were inseparable. For the rest of the school year, we were partners on every project, multitasking our way through them. Half the time we would be making up funny scenarios, and laughing until we cried. The other half we would have make a fantastic project using the inspiration of each other to get the work done. I am an all-around ""laughter enthusiast!"" I can make the smallest things funny, it's a quality I enjoy very much. Who knew a silly joke could go so far? Laughter cannot be the only element to a developed relationship, you need trust, honesty, and various qualities to keep a healthy relationship. My point is, how can you maintain a friendship with someone you can't laugh with, or be yourself with? It is human nature to laugh, you can't always be serious. I don't think that I could go a day without laughing. Laughing can be the antidote for a frown. Moral of the story, laugh!"
557	21415	8	3	For my family, laughter is important because it signifies peace and happiness, especially in times of turmoil. I recall a particular @DATE1 eve when my parents were constantly arguing, causing distress to me and my siblings. Despite the tension, a moment of joy emerged when my father took us to work with him, giving us a break from the chaos at home. Watching my little sister navigate her newfound mobility brought smiles and laughter, easing the heaviness in our hearts. The next day, amidst the gifts and festive cheer, the absence of parental conflict brought a sense of relief and contentment to us all. Despite their eventual separation, the presence of laughter in our family continues to create moments of joy and togetherness, making our home a happier place. Laughter remains a vital thread that weaves us together, reminding us of the importance of finding joy in each other's company.
558	21416	8	3	Many people believe that laughter is a key part of any relationship. There are many times when even the slightest laugh is needed to break the tension, or relieve some stress every once in a while. It is often said that laughter is the best medicine, and also the cheapest. Laughter is easily found and common to come by. In my case, laughter comes naturally to my sister and I, and for no particular reason at all; it not only saved, but it built our relationship to what it is today.  When we were younger, my older sister and I did not get along very well at all. She would always tease me, then laugh about it; and I too would laugh at things that she did not find humorous in any way, shape, or form. This constantly caused conflict and many arguments between the two of us; therefore we hated each other and, in a sense, wanted nothing to do with each other.  As my sister and I grew older and wiser, we started to become much more alike. We still made fun of, teased, antagonized, and pulled childish pranks on each other; but instead of getting angry, we would just laugh about it instead. As we continued to make each other laugh, we found ourselves getting along so much better. Soon after that, we began hanging out more and more and just for the fun of it, not because our parents told us too. Before we knew it, my sister and I were best friends.  It is rare to hear about siblings being best friends. I am lucky to be able to say that my older sister is my best friend. Personally, I feel that laughter has played a huge roll in the relationship between my older sister and I. Now we depend on each other because we both know that no matter what, we can always make one another laugh and virtually cheer each other up. We hang out when we need to get away or when we have something that we need to get off our chests. We know we have each other for that because we know we can always laugh about it in the end.
559	21418	8	3	"Laughter is an interesting emotion. It's one that you expect to feel when you are happy or humorous. This, however, isn't always the case. Some people laugh when they're embarrassed or uncomfortable. Others, when they're enraged and upset. And then, there are people who laugh when they are grieving or sad. People don't expect that to happen. To laugh when you are depressed. It is strange but true. I know this from personal experience, which led up to one of the most tragic events of my short life.  I was about nine. The age @CAPS4 you're hyper and energetic almost nonstop. I had just arrived home from school and walked in the front door. My mom was waiting for @CAPS3 inside. ""@CAPS1 on @CAPS2,"" she said. ""We're going to see your grandparents for a few hours."" I was upset. I was not only tired and hungry, but I had to drive almost an hour away to see my grandparents. So I did what any nine year old would do. I cried, whined and pleaded her not to go. She didn't listen of course. She toned @CAPS3 out, waited until I was out of air, and then picked @CAPS3 up and tossed @CAPS3 in the car.  Isn't taking a nap great? That's exactly what I did on the ride over. I was clapped-out, so I felt it was alright to have a little ""@CAPS3"" time. When we got to their house, I had just woken up and didn't feel like moving. I had to force myself to get up and say hello. It was depressing, yet fascinating really. Seeing your grandparents is like seeing a glimpse of the future. In the sense that you know what your going to look like when you're old. They had candy though, which was tasty and mouth-watering. We actually stayed for quite a few hours. My mom called my dad a couple of times asking if we could go home, but we never did. She just had a conversation with my grandparents while I watched television. At last, my dad finally called to say we could @CAPS1 home. We said goodbye and booked it before it was too dark out. By the time we got home, it was pitch-black outside. We still hadn't eaten yet and I was starving. I jumped out of the car and walked over to the gate that separated the front yard from the back. I shook the gate, expecting three delighted dogs to run up and start jumping on the gate wanting to play. Instead, only two showed. ""@CAPS4's @CAPS5?"" I wondered. I thought he was most likely eating or sleeping so I decided to just go inside and eat. When I opened the door to the house, both of my parents were standing in the entry way. I could tell they were trying to hold back tears. Then it hit @CAPS3 like a ton of bricks. ""@CAPS5 passed away,"" my mom said. I froze. I didn't believe them. I couldn't. My best friend in the world was gone. I cried for hours, possibly more. I didn't know what to do. Then something weird happened. I started to laugh. I don't know why I did. Maybe it's because I wanted to try to cheer myself up. Or maybe, I realized he was in a better place. To this day I still feel an empty space in my heart @CAPS4 my best friend once was. I still think about why I laughed that day. I think about why we laugh in general. Whether it's when you're happy, angry, or even sad, we laugh to try to get by and make the best of both good and bad situations. As tragic as the situation was, I can't help but feel happy. My best friend was in pain and could barely walk, so we had to euthanize him. I knew it was the right thing to do, and quite frankly, I don't think I would have felt better if I hadn't laughed that night. It was awkward at first. It felt wrong and terrible, but it helped @CAPS3 more than I could have ever anticipated. Laughing through the pain may seem strange, but sometimes, it can be a coping mechanism that helps us navigate through difficult times."
560	21419	8	3	The power of laughter in strengthening relationships is undeniable. A single laugh can bring people together, even after difficult times. In my own experience, laughter played a crucial role in repairing a friendship that was strained by a mistake I made. The incident occurred during my soccer season, where I found myself in a forbidden relationship with a teammate. What started as a seemingly innocent connection quickly spiraled into a series of events that led to betrayal and heartache. However, through it all, I learned valuable lessons about the consequences of my actions and the importance of honesty and trust in relationships. Despite the pain and embarrassment, I eventually found the courage to apologize to my friend and mend our bond. Now, looking back, I am grateful for the laughter we share, as it serves as a reminder of our resilience and the strength of our friendship. Laughter truly has the power to heal wounds and bring people closer together, even in the face of adversity.
561	21421	8	3	Green is not my favorite color, but laughter is definitely one of my favorite things in life. It has the power to bring people together, increase happiness, and create unforgettable memories. One particular memory that stands out is from a pool party I hosted on a warm day in the summer. After cleaning the pool and texting my boyfriend about the color of the water, a hilarious misunderstanding led to my friends bringing me gifts to help with my supposed illness. The party continued with laughter and joy, and even after everyone left, the night took an unexpected turn when a baby's green vomit ended up all over me. Despite the mess, I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. This memory, along with the nickname my friends gave me, will always be a reminder of the power of laughter and the joy it brings to our lives.
562	21422	8	3	Laughter is a crucial element in building relationships and creating lasting memories. It allows people to connect on a deeper level, share emotions, and simply enjoy each other's company. The shared laughter between family members, friends, and loved ones can create bonds that last a lifetime. Memories filled with laughter are often the most cherished and vivid ones, as they bring joy and happiness to our lives. Whether playing games, sharing jokes, or simply enjoying each other's company, laughter has the power to bring people closer together and create lasting connections. So, let's cherish those moments of laughter and continue to create new memories filled with joy and happiness.
563	21424	8	3	"Laughter is the expression of being happy, being able to be yourself around the people you care about, and expressing your feelings. Anyone can share laughter with anyone, even if someone you don't know very well or someone you have known for a long time and don't talk anymore, make someone else feel good by sharing a laugh with them. Last year my close friend, @LOCATION1 and I were together all the time almost every day. We always make each other laugh at the silliest little things, even if no one else understands what we are talking about. We can make laughter out of any small thing. We hang out a lot so that makes it easier to share our laughter with each other. One day in class we were just sitting in class reading a book and I turn around, there she is sleeping, with drool coming out of her mouth. The room was quiet, I was trying not to laugh really hard I started giggling. I poked her and she woke up and had her hair stuck to the side of her face. It was so funny, I couldn't hold it in anymore. She had a confused look on her face then I pulled out my mirror and showed her what I was laughing at, then she started laughing too. She fixed her hair and wiped the drool away. Then the teacher walked over to us and asked us if we had a problem. We looked at each other and giggled then replied with no we do not have a problem here. The next day we were walking to the commons after we had come back from @ORGANIZATION1 and we heard one girl say to another girl, ""is that all you do is talk crap about your sister?"" @CAPS1 girl was not a regular girl, she had purple faded dyed hair and teeth that stuck out over her bottom lip, which made the whole thing even more hilarious. @LOCATION1 and I looked at each other and were like holy crap did that really just happen right there? We started laughing after we were out of ear shot so she could not hear us laughing at her. We laughed about that for the rest of the year. Every time we saw her after that we called her ""girl with purple hair"", because no other girl at our school at the time had purple hair so it was really easy to spot her out of a crowd. Still to this day laugh every once in a while about that situation. A few weeks later after that had happened we had seen her former boyfriend hanging out with a group of girls so we went closer to see who they were, I did not know any of them, but I saw a couple of them and knew that they were freshman. @LOCATION1 gives them a dirty look and says he definitely downgraded since I dated him. There was one certain girl that was literally hanging all over him. She was not even pretty at all. She had a short haircut, but her hair was all greasy, it was like she had put lots of gel or had not taken a shower in two days. The girl was wearing clothes that were obviously way too small for her, you could see half of her upper body just exposed there. It was really trashy. We started laughing really hard because it was so obvious she was trying to get his attention and he was totally ignoring her. @LOCATION1 looked at me and we both starting laughing. I am not really sure what she was laughing at, because I was laughing at the girl hanging all over @LOCATION1's former boyfriend. The next day we were in @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class and I made a comment about someone being stupid and a student in the classroom tried to get me in trouble for it, but luckily my teacher liked me a lot better than the other student, because that person got in trouble way more frequently than I have. Later on in the day I got called down to the office because the vice principal needed to speak to me. He said a student has a problem with me calling him stupid. I have had lots of issues with that person and I told the vice principal that he is very obnoxious, and I also explained everything else that happened earlier. The vice principal told me that I am not in trouble because he was trying to start an issue. We laughed because he tried to get me in trouble and it did not work, then we both laughed because that student is a troublemaker. I have learned that throughout life you need to have a good laugh every now and then because laughter expresses your feelings and sometimes it just makes you feel really good. I know that with my experience I need to have those close people to make me laugh, also to get me through anything that I am going through. Laughter is truly a universal language that can bring people together and create lasting memories."
564	21425	8	3	Many people say that the people who laugh more live longer. I remember when I was ten years old, I was going to learn how to ride a bike. Little did I know it was going to be a hard task. My brother said I didn't need training wheels. Although I was scared, looking at other kids ride their bikes made me gather up courage to learn how to ride a bike.  It was the big day, it was a perfect day to learn how to ride a bike. As I walked down the stairs all geared up and ready I began to feel nervous. I went outside, my big brother was waiting for me. He had a helmet and the bike, he began to go over the basic rules. Slowly I started to get on the bike, I was confident I could do it.  Next it was time to gear up and put my helmet on. My heart was pounding, I could feel my blood going through my veins. Giving the first peddle I fell and hit the ground extremely hard. All I wanted to do was run home and cry on my moms lap. I looked up at my brother, he asked me if I was okay. Up until this day I can remember laughing instead of crying, after all crying wasn't going to make the pain go away nor teach me how to ride a bike.  Finally, I got back on that bike and peddled and peddled. I can remember my brother telling me that laughter is the best medicine around. I was laughing as a peddled, sometimes I think that maybe laughter is what made me accomplish my goal to learn how to ride a bike. in my life laughing and smiling and having fun is a big deal. You can't always take laugh too seriously.
565	21426	8	3	When I was adopted, I didn't know what to expect. Thoughts ran through my mind of what the family and home were like, and if they would like me or not. I was going to have two new sisters named @PERSON2 and @CAPS3. Sitting in the passenger seat of the black @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS4, my heart began to pound harder with every passing street, coming closer each second to the home that would soon be mine. As we approached the driveway, a well laid out, one-story blue house came into view. Welcoming me at the door was a tall, well-built man named @CAPS5, along with a friendly white pit bull named @CAPS6. Inside, I met @PERSON1, who exuded warmth and acceptance, and @CAPS3, my new little sister, with whom I instantly connected.  The days passed, and I gradually settled into my new home. Despite some initial challenges in connecting with @CAPS3, a breakthrough came during a @CAPS18 @CAPS19 fundraiser where we shared laughs and stories, forging a bond that grew stronger with each passing day. Our relationship blossomed, and today, @CAPS3 is not just my sister but also my closest friend. I cherish the moments we share and the pranks we play on each other, grateful for the love and connection we have found within our family.
566	21427	8	3	Laughter helps in so many situations throughout life. When you're angry, sad, nervous, or even mourning, laughing about the good times you had with an old friend can bring light to dark moments. Many times, when faced with upsetting situations, the people close to us can help by making us laugh, showing us that things aren't as bad as we may have initially thought. I remember a time when a classmate made a hurtful comment about my weight, causing me to feel upset and tearful. However, when I shared this with my mother, she made me laugh by pointing out the boy's own flaws, helping me see the situation in a different light. Laughter not only helped me feel better but also made me realize that I was making a big deal out of a minor incident. It's moments like these that show the power of laughter in shifting perspectives and bringing positivity to challenging situations.
567	21428	8	3	In order to laugh, one must be happy. I used to be happy until I made some mistakes that I deeply regret. These mistakes have caused me to feel disappointed in myself, to the point where I find it hard to be in a place I don't want to be. My life was once perfect, surrounded by my brothers, parents, and the love of my life. Now, I realize that nothing is worth being away from them. I miss the laughter we used to share, and I long to be back home or at school instead of where I am now. Despite my current situation, I try to put on a smile and remember the happiness I once had. My previous life was filled with joy, especially the moments spent with my beloved partner, my babygirl. I treasure the limited time I get to talk to her and my family every day, even though it pains me that it's through a phone with poor connection. The impact of my actions weighs heavily on me, affecting not only myself but also my loved ones, especially my younger brother who cries over not being able to see me. The thought of their pain is almost unbearable, and writing about it now brings tears to my eyes. However, I am determined to make things right when I get out and bring back the laughter and happiness that we once shared. Despite not foreseeing my current situation, I am focused on returning home to put a smile on my family's faces, especially my girl, whom I can't wait to shower with love and kisses. When I see her, I will give her the biggest kiss to make her cry and laugh with joy.
568	21429	8	3	"The @CAPS1-inspirational, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 I @CAPS5 the @CAPS6 of @CAPS7 -- @PERSON1. What is @CAPS13, exactly? Some might say, ""@CAPS8, that's obvious. @CAPS13's a sound, emitted from a person when they think something is funny!"" That's as good a response as any other, and certainly quite believable. But I believe laughter has a much deeper definition; a definition that can only be explained through a marginally-humorous, less-than-inspirational story about my experiences as a @CAPS9-@CAPS10-@CAPS11 basketball player. This year, as a high school sophomore, I decided to do something I'd never done before: go out for the basketball team. I was inspired by a longing to become more involved in the school district, and to be able to exercise throughout the rain-drenched winter months in which @CAPS13 took place. Having only picked up a basketball in order to steer clear of the ""sit-outs"" zone in middle school @LOCATION1, my performance at early practices was comparable to that of a high school dropout determining the orbit of the planets around the sun; and at least they get a calculator. Naturally the year I decided to give basketball a shot, the coaches informed us that seven unlucky individuals would be plucked from the team with joyous abandon. Through sheer force of determination, I improved enough in our first few weeks to be deemed ""better than dirt"" by the coaches; narrowly avoiding losing my spot on the team. In the months ahead, I would learn that my job wouldn't be making baskets and stealing balls... As astonishing as @CAPS13 was, my ability to imagine myself playing basketball far surpassed my actual skills on the court. I soon found that my place on the team wouldn't be aggressively running up and down the court fighting for control of an orange ball; I would be on the sidelines, cheeks firmly planted on the bench upon which my teammates would take breathers before going back into the action. Our team could play basketball, but not often on the same level as the teams we faced. As each game came and went, I could see the fighting spirit fizzling out of my peers' eyes; their morale was simply dropping, and no amount of my ball-playing abilities could change that. @CAPS13 was one game in particular twhen I discovered I didn't have to play in order to help my team. @CAPS13 was a home game, in our lower gym; we were down by about @NUM1 points against a team we had fared @CAPS8 against previously. Needless to say, players were becoming very frustrated. One of our star players, @PERSON2, was becoming so frustrated that our coaches decided to pull him out for a breather. He was raging, spitting profanities. He dropped himself on the bench with the elegance of an enraged walrus. His mom came down from the stands to give him water, which only made him embarrassed him more. Sitting beside @PERSON2, I could feel the anger radiating off of him. He was ranting under his breath over number @NUM2, the opposing team's point guard. I noticed that while @NUM2's fast legs and swift hands made him a great ball-player, his voice -- a good octave above his teammates' -- was much more @CAPS8 suited for covering @ORGANIZATION1 songs than calling out plays. I turned towards @PERSON2, tapping him on the shoulder, and informed him of my insight. He looked at me for a moment, a mixture of anguish and ""don't-talk-to-me-or-I-will-murder-@CAPS12"" on his face before bursting out laughing. Clapping me on the back, he said with a smile: ""@CAPS12 always know @CAPS4 to make us laugh, @PERSON1"". Suddenly @CAPS13 dawned on me that my banter and dripping sarcasm was quite often the one thing keeping smiles on my teammates' faces. I was able to use @CAPS7 to diffuse tense situations, and allow emotions to flow freely in a more positive manner. We lost the game. In fact, we lost all but one game the entire season; and so I made @CAPS13 my personal duty to keep the entire team in good spirits even in the worst of times. As the weeks went by, I started to feel more and more an integral part of the team; making teammates laugh kept their minds clear of anger and frustration, and allowed them to play to the best of their abilities. And so @CAPS13 was. Some players had quick hands, others had a flawless shot. Me? I made people laugh. I gave my peers,"
569	21431	8	3	Laughter plays an important role in everyone's lives. Different laughs represent various things. For instance, have you ever heard someone chuckle and know right away that they are being sarcastic, or maybe even sympathetic? A laugh can say a lot. I'm going to tell you about the time my friend fell into an icy pond.   In early winter, my friend was visiting me at my house for a week. The third morning of her stay, we woke up to seven inches of snow. As my friend, who was from a place with no snow, anxiously laughed at the sight, I could tell she just wanted to go outside immediately. We bundled up and headed out, with my friend eyeing the frozen pond on my property. She jokingly asked if we could go swimming, but I quickly dismissed the idea. However, she was determined to walk across a log over the pond, despite my warnings.   As she danced on the icy log, I couldn't help but laugh at her antics. Predictably, she slipped and fell into the freezing water. After a moment of shock, I managed to pull her out, and we both ended up laughing despite the chilly situation. Back at the house, we changed into dry clothes and spent the day sipping on hot beverages, sharing laughter and creating memories. It was a day filled with unexpected adventures and laughter that we would both remember fondly.
570	21432	8	3	"Laughter forms a bond between two people; a good laugh can turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A fantastic example of the power of laughter would be the first time I met my mother's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen and since then I had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life. This iron clad resolution ended when my two sisters and myself sat down to dinner with @ORGANIZATION1. One @DATE1 @TIME1, my mother announced that she had invited her new boyfriend over meet her children. My sisters and I were forced to scrub the house from top to bottom in order to prepare for our guest, while my mother cooked a giant pan of lasagna. When the house was clean and the dinner was cooked, I dressed for this most grievous occasion. My obsessive compulsive mother made me change clothes at least thirty times before she deemed me presentable enough to meet the man whose existence I was beginning to despise. At precisely six thirty in the @TIME2, @PERSON1's blue @ORGANIZATION2 pulled into our driveway. I shot my mother a steely eyed glare as I opened the door for the buffoon; thus, a most dreaded dinner began.  My determined hatred began to soften as soon as I saw @PERSON1, but it was by no means expired. @PERSON1 was tall and tan, a few years older than my mother judging by his wrinkle strewn skin and the silver streaked through his dark hair and matching mustache. He had the sort friendly, pleasant appearance that makes him immediately likable. My now giddy mother and her sullen children sat down to eat with the cheerful stranger. My younger sister warmed up to him first. She and @PERSON1 share a love of snakes, lizards and all things I deem ""creepy crawly."" A common interest brought them together before I knew it. My older sister adored @PERSON1 after a lively conversation about football ensued. @PERSON1 and my sister discovered they were both @CAPS1 fans, and consequently formed a bond over their team.  After winning my siblings over, @PERSON1 tried to charm me into liking him to. He attempted to talk of movies, music, sports, animals, even politics, but nut nothing he said could melt my icy disposition. I was determined to hate him from the start of the @TIME2, and no amount of charisma would break my persistent stubbornness. Eventually he gave up on me, and focused on entertaining the people who did like him. Over dessert he jumped into a stand-up comedy routine cleverly disguised as a story about his recent flight to @LOCATION1. He went on about the ridiculous security checks, the overly cheerful flight attendants who really hate their job, and the corny safety videos. I had tears of laughter in my eyes before I remembered that I had made a solemn vow to loath @PERSON1. I fought hard to resume my former demeanor, but my will did not stand a chance against @ORGANIZATION1's sense of humor. The triumphant smile and slick wink he shot me from across the table told me that he had won. Sure enough, we were the best of friends before the night ended.   Eventually @PERSON1 and I conversed about movies and music and found we had similar tastes in both, but our common interests had nothing to do with our friendship. They simply fueled the fire. The power of laughter brought us together like a magnet and a washer. Just as the shortest distance between to points is a straight line, laughter was the straight line between myself and @PERSON1. He and my mother are still together, and ever since he came into our lives, laughter has been our constant companion."
571	21433	8	3	The warm day spent with friends at the mall, followed by lunch and fun at the park near the river, turned out to be even better than expected. Laughter and joy filled the day, reminding us of the importance of happiness in life. Laughter is a key aspect of life, bringing people together and creating memorable moments. The ability to laugh and find joy in simple things is essential for a fun and fulfilling life. This day served as a reminder to cherish these moments and appreciate the happiness that comes with them. Laughing often is a way to connect with others and bring lightness to everyday life.
572	21434	8	3	"The time I went @CAPS1-wheeling! One time when I went @CAPS1-wheeling with @PERSON3, @PERSON5, @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and I, we went up @ORGANIZATION1. This is the arrangement of who was in what trucks. It was @PERSON2 and I in my @CAPS2 @NUM1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON4 in his tracker @NUM1, and @PERSON3 and @PERSON5 in his @NUM3 wheel drive jeep @CAPS3. When we started to head back down the mountain, @PERSON3 let @PERSON5 drive down. @PERSON5 can't see very well at night because she wears glasses and her eye sight's not very good. Well, I was following them down the mountain and we finally got to the pavement, and @PERSON5 was going pretty fast for that road because it's a narrow, curving road, and that was the first time she had ever been on it before. She went to go around a really sharp corner and got up on two wheels and flipped over right in front of me, so I had to slam on the brakes so that I wouldn't run into them. So, I shut my truck off, ran over there as fast as I could, and helped @PERSON5 out of the truck. When I turned back around to go help @PERSON3 out, he was already on top of the truck. He looked at @PERSON5 and said, ""@CAPS4, look at what you did to my truck, I have tried many times to roll it and never have been able to - god damn you!"" So, we all started laughing, and then I got a chain out of the back of my truck and pulled him back over. Then it was really quiet, and @PERSON4 farted, and we all started to laugh again. Well, then @PERSON3 found out that he got a hole in his radiator. I had to pull him back to his house, and it seemed like the longest drive ever because his truck weighs way more than mine, so I had to pull him home in @CAPS1 wheel drive, and you can't go over thirty in @CAPS1 wheel drive because things can break. So, we finally got to his house, and his dad came outside and he saw the truck and was really upset because he gave that truck to him as a graduation present, and he messed it all up. Then he finally cooled off because he said no one was hurt, and he was glad for that. So, we went inside the house, ate dinner, and went to bed. The moral of the story is to be very careful because things can happen when they are unexpected."
573	21436	8	3	We all know the benefits of laughter. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Is there anything more to laughter? Can one person be happy without laughing? I have never gone a day without laughing. I know the benefits of laughter. Do you? I know the benefits of laughter. Its truly amazing how something so simple can bring people together, make friends and fix relationships, or make someones day a little better if they are having a rough time. There was a time in ninth grade when my best friend and I got into an argument because I didn't ask him to be on our basketball team for a tournament that happened once a year. After talking it out, and my best friend cracking a few jokes, it had fixed everything. My point is that laughing can release tension, not make everything so serious. Laughing can help you make friends too. Around the world, simple laughter can bring two or more people together. What about enemies? Laughter could possibly show you something you like in that person your not too fond of. Laughter happens to be great for health too, and its a proven fact. What happens when you are really stressed about a test you had recently taken or something different? There are a lot of ways to handle stress, but a really good technique is simply laughter. Try going onto the internet to find something funny that will make you laugh, go hangout with a friend or group of friends, or go and find something else that might have you laugh a little. A famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 always gets nervous before one of his shows, and it just so happens that laughter is something he uses to shake off his butterflies. Its quite amazing how laughter can help you in many situations.  Do you ever find yourself feeling down or stressed? Have you had a good laugh recently? Laughing will probably help. If you are having trouble bonding with a friend or simply having a bad day laughter will be a great cure. Laughter is great for your health, and laughter has helped me in my life so far. and whether you realize it or not laughter helps you to. Your laughter can help others too! Next time you feel down or need something to lift your spirits have some fun with friends or do something you enjoy that might give you a good laugh. Laughing is truly a universal language that can bring people together, heal wounds, and improve overall well-being. Embrace the power of laughter in your life and see the positive impact it can have on yourself and those around you.

577	21441	8	3	"An argument is defined as ""A discussion in which disagreement is expressed."" In many cases, a proverbial ""gap"" is created between the two conflicting parties. Without a way to bridge this gap, the two groups, or individuals, will not come to a settlement, and continue arguing until one or the other backs down and accepts the others point of view. Laughter, can serve as this bridge. The door slammed shut and I went straight to my room. I had returned home from what had started out as a good time with one of my oldest friends. Looking back I do not remember what it was about, all I knew was that I was not going to speak to him ever again; but being as young as I was, these such thoughts rarely last. I would see him every day during the school week, but it would not matter whether he was there or not. He was absent to me as long as we fought. This seemed like a good plan, to completely ignore each other until we had calmed down, but as with any plan, things never go quite as well as you want them to, especially when you are in the same elementary school, and in the same class. In elementary school, or at least in my case, there were many group activities, and when you are paired with the person whom you are not on the best terms with, things become difficult. Whether it was to build something, write together, or solve a math problem as a group, communication and teamwork are both important, and us fighting did not effect the group well. We would each discuss the best way to go about performing the task at hand with another member of the group with whom we were not fighting with, and then they would discuss and consult each of us separately. In short, it was a mess, and much more difficult than it should have been. Outside the classroom, the fighting persisted. At recess we would not agree to be on the same team, or even be on the same side of the field as one another. After about a week of this, I realized this needed to stop. At recess, I tried to get him to talk out our problem instead of shouting at, or ignoring each other. The calm resolution to the problem started out well, but being children, ended in a shouting match, to which I lost. I began to wonder if we would ever resolve this. When I got home that day, my mother, being a mother and always knowing when something is wrong, asked me what was bothering me. I was resistant at first to explain things, but, being a mother, she talked me into telling her. She started to go on about how I needed to be the mature one and that we needed to calmly talk out our differences, which I had already tried. I began to tune her out and imagined my friends mother giving him the exact same speech. By the time she was done, all I had received from the lecture was that I needed to try again. The next day at recess, I searched for him with the intent of resolving things today, no matter the circumstances. When I found him and attempted to talk things out, it once again turned into a shouting match. Nearby friends started to crowd and we kept at it. Suddenly, in the midst of the yelling, my friend, with whom I had been fighting with for the last few weeks began laughing. I was taken aback and thought about what could possibly have happened for angry shouting to turn into laughter. Looking around I saw nothing out of the ordinary, only a few snickering bystanders. I ran what had just occurred back through my mind. Just as I reached the point where he started laughing I had realized I had inadvertently made a joke while we were yelling at each other. This realization caused me to laugh, and everyone else nearby to laugh. After we stopped laughing, we sat down and talked things out like we should have done from the start. We questioned why we were still fighting over something as unimportant and trivial as this. After about five minutes of talking, we agreed to still be friends and that we would try to talk things out in the future before shouting at each other. When a teacher blew a whistle and recess had ended, I walked back to class feeling happy, and relieved that we had finally worked things out and could continue being friends. If I had not made that joke in the middle of our fight, I am not sure if we would have made up, even in the event we realized how pointless it was. Laughing during an argument will not solve your problems for you. However, laughter can create a bridge across the gap, and provide a common ground in which problems can be solved."
578	21442	8	3	When someone first meets me, there is always a small wall to climb before we can really get to know each other: my laugh. I have this weird awkward nervous laugh, almost like a giggle, that I don't even hear. Others do though. Especially when they first meet me. I think that most times it helps people get to know me faster. But other times, I think it is a hindrance to getting to know me. When someone first meets me they usually always comment on my laugh. They either seem slightly thrown off by it, or they easily open up and joke around with me. They always tell me about it: how odd it is, how much I do it, what it's like, etc. As if I've never been told about it before. But, this is fine. I don't hear it come out and I don't mind being told. I don't really think of it as a bad thing. When they seem thrown off by my laughing, I get more awkward and try to control it, but usually end up doing it even more. If it seems to make them laugh and they don't make fun of me for it, I just let it come out, and it becomes very easy to get to know that person. I never really realized just how bad it was, until one weekend at the beach. I was on a beach retreat with my youth group, and one of the activities was a video scavenger hunt. We went around town and took videos of different things, actions, situations, and people. One of these things we had to get a video of was one of us playing rock paper scissors with a stranger. So I promptly went up to two older women and asked to play a game with them. When we all watched the videos later I saw and heard just how weird my voice, laugh, and mannerisms are with strangers. People had told me about them from time to time, but I'd never seen it. It was weird! Another situation was working at a camp this summer. When we did icebreaker games to break tension and meet the people on our teams more easily. Everyone on my team seemed slightly weirded out by me. I couldn't figure out why, until one person would just step up and be straightforward: and inform me of my laugh. As the first week went by though, I was the person that knew everyone on the team the best. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It can be bridged quickly, or made greater: depending on how people react to it. If they join in it together, the distance is destroyed. When, however, one person doesn't join into the laughter, or doesn't enjoy the other person's laugh, this distance is greatly increased. It becomes hard to breach this distance, and the chance to do so is probably lost. And that is just too bad. We should all be able to laugh together and share in each other's joy.
579	21443	8	3	"Every time I walk down the hall and I see a couple, they are either laughing with each other or doing other things that could disqualify my test. I know for a fact that the people that get voted cutest couple at our school are the ones that are laughing as opposed to the later. Not only does laughing create couples, then families, and eventually the next generation, but it creates friendships within schools, families, activities, etc. That's why personally I believe that laughing is the single most powerful action a person can do. Every person I am friends with have laughed with me and vice-versa. Especially one friend who I've gotten even closer since we met. I was very adamant about going to church when I was young. I have always been shy and church allows me to be social with others without ridicule. However I saw one girl sitting in the back corner who I felt was scared just like I probably would have been if it was anywhere else. My parents always wanted me to be more social and they said that one way to do that was to go out of my way to meet new people. I did that for maybe the first time in my life to say ""hi"" to her. She replied by giving me her name. However I went back into my shy self and walked back terrified to talk to her or any one else again. However, I was only in third grade when all this happened so as time passed by things changed. About 4 years after that a new church opened with a new class being open to children of all age groups. I had cemented myself into that classroom as one of two who regularly showed up. However this one day I was the only one who was there for my age group. Well actually I was the only one from my age group that was there on time. I saw a girl walking in with her dad who you could tell had forced her to go to the class. It took me a while to picture who it was but eventually I realized who it was. It was the girl who was scared to be in church and now she was the girl who was scared to be in class. She could clearly recognize me. I made a hand gesture telling her to come in. then you saw her smile. She shortly proceeded to laughing a little bit. This was when I realized I met someone special. Now every time I see her she smiles. That's how I know she will be a friend for a long time. Laughing can't be put into quotes, but it can be put into someone's memories for the rest of your life. I know this for a fact cause a lot of days have passed since and I still have these memories. Laughing is the easiest way to tell if a person is a true friend, something more, or should and will be forgotten. Laughter truly is a universal language that can bring people together and create lasting bonds that stand the test of time."
580	21444	8	3	I was hanging out with my friends at the park, just enjoying each other's company. We played games, ran around, and laughed so hard that we almost had to rush home to use the bathroom. After getting tired, we laid in the grass and watched the clouds, pointing out funny shapes and figures in them. We even made funny voices to go along with the clouds as they drifted by. It was a simple moment of joy and laughter that made us forget about any worries or stress.  After heading home to refresh ourselves, we continued our laughter-filled evening by playing games on the Wii. Laughter truly is like medicine, lifting our spirits and making everything seem a little bit brighter. It's important to find moments of joy and happiness in life, as they can truly make a difference in our overall well-being. Making others laugh and smile is equally rewarding, spreading positivity and warmth to those around us.  So, remember to embrace laughter and find joy in the little moments. It has the power to uplift our mood, bring us closer to others, and make life a little more enjoyable. Laugh often, and spread that happiness wherever you go.
581	21446	8	3	Once, a very long time ago I laughed very hard with a friend is when some kid hit the floor falling and started to cry. There was water on the ground and he was soaked. The janitor was wiping the floor with water. The kid was not paying any attention at all to the janitor. The janitor was also a mean person, he was mad at the boy for stealing stuff from the school janitor's closet. The boy was also mad because the janitor was mean to him I was in @NUM1 grade and I didn't know any better. I had to say that I was sorry because the teacher caught me and my friend laughing, and told me the boy was not mentally well or stable. I felt bad, and apologized right away. I told the kid that I didn't mean anything by it, that it was just a reaction. The boy was able to laugh at himself and he and I became friends. I feel that this small event in my life changes me for the better. I am not so quick to laugh at others misfortunes, people are stupid all over the world, no one is perfect. Everyone is different and unique in their own way. The world will never be as one, there will always be war all the time forever on earth.
582	21447	8	3	A time laughter has been in one of my relationships, was when I was down in the dumps and my cousin made me smile. It was a rainy day and I just woke up, my dad had asked me to make him some breakfast; while I was making the hash browns, eggs, and toast I thought of how little time me and my dad spend together. I brought his breakfast up to him and proposed the idea of going to the movies. However, my hopes were crushed when he postponed our plans. Feeling disappointed, I turned to my cousin who never fails to make me laugh. He cheered me up with his silly antics and jokes, bringing a smile to my face. His ability to lift my spirits with laughter is something I am truly grateful for. My cousin is not only family but also my best friend, and his presence in my life brings me immense joy and comfort. Laughter truly is a vital aspect of any relationship, and I am fortunate to have someone like him to brighten my darkest days.
583	21448	8	3	A time when laughter was one element was when my brother showed a youtube video to my family. The video was about a guy recalling his childhood experience of being sent to buy bread by his dad. To avoid trouble, his dad instructed him to go to a store across the street, warning him about some troublesome boys down the block. As the guy passed the boys, they stopped him, and more friends joined in, surrounding him. He managed to escape and sprinted home so fast that he joked about passing a car along the way. When he reached home, he told his dad about the incident, expecting concern, but his dad only cared about whether he got the bread. The humorous recount of the childhood memory had my family bursting into laughter, even though my brother had shown us the video the night before. The funny storytelling and relatable situations made us all chuckle and enjoy the moment together.
584	21449	8	3	"One day my friend and I were waking up late in the day and his brother came in screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs ""bro bro""! This was the nickname he called him because he was only two years old, so my friend Spencer calmed him down and we started watching t.v. We were talking about what we were going to do for the day so, we started throwing out ideas till we made one where we were going to swim later and play some games now. Spencer's mom asked us when we were going to swim and that we had to take his little brother. So we went early so his little bro could swim and we could sit around and listen to music. Unlike everyone who uses an iPod I use my phone because then I can text and listen to music plus when someone calls it shuts off music so I'll know. It was a brand new phone too and I was loving every moment of having it. So when we dropped his little brother off we went back to the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while. I put my phone on my shirt and my towel over both so when Spencer got out to use the towel he jerked the towel out and my phone flew up hit the ground slid on the floor all the way to the hot tub. That moment I look down and see it and freak I took it out ripped the back off and dried the battery with the towel hoping it would still work and it wouldn't stop dialing zero and nine so I took the battery out again. When we got back to his mom's I plugged in the charger with no battery and Spencer kept saying sorry and I kept answering ""its ok"". The next morning his mom asked why we didn't use a pot of rice and we started laughing because we freaked out so bad over a phone. I forgot all about the phone after that just kept laughing and the phone worked it is one of the funniest stories."
585	21450	8	3	@DATE1 What a night!! Me and my friends were going to a party at our dance coach's work. We had to dress up as elves and play with kids, which was fun. After the party, we changed back into our regular clothes and started taking all sorts of pictures - funny, cute, and weird ones. Wanting to prolong the fun, we decided to visit different places to take more pictures. Our first stop was a school playground, but we had to leave because it was late and we couldn't go inside. So, we headed to the discovery park where I let my friend drive around the parking lot. There were some scary moments, but we were all having a blast. However, things took a hilarious turn when my friend decided to change back, and ended up laughing so hard that she actually wet her pants! We still tease her about it to this day, and whenever someone jokes about peeing their pants, we all look at her and share a good laugh. It's a funny memory that we often recall and it never fails to make us chuckle.
586	21451	8	3	"For me laughter is a huge part of life. I cannot, nor wish to escape it. Laughter is fun in itself. It always makes tense situations become relaxed and enjoyable. No feeling is more perfect than falling head first into uncontrollable laughter. Laughter is the best way to unite people together and form memories and bonds. In my home and family, too many situations arise that cause the potential, and often result, of laughter. It is the same way with my distant families such as my friends at school. Life growing up with a brother, wonderfully fun neighbors, and cousins have produced most of my laughter memories. One such time, in which laughter flowed freely, happened rather recently. The situation began when my brother, ""John,"" had to do a school assignment. ""John"" was assigned, by his history teacher, to write a diary entry as if he were a mountain man in the 1800s. I did not set out to help him with his homework, but considering the end result, I was thoroughly glad I did. It seemed so unlikely that this task would be so fun. I guess that just shows how laughter can crop up so suddenly and in such unpredictable places. I came into ""John's"" room and he told me what he was working on, so I leaned over his shoulder and helped him with a few ideas. We were making progress and once reaching a certain point, we both contributed to a subtle humorous comment we decided to add to the entry. Reading our creation, nothing less than an explosion of laughter was triggered. The noise poured out of ""John's"" room like lava from a volcano! My parents could hear us and likely thought we were crazy! Another person reading our literature might not have laughed at all, but to us it was hilarious. Being in a good mood, and considering ""John's"" history teacher said to make the entries creative, more humorous and quite witty sentences were added. By this time I was doubled over struggling to speak through all the laughter I was consumed by. ""John"" was hardly better. Homework had never been more fun. We finished quicker than if ""John"" was working by himself and came away with the greatest feeling. ""John"" ended up getting full points on the entry when he turned it into his teacher. This is just one example of thousands I could think of in which laughter fills the moment. This particular instance helped with work and yet made the work not a chore, but rather a tremendously happy event. Perhaps more laughter in the workplace would lead to better production. All things considered, laughter, in my opinion, makes for the greatest joy."
587	21452	8	3	I believe laughter is an essential component of any relationship, whether it be with friends, family, or a romantic partner. My best friend, @PERSON1, and I share a strong bond that is built on laughter. Our friendship blossomed from the moment we met, as I made her laugh and we instantly connected. Our time together is always filled with joy and humor, even in challenging situations like when I injured myself during a fun adventure. Despite the ups and downs, we always find a way to laugh and lighten the mood. I truly believe that laughter is the key to forming lasting and meaningful relationships with others. It brings us closer together and creates special memories that we can cherish forever. So, remember to always find the humor in life and share laughter with those you care about, as it can strengthen your connections and make your relationships even more fulfilling.
588	21453	8	3	Just One day ago, my friends and I, Sarah, Jake, and I, walk under the cover of the trees, we decided to stop by the lake, in our usual meeting place where we have a perfect view, to have a chat. Jake, who is six foot tall, has long raven-black hair that just barely tickles his chin, deep blue eyes, and is extremely attractive, plopped down in the wet green grass. But Sarah, who is six foot, has short brown hair, dark ocher colored eyes, chose to stand about ten paces in front of us. To any person strolling by, she would have looked as if she was just enjoying the amazing view of the crystal water, but to us, who knew her all too well, knew she was thinking about her brother, Alex, who was in the hospital. Alex had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, got in the middle of a homeless person's fight, not to mention the guy was drunk, and got stabbed with a rusty switch-blade. Sarah felt like it was her fault that this had happened, and this made her so depressed that she would not laugh at any of our idiocy, or even eat for that matter. Sarah's feeling that way made Jake and I feel completely horrible and there was nothing we could do to cheer her up. Sarah was usually the most exuberant out of all of us, and we did every single thing we could possibly think of to make her feel better, or, at the very least, get her to smile again. But not once could we budge her, or even get one little giggle out of her tightened jaw. Not one of our pathetic attempts even touched her eyes, but we never gave up, in fact, we tried for days on end to get her to smile again. We got to the point of desperation that we even dressed ourselves up as teletubies, went to Sarah's house, dragged her off of her couch, and took her downtown. Yet not one second of it did her mouth even twitch upwards. Although we did some of the most outrageous, unimaginably embarrassing things we could possibly think of, and trust me, we though about it for days. We got absolutely no response what so ever out of her, except, of course, her enormous yawns. Finally, about a week later, we got her to giggle, which eventually turned into a full on, body shaking laugh. You will never guess what finally got her to crack. A knock-knock joke. Of all the horrendously obnoxious deeds we had done, cheesy, idiotic knock-knock jokes are what got to her. Although Jake and I felt like complete idiots, we could not help but laugh with her. After that day it was no longer a difficult process for her. Sarah was almost, but not quite, back to her normal self. So our lives went on, and Alex got out of the hospital perfectly fine.
589	21454	8	3	"Sometime life is complicated. Nothing is ever black and white. This is a short glance of my childhood. I think the best placed to start is the beginning.  When I was about @NUM1 years of age I had my first memory. My dad, @PERSON3, my brothers and I were all at a pond over in @LOCATION1. We were racing @CAPS1 boats that my dad had build. We would go there every other @DATE1 after school, from the moment I get out of school till it is so dark outside you can'@CAPS4 see you hand right in front of your face. One particular time I remember going, was the time my brother decided I need to go for a swim. My brothers and I got along but were never really close to one another. @CAPS9 loved pulling pranks on me, being that I was the youngest. So I was standing next to my dad and brother, there was a whole bunch of small ferns around us. My brother @PERSON2 jumped out of one of the bushes behind me and it made me jump. Meanwhile my brother @PERSON1 was on his hands and knees waiting for be to jump so he can make me trip over him. Well I did, there was a drop off at the edge of the pond that no one really noticed and I went tumbling down the hill. My elbow ran into stomach and my head hit a rock, then a @CAPS2! I was now soaked laying there a gooey green monster. At the moment no one was laughing but later on we did. The rest of that night no one really talked. The sun was just starting to set and I was sitting on the tail of a truck covered with blankets as my dad, brothers and @PERSON3 stood in the setting sun. I will never forget that loomenesint sight. As years pasted things gradually got worse between my brothers and myself. Things weren'@CAPS4 quit as easy. There wasn'@CAPS4 a forgive and forget. My brother @PERSON2 is five years older than me. He has @CAPS3 and serious relationship problems. One day he decided he was going to take out his problems on me. I was about @NUM2 years old. I loved my brothers and I didn'@CAPS4 know his ulterior motive at the time. My whole family except my dad was watching @CAPS4.V. in the living room. My brother @PERSON2 went back to his room and put spider man into his mini @CAPS5 player and climbed up the ladder into his bed. It was a titanium bed with a desk on the bottom, the top bunk was nearly kissing the sealing. He came out of his room and went into the kitchen and filled up his water bottle. As he filled his bottle up he asked if anyone wanted to watch spider man. Being my mother was watching the news I took him up on his offer. We both climbed up into the top bunk and watched the movie. We watched it for a little. I was cold so he offered me a blankets I got him last @CAPS6. It was fuzzy thick and warm with a huge tiger on it. Like most boys he slept in boxers and that was kinda weird seeing him walk around in them. But I never said anything. As we laid there he stuck his hand into my pants. I pushed him away and continued to watch the movie. He tried it several more times but I wouldn'@CAPS4 let him. I didn'@CAPS4 think it was right. But then he pinned my down with his leg across mine. I didn'@CAPS4 scream. He started to wiggle his finger around in my pants, it stung. I told him deliberately to stop, he didn'@CAPS4. Then he grabbed a pencil from behind him and stuck it in my vagina. Seconds later my dad walked in and said it was bed time. My brother threw himself back and I went soaring out of his room. That night was the first time my dad didn'@CAPS4 read me a bedtime story.  A few months later my brother @PERSON1 started acting weird too. He was always jittery around me and was never relaxed. One day he went out and bought a whole bunch of my favorite candy. Those @CAPS7 ""@CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's."" @CAPS9 look like a @ORGANIZATION1 that was white and crunchy on the outside and the inside is full of chocolate. He would bribe me with these, saying, ""I will give you one box of @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's if you let me touch you in three places of my choice."" I didn'@CAPS4 know it was wrong. I just wanted the candy, so I let him. This"
590	21456	8	3	"""Laughter"" Have you ever felt it? The feeling of uncontrollable joy building up inside you? The one feeling you can never explain in any word but one. Laughter. This is a wondrous feeling, it can make you do so many things, like scream, and yell! Someone once said, Laughter, is the beauty of life. It helps us get out of hard times, and it always put a smile on our face when we feel down. It will make good times even better and never be forgotten. Laughter is something everyone needs. It helps us connect with people. It causes you to become one with another. This is the story of me. The story of how laughter caused me to meet the love of my life. How the connection of joy between us will last forever, and how the memories of his smile will last in me forever. It was the day I met him. It was a gorgeous day, snow was covering the ground for miles, and I was surrounded by my amazing friends. The feeling of boredom quickly flew over our heads. So we decided it was time to have some fun. We quickly put our snow clothes on and began running for the door. The moment we stepped outside everyone but me stopped. I kept going into the ice-cold air. I slowly began to realize they had stopped and I tried to come to an immediate halt. They all began to laugh as I laid on the icy ground holding my sore butt. I was so embarrassed, and so shocked by what had just happened that I didn't move, I just laid back and closed my eyes. As I was laying there I began hearing footsteps. I figured they were just my friends coming to help me. But when I opened my eyes, it wasn't my friends I saw. It was a handsome man, one I had seen a few times before in my high school. He leans down and asks me, ""Are you okay?"" I reply in a shy tone, ""yes..."" He smiles and reaches down to help me up. As our skin gently touches I get butterflies all throughout my body. I look at him and can tell he was getting the same feeling. As I stand to my feet we both smile and begin to laugh. I still to this day don't understand why we laughed... I am wondering a million things at once, but the first question that exits my mouth is, ""What is your name?"" He replies with a smile and says, ""James and you?"" ""My name is Emily."" I reply. I begin to thank him and ask if he would like some hot chocolate or coffee. He replies in a cute tone that sent chills up my spine. He says ""I would rather take you to get a burger, will you come?"" A huge smile washes over my face as I say ""yes."" He grabs my hand and walks me closer to my friends. They all began to smile and turn and walk away quickly into the depths of my house. James smiles and decides not to follow. We both begin to laugh as we run over to his car. I had heard a lot about James, my friends were always talking about how cute and muscular he is. The first thought that went streaming through my head was, I can't believe he wants to take me out to lunch! We sit awkwardly in the car all the way to a small diner called Charlie's. When we stop James jumps out of the car and rushes to my door to open it. James is such a gentleman I thought to myself. When we get to our table James orders for us both and asks me all sorts of questions. James kept me smiling the whole time! I don't think any boy has ever done that. After we ate and James drove me home we smiled and laughed as he told me joke after joke. When we reached my house James asks me a question. A question I will never forget. ""Can I kiss you?"" James asks. I do not answer but lean in and kiss him. We look into each other's eyes afterwards and begin to laugh... Why we laughed I still will never know. But at that moment I fell in love. At that moment I realized laughter will be the connection between us forever. The laughter is in remembrance of him. Rest in peace James."
591	21457	8	3	"Like all great things in life, laughter is the thing that keeps me going. Without laughter I'm depleted. I'll tell you about the three things that make me laugh the most in life. First is @CAPS1 mom. (@LOCATION1) @CAPS1 mom is the one that showed me, laughing is the key to almost everything. She showed me it's okay to fall down. Laugh at the fact you're silly, you messed up but make sure to get back up. @CAPS1 mom can make me laugh no matter what is going on in @CAPS1 teenage ""drama"" life. The biggest thing I've learned is when I'm emotionally broken, when I feel the whole world is against me and I just don't want to be me anymore to laugh through it. When me and @CAPS1 best friend got into a fight @TIME1 @DATE1 I didn't come out of @CAPS1 house for about a week and a half, I didn't want to talk to any of @CAPS1 friends. @CAPS1 mom tried to get me to call her but I never did, till one day @CAPS1 mom sat down on @CAPS1 bed and said ""@CAPS2 it's not want happens to you it's what you do with it, do you hear me laughing all the time, when I'm upset, sad and happy...that's what I want you to do no matter what is going on in your ""drama"" teenage life don't shrug it off @CAPS2 laugh it off, call her.""@CAPS1 @CAPS5 friends definitely take second place. Like @CAPS1 friends, I also have @CAPS5. When I'm with them nothing else phases me, the whole world could be ending and I wouldn't notice a thing. I feel since I have @CAPS5 I speak a different language that most people can't understand besides @CAPS1 friends with @CAPS5. @CAPS1 friends are very random and have a lot of energy. One thing that they taught me is having @CAPS5 is a gift and a curse. When @PERSON1 and I are hanging out it doesn't matter who we're around we make there day, we can't help feeling goofy plus the non-stop laughing. Sometimes it gets us into things like people our age think we're laughing at them when we're really not.Third place is me. I make myself laugh more than anyone or anything. I'm a total comedian. When I try to be funny I'm not that funny but when I don't try I make people laugh so hard they cry. @CAPS1 whole life I've been told ""@CAPS2, wow you really are something no matter what mood someone's in you just make life seem so amazing."" @CAPS11 people laugh is one thing but @CAPS11 myself laugh is very different. When I was sitting on the floor in @CAPS1 room @TIME1 I was thinking about @CAPS1 past life and became pretty upset but to pull myself out of the negative thinking I started thinking about the good times I've and within five minutes I was laughing so hard @CAPS1 stomach hurt.     Like I said ""like all great things"" laughter is @CAPS1 greatest. Laughing really can open someones eyes. I will continue to live laughing and eventually pass it down when the time comes."
592	21458	8	3	"In any relationship, things like physical contact, verbal conversations, or any kind of outward expression at all is very important. More particularly, laughing is key as well, to any kind of interaction with someone. Laughing says,""what you are saying is funny"" or, I'm enjoying this"". Laughing says a lot without saying a word. Think about someone you know very well. It might be your best friend, or it might be a family member. If you think about it, you can tell when they are mad, sad, angry, frustrated, just by looking at their facial expressions or looking into their eyes. When you see them laugh, you see happiness. Its so obvious, because their eyes sparkle, their face lights up, and you just know that they are cheery. Now think about when you are hanging out with your friends. Being with friends is always fun, and we love it. That's why we go do things with them right? And when we are with them, we laugh a lot. We tell funny stories, we share inside jokes, and fun memories that make us laugh, and we love that, we love the feeling we get when we are with them,and most of all, we love the moments that make us laugh. Maybe its a long car ride, a sleepover, or maybe its at a party or church perhaps. Have you ever noticed that when one person laughs, the rest of the group follows in unison? Laughter is contagious, making it hard to resist most of the time. Whether it be a joke that was told, or that someone made a fool of themselves, its always a favorite part of any gathering or party, or whatever it may be. Some people say that each time you laugh, a few seconds are added to your life. Im not so sure I believe that, but I do believe laughing is healthy. I know that when I laugh, i feel so much better. Whenever I get back from hanging out with my three closest friends, I feel great. It's like whatever else that was getting to me that week or day is just forgotten, and especially if we laugh a lot, it makes me feel good. When a friend or someone else we know is down in the dumps,what is the first thing most of us resort to? It's going to be making them laugh right? Because laughter is a big part of being happy. When someone laughs, they find it hard to resist being cheered up. For this reason, I believe that laughter is the best medicine of all. It's so hard not to feel better when laughing. Once again, I believe that laughter is important in any human relationship, because laughing shows that you are either enjoying their company, just like smiling at all the right moments, or making the right face when they are telling a story, and showing them that you are engaged in the conversation. If someone is telling a funny story, or a joke, laughing shows that you get the humor in what they are saying. If you are enjoying being with that person, laugh a lot. Show them that you love hanging out with them. People love making other people laugh. Whether you are laughing at a joke, a funny story, or a face they made, or all of the above, laughing is just as important in any situation. Just like the saying goes for smiling, everyone laughs in the same language. Laughter says the same thing all around the world. Laughter is is almost always a good sign, and means something is going right. Laughter truly is a universal language that connects us all and brings joy and happiness to our lives."
593	21459	8	3	The power of laughter can have a lasting impact on individuals, shaping their self-perception and confidence. A childhood experience at a family gathering, where a young girl bravely took the stage to sing, turned into a moment of vulnerability as she faced laughter from the audience. This incident left a deep emotional scar, leading her to believe she had a horrible voice and avoiding singing in front of others. However, with time and understanding, she realized that the laughter was not meant to be hurtful but was a reaction to her adorable innocence and pronunciation. As she grows older, she learns to overcome her fear and embrace her passion for singing, determined to not let past insecurities hold her back. Through self-acceptance and positivity, she strives to regain her confidence and share her voice with the world, knowing that no laughter can dim the light of her talent.
594	21460	8	3	"I am going to tell you a story about when I was a young boy and, how I used to go on long trip with my father because he was a long-haul truck driver. Me and mi dad went many places around the country all of them being very fun and amazing. And we all had a lot of laughs The one that i liked the most though was when we went to Washington DC that place was so amazing there are so many things to do, as well as so many things to visit. Things that you could just see like the White House, Capitol Hill that was pretty cool i thought and all of the monuments. My dad told me to go and see if i could get past security at the White House and i was like nah i am good you can though and i laughed at him; Another place that i liked a lot that we went to would have to be New Orleans, even though it was very hot and muggy it was still fun. I remember my dad telling us that we had a lot of extra time and that he was going to be taking us to the zoo man was that cool we got to see all of the awesome animals such as the lions, the crocodiles, monkeys, gorillas , and the penguins. It was one of the best trips that my father ever took me on i liked it a lot. One of the funniest memories that i do remember is when we were driving throught the desert and there was this paper in the air and i did not know what it was so i was like, ""dad what is that""? and he says ""that is a falling star"" i was like ""in the middle of the day""? and it took me till about a couple years to figure out what it really was but now i know what it was and i just look back to that day and laugh."
595	21462	8	3	There was a memory of mine that was full of laughter and fun. Then it also turned into a serious and none joking around madder. It all started on a @DATE1 @TIME1, my brother @ORGANIZATION1 called me and told me to come come over I hadn't been over at my moms house in a while. I replied yeah sure man ill be over in a hour. I jumped in my truck and headed to my mothers house.While on the way I stopped to get some gas at the gas station. Fifteenth minutes later I arrived at my moms house. once arrived my brother was out side waiting for me. @ORGANIZATION1 came up to the truck and helped me with my bag and the door. Once I was in the house I walked over to the kitchen saw my @CAPS1, and gave her a hug, and asked her how she was doing? She replied, I'm alright hunny, then asked me what was new, with myself? I said nothing much @CAPS1, hanging out trying to stay out of trouble. I asked her is there anything she needed me to do? Or needs to be done? My om named off a couple things that needed to be done around the house. After she was done telling me some of the things i headed to my room to change into my work cloths, then headed out side. I grabbed my brother on the way because he was going to help me out. While we were down at the garage @ORGANIZATION1 brings up the fact that I haven't been there in a while he said party tonight. I replied ok. While I was done working on the garage, my dad came down and said the fence needs to be fixed, so we moved the tractor over and fixed the fence. Its was @NUM1 at night already people were already showing up.  When we got to the house my @CAPS1 comes out and says, what you guys doing out here? Get in the party already, it's a full house there were @NUM2 people in my moms house that night. Drinking and just having a good time. When i walked up to the living room i noticed the girls were making food for the guys while the guys were playing drinking games. There were a couple games going on, for example there was beer pong, shots, and beer bong. There was always someone that wanted to beat the drinking record in the house, to be the best drinker. The drinking record in the house for one night of drinking was @NUM3 shots and @NUM4 beers. To this day the record still stands and the person who holds the record is me. I look over at shots and a friend of my @CAPS1 said i wanna challenge you. I said ok. It did not end up well @NUM5 shots, and the guy that was against me was passed out on the table.  Hours later everyone was sleeping but me, my brother and one of our friends. We were out side chewing while @ORGANIZATION1 was peeing on his dads car. All of the sudden I look over and @ORGANIZATION1 is puking all over on the ground. I laughed so hard i feel over because the look on his face while smiling when he was throwing up. My friend @PERSON1 and I took @ORGANIZATION1 down stairs to his bed put him to sleep and went back up stairs, to lay down. Before we when it the door opened and it's @ORGANIZATION1 he wanted to say he loves us and good night. We replied thanks bro same to you. Less that thirty seconds later We heard oh crap and a loud noise falling down the stairs, it was @ORGANIZATION1. The next @TIME1 I woke up and I did not feel so good, I told my @CAPS1 about it. She said ok well ill make you some food. So she did I did not feel better so I just went home to sleep. I opened my door I saw my @CAPS1 at my house and said, @TIME1 @CAPS1. She replied you drank? I said yes, and i don't feel so good. she said ok well ill take you to the doctor if it does not get better. A month went by of me not eating right or drinking, so i went to the doctor and they told me i messed up my liver so bad I had the liver of a @NUM6 year old, all i remember was crying and saying to my @CAPS1 never again. I realized drinking and having fun is all ok until someone gets hurt. The doctor told me if i was to drink again I could die, I made the best choice of my life there i believe. To this day I have not drank any alcohol at all it has been a year and @NUM7 days. Laughing and having a good

One day, the boss of the company asked who worked the hardest, but no one answered. When the boss asked for a recommendation for a promotion, everyone suggested this businessman because of his cheerful demeanor. He was eventually promoted to the highest level in the company, showcasing how his laughter made people happier and more connected. Laughing not only promotes a friendly atmosphere but also has numerous health benefits, including potentially increasing lifespan and improving mental well-being. This story highlights the power of laughter in building relationships and achieving success. Laughing often can truly make a difference in people's lives and bring joy to those around us.
597	21465	8	3	Laughing has always been a big part of my life, and I believe that it plays a significant role in shaping who I am. Whether I am joking around, making funny faces, or laughing at my own clumsiness, laughter has always been a constant companion. It has helped me navigate through embarrassing situations, awkward moments, and even everyday challenges. My mom used to say that I was clumsier than a bull in a china shop, and looking back, she was right. But instead of feeling embarrassed, I have learned to laugh at myself and turn those mishaps into funny anecdotes.   One particular incident that stands out is when I fell down the stairs at an elementary school award assembly. Instead of being mortified, I chose to laugh it off and get back up with a smile on my face. This ability to find humor in the face of adversity has not only helped me cope with my own clumsiness but has also brought me closer to my family and friends. We often joke around and laugh together, finding solace and joy in each other's company.  Through laughter, I have learned to embrace my quirky, funny side and share it with those around me. It has become a defining trait of mine, and I take pride in being able to make others laugh and brighten their day. Laughter truly is a powerful tool that has shaped me into the happy and funny person that I am today.
598	21467	8	3	It was my first year of high school and I was feeling pretty confident. I had great teachers and all the classes I wanted. My first day was going awesome! I had woken up on time, eaten a good breakfast, and I didn't even miss the school bus. My first few classes were fabulous and I was about to go to lunch. As the bell rang I hurried to the cafeteria to get a good spot in line. One of my close friends had called my name so I turned to wave and when I turned back I ran directly into a girl named Emily. We hit hard. I flew backwards dropping everything I was carrying. I tried to say I was sorry but all she did was glare at me and walk away. As I picked up my books I realized I didn't want anything to do with that girl and decided I'd just forget about what had just happened.   After lunch I had English. I was extra excited for this class because the boy of my dreams, Ryan, was in it. On my way there I made a quick pit-stop to the ladies room to make sure I still looked decent and then headed to class. As I walked in the room the first thing I saw was Ryan's beautiful blond hair and his dazzling blue eye. Then I registered the whole scene. Guess who was twirling her hair and batting her eye lashes at my dream guy! You got it, Emily. From that moment on it was war! As the year progressed Emily and I constantly strove to out do each other. We'd race each other to class to see who would get to sit behind Ryan. She always had to have the best hair. I would get a cute new hair cut and she would get high lights. I received a phone. So she went out and bought the latest and greatest phone with the built in music player. I remember getting to class early one day, so excited to show Ryan this new game I'd learned. But of course when I walked in the room Emily was already showing him the exact same game. There was one thing I always had over Emily, books. Both Ryan and I loved books. We would sit and talk about the latest and greatest books for hours. This always made Emily jealous. Our childish behavior went on like this for three or four months. One day at lunch I was just sitting, eating my food, and minding my own business. All of the sudden Emily appeared out of nowhere and spit soda at my face. That did it. This was the last straw. I grabbed my milk carton and dumped it on her head. The cafeteria went silent for about a minute. Emily and I stood there glaring at each other, rage searing from our eyes until some one broke the silence with a loud laugh. Soon everyone was laughing, including Emily and I. We realized just how stupid we'd been acting and for the first time we were laughing together not at each other. We both apologized and helped each other get cleaned up.   Eventually we became really good friends. To this day we still laugh about our ninth grade rivalry.
599	21468	8	3	All the great memories that @LOCATION2 and I, spent and shared together when we were really good best friends. We were around @NUM1 years old and in @NUM2 through @NUM3 grade. Of course we got older as the years went by, but we had so many great times together. Whenever we hung out, we would always laugh about almost everything, and most of the time we would just never let a lot of stupid things get to us. Whenever I needed someone to talk to she would be the one. She went through a life that was almost the same as what I went through in life, and so she knows what I or even she needs to do or say. Even though we would always have lots of fun, we would have our moments and fight, but always work things out. We'd always have each other's back for everything. I guess what I'm trying to say is that two people who are close always have their great needs and feelings, and especially their laughter in the relationship.  I remember in @NUM2 grade, both of us would always try to hang out whenever we could. We were still young so it was hard to do be able to do anything because our parents wouldn't let us most of the time. Whenever we did though, we would think about random games, and go to different places just to have fun. As we got older though we were trusted more and could do lots more things, which was a good thing. Then I moved to @LOCATION1, not the greatest thing, but it was for love. What made it better was that she still came over all the time. We would go and pick her up on @DATE1 and then on @DATE2 my mom would drive to school because my mom still went to work there in Florence. Every night that she was there we would always stay up. I remember that I would always keep these little hot chocolate packages in my room and after my parents went to bed we'd sneak out to go get hot water for it so that we would have hot chocolate to drink. Some other times we would make coffee so that we could stay up longer. It was hard sometimes because my room was right across from my parents' room and at the time I had beads hanging from my door. Fun times trying to keep quiet and not get caught. Sometimes when she came over she would bring all her makeup and things so that we could dress each other up. One night we had blindfolds on and do each other's makeup.  Throughout all these memories and moments shared with @LOCATION2, laughter was always present. It was the glue that held our friendship together, even through the fights and disagreements. Our bond was special, and the joy we found in each other's company was truly priceless. These memories will always hold a special place in my heart, reminding me of the wonderful friendship we shared.
600	21470	8	3	Laughing is a powerful tool that can help build friendships and create lasting bonds. It has the ability to bring people together, even in the most unlikely of circumstances. One example of this is a story about a group of friends who found common ground through humor and shared experiences. By sharing laughs and creating memories, they were able to form a strong connection that lasted a lifetime. Laughter truly is a universal language that can transcend differences and bring people closer together. So next time you find yourself in a new situation or meeting new people, remember the power of laughter in forging friendships that can last a lifetime.
601	21471	8	3	"Laughter, one of the greatest gifts in life. It's what helps you get through the day, the year and in the long term, your life. For me, many things can go wrong in a day. For example, I could forget about an assignment that ends up being a big part of my grade or just have a difficult day. All i need to make those bad things seem like old memories is to have a long and pleasant laugh. It is ten times better if that laugh is shared with someone else. That's why when i moved to @LOCATION1,@CAPS1 I tried to keep a look out for kids like me, who loved to laugh and make other people laugh. The first days were rough. I met a lot of new people that were all the same. Some just wanted to know my name and others to get to know me better, and that was fine. There was one person that I noticed was in multiple of my classes. So one day when our @CAPS2 teacher asked us to partner up and write a myth of creation or how something got to be the way it is. Quickly, I looked around to choose someone before every one would have a partner and I would be sitting there awkwardly without a partner. I asked a boy who was in few other of my classes. I had not really noticed or even heard him talk. He agreed to be my partner. We introduced ourselves and he told me his name was @PERSON1. He had a very quite voice. I had barely understood his name, so i had to read it from his paper. We had to work on the paper together but it felt more like if we were doing it individually. I began by throwing some ideas around. @PERSON1 would then say something and laugh but I could never hear what he would say. We worked on the paper for a couple of days, continuing to only interchange some words.  Meanwhile I was still trying to make at least one good friend. I thought maybe threw that friend i could meet some of his friends and in time I would have my own set of friends. In the meantime I ate lunch with my sister @PERSON2. You would think it would be slightly awkward or uncomfortable. It wasn't though, it was actually pretty nice because our bond had become stronger. That would work well for both of us until we made some friends. After some time she had made a couple of friends and was ready to move on. So one day while we were both eating lunch one of her new friends passed by and asked her to go sit with her. I hoped so bad that she would just say no or even say, maybe tomorrow, but no.  There I was sitting by myself in a lunch room full of eyes that were just judging who you were sitting with, if anyone. I began to eat my lunch faster than you could say sternocleidomastoid, and I was out of there. Panicking in the inside but completely calm on the outside, I paced the hallways looking for someone to hang out with. Then I saw ""That @CAPS3"" from three of my classes. I casually walked up to him and tried to start a conversation. For some reason i felt relaxed not as if I was trying to make a new friend but as if I was already talking to one.  In the beginning, we were just two guys that talked about classes and how this school was different from my previous. Then all of a sudden we began to talk about movies especially the resent more funny ones. We could not stop laughing in all of our classes, especially auto mechanics. We would use up all of our shop time just trying to remember all of the funny lines from the movies and trying to say them or act them out the best we could. Soon we also found out that we watched many of the same t.v. shows. We could make each other laugh with pretty much anything one of us said. I had noticed this special quality in @PERSON1 that made him extremely funny. I wasn't sure what it was,but with anything he said I would just laugh uncontrollably. We were laughing buddies, but soon we actually became great friends. We had really bonded in between the laughter. During that time we would find out new things about each other. That made us realize that we were a lot alike. Its been a few months and we have only become greater friends. I had made friends before by making them laugh or laughing at there jokes. I knew this was different tho. I had made the greatest friend I had ever had. Now I'm moving and that's the worst part. I know that with the bond of sharing some of the greatest laughs of my life we will continue to stay friends for a long time. Moving away is tough, but the memories of all the laughter we shared will always stay with me, reminding me of the amazing friend I found in @PERSON1"
602	21472	8	3	I have lived in my hometown almost my whole life, attending school from pre-kindergarten all the way up to 8th grade. However, halfway through my 8th-grade year, my mom dropped the bombshell news that we were moving. I was shocked and didn't know how to react - I didn't want to leave behind everything I knew. But my mom assured me that I would make new friends in our new home in Lebanon, where my cousin also attended school and could help me settle in. We packed up our things, cleaned the house, and said our goodbyes before embarking on the move.  Arriving at our new house, I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it was. My brothers were excited too, and we quickly chose our rooms and began unpacking. As the days passed, I got more and more nervous about starting high school in a new town. When the first day arrived, my cousin offered to show me around and introduce me to some of his friends, which eased my anxiety a bit.  Walking into the bustling school, I felt a mix of excitement and nerves. Throughout the day, I met new people, introduced myself in classes, and tried to find my way around the campus. By the time the school day ended, I was exhausted but relieved that it wasn't as scary as I had imagined. Back at home, my mom bombarded me with questions about my day, eager to hear all the details.  As I settled down for the night, I reflected on the whirlwind of a day I had experienced. Despite the initial fears and uncertainties, I was hopeful that I could find my place in this new chapter of my life. And as I drifted off to sleep, I knew that each day would bring new challenges and opportunities to grow in my new surroundings.
603	21473	8	3	When we all get together on my dad's side, we just sit, laugh, and talk loud. I always say that we are one big fake family. All the aunts, uncles, and cousins come around my grandma's small kitchen table and talk. There are so many conversations going on, people talking loud and laughing, that it makes me feel like I'm at a home away from home. This was the case when some of us got together for a late birthday party for me in my grandma's kitchen. It was a simple gathering with my grandma, uncle, aunt, dad, my two cousins, and I; sitting around the kitchen table eating cake and talking. We were laughing and joking around, creating memories that will last a lifetime. Laughter is truly the best medicine, and my dad's side of the family knows how to have a good time together. I cherish these moments with my family, where we can be ourselves and share in the joy of being together. Family is not just about blood relations; it's about the bonds we create through shared experiences and laughter. I am grateful for my family and the laughter they bring into my life.
604	21475	8	3	"Do you remember the first day of @NUM1 grade? Everyone is awkwardly and excitedly standing there waiting for their seating arrangement. You have the middle school jidders and everything is just happening to fast, I remember all that. I went to school at @CAPS1 for my middle school years, my teacher was @PERSON3. She was the type of teacher that was strict when it came to where you sat in class. If you didn't like someone, she would probably sit you by them thinking that you two would magically become friends. I was standing there in the corner with my best friend @CAPS2, we were of course hoping that we would be seated next to each other. After we finally got our seating arrangements, we were not seated together. I was sat next to @PERSON4-- a girl that I didn't know at all-- @PERSON5, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. I was friends with everyone except @PERSON4, who I have never saw before in my life. As class went on @PERSON6 talked about middle school and how it is so important to get good grades and be prepared for high school, we all sat there and as to what it looked liked day dreamed. No one really talked to anyone, there was still that awkward first day thing going on. @PERSON4 looked like a girl that would rip your head off if you said anything to her, so I kept my mouth shut.  @PERSON6 went on with her ""first day lecture"" and all of a sudden she cracked a joke in the middle of her speech, to get our attention. We all started laughing. I would have to say that it was a very good ice breaker. After everyone after everyone laughed for a while, it seemed like everyone loosened up a bit. @PERSON4 and I started talking about how that joke was only funny because it was so dang stupid. From then on we kept talking and she seemed like a cool person. @PERSON4 and I became partners for every project that we did and we were always together, she became my best friend after @NUM2 days; all because of laughter. I would have to say that the reason @PERSON4 and I became friends is because of laughter. I probably never would have talked to her in the first place; even though I am glad I did because now I have an awesome best friend! Middle school can be scary, especially on the first day of school. That's why I think laughter is such an important part in someone's relationship, you can't get by without it!"
605	21476	8	3	"One time I was sick, and I told my mom ""I need to get some ice tea"" so I get up and go to the freezer. Suddenly my throat gets irritated and I feel the need to cough, so I do and instead of coughing on the side I do it right into the ice bucket. And it just so happens that my mom was standing next to me, and she says ""Oh god! Son, what was that?"" so we started laughing. It was ironic because the germs would be preserved in the icebox. It was funny that I was unintentionally keeping my germs alive in the ice, and my mom ended up using that ice. The situation turned out to be a humorous moment between us, despite the initial grossness of the situation."
606	21477	8	3	It was a cold winter evening when I decided to go to the ice skating rink with my friends Jack, Sarah, Mike, Emily, and Lily. We had a ride to the rink and back so we rode along with Sarah's dad. On the way, we listened to some classic rock and Christmas carols (which I recommend to any music fans). Once we got there, I told a joke and we all laughed so hard that we couldn't stop. It was a night filled with joy and laughter, creating memories that would last a lifetime.
607	21478	8	3	I always wished that I could go back in time and relive my childhood. Knowing that that was the time when I was most happiest and just living life with no purpose, no plans. Looking down on my little cousins or brother, I see joy, laughter, and silliness. I see innocent faces who have no idea nor understanding of what is going on around them. As I watch them slowly grow out of their unusual habits, I find myself back in the year I was a little girl, not in school yet, running in my grandmother's yard on a sunny mid-day. I remember playing hide and seek with my sister, giggling and pretending to be a pilot as we ran around the yard. Those carefree days were filled with laughter and fun.   Fast forward to a few days after a tragic event, everyone gathered at grandma's house. I was playing with my two youngest cousins when we discovered a small hole in the wall that gave us a glimpse into the room where the adults were. We had a great time spying on them, unaware that our uncle was watching us and eventually joining in on the fun. It was a moment of innocence and laughter amidst a difficult time.  Now, as a sixteen-year-old babysitting the younger kids in grandma's living room, I realize the importance of laughter and living in the moment. While there are serious times, laughter is a vital part of life. I reflect on my childhood with fondness, knowing that those carefree days shaped who I am today. Laughter has always been a constant in my life, a reminder of the joy and simplicity of childhood.
608	21479	8	3	Laughter can be helpful in many ways and with many things. Like, if your having a bad day, a friend can try and make you laugh to help you feel better. Or maybe something like you lost a loved one. Yes it's a very tragic thing, especially if you really close to that family member. People will still try and make you laugh and tell you that there in a better place and won't be in pain anymore. I have had some moments like this and I sometimes felt better after the person or persons have made me laugh. I also know that I have people that care for me and want me to be happy and full of laughter. The most recent time I have needed someone to help me laugh was yesterday. It was yesterday night, I had math homework that I needed too do. It frustrated me so much, I started too cry. i told my boyfriend this and he just started telling all of these silly jokes. They kind of helped. What helped the most though was when he had said he could come over this @DATE1. I started smiling and laughing because I was so happy that he could. Another time that I have had laughter help me was when I was at @CAPS1 with my mom, dad, brother, and little sister about @NUM1 years ago. My brother decided that he want too take me on @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I can't remember if that was the ride though. Anyway, he took me in it about @NUM2 or @NUM3 time. I was so scared, and wet that I didn't talk too him for the rest of the day. He finally apologized and took me too a face painter lady in one of the stores. I chose what I wanted on my face, I can't quite remember what it was though, I think it was some kind of fish. But, after she had finished, I looked in the mirror she had and I burst out laughing. I laughed for about ten minutes and said that I accepted his apology. When we arrived home a few days later, I took the hose and sprayed him with it just too get him back. And too be a little stinker of a sister, like all little sisters should be every once and a while in my opinion. Thank gosh it was during the @DATE2 because me and him did it a few more times just too be brats too mom and dad. Lastly, I remember this one time in @NUM4 grade when my best friend @CAPS4 was moving. I cried for days and days. Then finally he calls me and we talked for about @NUM5 hours, and talking too him just made me laugh, and wish that he hadn't of moved. At least I still got too talk too him. Only about once or twice though. anyway, those times talking too him made me so happy. We talked about his dogs. One of his dogs names is @CAPS5, she was about @NUM6 months at the time. She started chasing her tail and when she went around about @NUM6 times, she tripped over her feet and fell on her rump. So, to end this trip down memory lane. Those three blasts from the pasts were the ones that made me laugh too help me feel better when I was feeling upset, or down.
609	21480	8	3	Laughter in life is a good thing to have, as it brings joy and happiness to our daily experiences. When I was younger, I had a beloved dog named Max. We enjoyed spending time together, whether it was going for walks, visiting the beach, or having picnics in the park. Max had a litter of puppies, each with unique names like Popcorn, Big Tail, and Mountain. Although I initially felt possessive of Max and didn't want him to have a family, I eventually realized that he deserved to have his own life and be happy.  The puppies, especially Popcorn, had their own quirks and behaviors that brought laughter into my life. They loved to chew on everything in sight and had a habit of nibbling on toes and hair. Despite the chaos they caused, their antics always made me smile. Max, on the other hand, had a fear of swimming but with patience and guidance, he eventually overcame his phobia. When I had to leave Max behind due to moving to another state, it was a heartbreaking moment, but I learned to cherish the memories and laughter he brought into my life.  In addition to dogs, I also had cats, each with their own unique personalities. From a wild kitty named Shadow to a speedy cat named Flash, they all added their own touch of humor and joy to my life. Laughter, I believe, is essential in relationships as well, as it can strengthen bonds and create lasting memories. It is a powerful tool that can help us navigate through life's challenges and find happiness in the little moments.  Having animals in my life has taught me the importance of laughter and how it can brighten even the darkest days. Whether it's through the playful antics of puppies or the quirky behaviors of cats, the joy and laughter they bring are priceless. Laughter is indeed a vital ingredient for a happy and fulfilling life, and I am grateful for the memories of joy and happiness that my furry friends have given me.
610	21481	8	3	Have you ever had that one moment with someone that you'll remember forever and laugh about every time you think about it? I have, and I think that everyone should have a moment of laughter in their life. On a particular day, my boyfriend from out of town decided to take me out for an early breakfast. He called me at four in the morning, claiming he was starving and needed food in his stomach. So, he picked me up around five am, and we went to a local diner. After finishing our meal early, he suggested going for a drive around town, despite being unfamiliar with the area.  As we ventured onto gravel roads, we soon realized it might be time to head back. However, when he attempted to turn the car around, he mistakenly drove into a muddy field. Despite my warning, he insisted he could get the car out. After several failed attempts, he ended up covered in mud from head to toe. I couldn't contain my laughter, which only increased when he playfully smeared mud on my face, leading to both of us falling into the mud.  To add to the comedy of errors, I had accidentally left the car in reverse, causing the doors to lock automatically. It took us nearly two hours to unlock the doors and free the car from the mud. When I shared the story with my family, we couldn't stop laughing, and it has become a hilarious memory we continue to reminisce about. Laughter truly is the best medicine, and that day will always be a cherished moment of joy in my life.

612	21483	8	3	"My grandfather always used to say, ""life is like a kaleidoscope, you can keep turning and turning and it may seem like it is changing, but really it's just repeating itself."" I have always wondered if the statement really applies to life, and if it does why would we want life to continue in the same pattern, if it isn't going like we had planned. When I was twelve, me and my two little sisters were split up and three thousand miles were crammed in between us. I was put here in a new location while they remained in our hometown, where I was born. At first, the pain of those three thousand miles was devastating. It was like I had two of my essential organs removed from my body. Eventually though time passed and the agony lessened its grip on our lives. It may seem cruel at times, but most of the time now the thought of them doesn't cross my mind. Maybe it's true what they say, ""out of sight, out of mind.""  It's sad to think of how close my sisters and I were before the change. We did everything together. We are very close in age, the youngest and I are only two years apart. I remember all the times we would spend outside on humid summer days. We would look as white as ghosts because of all the sunscreen my mother would generously apply to our skin. Times were different then, they were happy, I was happy. If I think really hard, I can see us sitting on the shag carpet in my room, playing with dolls until the sunlight melted slowly into darkness. If only I could have that moment again even for a second, then maybe I could feel that happy content feeling once again.  Although much time has passed since our separation, I still have those days when I feel that my world is caving in around me because they are so far away. I'll give them a call and the questions are always uncomfortable at first, like between strangers meeting for the first time. I can feel the three thousand mile scab on my heart reopen and it bleeds as though I am leaving all over again. I ask myself why do I bother to call if it hurts this bad? And then I hear it, like the beautiful sound of classical music to my ears, I hear them laugh. I have that feeling I needed all of a sudden, I am happy. With every small giggle, my smile grows because I know I have made them feel whole again and for a second I have let them forget about how far I really am. Their laughter makes those three thousand miles evaporate into the air. In those moments of laughter, I know that we are close again, that we are sisters, not strangers. It's true what my grandfather says, because no matter how my life changes, I will always have that feeling of total bliss when I hear the sweet laughs of my little sisters."
613	21484	8	3	"I rested my back on the cool steel of the lockers trying to ease my nerves. ""@CAPS1 game is everything we have worked for- every excruciating practice, every tedious drill, and every game film we have studied down to the minutia. It was all to prepare us for tonight. @CAPS7 we lose tonight, everything we have worked was for nothing."" I listened attentively as @PERSON1, our team captain, spoke. The words she chose for our pre-game speech were straight to the point, and anything but sugar coated. As I glanced around the locker room it was easy to observe that everyone one of my teammates was anxious. Emilie was vigorously chewing what was left of her nails, while @LOCATION1 preferred to show her uneasiness by the constant tapping of her foot. @PERSON1 finished her speech, and with the break of our huddle we entered the gymnasium. The stands were packed with familiar faces of our small town. In a small section of the stands there was a group of people wearing colors not native to our school. @CAPS1 brutal reminder brought my attention back to warm ups.  The twenty minutes we had for warm ups seemed to last no longer than two minutes. The announcer began to state our starting line up, but it was no use. The roar of the crowd overpowered the speaker system. It seemed as @CAPS7 everyone from our town of five thousand was attending the game. Not an empty space was left in the bleachers. The bench vibrated from the stomping and clapping of the crowd, threatening with every shake to collapse. The starting five for each team walked out to the center of the court for tip off. With the loss of the tip off our team was quickly put under pressure. From the first possession of the game we were chasing our opponent.  The first two quarters ended with a dead even score. Feeling discouraged my team regrouped in the locker room for @DATE2 time. We entered the locker room a moment before my @CAPS3. I took @CAPS1 opportunity to @CAPS2 around at the expressions' of my teammates. Nothing, but disappointment and fear crossed their face's. My @CAPS3 opened the door, and I instinctively braced myself for the throwing of keys against the wall, or the smash of the clip board. My team had witnessed these acts of rage countless times before. To my surprise, my @CAPS3 entered with complete poise and composure, as @CAPS7 our first @DATE2 of treacherous play didn't phase him. We were not yelled at, or criticized. Instead, he rubbed his eyes, face down and shoulders hunched over. His belly began to shake, shortly followed by his shoulders. My first hypothesis was that he was crying, but then to my amazement, I heard the soft chuckle of our @CAPS3. Soon that soft chuckle metamorphosised into a stomach thrusting, loud cackle. My team exchanged confused glances, and waited for my @CAPS3's explanation in anticipation.  ""@CAPS2 at yourself!"" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ordered. ""@CAPS5 are all more tentative than when I asked @PERSON2 out to my first dance!"" We could always rely on @CAPS3 for an unrelated metaphor. Even @CAPS7 it wasn't related to basketball, the point was clear. ""@CAPS7 @CAPS5 guys would just believe in yourself the way I believe in @CAPS5, @CAPS1 game would be a blow out! Instead, @CAPS5 are playing like a bunch of bunny foo-foos!"" We all laughed with the thought of playing like the nursery rhyme we had hear so frequently when we were children. The speech @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gave eased us all. The confident team we should have been from the start of the match was now prepared to win the @DATE2. To think that @CAPS1 confidence came from just one comforting laugh seemed almost improbable.  The whistle blew to start the @DATE2. We played with such assertiveness and confidence that @CAPS7 @CAPS5 were to compare one @DATE2 with the other, it would @CAPS2 like two different teams. We grasped the lead early in the @DATE1, and sustained it for the rest of the game. The victory of that night's game lead us one round deeper into the state tournament. As I walked back to the locker room I glanced around the massive gym. I looked at: the crowd, score board, opponents, referees and news reporters. I realized how easy it is to get caught up everything that shouldn't effect @CAPS5. All the distractions easily make @CAPS5 forget the main purpose of why @"
614	21485	8	3	"Freshmen year, @CAPS1 season. I have been @CAPS1 for about eight years now, I made varsity in a @NUM1 school in @LOCATION1 my first year in high school. Being the only freshmen on the varsity squad, everybody knew who I was, ""The short kid on the varsity @CAPS1 squad."" @CAPS2 a eighth grader I won junior state and wrestled all the way through the brackets without @CAPS1 a full match. Meaning that I pinned everyone in the first round. I couldn't be touched. Going into high school I knew that I wouldn't have @CAPS2 easy of a time like in grade school. I was completely right. My coach had to be the funniest person that I have ever met in my life. @PERSON1 was my @CAPS3 teacher since the @NUM2 grade and has been my role model all the way through life. He made the funniest jokes about wrestlers on the team. A lot of people disliked @PERSON1 @CAPS12 @CAPS4 and him got along great. I ended the season freshmen year with @NUM3 wins, @NUM4 pins, and @NUM4 losses. I still to @CAPS13 day haven't been pinned. Which got @CAPS4 the wrestler of the year awarded by my @CAPS1 coach @PERSON4. When the season rolled around to regionals I knew that I had a shot to go to state. There were six guys in my weight class and four of the six I have previously beaten in early season. I had to just worry about my match ahead of @CAPS4 and wrestle mistake free.  At the @NUM6 pound weight class there is a bunch of little kids. I was definitely the most experienced in my weight class. I got seated first seed. The second seed was @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1. He dropped weight so he could try and take my seating for state. My first match I wrestled @CAPS5 from @CAPS6-@CAPS7-@CAPS8. The match was very short-lived. I pinned him in about @NUM4 seconds. After my match with @CAPS5 I walked to my coach and he told @CAPS4 a quote that I will never forget, ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11's lonely at the top, @CAPS12 the view is excellent."" @CAPS13 quote stuck in my head throughout all of my next matches. I won my second and third matches and was in the semi-finals. I was one round away from going to state automatically. I wrestled @CAPS5 from @PERSON3 and he weighed @NUM8 lbs. I knew that he was a good wrestler even though I had about @NUM9 pounds on him. I was getting ready to wrestle and I seen @CAPS5 warming up across the gym from @CAPS4. @CAPS2 he was jumping around getting warmed up I see him trip and fall on his face. My coach had seen the same thing and started making fun of him. @CAPS11 was the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed. I wrestled through the match and pinned him in double overtime to go to state. My coach walks up to @CAPS4 and says ""@CAPS11 took you that long to pin someone who can't even warm up without falling on his face."" @PERSON1 had about three teeth total in his mouth. He lost them from a lot of different ways. He was a adventure man. He loved white water rafting and loved the sport of @CAPS1. When I moved, I was far away from my idolized @CAPS1 coach, @CAPS12 we still hit @CAPS11 up on the facebook and chitchat. To @CAPS13 day, he is still the funniest man I know and still my idol. My high school freshman year was filled with challenges, victories, and unforgettable moments, all thanks to the guidance and humor of my coach, who remains a constant source of inspiration in my life."
615	21487	8	3	Many people think that laughter is not a big part of a relationship. However, I believe that having a good laugh with your partner is essential for a healthy and strong bond. I have personally experienced the positive impact of laughter in my own relationship with my girlfriend. We enjoy sharing jokes and making each other laugh, which brings us closer together and creates a positive and joyful atmosphere. In addition to my relationship, laughter also plays a significant role in my family life. My dad, in particular, has a great sense of humor and always manages to lift our spirits with his funny remarks, even after a long day at work. I have learned that laughter not only strengthens relationships but also brings joy and positivity to everyday life. Furthermore, laughter is also crucial in forming and maintaining friendships. When I spend time with my friends, we often share jokes and funny stories that create a sense of camaraderie and happiness among us. In conclusion, laughter is a powerful tool that can enhance relationships, bring families closer, and strengthen friendships. It is an essential element in maintaining a positive and happy environment in all aspects of life.
616	21488	8	3	"When I was a young boy I used to laugh at anything I could, but as a kid who didn't? As I got older and grew more, I developed a great sense of humor that to my advantage made me a young people pleaser. I grew more and more developing a stronger, more confident sense of humor. I could always remember making people laugh and loving the attention I received from humor.  As my body grew older and my humor grew more funny I had made myself more dependent on my people pleasing personality. In addition, I then taught myself how to alter my voice and change my tone for a more humorous effect. It was a step I knew was appropriate to advance my humorous personality. I had no intention of losing my humor, so I used it to my advantage.  I used my humor to boost my social status, to get attention from non-accepting peers, and to get the attention that I thrived on. I had begun to be accepted by higher peer groups that used to look down on me and it seemed as if I had a lot of the attention. Anything I could do to make my fellow peers laugh was a goal for me. As I advanced into high school, I knew my humor needed work to keep my peers still laughing, I just didn't know what kind of work I needed. That was when I started to ultimately lose my funny, humorous personality.  I had then dropped in the peer ranks, down to the kids I thought were once called strange. I was friends with people who didn't always keep their heads up and were constantly down and seemed never positive. I was letting people that I called friends drag me to the bottom when I knew I should be more at the top. This was my first major downfall in which I had successfully lost my humorous personality. One of my friends especially brought me down more than anyone else, down to a level of being unhappy. That so-called ""friend"" took me down so far that I needed therapy to help me get back up to a normal level of happiness.  I finally realized that it wasn't fun to be someone's friend who only drags you down. I finally broke free of that clutch when she moved, I wasn't mean enough to say I didn't want to be friends with her, it was just too hard for me. When she moved, it allowed me to heal myself and pay more attention to my humor. I had broken my dark days away and started back on my endless trail of humor. It was hard to accept the fact that I had lost my humor for what seemed to be forever, and lost my spot in the social bracket which would be hard to regain. But after a month of hard work and focus on both school and humor, I had got my personality back to normal!  Instantly after I regained my humor, I began to feel more happy. I received more attention and felt like I was back to where I should be, although I was just a little lower. Back in the saddle of humor, back to the laughs of my peers, back to the smiles, and most importantly back to the way I used to be. I had to regain all of my humor and personality, my tones, voices, and jokes but it was worth it, in a strange way. As I now continue my humor as a junior, and I have not successfully lost it yet, but there is always a future. I managed to turn the best thing I had to the worst I have felt in a matter of weeks, then right back up again. In the end, it's not what you have that matters, it is what you can do to please yourself and in the end, I would not change a thing!"
617	21489	8	3	In @NUM1 grade to @NUM2 grade was the happy time of my life. i had a teacher name @PERSON1. she love mickey mouse. i wish that sometime can go back there. in @NUM1 grade i was to the class room i know my of friends was with but did know the teacher. i didn't know what think of her at the @CAPS1 but i know have to get know her because she was my teacher for @NUM4 years. at one of my meeting my p.e. teacher teach me how to try my shoes.everyday we in ours journal we have did to tell a story about something i all ways talk about @PERSON2 and she will all ways tell me don't writer about her tell something new.in @NUM1 grade. my class and i we got to coffer shop for a frip trip. in @NUM6 my class read over @NUM7 book we have a party. sometime in the @DATE1 time we all get together and we will have a ice cream party. when @DATE2 come around we all ways do a musical every years. in @NUM8 i when to outdoor school it was fun and cool. In outdoor school, we participated in various activities like hiking, learning about nature, and bonding with classmates. The memories created during those years will always hold a special place in my heart, especially the fun times spent with my beloved teacher and classmates.
618	21490	8	3	Laughter saved my life. Growing up, my life was pretty normal. Me, my little brother, mom, and dad, all living happily together in a nice suburban area. But two years ago, everything changed; and it seemed as though it wasn't for the better. My parents got a divorce. It was all very strange because at that time in my life I thought that that couldn't happen to me; it was impossible. As I talked to my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. But thought I came to grips with my new life, I still was unhappy a lot of the time. But the times when I was with my best friends and caring family, were the times that I forgot about all of the things going on at home.  George and I have been really close friends since the 1st grade. We are inseparable. Though I have many other friends, he is the one I would always turn to if there's a problem. He knows me better than anybody else. We talk every day at school, we text message each other every night, and hang out almost every weekend. The night that my parents told me they were getting a divorce I called him crying. He told me that in the end it would all be okay, and he told me that he was always there for me if I needed anything. At that point in time it was clear to me that I had something that not a lot of people can say they had in their lifetime: A true friend who would be there through anything with me. He and I would joke about all my problems. To some, that might seem a little strange; but it was almost therapeutic to me. Making fun of my life made it easier to live it in a sense. It helped me to realize that I need to let go of the past, and that just because there's a rough patch, doesn't mean that the rest of my life is destined to be this way. George knew how to cheer me up, and he could always tell when I needed a good talk or a good laugh to make my day better.  A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, to do crazy things, and to lay on the couch all day watching sappy love movies with. For me, it's Jane. When we're together there is no stopping us. She was always right by my side through my parents' divorce. She was there with me on my last night in my house before we moved out. We sat on my bed in my empty room, recalling all the memories the house had given us. Some would think this would be a sad time, but all we did was laugh. Because all of the memories were good ones. We weren't crying because we were upset; we were crying from laughing about all of our insane adventures for hours. To me, that's a pretty good reason to cry. We re-lived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to let the situation make us upset. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one; that we would always remember.  My family is quite strange; but we do know how to have a good time. I don't have many family members, but I think that because we are so tightly knit, we get along really well. Whether we're out in the backyard playing a game of wiffle ball, or in the house playing pranks with whoopie cushions, it's always a fun time at my aunt Sarah's house. During the rough times of the divorce, I would spend a lot of time at my aunt Sarah's house because I didn't have to worry about being questioned all the time about how I was feeling; I just had to worry about if I should bring sneakers to go on a hike, or if I should bring my pajamas in case we decided to have a movie night sleepover. That house is a place I still go to just relax, and forget about whatever might be worrying me. Aunt Sarah's is a safe haven for me to just let go, and have a good time with some of my favorite people in the world; my family.  If I didn't have all these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow up, I'm realizing that these people have molded the person I am today. They helped me through the roughest time in my life, and that proves how much they really care about me. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. Laughing helps to get you through terrible times, but the people who make you laugh are really what matter most. I can honestly say that every one of these people have made me a better person, and I love them with all my heart.
619	21491	8	3	"Life is a serious matter that should be taken into consideration. Life is what you make it and I have given my best efforts to achieve this goal; even when it seems senseless. It may be hard to not be an effect of the world's chaos and daily epidemic, but doesn't it seem easier or less stressful to smile than to frown? To live life in the moment with no worries of what is gonna happen, just to be carefree, I would consider it exhilarating. To be nothing but the purest form of tranquility.  My memories as a child are faint, but I am glad to say that I have some. Happiness as a child is most pure in my position. I long for that purity I once had, as most do. It was my favorite pair of plastic Barbie high heel shoes or my special princess backpack with every princess or superhero. It was my parents making funny faces that made me explode in laughter because I could not possibly hold it in any longer. All I longed for was a picnic under my favorite long green-haired willow tree, to feel as free as the birds, to sing their beautiful songs, and to dance around with a never-ending smile. It's the fragile youth of a child I longed for.  As life goes on, my purity has faded and the distance from people, the community, and myself has extended till I felt alone in solemn. I had changed as a person when life burned me one too many times. I felt God had betrayed me if not hated me. I then had become a stone-cold wall that no one could penetrate. But as I gazed into the mirror, I no longer saw a passion for life, just hatred. This moment in time changed my life perspective. My strong hatred for the world began to handicap me in various if not most important aspects. If I couldn't open up to myself - how could I open up to the world?  To learn, to be free, and to grow was my ultimate goal. Within myself, I learned the most important lesson; laughter and willingness to be optimistic, compassionate, and understanding. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I believe this is an honest opinion worth trying to prove. Laughter changed my life, my world, and it's a reoccurring symptom that I take pride in every day. In my most embarrassing moments, most angry of times, and even within my deepest sorrows, I still manage to scrape up a smile.  Helping people helped me realize and understand this is a passion of mine. I want to help the world not hide from their pain, but just to realize life can take a twisted turn and still end up being alright. Even within the deepest darkest caves, there is always a rock awaiting to crumble to bring light. To me, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. In my light -- a smile can carry. I want to be that light. I want to be that relieving feeling that everything will be alright, so I live my life through a gracious smile. In my perspective, if you create a smile, you will receive three more. This is my motto, ""See life for what its new adventures bring, just smile, the world will continuously turn as life rolls on."""
620	21494	8	3	Laughter can mean different things to different people. It can be a way to cope with difficult situations, express oneself, or simply enjoy the company of friends. As we grow older, the meaning of laughter may evolve as well. When faced with a heartbreaking loss, such as the passing of a loved one, finding solace in laughter can be a powerful coping mechanism. Reflecting on memories and sharing moments of joy with others can help ease the pain and keep the spirit alive. While the future may hold uncertainties, having the support of family and friends can make the journey a little lighter. It is important to remember that life goes on, and finding moments of laughter amidst the tears can be a healing experience. So, embrace the love and laughter around you, and keep moving forward with strength and resilience.
621	21495	8	3	Every one laughs, i love to laugh in fact that's one of my favorite things to do. If your in a bad mood or just cant get happy, laugh at things cause i am sure it will lighten up your mood and i will tell you what, its also very good for you in many ways. If people didn't laugh then this world world would be a very depressing, you smile at someone who isn't the happiest could totally change their mood. So as i have told you before i am a very happy and energetic person and laughing is what i do best,and i smile at everyone around me. well i have a story for you, i like to volunteer at homeless shelters and old folks home cause i believe i should share my happiness with everyone else around me it makes my soul feel good to help people out. This one after noon i was doing what i do best laughing and having a good time at the old folks home making people smile, they all love having me around cause they say i cheer them up. I run around room to room bringing in vases of flowers opening their curtains to let the beautiful sunshine in, i always told them vitamin D is good to warm up the soul. There was this one man there who had never have a smile on his face and i did the same to him as i did to the other residents and no matter what i did he would never smile. When ever i came in he was always gazing out the window with a dead look on his face, so i had ask the nurses why he was so grumpy and quiet and they had told me he was a veteran. He didn't have much family from what i understood, or well at least they didn't visit him much they just dropped him off cause they didn't want to deal with the grumpiness any more. but i have a heart of gold and i feel like i should share. I had decided one day that i was going to turn that frown on his cute little face upside down, and make him feel happy and smile and interact with the other residents. So as usual i went in and did my daily routine to all the other rooms, we talked did some laughing and all sorts of stuff. I had saved the little old man for last i wasn't sure what his name was or what the what his whole background was like but i was going to go for it! I went in and he was staring out the window as usual, i hesitated for a minute cause i didn't know how he would react. So i went up and started talking to him, i introduced myself but he didn't seem to pleased. I asked him his name and he told me it was none of my business and that totally shot me down made me feel like i was the bad guy. So i started talking to him and asked him about his life, he had slowly opened up to and told me about all the stuff he had seen in the Vietnam war. He turned out to be a nice guy, all those nurses were wrong about him they didn't even try. We laughed for hours me and him, and it didn't get old. Ever since i talked to him he has been progressively started interacting with the others, they just didn't give him the time of day to explain his feelings or someone to talk to. So think about it next time your going to the store and you see someone who doesn't look like they're having the best day, and shot them a smile!!! :)
622	21500	8	3	I agree with the sentiment expressed in the original text about the value of having a best friend who can make you laugh. Laughter truly is a powerful tool for lifting one's spirits and finding joy in even the most difficult times. Having someone to share those moments of uncontrollable laughter with is a precious gift that not everyone is fortunate enough to have. It's wonderful to have a friend like @CAPS14 who can turn a bad day into a memorable evening filled with laughter and shared stories. These moments of joy and connection are what truly make life special and meaningful. Cherish those moments with your best friend, for they are truly priceless.
623	21501	8	3	Laughter is indeed a powerful tool that can bring people closer together. In the case of the narrator and their father, laughter played a significant role in strengthening their bond after a tumultuous time with the narrator's mother. Despite the challenges they faced, the father's sense of humor and the joy they found in each other's company helped them form a deep connection. Laughter not only lightened the mood but also created lasting memories that the narrator cherishes. It is a reminder of the importance of finding joy and humor in relationships, as it can help navigate through difficult times and build strong, meaningful connections with others.
624	21502	8	3	"A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I felt simply @CAPS5. I was very stoical; my life was nadir. Helplessly. I had written a @CAPS2 to my hero; no reply. I was determine to wait @CAPS3 see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lighting, astounding; his name is @PERSON6. I understand his music.  My best friend @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I, would always talk about how awesome his music is; in fact @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @ORGANIZATION1. We were two different people; I didn'@CAPS8 even think we could be friends, or have anything in common. @CAPS20' music brought us together.  @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I wrote a @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1; I thought to myself ""@PERSON6 is not even going to look at it,"" but I watched @PERSON4 write the @CAPS2. Weeks @CAPS3 weeks past by @CAPS3 I really thought @ORGANIZATION1 wasn'@CAPS8 going to read or reply. After that @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started to dilapidated. I felt discourage; we only talked about @PERSON6 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 photography project. We were really procrastinating toward @CAPS6 project; I had been a little distracted with cheer-leading @CAPS3 homework form the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring @PERSON4 calls @CAPS3 texts. Until I realize I had made a wrong choice; @CAPS15 I called my friend @PERSON4--thank god I did. A week later @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I @CAPS3 two of my friends: @PERSON5, my best friend since seventh grade; @LOCATION2, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On @CAPS6 way there, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I were telling @PERSON5 @CAPS3 @PERSON4 about @CAPS6 amazing experience in health: @CAPS6 health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I, facetious made an alien-looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes @CAPS3 @CAPS6 alien had warts all over. We laughed non-stop, obviously we didn'@CAPS8 turn it in. When we arrived to the dorms, @CAPS3 @PERSON4 presented me to his friend @CAPS8.J; @CAPS18 was a big fan of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS9."" @CAPS10 we played various games I notice @CAPS8.J, had some warts on his hands, @CAPS3 when @CAPS18 took off his shoes; to put on his saddles, I couldn'@CAPS8 help but notice @CAPS18 somewhat reminded me of @CAPS6 drawing. I hysterically started to laugh non-stop, my friend @CAPS12 kept asking me why I was laughing, I said ""@CAPS8.J looks like my alien,"" @CAPS18 said ""wow that's rude."" I said ""In my eyes that's the perfect body."" We all had a good laugh @CAPS3 kept playing games @CAPS3 listening to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I had to meet, to work on @CAPS6 photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each-other @CAPS3 the things that we like @CAPS3 dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about @PERSON4 threw this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life to fast, @CAPS3 I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but school @CAPS3 sports sometimes held me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest. But I love my life @CAPS3 wouldn'@CAPS8 trade it; everything that I do gets me closer to my goal: @CAPS14.B.I agent. This project was vehement. To me it was a @CAPS1, a way of life telling me ""hang on, you'll make it;"" all due to a simple call. We were working hard, when @PERSON4 phone kept ringing. I was a little cantankerous. I said "" @PERSON4 answer the phone!"" @CAPS15 @CAP"
625	21503	8	3	On a hot summer day during the middle of July, my friend and I were camping in a beautiful location by the ocean. We had joined her family on their camping trip, staying in their cozy RV. Our campsite provided easy access to the beach, where we enjoyed daily walks and soaking up the sun.   One morning, we were unexpectedly woken up at six thirty in the morning. Despite staying up until the early hours of the morning, we were energized by the news that we were going to take a plane to another city where my friend's sister was in labor. With only a few hours of sleep, we fueled ourselves with strong coffee for the long day ahead.   The journey to the airport was filled with laughter and silliness, as we found humor in everything around us. Our infectious giggles even caught the attention of a fellow passenger who turned out to be a secret agent, adding to our excitement.   Arriving at the hospital, we were overjoyed to meet the new baby and share in the family's happiness. After a quick meal, we passed the time with shopping and visiting my friend's family before heading back to camp. Exhausted but fulfilled, we reflected on the day's events with a sense of gratitude for our friendship and shared adventures.   The bond we share, filled with laughter and unforgettable moments, keeps us close and makes every experience together a memorable one.
626	21505	8	3	Laughter truly is the best medicine, especially when it comes to relationships. It has the power to lighten moods, strengthen bonds, and bring people closer together. In my own experience, sharing a good laugh with my boyfriend completely turned our relationship around. We went from being moody and serious to smiling and happy, all thanks to a night of jokes and laughter. Since then, we've made it a point to incorporate laughter into our daily lives, and our relationship has never been better. I now understand the importance of laughter in a relationship, and I believe it is essential for maintaining a strong and healthy connection with your partner. In the end, I can't imagine life without laughter, as it truly has the ability to work wonders and bring so much joy and happiness into our lives.
627	21506	8	3	"I love laughing! Laughing makes me feel satisfied and happy. When I laugh with someone I don't know, I feel like I've known them for a long time. When I laugh with someone I do know, I feel fully content. But there is one person with whom I love to laugh with most of all, my cousin @PERSON1. I think that laughing is an important part of our relationship because when we laugh, its magical. Magical as in how fast and @CAPS5 it takes to make one of us laugh. We will say almost anything, the most random but humorous things, then we will laugh until we literally cry. One @TIME1, when we were talking on the phone, we decided to call up our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up we hung up disappointed. I was thinking of the @CAPS1 movie that I had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started coming to me. I started talking in @CAPS1 to my cousin, pretending that I was our aunt from @LOCATION2. I told her how I was coming over for a visit in the @DATE1 @CAPS11 they had better be prepared. I like my bed nice and soft, fluffy pillows, and my own bathroom. I was the picky aunt. I want everything perfect for when I come. We laughed and laughed. Then @PERSON1 says to me, ""@CAPS3 don't we call @CAPS4 again and if he doesn't pick up, we'll leave a message."" ""@CAPS5 will we say in the message?"", I asked. ""@CAPS6'll just say that @CAPS6're his aunt from @LOCATION2 and that @CAPS6're coming for a visit and all the rest @CAPS6'll just make up.""""@CAPS7"", I said hesitantly. I dialed star six seven then his number and pressed talk. Luckily, no one picked up. But when the answering machine beeped allowing me to record a message, I was speechless. Then I started in my high picky aunt voice, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS4, this is your aunt @LOCATION1 and I..."" I burst out laughing before I could continue. ""I.. I'm coming over for a visit in.."", again I exploded. I could hear @PERSON1 laughing in the background, which made me laugh even harder. I tried again this time getting farther into the story laughing here and there. By the time I had reached the maximum amount of time for the message, I was @CAPS11 into it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only half way done. @CAPS11 after the answering machine was done talking, I pressed two to here my message. As I listened, I couldn't help thinking about @CAPS5 a complete fool I sounded like. @PERSON1 kept shushing me each time I laughed to loud, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too. She was just holding it in. When I hung up, I called her back and when she answered I said, ""@CAPS10 do it again because I didn't finish.""@CAPS11 we called again and this time I said the rest more willingly and I barely laughed. I was saving it for when we listened to it. When we had our fill of laughter and wiping tears, @PERSON1 said, ""That was the most hilarious thing we ever did together, we have to do it again sometime."" ""For sure"", I told her. But it was late into the @TIME1, and time to go. When we had finished our good bye's and I love @CAPS6's we hung up. That @TIME1 and every other time I laugh, I think @CAPS5 would it be like if no one could laugh. @CAPS5 a boring place this would be, @CAPS5 a lifeless life. When I laugh, I feel lively. I want to live to laugh another day. If there were no laughter, that would be a shame, for I dearly love to laugh. Laughing with my cousin @PERSON1 is truly special, as we create unforgettable memories filled with joy and laughter that strengthen our bond even more. The moments we share together, laughing until our stomachs ache and tears stream down our faces, are priceless and bring us closer together. I am grateful for the gift of laughter, especially when shared with someone as dear to me as my cousin. Laughing with her is a reminder of the happiness and love we bring into each other's lives, making every moment spent together truly magical."
628	21507	8	3	"To me laughter shows the importance of life. I have always felt that in any situation whether good or bad laughter can completely change the way people handle those situations. When it comes to a relationship simply laughing can help anyone. Laughing symbolizes happiness and it is more than important for the people in a relationship to be happy. I have had many horrible situations where just laughing has helped us work through it. Laughing has always changed my mood and helped me through situations. When you get yourself so worked up about little things you forget about the good things in life and begin to lose your patience with each other, this has happened to me a lot. A time this happened to me was when me and my boyfriend were on our way to a vacation and it seemed like everything about that trip was going wrong. We went for a vacation away from our hectic home life's and ended up wishing we were anywhere but where we were! They had overbooked our hotel, our car broke down, my credit card account was being held for hours and it seemed as if that trip was the biggest mistake we had ever made. There was so much tension between us that we couldn't even look at each other without getting into a fight. We ended up going to some cheap hotel and spending the only cash we had. The next morning things got so bad that just being in the same room made us want to lash out and kill each other. He ended up leaving for the day and we didn't talk for when he came back, but even when he got back after not being together for a day it was still hard being around each other. The next morning we woke up and by this time we were both fed up and have had more than enough. The only thing we did was mope around and fight, this made us realize we were really stuck and this vacation could no longer be called a vacation. There was no one we knew around to loan us money, no banks only an ATM and we realized we were not at our dream vacation destination more like in a nightmare. We had pretty much given up and lost faith in actually having a ""good vacation"" and had given up on each other. We were done, wanted nothing to do with each other or this nightmare anymore. This nightmare had ruined who we thought we were and we no longer looked at each other as a happy couple anymore, but more as two people who completely despised each other. The next day I decided to call my bank and see what was going on with my account, it turned out I forgot I changed my pin number to access my account. The entire time I kept entering the wrong pin so they locked my account to be sure someone was trying to break into it. I could not even describe how dumb I felt. I knew that as soon as I came back with the news even though it seemed like things would be alright, they wouldn't. When I arrived back at the hotel I could feel the tension as soon as I walked into the room. I began packing my stuff and when he caught on to what I was doing he asked where I was going, I replied ""to luxury"". Instantly his face lit up and he asked ""how"" and after I explained to him what had happened he instantly began laughing and hugged me. I knew as soon as I saw that smile on his face and heard laughter that things between us would be alright after all. We finally had the money to rent a car and get to our dream destination. When we arrived at the hotel things were going great, we were smiling and laughing and actually enjoying ourselves. I can honestly say that even though all those horrible situations happened that I enjoyed our trip. I strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason led us to a week full of laughter and true happiness. Laughter truly is the best medicine and can turn any nightmare into a dream come true."
629	21508	8	3	"Laughter is necessary to survive in this crazy and beautiful world. It is something we possess with us throughout our lifetime. As humans, we grow old and eventually die, but laughter never does. It lives on forever. Laughter is often referred to as 'the best medicine', and why shouldn't it be? It brings joy to the sad, relief to the burdened, and life to the depressed. The best part about laughing is that it is completely and unchangeably free! Never will someone have to pay to gain a drop of laughter. On the other hand, laughter is also contagious. A single smile, throw back of a head, and a gut busting laugh can cause an entire room to become ill to this glorified epidemic. Laughter is the best release. When I was younger I had a neighbor named @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON1 was an older man who spent most of his time in his carpentering shop. He never talked to the rest of us on our street nor did we attempt to strike up a conversation with him. Day in and day out I would notice his little red pick-up leave in the morning and return at night. His life seemed like more of a routine and I was curious to find out why. @PERSON1 had a wife who, as well, became a vampire to the rest of us. This was completely fine, because to us, she was a monster. Countless times soccer balls would be kicked into her yard by pure accident and she would come out of her quiet house yelling and waving her hands in our direction. She even left a note on my family's front door telling them to ""take better care of your lawn"". I sympathized with @PERSON1 for having to live with the woman. Something in her voice seemed off, as if she was deaf. That aspect of her life always made me feel a little bad for her. Being different could have been a possible explanation to why she treated people the way that she did.  I will never forget the day the ambulance pulled up in front of their perfectly serene house. I sat on my front porch silently watching the medics go inside the house. Not long after, I heard the little red pick-up coming up the road. I knew, as far as everyone else on @ORGANIZATION1, that this was not part of the routine. After about @NUM1 minutes, a body was carried out on a stretcher. My heart sank. Even though I was young, I knew the significance of a hovering white sheet over a being. @PERSON1 was very secluded after his wife passed away. Nobody could blame him for that. He lost the love of his life; he lost his routine. My family discussed and decided to bring him meals. The food was never anything particularly fancy, just something that would keep him going. I've never seen anyone so appreciative. Still, we knew to stay off of his lawn. His wife loved it and he must have felt like she was still attached to it somehow. He was lonely and my family wanted to be there for him. Soon after we brought over meals, my younger sister and I started walking his small, white, fluffy dog and invited him over for dinner as often as our mom would let us. He became more like a grandfather than a neighbor. One day, my friends and I were outside playing soccer on our small street. It was sunny and warm outside. Life was good. I could feel the vivacity of youth pulsing through my veins as I ran around. As of on its own, the ball rolled into @ORGANIZATION2's yard. We all hesitated when we saw his door open. He looked pestered and quite upset as he slowly bent down to pick up our ball. I winced, knowing I'd hear about this later from my parents. Then the unexpected happened, @PERSON1 started laughing. The kind of laugh where a person might be considered crazy for being that happy. The kind of laugh where tears run down a person's face. Not knowing what to do, my friends and I started giggling to ourselves. @PERSON1 threw us the ball and went back inside. His laugh was a clear signal, @ORGANIZATION2's grieving and unhappy soul had been relieved.  From then on, laughter has meant a great deal to me. Laughing can direct you straight to a person's soul. It can be the connection between people. Without laughter, life can seem dull. Once it is brought into your life, it has the powers to heal and restart. That is exactly what it did for @ORGANIZATION2. Through laughter, he got his life back. Laughter truly is a gift that keeps on giving, connecting us all in moments of joy and healing."
630	21509	8	3	So one day I was at home babysitting my little brother. It was a super boring day. So I go check my email, and I get an email from my boyfriend. I got excited to talk to him because I got my phone taken away. I open it, and it was a break-up email. It was so shocking. I wanted to cry. So I called my mom on the home phone, and asked if my best friend @PERSON1 could come over. My mom said yes. I called my best friend @PERSON1 and told her what had happened, and asked her to come over. By this time I was crying my eyes out. @PERSON1 said yes to coming over! @PERSON1 is my best friend in the whole world! She always knows what to do and say when I'm upset. I was waiting for her for a long time. Her mom always takes forever when she's out doing things. She finally gets to my house, and she gives me a big hug! We are always there for one another. I have always been there when all of @CAPS1's boyfriends had dumped her so it felt nice for her to be for me this time. I haven't had as many boyfriends as she has. So we go to my room, and I'm still crying. I couldn't stop. It was like a river flowing down my face. Being dumped really is a horrible feeling. He was the best boyfriend ever, so that he dumped me was very unlike him. @PERSON1 was just sitting there texting. I was thinking, why are you just texting, you should be comforting me. I didn't want to say it so I didn't. So we started to talk and we decided to go to the mall. That's always a fun place to be. So we ask my mom. She had just gotten home. She said no. I really didn't want to be at home; anywhere was better than home at that time. So we went back to my room, and I was crying again. So @PERSON1 started to say bad things about my ex-boyfriend. I knew the things weren't true, but it was really, really funny. We were both laughing really hard and I was starting to feel better! Yay @PERSON1 making up stupid ex-boyfriend jokes! Laughter is the best way to make everything better!
631	21510	8	3	"The thought of seeing him and hearing his laugh never failed to make me smile. I was beginning to accept the fact that this was an urge I couldn't fight anymore. His sense of humor was the best I had encountered and it made my heart run wild. To me, the best piece of a relationship is learning about one another and exploring the little things that make that person who they are. A trait I always search for is someones humor and when I can easily find it, I thrive on it. My story takes place nearly a year ago, while my freshmen school year was coming to an end. I had a suitcase of new memories I planned to carry with with me, but one more was still to be added. I strolled into art class merely @NUM1 seconds late on a particularly average day. The musty smell of rain and old paint settled in the air, something I had come accustom to. Instinct told me to take my seat, so with my headphones blocking the rest of the world out, I did. I paused my music to allow my surroundings to come into focus. A voice with a highly sarcastic tone came from in front of me. ""@CAPS1 to go! You're late."" @CAPS2 the teacher had moved all of our seats, I couldn't help but to laugh at myself as well. However, my seat remained unchanged, the only new aspect was the people sitting around me. I greeted the familiar faces with a smile as class began. The teacher went on about art related topics that I was far beyond, so by habit I vaguely payed any attention. I was far more focused on the person sitting in front of me. I had never talked to this boy but there was something very intriguing about him. We barley said a few words on that day of class. As the next day approached, I continued my usual pattern of entering the room and sitting in the same place. It had slipped my mind that a stranger was going to sit in front of me. He turned into the room took his seat. @CAPS2 what I had forgotten made me excited. Today was a free work day, a time to be social and work at our own pace. Perfect opportunity for me to learn something not related to art. I casually introduced myself, trying to fit personality into my words. His introduction was far less enthusiastic. Him being uninterested made me thrive to try harder. I began to be myself and act as if I had known him for years, even though his name was brand new to me. It was then I had caught his interest and the conversations started flowing. By the end of that day I hadn't finished any of the work I was supposed to have, but I couldn't bring myself to care. I had just met such an alluring new person. Each day went on similarly but I had taught myself a good balance of work and talk. I couldn't get enough of this person I had just let into my life. Everything he said interested me and each word pulled me in. I'm positive everyone in the room knew of how funny I found him because of how often my laughter filled the room. It didn't take long for me to become very attached to him and each hysterical thing he said. After a couple weeks, the hour of class wasn't enough for us, and he made the decision to give me a call. I intrigued him as well. So our time spent talking didn't stop at the end of the school day but spilled over into our phone conversations. More time passed and it became a usual thing to talk with him often. I no longer needed to act as if I had known him for years. It was well over a month and a half into our relationship when comfort was starting to set in for me. Although, along with familiarity came a sense of question. I was beginning to very well open up to him but was not getting the same in return. I would tell him something of my past and he would make a joke of it; I would explain an opinion of mine and he would pretend to have the same. I had never laughed so much in such a short amount of days, but it was coming time to feel more then pretend hysteria. I wanted to be able to tell him personal things, but get something from him too. I began to realize I was digging deep into shallow waters. The amount of laughter in this relationship of mine was clouding my judgment of the person underneath the humor. I couldn't connect with him on anything more then simple things. I still wished to have him be apart of my life, to still enjoy his company, but I had no need to dig deeper. It was time for me find new waters to swim in. As I made the decision to move on from this relationship, I understood that sometimes laughter is not enough to sustain a connection. While I cherished the moments of joy and amusement, I knew that"
632	21511	8	3	One day on a stormy night, I had gone to the wood shed to get some wood. The wind was thrashing the trees, and all of the coyotes in the distance were barking to the moon. Taking one piece at a time, I tried to ensure that the pile would not fall on me. However, I lost my footing on a small log, hit my head, and ended up unconscious.  My brother found me and brought me into the shop to keep warm, accidentally locking us inside. With no way out until morning, we decided to pass the time by making up stories and telling jokes. Despite the unfortunate situation, we found joy in each other's company, sharing laughter and bonding over shared interests.  As the storm passed and morning approached, we continued to entertain ourselves with jokes and snacks, making the best of our situation. When our parents finally found us, we realized that the experience had brought us closer together. Despite our occasional fights, we knew that the laughter and memories we shared that night would always hold a special place in our hearts. It was a night of unexpected connection and joy in the midst of a storm.
633	21512	8	3	The fishing trip with my buddy turned out to be an amazing experience. Despite the initial challenges of being tired and cold, we managed to have a great time out on the water. With the guidance of my friend's dad, we caught plenty of fish and created lasting memories. As we headed back home, the conversation was filled with excitement about the day's adventure. Overall, it was a day well spent, filled with laughter, fishing, and good company.
634	21513	8	3	Laughter is indeed a powerful tool that can bring people together and make even the toughest of days a little brighter. Watching funny movies, like those featuring the comedic genius of a beloved actor, can create lasting memories and strengthen bonds with loved ones. These moments of shared laughter can shape our personalities, bring joy to our lives, and remind us of the importance of finding humor in even the most challenging situations. So, next time you're feeling down or overwhelmed, remember the healing power of laughter and the positive impact it can have on your well-being and relationships.
635	21514	8	3	"I think laughter should be a huge part of everyone's life. For example, laughter has brought my mother and me closer than ever before. One time, we were sitting in her camper after not seeing each other for a month, and we just let everything out, including lots of laughter. We were joking about fake teeth, and we laughed so hard that my mom even tinkled in her pants. We spent about an hour talking and laughing about fake teeth. I believe that laughter makes everyone feel better about themselves, including me. It's a great way to show that you know how to have fun and enjoy life. Laughing is essential in building friendships and relationships.   When I'm with all of my friends, we never stop laughing, and it always lifts my spirits. I remember a time when my family and I went to Disneyland when I was a little girl, and it was the best time of my life. There wasn't a moment when I wasn't laughing with them. I can't understand how someone could go through life without laughing or smiling when something funny happens.   My grandfather is also a source of laughter in our family. When he's in a good mood, he always finds a way to make everyone around him laugh. I recall a time when he saw a commercial with a plastic grandpa singing ""I'm not your daddy, I'm your grandpa"" repeatedly. Since then, he sings it around the house all the time, bringing smiles to our faces. In conclusion, laughing is truly the best way to feel better about anything. So, whenever you're feeling blue, just think of something that always makes you laugh and let that laughter brighten your day. Laughing is a gift that should be cherished and shared with others."
636	21515	8	3	"Well since you guys want to hear a funny story, I got a couple but I'm only going to tell you about one of them. This one starts in my birthday. I was living out in the countryside and it gets pretty hot in the summer. I lived there a couple summers so I know how hot it gets. This year I wanted to get a pool for the fun and to stay cool. But I didn't want a pool that just I could hang out in. I wanted to get a really nice pool for everyone. I already knew that those kinds cost a bunch of money but, I wanted to get a big pool that I could have all my friends come over, hang out, swim and play my favorite game marco polo.  I went to talk to my dad about my pool idea. He said that he would love to get a pool for the summer because he would come in and swim with me and hang out but, like I was saying pools are expensive and that's exactly what my dad said. I told him that I would pay for half of whatever it costed. My dad finally agreed with me so we went down to Walmart and looked at their pools. There were some cheap small ones and there were a lot of huge expensive ones but, I was looking for one right in the middle, not too small, and not too much money. I found one for eight hundred that was perfect for what I wanted. I went to ask my dad if I could get this one. He said that if I pay for four hundred of it like the original deal that I could get it. Like I told him that's what I said I was going to do and that's what I needed to do. We finally came to an agreement that we had to get the money first, so I went back to my house to make a plan to get four hundred dollars, my dad was doing the same, but he has a job so it's not that hard for him because he gets paid. It's a lot harder on me because I have no job.  I decided to fix my bike and go looking around for any jobs available. I went door to door to find people that needed any help around their house. I found a couple of people who needed some stuff done and they both agreed to pay me fifty bucks, so out of each, I could get a hundred right off the bat. I had to haul a bunch of old tree branches and garbage away. When I was done I put that money in my pool savings for later. I also went to this place called the local nursery and I was good friends with one of the kids that was related to them. I talked to him about him asking them if I could do any work for a little cash. They said that I could go to every tree and put a pink tag on him and they agreed to give me eighty-five bucks. I took their deal but, my bike can't go through the mud where the trees were planted. My friend said that I could borrow his little dirt bike and take it to put those tags on the trees. I borrowed it and got that eighty-five bucks. I gave my friend ten because he let me borrow his dirt bike. I'm almost halfway to my four hundred.  When I was thinking, I got so caught up in buying this pool that I forgot my birthday was coming up tomorrow. I told my dad that I wanted that pool for my birthday and he was like ""yeah I already knew that so I already bought it"". I was so happy that I got my pool. Now I have like two hundred bucks to spend and I didn't know what to buy. So I bought a bunch of food and stuff for the pool party. On my birthday, I invited a bunch of friends over to my house. We all got in the pool even the parents. We decided to play marco polo because I wanted to play. My friend's dad who is a huge dude was playing. I said marco and he lunged at me. I moved but he kept going, he went straight through my pool's wall and everyone fell out of the pool. I was laughing so hard but I was also upset because my pool was already broken. Luckily my friend's dad is rich, so he bought me another pool. He saw how crushed I was on my birthday and because he knew I wanted that pool. He also bought me a new bike and it was sick. During the summer, I had a blast in my pool and if I wasn't in my pool, I was on my new bike."

638	21517	8	3	My sister @PERSON3 and my niece @PERSON2 had just come down from @LOCATION2. It had been three years since I last saw them. When my brother @PERSON1, my sister @CAPS1, and I went over to my dad's for the weekend, we all decided to go camping by the beach. That morning, we all woke up early and packed everything in the car. My dad and brother did most of the work while us girls got ready. After everything was packed, we were off to @LOCATION1.  @LOCATION1 is a small town surrounded by mountains with only a few houses, a park, a river, and forests all around. My dad had built a small one-room cabin there a few summers back. It had a wood stove in one corner, bunk beds taking up most of the space, and a messy counter filled with food and supplies. On the ride over, we were all teasing each other, sharing funny stories, and trying to make each other laugh.  As we drove along the gravel road, my dad started making the car slide back and forth, scaring @CAPS1. While everyone else was laughing, @CAPS1 was screaming in fear. When we arrived, we decided to go to bed early to wake up and head to the beach the next day. @CAPS1 was the only one ready to sleep, while the rest of us wanted to have fun. We spent the night joking around, trying to make @CAPS1 mad, and laughing at the silly things we said.  Looking back, that night was filled with laughter and joy, even though some of the jokes may have seemed silly now. We made the most out of our time together and created lasting memories that we still laugh about to this day. It was a night of pure fun and happiness that we will always cherish.
639	21518	8	3	Laughter is almost always a good thing, mainly because when people laugh it means they're happy or something is funny. It can be very beneficial at times, for instance when someone is not feeling happy, people always try to make them laugh to make them feel better. When I am faced with someone I don't know, usually my first instinct is to try to make them laugh. Laughter has always been a source of enjoyment and it still is today. We have certain advantages now than we had one hundred years ago. For instance, now when we want to laugh, we need only to pick up a remote and turn on the TV, we can even choose what we want to laugh at and search for something to laugh at on the internet. Sometimes people go to comedy clubs to see stand-up comedians. Comedy and laughter go hand in hand, from the very first time someone laughed, comedy was born and will be around forever unless being happy becomes outlawed.   I remember that whenever my parents would have a new friend over, the only thing I would hear when they were at my house was the sound of both my parents and our new guest laughing. Soon, the new guest was over much more often. Laughing is also a very important part of any relationship because it makes the person who is making the other laugh more of a pleasure to be around, and thus makes them like them more. Have you ever noticed that men usually try to make women laugh in order to get that member of the opposite sex to like them? This, along with physical attraction, helps start the relationship.   I have heard that laughter can also be therapeutic. Sometimes I like to laugh when I'm not feeling so good, so it could possibly be therapeutic for me, which is why people have been going through therapy for many years. Sometimes people laugh even if the subject is not funny, they only do this because otherwise the situation would be somewhat awkward and one might feel out of place. Everyone has a different laugh; some are louder than others and some have a rhythm to them. No matter what your laugh is like, it can help you feel better and become closer to someone. Laughing is one of life's greatest pleasures, and we should all take a chance to just sit and laugh.
640	21519	8	3	"Library adventures continued to unfold as my best friend and I delved into our volunteer work. From encounters with the infamous ""Creepy Stalker Guy"" to failed attempts at being covert spies, laughter was a constant companion. The library, typically a quiet sanctuary, became a backdrop for our comedic escapades. Whether facing off against rude patrons or dodging awkward situations, we always found humor in the most unexpected places. Despite the challenges and mishaps, that summer remains a cherished memory of laughter and joy. The library was not just a place of books and silence; it was a stage for unforgettable moments and endless amusement."
641	21521	8	3	"""Coleslaw's get out of here before they wake up,"" Sarah said, standing up with her blanket wrapped around her. I did the same, brushing grass off my pillow. Disappointment was rushing over me; I actually wanted to see the meteor shower. ""You coming?"" I asked, looking at my old friend in a new light. ""No!"" Sarah said and gave me a look of pure anger. All of us were supposed to be in bed at ten, it was 1 am. It was week five at summer camp. We had made new friends and met new people. Sarah and I were volunteering to help disabled children, and Emma was there to socialize with the attractive guys working at the camp. As Sarah and I walked back to Emma's camper to return her sleeping bags, I couldn't help but feel mad. That was the third time Emma had been rude to me, and I didn't understand what her problem was. It could have been jealousy, as Emma didn't like Sarah. My mind was racing, and I knew it was going to be a long night. We reached Emma's trailer and opened the squeaky door. Emma was laying on the couch in her pajamas, her daughter, Lily, safely tucked away in bed. ""Hey girls!"" Emma exclaimed, ""Where's Emma?"" ""She's out on the field watching the shower with her real friends,"" I said, making air quotations with my fingers. Sarah rolled her eyes and re-gripped her pillow and blankets. ""Can we sleep in here tonight?"" Sarah asked. ""Sure!"" Emma said, ""Come in and lock the door behind you."" We walked in and locked the door. As we settled down on the beds, Emma made some chocolate milk. ""So, ladies!"" Emma started, handing us each a glass full of delicious milk, ""I want to know the good gossip! Why is everyone mad at Sarah?"" ""Sarah is mad at me because your daughter likes me more,"" I said, shrugging and taking a long sip of my drink. ""Is that all?"" Sarah said, ""The other part is a long story. So yesterday I was talking to her about Lily. You know cute counselor Lily?"" They nodded, ""I told her about a conversation Sarah and I had where I told a really stupid joke, and out of pity, Sarah laughed and said 'that's cool.' I was so excited, and Emma was laughing at me because I was jumping up and down."" ""That doesn't sound mean,"" Sarah stated. ""No!"" I continued, ""Emma then went on to tell me that Lily doesn't, and never will, like me. Emma said that Lily just thinks I'm stupid and feels sorry for me."" I was almost shouting, ""I mean out loud I agreed with her, but in my head, I was screaming furiously, Lily loves me! We are gonna get married someday!! I decoded her words with my heart!"" I slammed my palm against my chest and pretended to cry. Then I couldn't help but laugh. All three of us were laughing hysterically at my faked passion. ""Sarah should write skits for SNL!"" Emma said, gasping between fits of laughter. Suddenly Sarah stopped laughing and said, ""I really want some coleslaw! Random, right?"" ""I could go for some coleslaw right about now,"" Emma shrugged. ""I could go for some Lily-slaw right about now!"" I said, smiling. Instantly, new laughter erupted from everyone. I thought about how much humor this story would lose every time I retold it in the future. Somehow, I knew that I couldn't do it the justice it deserved. The laughter started to settle. We sipped our milk quietly, thinking. As we did, I looked out the window to see Emma walking our way from across the field. With a groan, I got up to unlock the door. ""Lock it!"" Emma said, ""and turn off the light. Anyone who hates my two-year-old daughter doesn't need to be here."" I flicked off the light and made my way back to the bed. Emma got to the door and tried the handle. When she found that it was locked, she softly knocked on the door. Then she waited. We buried our faces in pillows to muffle our uncontrollable laughter. Giving up, Emma walked away through the gravel. We all burst out laughing, unable to control ourselves. Looking at the clock, Emma gasped; it was 2 in the morning, and camp would be starting in four hours. It was time to get some sleep. Emma went back to her bed, while Sarah and I said our good-nights and rolled over. The trailer went quiet. Laying there, I thought about the happiness created by us. I knew that Emma would be fine. Maybe her being mad was worth what I learned. That night"
642	21522	8	3	It was the middle of summer and I was ten, bored and constantly sleeping. Even at ten I still played with toys, and that was the highlight of most days. All of my friends from fifth grade were on vacation surfing in Hawaii, or roasting marshmallows over the roaring fire with their families at camp, while I was stuck at home with nothing to do. That was about to be the most boring summer break anyone has ever had until one day in July. The day I met Alex was the day I gained my best friend. I met Alex because of my brother and his sister, they had crushes on each other and wanted to start dating. That was fine with our parents but, that also meant that her brother Alex, and I, would have to tag along also. I remember the first day being so uncomfortable and stiff. I could tell he didn't like me, he only chuckled when I would crack a joke here and there. As time went on though, I must have grown on him, because a few days later he was laughing at practically every joke I made. Those jokes had eventually led up to a friendship that would last a lifetime. Which really started when his birthday had come up in late August. He was having a small overnight birthday party which included me, his family, and his good friend Jake. Jake couldn't stay overnight, so it was just me and Alex. I didn't get much sleep at all that night, but that was fine with me because why I hadn't was a good enough reason not to. We spent half the night talking, and laughing, and really just getting to know each other better. Anyone with eyes could see that we were becoming close friends. Even after our siblings separated from each other we would still hang out as just us two. The real test of our friendship took place shortly after his birthday when Alex, and his family moved to California, where they were from. After they moved I still had contact with him and we talked to each other frequently. They had been gone for about a year when I got a call from Alex, telling me that they were going to move back. I had so many questions that needed to be answered, but he had a really bad connection and the call was dropped quickly after I heard him say that. With many things left unsaid my overall emotion was obviously happy, but also slightly confused. Was he really coming back? That was the question that kept me wondering. It was days after that I had gotten another call from him, and this time we actually had a chance to talk. It was true, he was coming back, but as it turns out not forever. Alex came back for about another solid two years, having fun and being the best of friends, but his parents already wanted to move back to California again. This time was different because he wasn't coming back. He was going to stay there, without a thought of going back. Alex had left my life as quickly as he entered. He's halfway across the country now, with new friends and a renewed life, probably laughing at a new friend's jokes.
643	21525	8	3	Laughter can be a good thing and sometimes it could be a sad thing. When my family and I went to @LOCATION3 for my two little brothers' appointment, we ended up having a great time during our mini-vacation. On our way to an island in @LOCATION1, my sister @PERSON1 entertained us by pretending to be on the Titanic, complete with a dress. Even though she is eighteen, we couldn't help but laugh at her antics.   During our stay at our uncle's house, we had a funny moment when my sister @PERSON1 fell while running away from their little dog. We couldn't help but chuckle at the situation. Additionally, when we visited a military base with our uncle and aunt, @PERSON1's fascination with the jets provided us with more laughs. It's moments like these that bring our family closer together and create lasting memories.  One particularly amusing incident occurred when @PERSON1 bought a questionable pin at a gift shop, which led to some lighthearted teasing from the rest of us. And during a meal at a taco joint, @PERSON1's declaration about two hot guys nearby resulted in a comical mishap that had us all laughing uncontrollably.  Despite some embarrassing moments, our family bond grew stronger, especially during our beach trip where we engaged in various activities and shared many laughs. Even a trip to @CAPS3 on ice with @CAPS4, sierra, aunt @PERSON4, and @PERSON1 provided us with unforgettable moments and laughter.  Through all the laughter and jokes, our family found a way to communicate and connect on a deeper level. These shared experiences will always be cherished, and I look forward to creating more joyful memories with my loved ones in the future. Laughter truly is the best medicine for a happy and united family.
644	21526	8	3	I have a friend named @PERSON1, and we have been friends since fifth grade. About two years ago, we were invited to her fifteenth birthday party at her dad's house in @LOCATION1. We were all excited to spend the day hanging out, swimming in the pool, watching movies, and playing board games. On the way to the house, a funny incident occurred when @PERSON2 struggled to unbuckle her seatbelt, causing a moment of laughter. Later, we decided to go to the pool to swim and tan, but we were greeted by scorching hot blacktop outside. @PERSON2's feet were burning, so she ran to the grass but slipped on the wet ground, adding to the comedic chaos. Despite the mishaps, we all made it to the pool and had a great time celebrating @PERSON1's birthday. It was a day filled with laughter, fun, and unforgettable memories with friends.
645	21529	8	3	The fishing trip to the deserts of eastern @ORGANIZATION1 was a memorable experience for my brother, our friend @PERSON1, and me. Despite the initial hiccup of arriving a day early and having to camp by the roadside in the chilly desert air, we made the most of our time there. Meeting and bonding with the laid-back college students from @ORGANIZATION1 around the campfire added to the fun and laughter of our trip. As we shared jokes and stories, the nights were filled with warmth and camaraderie. Looking back, @CAPS1 @DATE1 was a time of joy and adventure that brought us closer together as friends and family.
646	21530	8	3	"Laughter, one of the most joyous things there is to experience in this world. Everyone can relate to it and there's no one out there who would say that they don't enjoy laughing. It's human nature to want and to need to be connected to other people; we are social beings, and laughter is the best way to connect to other people. There is no negativity in laughing, unless that is if you are laughing at a rude comment, and in general, if people are laughing, they would say they're having a good time. People build relationships around experiences that they have with other people, for example dating. On a first date, it's to be expected, and an important factor, for the two people to be having fun and laughing. Other wise, when they separate from each other and are only left with their thoughts, their impression could make or break the relationship. That's why a first impression is so important. When the two people are reminiscing about the date that they just had, if they remember smiling and laughing, then they will most likely have a positive memory of their experience and want to hang out again. Think about any experience you have ever had with another person. If you remember the first time you met them, and how you felt afterward, the way you felt then, could tell you a lot about how the relationship went. Meeting new people, it's difficult, but you ask anyone about how to start a conversation with someone new, and they will usually tell you, ""make them laugh"". It's a universal term, anyone can do it. This past month, basketball season has started and I am playing on a whole different team then I did last year. Only half the girls on my team last year are still here, and I have had to make a connection with girls who are younger then me, and who I haven't yet gotten to know. I start to think about all the new girls, and who I have already made connections with and how I'm now good friends with most of them because of laughter. Everyday we get closer and closer because we find ways to laugh with each other out on the court. No matter how difficult the practice @MONTH1 get, you can never become to exhausted when someone is making you laugh. Laughter is needed in life to make it more livable. Think about it. If you could never laugh again, what would be fun about life? Image life if it were like detention all the time, never being able to just let loose, relax and have a good time. No one would want that. People would go insane, laughter calms people down and mellows them out. It helps create people's personalities and can affect others as well. Laughter is like a ripple in the water, it starts as just one single person, then expands out touching anyone near it. Laughing is contagious, like a @CAPS1 in mid @DATE1, and brings joy to you and the people you can touch. Laughter, it's the foundation of happiness."
647	21531	8	3	"@LOCATION3 has always been my place of choice to travel to whenever my parents question me of where I would like to go during the @DATE1. The rolling green hills, stunning sunsets, and thrilling thunderstorms are certainly a large part for my reason to go, but the idea of seeing my @CAPS7's side of the family again overpowers all of my other reasons. The core of my @LOCATION3 family has always been my @CAPS1 @CAPS2; with her friendly smile, caring personality, and a sharp sense of humor, she makes friends and acquaintances wherever she goes. Yet, due to the fact that we live hundreds of miles apart, I'm only able to see @CAPS1 @CAPS2 three times each year: my family drives up to her house twice every @DATE1, and she drives down to my grandparent's house for a few weeks in the @DATE2. I cherish every moment I spend with her, especially when she accidentally makes a fool of herself and causes hysterics.    A few summers ago, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, my @CAPS7, and I traveled up to @LOCATION2 to check out some of the town's antique and flower shops before dinner. We had spent a few hours driving around town, scoping out all of these shops to raid them of any gems that either @CAPS7 or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 must have for their already old-fashioned homes. I had lost interest after the first few hours; antique shopping was never a passion of mine, and I was ready to take the one hour trip back to @LOCATION1 to go swimming with my cousins.    Once @CAPS7 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had spent most of their money on a couple of ""treasures"" a few hours later, we were exhausted and prepared to head home when we happened upon a pizza shop down the main street. Our mouths watered at the thought of eating a slice, but rather than going inside to eat, we ordered a pizza to take home and bake instead. In her white @ORGANIZATION2 pick-up, my @CAPS1 pulled into the shop's parking lot, leaving @CAPS7 and I inside while she grabbed the pizza. Upon her return a few minutes later, the aroma of the pizza wafted through the cab, making our mouths water and our desire to get home to grow exponentially. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 placed the pizza in the back seat, grabbed her coffee, and revved up the engine. We were all lost in our own thoughts about sneaking a slice of pizza when suddenly the front tires of the pick up dipped down and thumped onto the road. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 nearly dropped her hot coffee all over her lap, while @CAPS7 panicked and grabbed the handle on the door in reflex. We were all flabbergasted, stunned as little kids trying to grasp that the @ORGANIZATION1 didn't exist. Moments after the initial panic, we realized that @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had accidentally driven over the curb. We burst into laughter while poor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had a red-rose face and an apologetic smile wider than the @ORGANIZATION3. She cautiously drove with the traffic, laughing hysterically with tears in her sea blue eyes along with @CAPS7 and I.    Our hysteria episode lasted for a few minutes, in which time @CAPS1 @CAPS2 had pulled into a vacant parking lot; none of us wanted another unplanned adventure on the road. I wiped the tears from my eyes, trying to stifle the laughter and recompose myself. @CAPS7 was still giggling and wiping the mascara off her face. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing the same, and then turned around to look at me. She locked her bright eyes with mine and smiled as sweetly as only she could, and we burst into more hysterics.    After @CAPS28 next small hysterical episode was over, we were finally able to pull back onto the street with the rest of civilization. As @CAPS1 @CAPS2 pulled out cautiously, I burst out, ""@CAPS27 not to run over anymore curbs!"" @CAPS28 drew up another round of laughter. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 has always been there for me, through the laughter and the tears. Because we are family, we have a natural bond between each other. Yet without laughter, @CAPS28 bond would not be nearly as close and glued together as it currently is. Hundreds of miles of farmland and open road separates us. The occasional phone calls and e-mails are all we have to communicate between each other. My @CAPS1 is the most caring, humorous"
648	21532	8	3	"""@CAPS1 days are diamonds and @CAPS1 days are stone,"" are the famous, melodic words of @LOCATION1. He was absolutely right and the day of @DATE1, was a very stony day. It began when I woke up late, having stayed up until eleven o'clock the night before in order to finish my homework. As I hurriedly pulled a sweater over my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, to school. Running under the dreary gray clouds, I suddenly remembered the geometry test that was scheduled for today. By my seventh period geometry class, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and my head was pounding. Of course, this had to be the day that @PERSON1 decided to cheat off my test. As his eyes swept over my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared pointedly at his own paper. I should have simply shifted in my seat so he could not see my test, but I wanted him to get the point. @PERSON2, however, seemed to think I was cheating off of @PERSON1. I took the reprimands silently and went to my locker. After collecting my belongings, I turned to go home. A loud ripping noise caught my attention and I realized, with a groan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker. Without acknowledging the stares of my peers, I turned and ran out into the pouring rain. Once I had reached my quiet road, I could not contain myself. With my face turned towards the stony sky, I shouted until I my throat felt like sandpaper. I had never had any sort of emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and alien to me. I hoped that no one would ever see me like that, as I had transformed into a stranger, hurt and lost. Following my explosion, I trudged slowly home and entered the house to find my @NUM1-year-old sister, @PERSON3, begging me for macaroni and cheese. I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove. Maybe it was cruel fate or possibly just stupidity, but either way I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled down the front of my body. Granted, it was not very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit down on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry. My sobs sounded like a frog croaking. I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand tapping my shoulder. ""@CAPS2?"" @PERSON3 asked tentavely. ""@CAPS3 did the dog say to the cat?"" I just stared at her with leaking eyes. ""@CAPS4 are a cat-astrophe,"" she answered herself. A small smile was set on her pink lips as she started giggling. Then I started giggling, too, which led to uncontrollable laughter. It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter felt like cold water running over the painful burns the day had forced upon me. There we sat, a giggling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, sitting on their kitchen floor on a very grey day. One little joke, with just one fit of laughter, had transformed my entirely stoney day into a perfect little diamond."
649	21533	8	3	My dad and I went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit. I was nervous in the beginning, of course, but quickly became comfortable behind the wheel. I drove all over town completing some errands we had to do along the way. Now it was time to go through the car wash, my first time in a car wash with me in control. I didn't think a car wash would be difficult to achieve after driving all around town, but I was wrong. After having a hard time pulling up to the right spot so the wash could start, I had to roll up all the windows and fold the side view mirrors. Before I could do all that, the wash had started! As a hurricane of soap swirled around the car, I rushed to fold the side view mirror and was successful. Unfortunately, due to my slow reaction times, I could not also roll up my driver window as the soap came back around and enveloped me in white foam. My dad and I were all wet, and the inside of the car got all cleaned even though that wasn't the plan at first. I finally rolled up my window, looked at my dad. He looked back at me not saying anything, the car was silent. After our minds finally developed what happened, we broke out in laughter. We had not stopped laughing through the whole car wash and after because of the rarity of that situation. All I could say after that was that people go their whole lives without having that type of car wash incident, so why did it have to happen to me!
650	21535	8	3	"You know when you're talking to a friend and they tell a hilarious story about that one time when they spilt soda all over the person next to them at the neighborhood barbecue, or they tripped in front of an entire classroom full of people on the first day of school? And then you think its so funny that you laugh so hard you cry? I remember days like those, you always tend to feel better when you laugh. When friends hang out laughter is usually involved. To be able to joke around with someone and be able to laugh you usually need to be comfortable to be able to find something funny. Laughter brings people together even on the worst days.  Everyone has those awkward times when you're talking to someone who you aren't having the best of relationship with but yet you have to make due and try to make it less awkward. There's also the random joke when someones upset to try to lighten the mood. When you get someone to laugh its so much less awkward because then you know they are in a somewhat of a good mood and its easier to talk with less tension. I've had plenty of days when I've gotten into a fight with a friend and I've had to talk to them for class or they insisted on talking. It's just like they just keep talking or just listening to you and you don't know what they are thinking or if they are judging you as you speak. But you know they aren't when you can get them to laugh because then they aren't really thinking badly of you. It also helps the tension. There's also the time when one of your friends is crying over something which makes you want to cheer them up or let them talk to you. Sure there's still tension cause of the fact that they are crying but joking about it or trying to get them to smile or laugh does help distract them and get them in a better mood. It's said that ""Laughter is the shortest distant between two people."" and I think that's true because when you joke with someone you learn more about them and they are more comfortable to open up with you. Also if you can have a good laugh with someone they are more likely to become a friend of yours since you know how to make them laugh and it's fun to talk to you. The more you and a friend can joke and laugh together the more close you usually tend to get with them cause you enjoy spending time with them and you're more comfortable with them and you know them better. And also when you can joke freely with someone you can usually also talk freely to them about anything and you know they'll be there for you when you need a good joke or someone to talk to. I know that I personally love to hear funny stories, I never really have many of my own that I remember. I love hearing jokes and laughing with my friends. It always brightens your day to have a good laugh with someone you know. But most people tend to giggle or smile when uncomfortable too. You know those times when someones having an awkward conversation with you and they ask a question you don't want to answer or don't know how to answer and all you cam do is giggle and smile when they look at you expecting to answer. Or when you have to talk to someone you don't know and you just laugh and keep messing up your sentences cause you don't want to mess up. I don't know if laughing when you're uncomfortable is just a way to make it less awkward or because you're too confused on what else to do. Sometimes when you get awkward and laugh it can make it even more awkward when they just find it weird and sometimes it helps when they then joke with you or just keep the conversation going and make it less awkward.  Even when you know someone you can still have those awkward conversations or those moments of laughing so hard you cry. It is also said that's ""Laughter is the greatest medicine."" I also agree with that because when you laugh you always tend to be in a greater mood and when you're in a better mood you tend to feel better in any way and you also tend to be more positive about things. Laughter brings people together in awkward, sad, good, or just normal conversations. The better you can relate to someone, the more you guys can joke together, the more comfortable you are with that person. Your day is always brightened when you share a good laugh with a friend, a classmate, a parent, anyone, even a stranger. It always helps lighten your mood even on the most stressful depressing days. Laughter truly is a powerful tool in forming and strengthening relationships, easing tensions, and brightening even the darkest days."
651	21536	8	3	Have you ever had a memorable time, where you laughed so hard with friends or family? Well I know I have had several of those times with my friends and family. I love those times that you laugh so hard your stomach starts aching really bad.  First, one of my most recent memorable laughing moments I spent with my mom that I don't see often. So this moment meant a lot to me as you can imagine. The last time she came to see my older brother and I we went bowling. She brought her friend down with her as well. My brother and I hadn't bowled in a very long time, but we knew we would still beat them. It turns out my mom beat me though. We had a lot of great laughs over that, actually I think that was the first time I wasn't a sore loser. Although, I'm still not sure how she beat me, she would through the ball down the lane sideways and some how it would go right down the middle. When you have moments like these, that you can look back on to help you through the hard times, it's really inspirational. All in all we had some really great laughs that day that were shared with my mom.  Another memorable laughing moment was spent with my dad and brother. Every once in awhile my dad, brother and I sit in our living room and talk about several different things, some good and some bad. They can be about my mom, school, our animals or all three of our compassion for sports. These talks always mean a lot to me because we never spend much time together. We don't get to spend much time together because my brother and me are always at school or in some kind of sport and my dad is always at work. These conversations have several effects on me sometimes they are sad and other times they make me feel better about things. There are so many laughable moments just in our living room. One thing we always like to laugh about is the way my dad always says album. For some reason he thinks he has to add another @CAPS1 in front of the @CAPS2 so it spells alblum. My brother and I enjoy making fun of him for that but we all have our moments we like to laugh at each other for. That was just one of the many things we love to laugh about.  Sometimes laughter is a very important part in someones life. For someone who is on the edge, or upset, just saying something little to make them smile or laugh makes all the difference in the world. Laughter is a great way to make people feel loved and excepted, also a great way to put people back on track when they're down. I know smiles and laughing makes me feel so much better inside. I hope you have had some great laughing moments spent with the people you love and care about.
652	21537	8	3	In the @DATE1 of @NUM1' I spent two weeks at my aunt's house. At the time my cousins were living with her. My cousins and I are very close so we liked to spend time together. On evening we decided to watch a movie. I remember it was called my bestfriend's girl. So we started to watch the movie and it was super funny, we laughed constantly through out it. My cousin named @PERSON1 has an awesome laugh, everytime he started to laugh I couldn't help but laugh too. We watched the movie and afterwards we went to go get some food. We were all in a very good mood, making jokes and doing crazy things to make each other laugh or be funny. My cousins would change their voices, making then higher or lower repeating lines from the movie or just making things up. That night we ate @ORGANIZATION1. When we got back to my aunt's house none of us were tired so we decided to watch a late night program called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was a program composed of a bunch of short cartoons. They were all very funny. We would make fun of them and laugh and mimic what the characters did.  We stopped watching it at about @NUM2 in the @TIME1, I was very tired but my cousins were not. For awhile we just sat on the couches and talked, continuing to make jokes and say stupid things that would make us laugh. About a hour later we all fell asleep and continued to watch movies and just hang out for the two weeks while I was staying there. It was probably the best time of that @DATE1. I was very happy and enjoyed my @DATE1 because of my two cousins and the time we spend together. I laughed so much that my stomach would hurt all the time, but I didn't care because I was happy. I still spend time with my cousins and laugh a lot. I believe that our time spent together and shared laughter has brought us closer and more involed in each others lives. A person who can laugh, knows how to have a good time, and is fun to be around. Our bond has only grown stronger over the years through our shared laughter and joyful moments.
653	21539	8	3	"@CAPS1 As long as you breathe, love as long as you live. @CAPS2 was impossible, there was absolutely no way @CAPS2 could be real. Breathing seemed virtually unachievable, as if I was choking on air. Everything around me blurred, spinning viciously as I clung to the fresh cut grass. Tears diluted the burn in my eyes, but not the sting in my nose, though neither caused my body to tremble as @CAPS2 did. Attempted screams came out as muffled moans. Alone @CAPS8 helpless, I could feel her staring at me, unsure of what to @CAPS7. My best friend stood @CAPS8 watched as I grew more violent, pounding the dew soaked lawn with my fists, whimpers transforming into shrieks. A door slammed behind me @CAPS8 I felt the arms of my father, trying to guide me towards the house. Once inside, my dad buried my face in his chest in more of an attempt to silence my obnoxious wailing rather than comfort me. He apologized repeatedly, I imagine he didn't know what else to @CAPS7. @CAPS2 was too early for the ""In a better place"" speech, but too late for everything to be okay. I continued to cry as stumbled up the stairs to my bedroom, @PERSON2 trailing close behind. Sitting on my bed @CAPS2 seemed like nothing was worse in the world. Suddenly, I was overwhelmed by the feeling I was missing something, like he was closer than I knew. I sat up to see his plastic sunglasses sat staring at me from my dresser. A black frame with neon blue sides. He @CAPS8 his ""stunna-shades"" danced through my head. Him standing out the car sunroof flexing shirtless, to propping himself up pretending to be awake in class. Seeing the glasses was like looking into his eyes. In my mind, his face held grief @CAPS8 frustration, he didn't want me crying. The few times tears fell down my face he'd say, ""Come on, suck @CAPS2 up @CAPS8 take @CAPS2 like a man!"" I knew in my heart he wanted me to be with the people he loved @CAPS8 he wanted us to be smiling. With the morning sun beating on my back, I pedaled my bike as fast as my legs would allow. Reaching her front porch, I realized immediately the time I was about to spend in that house, would be like none before. When I let myself in as I always did @CAPS6 peered around the corner, eyes swollen @CAPS8 discolored. I took four steps forward @CAPS8 met her with a tearful embrace, in which I apprehended @CAPS6 wished I was him. @CAPS6 loved him in a way I'd never fathomed, but the desperate longing to be held by a loved one, I knew all too well. We cried @CAPS8 held each other because there was nothing more we could @CAPS7. When there was a pause in the sobs @CAPS8 @PERSON3 actually looked at me for the first time, noticing I looked just as terrible as @CAPS6 did. I reached into my pocket @CAPS8 pulled out his sunglasses. @CAPS2 was hard not be selfish at a time where all I wanted was to be comforted, but I knew what I had to @CAPS7. Forcing a smile seemed infeasible, but I knew @CAPS2 was my next step. Her gaze drifted down to the palms of my hands. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5."" @CAPS6 started weeping once more, I held her @CAPS8 tried to be strong. More of my friends crept out of the kitchen, tear-stained @CAPS8 reddened as well. I smiled at them gently. They all took notice of the sunglasses in my hand, but didn't understand, they hadn't known him the way @CAPS6 @CAPS8 I did. We spent the day gathered around with a loss of words @CAPS8 hunger, our pizza sat untouched, the television on just to break the silence. No one said much, about anything. ""@CAPS7 you remember the time he hid our biology project in the freezer?"" I felt the question @CAPS3 up like vomit, too large to swallow. They just looked at me, not sure what to think. I feared I spoke too soon, I began to assume all of the melancholy @CAPS8 crying was supposed to continue uninterrupted for longer than @CAPS2 had. @PERSON3 smiled @CAPS8 nodded to my relief. ""@CAPS8 you got mad because he"
654	21540	8	3	Laughter has always been a crucial element in my life, serving as a powerful source of motivation and joy. Whether I find myself in embarrassing situations or facing moments of anger or sadness, a good laugh has the ability to lift my spirits and push me forward. When I decided to embark on a journey to improve my health and fitness by going to the gym, I initially struggled with staying motivated. However, the presence of my mother by my side during those early gym sessions kept me going. Her determination and support fueled my own efforts, and I found myself pushing harder with each passing day. Despite the challenges I faced in sticking to a regular gym routine, the laughter shared between my mother and I during our driving lessons in a church parking lot brought a sense of lightness and joy to the situation. As I mastered the art of driving a stick shift and gained the independence to drive myself to the gym, I found new reasons to stay committed to my fitness goals. The combination of physical exercise and moments of laughter, whether from watching a funny TV show during my workouts or simply singing along to music in the car, propelled me towards success. With each passing day, I felt stronger, more energized, and more motivated to continue on my path to better health. Laughter has truly been a saving grace for me, providing the necessary encouragement and positivity to keep me going. As I continue to shed pounds, increase my fitness levels, and embrace a healthier lifestyle, I am grateful for the power of laughter in transforming my mindset and driving me towards my goals.
655	21541	8	3	"Laughter is the key component in anything in life. It is able to turn any sad moment good and any great moment even greater. Here is an example in which laughter brought my boyfriend and I together. I had been crushing on the same guy, for two months. I was way too nervous to speak to him. One day my friends and I were walking down the hall where he happened to be. When i saw him I tried to turn around and walk the other way, but my friends pulled me back. They then told me they heard from a ""little bird"" he liked me too, so we continued to walk in his direction. We stopped walking right in front of him and my friends pushed me into him then ran off. I told him sorry as I turned bright red. My best friends had set me up. We stood there for five minutes in an awkward silence. All I did was stare into his beautiful blue eyes. All i could think about was how hot he looked in his black wrestling shirt and his faded blue jeans. He probably thought i was a freak. He had been leaning against the wall standing mostly on his right leg. Then when he went to switch to his left leg he let out the biggest fart i have ever heard. We started laughing. After we had settled down from laughing hysterically, we started talking. We ended up talking for two hours. A couple weeks had gone by and we had been talking more and more each day. Another week had flew by and we went to our first movie. I called our first date. That night he asked me to be his girlfriend. I of course said yes. Ever since the day he farted I have thanked for . I wouldn't have him as my boyfriend if weren't for him braking the ice with his embarrassing moment. Most of all I thank my friends for shoving me into him that day. There could not have been a better way to meet a guy. This is just one example of laughter and how much change or affect a situation. Laughter is the medicines of all medicines. is one of the most important tools a person have. Laughter brings people together and creates lasting bonds that can withstand the test of time. It is a powerful force that can turn any situation into a positive and memorable experience."
656	21542	8	3	Laughter is truly a universal language that has the power to bring people together and create a sense of joy and happiness. In my experience, laughter has played a crucial role in breaking the ice and lightening the mood during family gatherings, such as our annual event with cousins and close friends. Despite the initial awkwardness of sitting next to unfamiliar relatives, a well-timed joke from my cousin always manages to get everyone laughing and feeling more at ease. This laughter not only helps to dissipate any tension or discomfort but also fosters a sense of connection and camaraderie among family members. Ultimately, I believe that laughter is a key ingredient to creating lasting memories and building strong relationships with others. It truly is a powerful force that can transform any situation for the better and bring people closer together.
657	21544	8	3	I choose to have a positive outlook on life and I'm generally a happy person. Who wants to go through life mad all the time? Even at my lowest I know that I have a lot to be thankful for. Because of this, laughter is an everyday factor of my life. When I'm with friends and family I am always laughing. Laughter is my medicine and I wouldn't be the same girl without it. When I was in the fourth grade my family and I began going to a new church. I didn't know anyone there and I was really nervous about going to Sunday school. Mom walked me down the stairs to the classroom and the teacher introduced herself to me. Her name was Ms. Smith. She was pretty and very tall with a funny Australian accent. She was wearing alligator skin boots with black jeans and a pink top. Ms. Smith introduced me to the class stating my name and grade. After taking my seat, we recited Bible verses and read short clips of Bible stories. When Sunday school had ended, mom came downstairs to get me. Reluctant as I was to leave, I took hold of her hand, said bye to Ms. Smith, and went back upstairs without one word from any of the other kids. But on our way upstairs, a girl about my age, whom I recognized from the class, said goodbye to me. I returned her nice gesture with a smile and a wave. One week later, mom took me downstairs to church again. This time I was relentless and determined to make a new friend. I went and sat down next to the girl who said goodbye to me last week. I introduced myself to her and she told me her name was Sarah. We soon became very close. Every week I was so excited for Sunday school so I could spend time with Sarah. We became best friends! We played on the same soccer team together, and we pretty much lived at each other's houses. In fact, Sarah has her own toothbrush at my house, and I have one at her house as well. One time Sarah and I were in Sunday school, and now that we are older we go to the main service, we laughed so hard we almost peed our pants! Sarah and I have so many great memories together, and though we are getting older, the memories will last forever.
658	21545	8	3	Making jokes or just talking about funny stuff and laughing with people can make conversations comfortable and lets people see your true self. Laughing is essential in relationships as it helps to keep the fun alive and fosters a sense of closeness. Without laughter, relationships can become dull and unfulfilling. When meeting new people, laughter can break the ice and make conversations less awkward. It allows individuals to relax and show their sense of humor. Laughter can also help in times of sadness or stress, as it has the power to uplift one's mood and provide temporary relief from life's challenges. Overall, laughter is a powerful tool that can strengthen bonds, create lasting memories, and make life more enjoyable.
659	21546	8	3	When I was about thirteen, my older brother and I decided to spend the day fishing. We got ready in the morning, grabbed our gear, and headed to the creek behind the store in town. The day took a turn for the worse when we encountered a waterfall that almost capsized our boat. Despite losing most of our gear and having a scary experience, we pressed on, determined to make it back home. We faced more challenges, including navigating through dangerous rapids and almost drowning in a deep pool. It was a day of survival rather than leisure, but we managed to make it through, learning valuable lessons along the way. Looking back, we can now laugh about our misadventures, grateful to have come out of it safely.
660	21547	8	3	It is true that laughter is important in any relationship, friendship, and in life. Sometimes laughter gets you out of trouble, sometimes it gets you into trouble, but the more we laugh, the happier we are likely to be. One time that laughter came in handy was during my time in school. In the first grade, students were split into different groups - the popular girls, band nerds, hippies, and the jocks. Each group had their own distinct characteristics and behaviors, and they rarely interacted with each other.  I belonged to the group of hippies, known for wearing green every day and spreading peace and kindness. One day, we decided to sneak out of the lunchroom and enjoy our meals on the bright green lawn outside. Despite the risk of getting caught, we had a wonderful time laughing, talking, and playing on the playground. However, our fun was interrupted by a teacher who caught us breaking the rules.  As the teacher scolded us and warned of consequences, I couldn't help but burst into uncontrollable laughter. My laughter was infectious, and soon the teacher joined in, realizing that we were just kids having fun. In the end, she let us off with a warning, and we were able to continue enjoying our day without any serious repercussions.  This experience taught me the power of laughter in diffusing tense situations and bringing people together. Laughter has the ability to lighten the mood, ease tensions, and create unforgettable moments of joy. In the end, having laughter in our lives truly makes the world a better and brighter place.
661	21548	8	3	"Laughter, one of the wonderful things that we humans can enjoy. Laughter with friends, family, and with people we do not even know. We all can enjoy and share laughter, it is one of the amazing things that can bring us together no matter what ethnicity, age, gender, or disability. We all can enjoy it together, and no one can take it away from us. Laughter is simple, but yet complex in many ways. It is like falling into a pool of joy. Laughter, just the word ""laughter"" brings me joy! When our days go sour laughter is there to sweeten it up. Where would we be without the wonders of laughter? Laughter, it is like a tool. It is the thing that has helped me make new friends. Also, laughter has helped me get out of conflicts from both friends and enemies. It has also aided me into achieving the things I want. Laughter is my middle school years. My family and I moved a lot, and every time I moved I had to make new friends. It got very difficult for me to make new friends every time I transferred to a new school. After I have settled down and got used to the surroundings of the new school I then started to make friends. I noticed that laughter was a key element on making people like you, and then later consider you to be what is known as a friend. After I have made new friends, and became very comfortable with my school the time to move came again. It gets difficult to make new friends, but its even harder when you have to leave the new friends you just made behind. After moving so much I just got used to making new friends, and later on laughter slowly became more like a tool than something that I should enjoy. A tool for just making friends. After I got into high school I just stopped trying to make new friends, because I felt that I knew I was going to make new friends, and then transfer to another school, and then start all over and make new friends again. I gave up trying and decided to get more involved in school and achieve good grades. Later in the year I felt like a kid with no friends, because I stopped trying. I decided to go and make new friends, but somehow it became a lot harder to make friends in high school than middle school. I tried to be the funny guy like I was in middle school, but I just didn't have it in me anymore. Also, when people get older the type of humor people enjoy changes. As time went by I realized that you don't have to make everyone laugh, so they can be your friend. It was about getting to now the person, and to be able to relate and to be a there when they needed you the most. Making friends at a new school is not easy, but it also is not very hard. All you got to do is be open to people and let them know who you are. This is what I learned about making friends. You can't make everyone laugh, because everyone has a different taste in humor. Humor and laughter are different from each other. Everyone has a different taste in humor, but we can all come together and have a good laugh. Laughter is wonderful. It is what puts people in a good mood. We as people have our differences, but we can still all laugh together. It feels very good when you get a good laugh, but its even better when you know that the person who made you laugh did it so you can be happy. We should not take laughter for granted for it is something that puts a smile on our faces. Laughter is truly a universal language that connects us all, regardless of our differences. Let's cherish the joy it brings and continue to share laughter with one another, spreading happiness and building strong connections."
662	21549	8	3	In the story I am going to tell you, it involves one of my friends and myself. After school one day, my friend and I went to my house for the night. It was a lot of fun; we started off playing video games and laughed really hard when one of us would die in the game. Then, after a while, it was dinner time, and my mom told us to get off and come eat. It was really fun at dinner; we threw stuff at each other when my parents weren't looking. It was a blast, until dinner was over, and we didn't have anything to throw at each other anymore. But now it was time to start playing games again.  At this time, it was about ten o'clock, and we were getting really tired, so we put in the movie Step Brothers and watched it. It was the best time we had all day; we were laughing non-stop at everything that was said in the movie, and it was great. We both loved it and really wanted to watch it the next morning. But before we could, my friend's dad was there to pick him up, so that was the end of the best time with my friend and the funniest time ever too. It was great; we laughed non-stop the whole night. Now, that just shows that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. Laughter truly brings people closer together and creates unforgettable memories that last a lifetime.
663	21550	8	3	Have you ever had that one friend who was your best friend, that you could go to for anything, that you were so close to that you guys knew everything about each other, from the way your nose flared when you laughed to your deepest darkest secret? Well, my friend was that type of best friend to me. We became friends in first grade and from then on, we were inseparable. We were always laughing and playing, getting into mischief, and having a great time together. Laughter was a big part of our friendship because we could always make each other laugh no matter what. Our inside jokes and crazy adventures were what made our friendship so special. We had our favorite restaurant that we loved to go to, where we would talk about the funny times we had together and just enjoy each other's company. One day, we had a hilarious moment when we noticed that our friend's zipper was down while he was talking to a group of people. The whole situation was so funny that we couldn't stop laughing the entire ride home. It was moments like these that made our friendship so unique and special. We may have our differences, but our sense of humor is what brings us together and makes us the perfect best friends. Our bond is unbreakable, and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
664	21552	8	3	Laughter is the best medicine for a friend in pain. My friend @CAPS1 and I were best friends, he came to my house every weekend. So while I waited for him I decided to ride my bike. I rode around the block a couple of times, when I hit a curb and crashed. My handlebar hit me in the lower rib cage. My mom took me to the doctor's office to see if I broke a rib. The doctor said I had only bruised it. On the way home I was in so much pain, my mom made a stop for some ice cream, that didn't help. When we got home I just laid on the couch for a while. I heard knocking, it was @CAPS1. The first thing he did was ask what happened, I said I didn't want to talk about it right now. We ate dinner then played a game. Then we watched some movies eventually we both fell asleep. We woke to the smell of bacon. I was still a little asleep, by the time I realized that I had woke up @CAPS1 was downstairs. I was in so much pain I couldn't get up. So I just laid there for a short while. @CAPS1 came back up the stairs to see why I didn't get up. He saw me just laying there. We just started to laugh, I noticed that I felt a little better but I didn't think much of it. After we ate we turned on the @NUM1, my mom said for everyone to clean but @CAPS1 and I could play, cause I was hurt and @CAPS1 was a guest. We played Mortal Kombat @NUM2, @CAPS6 and @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 and @ORGANIZATION1. I won most of the time, till he started to cheat, but it was still pretty fun. When we were done we watched a funny movie, we laughed so much, that when it was over I almost forgot about my rib cage. We went to the park to shoot some hoops. As soon as he shot, it bounced off the rim and hit him in the face, I thought that was funny, he didn't seem to think so. When we got bored we headed down to the market to get a snack. While eating, I told him what happened with my bike, he asked if it made a visible mark, we looked and saw it looked just like a smiley face, it was funny but creepy. When we got home, he said that he wanted to ride bikes. At first I was a little scared, but nothing big. We rode around my yard for a while. His mom got there shortly after. Then I went inside and just sat there. My mom asked how I felt, but it didn't hurt anymore. I got better because laughter is the best medicine.
665	21553	8	3	One rainy day in a far away place, there was a soccer game that I was in. It was the last game of the season, making it especially important to me. As I prepared to head to the game, a big black rain cloud suddenly appeared in the sky, threatening to ruin the match. Despite the ominous weather, I was determined to give it my all on the field.  Once the game started, I found myself slipping and falling multiple times due to the wet and muddy conditions. My coach eventually decided to take me out of the game, and I watched from the sidelines as my team struggled to compete without me. In the end, we lost by two points, and I couldn't help but feel disappointed.  As I waited for my aunt to pick me up after the game, I realized she was running late. When she finally arrived, she was cold, wet, and clearly not in the best mood. Despite my muddy appearance, all she could say was to be careful not to get dirt on the seat.  We rushed to a party after the game, where I saw my teammates covered in mud just like me. Despite the rough day we had on the field, seeing everyone come together and enjoy the food and company lifted my spirits. It was a day full of ups and downs, but ultimately, it was a memorable experience that highlighted the importance of teamwork and perseverance in the face of adversity.

667	21555	8	3	The elements of laughter serve as a way to express emotions and create connections with others. Laughter is a common occurrence for me, especially when I am with my friends after school. Our bus rides home are filled with jokes and ridiculous stories that help us unwind and forget about the stresses of the day. The laughter shared with my friends brings me joy and leaves me with a smile on my face as we part ways at each stop. This tradition has been a highlight of my school days for the past three years, and I hope that our last ride together next year will be just as memorable.
668	21556	8	3	The new trimester had started and leadership was my second period. With no idea of what the responsibilities of a leadership student were, I was skeptical on taking the class. After days of taking the class, I began to enjoy it more and more. After a week or so, the teacher announced we would be on stage helping set up and organize the upcoming assembly. I had never done anything of the sort so I was somewhat excited. Days went by and the entire class practiced setting up the assembly, running to our places, moving props, and stacking chairs. The day of the assembly finally arrived, it was time for the show. The students poured into their seats as we scurried around behind the curtains. Everything was set up perfectly. The curtains rose and the assembly began. My peers and I stood behind the stage watching the assembly unfold. The school band preformed a long boring set of songs, the curtains fell and the entire leadership class ran out on stage, picked up and stacked the chairs that the band just used. After, we all ran to get the bleachers and dragged them out to the front of the stage. The choir was now going to preform, we then retreated back behind the curtains.  The choir sang their songs, and we watched, but as they proceeded to set up for their last song, students moved around leaving a large open spot in the top row. With the choirs last song, they preformed a simple swaying dance to go along with their song. My leadership class friends and I, noticed this large open spot in the choir and thought it would be hilarious if one of us went up there and pretended to sing and dance. However, none of us had enough courage to do it. The choir finished their song and dance, the first assembly was over. We then cleaned up and got ready for the second assembly. It was time for the second assembly and everything was going to be preformed again. The students came in, sat in their seats, the band played, we stacked chairs and moved bleachers. It was time for the choir to come out and sing once more. The thought of how funny it would be to go up on the bleachers and dance came upon us once again. Finally we convinced one of our classmates to do it. She ran to the choir room and put on a choir robe, put her hair in a funny bun fixed on her forehead, and stepped up onto the bleachers.  She took the open spot in the top row. The song began as well as the dance. She broke into random dancing, not in any way matching up with the other dancing choir members. It was obvious she did not belong up there. The crowd soon began to realize what was going on. Laughter broke out in the seats, but soon after laughter broke out behind the stage as well. I was laughing like I had never laughed before. It was painful, tears pouring down my face, I was gasping for air. Running out of breath and bracing myself for a deep inhale, when right at that moment the song had a dead silent pause. The auditorium went completely silent, I inhaled in, and as I took in that air, my body managed to let out an extremely loud embarrassing screeching noise. People behind the curtain stared at me, I knew that it was heard throughout the auditorium. Embarrassed I laughed even harder, causing more pain, tears, and lack of oxygen.  The song ended followed by the end of the laughter, then by the end of the assembly. The girl stepped down from the bleachers and we all scrambled out of the building, hiding the robe along the way. We laughed all the way to our next period, listening to the students in the hallway talking about it. Giggles filled the school for hours. Talk of who it was, what actually happened, and why it happened were on everyone's minds, except for ours. The second period leadership students knew exactly what had happened. We had the pleasure of telling everyone in school about the dirty little details. The following days however, the teachers also got word of it. Not thinking our actions all the way through, we would soon have to face the consequences. We were told it was irresponsible and child-like. We had a plethora of possible punishments, in school suspension, @DATE1 school, a referral, an apology to the choir class, and loss of the privilege of being in leadership. After the school board talked to our parents and gave the event serious consideration, we got out of it with having one day of @DATE1 school and apologizing to the entire choir class. The school board, realized it was just a joke, letting us off easier than it could have been. In my eyes the prank was well worth it. For weeks on end, every night I would go to bed laughing about that leadership assembly.
669	21557	8	3	"Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry? Your chest is bubbling with the laughter, and tears spilling out of your eyes; faces turn bright red and your body is practically having convulsions. This is not the forced kind of laughter, this is uncontrollable. This is pure joy. I laugh like this at least twice a day, tears and all. If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts, I swear I would have it. If I have a good laugh during the day, then I wont be so sad later to come. It has made me a much happier person. And it has even been able to bring me together with other people. There was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. This was a time in my life where I worried and would dwell on the past. I was a deep fourth grader. But my friends were much different. They did have their bad moods on occasion, and whenever we were feeling down we would sit on the swing set. Very creative, I know. This swing set was navy blue, and sat right at the corner of the playground right where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives. One day as we were dismissed to recess, four of my close friends and I went over to the swing set. We watched as the boys ran as fast as they could to the field to get their daily game of football started. Almost every guy in the school would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the school studs. And sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting there sulking on the swing set, a few boys walked up to us. ""Want to play some football with us? We could use more people!"" they said. We weren't in the mood for playing football, but with the persistent nagging, we had to give in. The square field was soggy from the recent rain, and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped. Us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team, and duck for cover when needed. The football lightened our moods, and was much better at making us happy then the swing set. So a new tradition was formed. Every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around. We dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball, and lunged to tag any person we could get to. The swing set was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun. But one day while we were playing it was extra muddy from a storm the night before. It was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field. People were slipping and falling constantly. And then something amazing happened, it started raining all over again. But nobody had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and kept going. The rain blinded us, and the slick ground was no help. So a collision was inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had been through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot of the end zone, and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance. When out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. But instead of swerving to miss hitting him, she slid. It was a priceless moment, almost taken from a cartoon. Her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt. Everyone on the field was already peeling over, clutching their stomachs from the laughter. But she continued to slide. The boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice she was headed in his direction. That is when she took him out too. But he was unfortunate enough to land on his face. His body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground. Even the two that fell couldn't help but laughing. The game was halted as we all shared this priceless moment. We were brought together by a simple game of football, and uncontrollable laughter."
670	21558	8	3	"Many believe that laughter is the key to the start of a great friendship. Laughter can mend the broken bridges between people and even make awesome relationships even better. Laughter can be such a powerful thing and most don't understand its power. I especially didn't know until two years ago when I met someone named @PERSON1. It only took the move of my former @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to understand laughter's full potential of the beginning of a great friendship. It all started a couple of weeks before school ended when the news was received.  At the time, I was part of a small @CAPS3 group in a small church in a small town. @CAPS3 @CAPS2, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3 were moving and would no longer be able to lead the @CAPS3 group. The entire church congregation was saddened by the sudden news, but none were as depressed as the @CAPS3 that they had touched in their many years in ministry. We had grown used to the couple. Many of the few that had been around the longest, including myself, had spent nights at their house, or in my case, babysat their young daughter. They were like family to all of us, and no one wanted to see them go. But sometimes I wonder if they hadn't, what would have happened.  Two short months later, word had gotten around that someone from @LOCATION1 was traveling to our small town in @LOCATION2 for an interview for the newly open position. All the teenagers were guarded the moment he walked through the door. His name was @PERSON1, only in his early twenties, but had quite a lot of experience in ministry. My first thought was that this must be some kind of joke! How could he lead a group of kids if he's only a kid himself!? I wasn't very keen on him. Neither was anybody else. But something was very different about him. He wasn't afraid to tell us about his life, and he seemed to be totally honest with everyone of our questions we asked. And that was when we knew as a @CAPS3 group that maybe he was the one.  Even though I knew @PERSON1 would be our new @CAPS3 @CAPS4, I still didn't want to accept it. I tried and tried to avoid him, although it always seemed we were having to deal with each other more than either of us wanted to. So finally, @PERSON1 decided it was time that the two of us needed to get to know each other. One day, my mom got a call from someone at the church, she wouldn't tell me who, but that I needed to go. So I did. And who was there? @PERSON1, in the sanctuary just the two of us and the associate @CAPS4, because it would be too inappropriate for us to be by ourselves.  ""Your mom didn't tell you why you're here, did she?"" I laughed, ""No, she didn't."" ""Do you feel we talk? Go hang out, wherever you want?"" ""Um... okay, how do you feel about going to @ORGANIZATION1?"" The question was puzzling to him, but it did to most, but he accepted the idea. ""So, are we going to @ORGANIZATION1?"" he said as he pulled into the parking lot. ""I don't know, it was just the first thing that popped into my head."" We both chuckled. I felt more at ease with him now and actually thought for the first time that maybe this would be a pretty fun trip.  As we walked through the building, it started to be quite boring. But the boredom faded away as we decided to pass through the toy aisle, and set off all of the toy alarms and sirens. Toy after toy started to go off as we went through the aisle, touching every toy that made some kind of absurd noise that would drive anyone up the wall, which many did. Finally, we walked around the store to other departments in the store and got to know each other a little better. It was weird that only a short time ago I didn't want anything to do with @PERSON1, and now I was walking around @ORGANIZATION1 laughing and just having a good time.  That was about three years ago. Shortly after, @PERSON1 had to leave. Many rumors were told, but because he didn't really tell anyone other than the fact that the council had asked him to leave. No matter the reason, I still am in touch with him and am glad that the day at @ORGANIZATION1 had happened. Laughter truly can bring people together in unexpected ways."
671	21559	8	3	"Though my sister and I have very different personalities, and much of the time do not find humor in the same things we have still shared some humorous moments. It's the times you decide to just go with the flow and enjoy someones company instead of letting it bug you. One sunny day in the park I had somehow convinced my sister to go rollerblading with me. My dad drove us to a park that had a huge pond in the middle of it. The pond was nice in the fact that there was a smooth side walk that circulated all the way around the pond for my sister and I to skate on. The pond was not so nice in the fact that it was very littered with ducks and geese and of course their droppings as well. We always thought of the pond's water as one of the most disgusting things on earth. We got our roller-blades on and carefully stood up. Our dad was going to take a nap in the car while we made our laps around the lake. As we skated we noticed a man and a woman sharing a date together in a very small boat. They were totally unaware that their boat was tipping strongly to one side. My sister and I thought it would be hilarious if all of a sudden the boat tipped over. We let that thought pass and continued on our route. On our next lap around we heard a woman yelling. we looked up and saw that it was the woman who had been in the boat. The woman was now standing on the shore yelling at the man to get all her belongings that had fallen out of the boat and were now floating in the gross pond water. The man was waiting in the water up to his chest collecting their items and trying to deal with his upside down boat. ""That date was definitely unsuccessful"", I thought. We could hardly contain ourselves from bursting out with laughter. We rollerbladed back to the car as fast as we could. My sister was in front of me and when she tried to stop she couldn't. She basically body slammed the car, fell back, and rolled right underneath it. My dad rapidly opened the door to find me crying with laughter. We pulled my sister out from under the car and drove home."
672	21560	8	3	"When I told my mom that I wanted to run from sunset to sunrise to raise money for a trip to Disneyland, she laughed. Her laugh was one of utter sarcasm, as if she was saying, ""Is this a joke?"". Yet, when the crazy idea of running for 12 hours straight was truly thought through, the laughter began to melt away. The idea made sense; I wanted to go to Disneyland with my school's band with a cost of roughly $1500. My family didn't have that money, and I certainly wasn't going to bribe my neighbors penny by penny to buy cheap cookie dough from a magazine. I needed to earn my money, in a way that not only was meaningful, but also efficient. What better way to do that then to do a long distance run; a skill that I not only loved, but was also good at? The plan started small; I would run from sunset to sunrise with some friends, wanting to raise about $500. After consulting my distance coach, I realized that running for 12 hours would entitle me to over 60 consecutive miles.  Running was one thing, but then there was the reason behind the running; raising money. A family friend, Sarah, who was both a runner and an organization whiz, helped me out. When I informed her that my goal was to raise $500, she looked at me and firmly said that I could do better. We started out with local businesses, asking for things ranging from bananas to an energy gel called ""GU"". Sarah taught me how to dress, talk, and present to each business, helping me create a flier to put up in coffee houses, and a way to organize the money I brought in. Next, came the friends. Surprisingly, I found that a lot of my friends not only wanted to donate, but also wanted to participate in the all-night run, and thus was created the running ""shifts"". Soon, I had about twenty people who were going to run with me, ten businesses who sponsoring me, and four ""drivers"" who drove cars with mattresses, food, and water in the back to support me and my ""crew"".  Before I knew it, my whole community was cheering me and that crazy, laughable idea on. The day of the ""Disneyland All-Nighter Run"" came before I knew it. The day before my stomach was twisted in knots, and it almost impossible to rest. Yet, as people arrived ready to run, drive, and cheer the whole event on, my fears began to subside. The weather was wonderful, with clear skies and decently warm temperatures for early December, and everybody who came were cheerful and encouraging.  As the sun set on that fateful day of December 1st, a group of roughly twenty teenagers all with a crazy goal and strong spirits, set off from my home in an awkward jog, knowing that they would return when the sun rose the next day having conquered something almost impossible. As we ran, headlamps were turned on, music was cranked up, quirky runner games played to pass the time, and silly songs were sung to keep our feet moving in the briskly cool night. The hardest part for me was returning to my home after 40 miles for a bathroom break around 1am and realizing that I still had seven hours left.  As the miles and minutes began to blend together in the seemingly endless night, it became hard for me to believe that the sun would ever rise again. We all wanted so badly just to stop, rest, and sleep. That night, with our feet pounding the cold pavement, we ran like shadows through the endless night, our eyes searching for the sunrise that would signify our time to stop.  The sunrise that rose the morning of December 2nd at 6am was the most welcoming sight I had ever seen. 70 miles behind me, and well over 30 for each person in my group, we were all exhausted and cold to the bone. Everyone who had been resting jumped out of the support cars and joined me for the last mile, every one of us watching with awe as light seeped into the darkness, stunning the quiet, frost-covered world on with warm light. The sun rose big and orange, and when my feet finally stopped, an exhausted yet exuberant shout left the throats of everyone. It was then, in that gorgeous sunrise, that me and mom hugged and laughed; a laugh that was not sarcastic, but spoke of how a girl who had done the impossible."
673	21561	8	3	"My best friend is probably my brother, @PERSON2. It was in the middle of @DATE1 and we were sitting outside on top of the wooden table in our mother's backyard. @PERSON2 started telling me how much he wanted to be done with high school and that he was, ""just done with all this."" I sat there listening attentively for maybe thirty minutes as @PERSON2 poured his heart out, and nearly broke mine with how distressed he was. @PERSON2's best friend, @PERSON1, had just told @PERSON2 that @CAPS1 he went out with the girl @PERSON2 liked, then their friendship was over. @PERSON2 was extremely hurt by this betrayal added on top of how he was afraid of getting kicked out of school because of his grades, and the amount of pressure coming from our parents at the time, was simply too much for seventeen year old @PERSON2 to handle. I talked to @PERSON2 for at least another half hour after that about what I thought he should do, at the end of our heart to heart talk I told @PERSON2 that, ""@CAPS1 you don't get it together and start geting good grades, their going to kick you out of school, @PERSON2. Honestly, @CAPS1 that happens I'm going to be really mad at you; becaus the only person @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are going to have to nag on is me."" We both laughed quietly for a minute, paused, and laughed until we cried.  I don't know to this day what was so funny, maybe how serious everything was when we were just kids or @CAPS1 it was simply a release of stress and anxiety for both of us. My tiny, little, lame joke that I dropped at the end of our talk just made it all seem okay, made us think about how young we are, how minor so many of these problems were in the grand scheme of life. That inital laughter made is possible for us to simply let go. After this happened @PERSON2 and I went on with our lives as @CAPS1 this had never happened, never speaking of it. Except that @PERSON2 never got a bad grade in the rest of his high school career, he chose his friend over a chance at the girl but found another girl who has @ORGANIZATION1's approval. Was it laughter that helped @PERSON2 get through this difficult time? I couldn't say, but what I do know is that there was laughter there and @PERSON2 did what he needed to do. Laughter truly has a way of lightening the heaviest of burdens and bringing us closer together in times of need."
674	21563	8	3	"The sound of laughter could be one that breaks all barriers. Just a single giggle or quiet chuckle can expand someone's world. Laughter is a sign. It's something that tells someone new ideas, desires, or dreams are going to be created. Once one laughs, he or she getting along with someone -- they're forming a relationship. The first time @PERSON1 and I laughed together, there was no doubt in my mind it was the start of something new. Once I heard his cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, I was set and ready to be swept off my feet.  I was privileged to hear that laugh for three days of my summer in the year @DATE2. It was a @DATE1, and for the past four days I was bounding and skipping throughout mountains and hills in the never ending desert of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That day, my cousin @CAPS1 and I were about to wander in to a familiar territory of ours: the mall. As a bonus, that cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle was bounding and skipping along with us. When @PERSON1 walked over to us in the food court, he definitely succeeded in playing it cool. You could tell he actually made time to comb his hair and decide what he was going to wear just to look as spiffy as he was. ""@CAPS2, hey guys!"" he called out smoothly. Our eyes met immediately, and already my cheeks hurt. The next few minutes that we spent together were crucial. I needed to make a good impression on this guy. We stood in the line of @ORGANIZATION1, where he would retrieve his usual order of two @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 without lettuce, a large order of fries, and a large @CAPS6. Pepper. As for me, all I wanted was a small vanilla ice cream cone. Glancing over at the other register, I saw @PERSON1 turn his head my way in the corner of my eye. ""@CAPS7, do you have @MONEY1?"" he hesitantly asked me. He fiddled with his pockets a little, while also brushing his luscious blond locks from his face. I chuckled silently to myself, and his reaction was one that is to this day one of my favorite things about him -- his smile. Still chuckling, I said ""@CAPS8,"" and carefully handed him the @MONEY1. To this day, @PERSON1 is my very best friend. Eventually, I did get back the @MONEY1 he owed me. Ever since that one moment when we were standing in the waiting line at @ORGANIZATION1, the next several hours were jam-packed with laughter. I don't really remember a single thing he said that didn't at the very least make me grin as hard as I could. Literally, with several leaps and flips, on that day I made a new friend. And even then, I was completely unaware of the amazing journey there was to come with this boy. It was all because of that very first natural instinct @PERSON1 and I both had towards each other; to laugh. If I had never laughed so hard my stomach was aching, or never laughed so hard tears were running down my cheeks, there is just no way we would have had the connection that we did. His unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle never gets old. Laughter is one of the main keys in our friendship. One of us has to let out a little cackle every once in a while. Also, @PERSON1 is still in @LOCATION2. I'm not. As badly as we both wish we could be, we're not in the same place. We need to be able to thrive and grow in separate places. So, with that, if someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" then they were absolutely correct. When @PERSON1 and I laugh together, it doesn't feel like we're fifteen hundred miles apart. So this laughter, this just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, is an element and part of my life that I am indescribably grateful for. This laughter formed one of the greatest relationships in my short fifteen years of life, and I sincerely hope it will form many more wonderful memories in the years to come."
675	21564	8	3	The surrounding area is dimly lit, accompanied by a fluorescent lamp shaded in the corner. Our blaring television screening an action packed, science fiction movie drowns out profane rap music escaping from my brothers headphones. Cuddled up on the couch my sister, @PERSON2, and I alternate braiding each others hair. Our small kittens @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON1 race to their food and water. As always @PERSON1 is superior and @ORGANIZATION2 scurries up the dining room chairs, defeated. Irritated @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sighs heavily with frustration once @ORGANIZATION2 trips his laptop charger and rips it out of the socket. Keys jingle, the door slams, speedy footsteps: @CAPS3's home!   By now it is @NUM1 o'clock and we have settled on the couch and everybody seat checks after snatching some food. The aroma of spicy @CAPS4 food steams the entire apartment as everybody feasts on chalupas and gulps down @ORGANIZATION1 from @LOCATION1. Napkins are distributed and the cats linger around our feet, waiting for their share. The last bite of my chalupa is portioned between the cats, which causes a bit of ruckus. @PERSON1 undertakes @ORGANIZATION2! The thief in @PERSON1's attitude begin to shine through as she robs @ORGANIZATION2's portion. This causes @ORGANIZATION2 to hiss at her, and proceed to hop onto the coffee table. On the way, she charges through the five drinks at the end of the table, managing to knock over two of them. Then the nacho cheese, being very unnoticeable, coats her striped gray paw leaving one-inch, yellow-orange circles to puzzle us. Minute but sharp white teeth are exposed and she devours the remains of @PERSON2's chalupa. Raining down the coffee table are trails of blue fizzy @ORGANIZATION1, and puddles gather at my feet the new suede couch. Smothered by booming laughter, @PERSON2 screams at @ORGANIZATION2 for stealing her chalupa. Following the escape of @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON1 trots innocently behind her. My sister is still steaming angrily so in attempt to calm her down, I take off my newly @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1-stained sock and catapult the mess toward her head. Instead of the sock slapping her in the face like I had hoped, it whistled past her ear and splashed in the fullness of my mothers stomach. Between the sock and the cats, the whole family is cracking up! @CAPS1 @CAPS2 reenacts the situation and his wild sound effects encourage our laughter even more. After a few minutes, the chuckles die down and we prepare ourselves for the next humorous incident.  I am freezing and muddy after a rainy softball practice, my siblings are just lounging around, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is frustrated from failure of employment, and @CAPS3 is weary and exhausted from a long day at work. We all look forward to what the night has in store for us: laying our busy brains on a fluffy pillow and allowing slumber to take over our life for the next @NUM1 hours. Looking past our sleepiness, we can still happily spend time with one another. Considering the fact that @PERSON1 is younger than @ORGANIZATION2, hilarious situations such as this, amuse my family daily. Surprisingly @ORGANIZATION2 wore the warrior suit this time which added a few extra minutes to the process of the hilarity. Not only that, by also the fact that it took a toll on everybody's dinner. My family is blessed with the knowledge of seeing light in odd situations. The main element in our memorable moments is laughter. Laughter is one of the few bonds our family will hold forever.
676	21566	8	3	Learning to laugh on a family vacation in a small town in the state of @LOCATION1, I came to understand the power of laughter in bringing people together and relieving stress. Despite my initial skepticism, I learned that laughter can have numerous benefits, including weight loss. However, my sister struggled to see the positive side of things, often blaming others for her problems. During our trip, her negative attitude became apparent, leaving me concerned for her well-being. As we reunited with our extended family, I hoped the joyful atmosphere would lift her spirits. Yet, as we visited familiar places and encountered old memories, I realized that past experiences had left a lasting impact on my sister's self-esteem. It dawned on me that I had played a part in her lack of confidence by not offering support when she needed it most. Reflecting on a past incident where I had laughed at her misfortune instead of comforting her, I understood the importance of being there for her. I approached her, apologized, and together, we worked on building her self-esteem through laughter. By learning to laugh at herself and embrace her mistakes, my sister found a newfound sense of confidence. Our trip, filled with moments of laughter and self-discovery, became a turning point for us both. The memories we created during that vacation will forever remind us of the power of laughter and the importance of supporting each other through life's challenges.
677	21567	8	3	Laughter is a universal language that brings people together in moments of joy and happiness. I have always been someone who laughs easily, finding humor in everyday situations. Recently, on a cold winter day, my boyfriend and I decided to warm up in his hot tub after playing in the snow. As we rushed to get dressed after our soak, I had a clumsy moment and ended up falling on my butt, much to the amusement of my boyfriend. Despite the embarrassment, I couldn't help but laugh at the situation. Little did I know, karma had a funny way of striking back, as my boyfriend ended up hitting his head on the same exercise machine I had fallen over. The sight of his red bump and his reaction was enough to set me off into another fit of laughter. Even as we sat in the pickup waiting, I couldn't stop giggling at the ridiculousness of it all. Laughter truly is a powerful tool that can bridge gaps between people of different backgrounds and cultures. It is a simple yet profound expression of joy that can brighten up even the coldest of days.
678	21568	8	3	"It all began one morning when I heard my hulking mass of an alarm-clock spouting off again. So I reached over and pushed the button to turn the exceedingly loud contraption off. When I noticed that I have woken up ten minutes late, and so I jumped out of the bed and sprinted to the shower. When I was finished, I got dressed in my @CAPS1-shirt and jeans, which is what I normally wear, then unplugged my cell phone from the charger and placed it in my pocket. Having dealt with the situation at hand, I went down the stairs and into the kitchen to prepare the modest meal of oatmeal. After I was finished eating, I packed up my books and walked back up the stairs to brush my teeth. After doing so, I swiped my coat and hat in one fell swoop. I secured them to my person, grabbed my back-pack , and walked out the door. I stood there on that cold and rainy morning, pondering what the day would hold for me. Suddenly , their was a great noise, I turned to face the approaching threat only to find that the bus had arrived. My mind quickly recovered from @CAPS2 slightly startled state and I stepped onto the bus. The bus ride was no different from the others, kids squawking about what happened at school yesterday, what they are doing @CAPS2 @DATE1, and other seemingly useless conversation. There I sat my eyes fixed gazing out the window of the bus, watching , studying , and mapping the present course of the massive vehicle. We stopped at one of the bus stops, and on the bus came my good friend @PERSON1. As usual she came and sat down next to me and we started talking about the usual cars, music, and the occasional jokes. As I started to develop a creative and captivating joke, she just belted one out right off the top of her head. We both just started busting up laughing, I even felt a tear form in the pit of my eye. We didn'@CAPS1 stop laughing until we got to the school,and my joke was successfully forgotten. The joke lingered in my head all day long, to @CAPS2 day I still think it is one of the best I've ever heard. Through all of the countless jokes, underhanded comments, and puns I've heard, that one brought about the most laughter of all. But then @PERSON1 moved away to another city, @CAPS2 was a sad day. The very next day I heard the age old saying, ""@CAPS2 one time at band camp....."", story and laughter was restored to my life. I learned something that day that friends my move away but the jokes that were said will still remain."
679	21569	8	3	It all started when my eighth grade class had a plan to go see a movie together. I had the idea to see a movie, so i picked a few movies that were in theaters. The choices were between, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2,' @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4,' and another movie that i cant remember. We, as a group, decided to go to @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4. The movie stars @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 from @CAPS8 @CAPS9. I thought that the movie was really good but there was one part in the movie that made me laugh so so hard. The scene starts out with @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 wandering around trying to find a place to stay for the night; and they seemed to have @CAPS4 @LOCATION1; @LOCATION1 plays an important part in the movie. After a long day full of scary situations, they find a good size cave that they decide is a good spot to stay for the night.  Back tracking a little bit, earlier that day, and in the movie, @PERSON1 came across a native fellow named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is a man-like creature that walked like a monkey but has the face of a human but has an all-around hairy body. They came across him while traveling through the desert and saved him from execution; for that, @LOCATION1 is very grateful and is @CAPS11 guide around the mysterious @CAPS3 that is foreign to man and that has never been seen by man.  Back to what I was talking about earlier, when @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 end up in the cave they see two full-body skeletons sitting at a table that has an old record player on it, but the record is playing and making music. Just a second later @LOCATION1 comes in the frame of the scene and does a little dance that puts him close to, but in front of the table. Then @LOCATION1 does multiple pelvis thrusts to different directions, basically humping the air. Watching that scene made me laugh the hardest that I have ever laughed in my life. To this day I look back at it and laugh just as hard as I did the first time I saw the movie.  About a month later, I went over to one of my good friend's houses and we watched the movie again. When we got to the scene of @CAPS13 jig, we both fell down, off of the couch laughing. We replayed that scene about ten more times and ended up crying because we were laughing so hard. Laughter is good for the soul and morale, and for friendship building. Thank the @CAPS14 that he made us laugh!
680	21570	8	3	Laughter A true story that involves @CAPS4 and laughter was when i was hanging out with my @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON1, and her fiance @PERSON4 (who is a profesional quad racer) at a @ORGANIZATION1 concert in @LOCATION2. The concert was the best concert i have ever been to and probably the best one i will ever go to because @ORGANIZATION1 is my favorite band. They even played the song that made them, its called @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When we were there the music was really loud and a bunch of people were drinking and getting drunk and doing stupid stuff. Like this one guy who was standing behind his girlfriend who was sitting down in the grass, this guy had a few too many to drink. He was standing behind his girlfriend laughing at a joke that oneof his drunk buddies told him and then he leans on his girlfriend but just falls on her and folds her right in half like a lawn chair. My @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 started laughing, it was pretty funny. But then the guys girlfriend got up and walked out of the stadium so he got pretty sad. The rest of the concert was pretty funny. The front rows seats were only for people over @NUM1 because during the concert the band would bring out some beer guns and shower the front rows with beer. The front rows were the craziest rows. The back rows were pretty crazy too, people were smoking marijuiana in the back rows, but we werent. When we left we all smelled like weed and didnt want to get pulled over for any reason and have the cop think that we were drugies. It was a long ride home, we live in @LOCATION3, @ORGANIZATION2 and we drove to @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2 and back in one day. I was so tired, we didnt even take any chairs to the concert so we had to stand up in the same spot for about @NUM2 hours. But it was all worth it to see my favorite band in concert. They had a few other bands before them that were also great. Bands like; @PERSON2, @CAPS5/@CAPS6, and @CAPS7. So it was deffinetly the best concert I have ever been to. The second best concert ive ever been to was a @CAPS8 concert in @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS9 @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 @PERSON1 during the @CAPS10 @CAPS11. There were a lot of things we did before the concert like; look at animals, eat, go on rides, buy things, eat more, get drinks, and walk around the @CAPS11. A lot of things made @CAPS4 laughlike when my @PERSON1 stepped in horse and goat poop and when my mom dropped her food on her lap. The concert was really cool, they played some songs to there new album @CAPS12 and @CAPS13. It wasnt as long as the drive to the @ORGANIZATION1 concert and it wasnt as good. But it was still awesome.  After the concert, we drove back home, sharing stories and memories of the amazing experiences we had just encountered. Despite the exhaustion from the long day, the laughter and joy we shared during the concerts made it all worthwhile. The bonds we formed and the moments of pure happiness will forever be cherished, making these concerts unforgettable in our hearts.

It is a story about me @CAPS11 my friends @CAPS11 a little adventure we had @DATE1, a day we would never forget. It starts off on one of the nicest days i had ever seen, i mean amazing, blue sky's, warm @DATE1 air, @CAPS11 the sound of the laughter coming from the children playing in the street. Me @CAPS11 my three friends @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @CAPS11 @CAPS2 were sitting on my back porch in a circle playing our guitars, as usual @CAPS11 we decided that we needed to go do something, something new. As we sat @CAPS11 thought about what we could do nothing came to mind. Until @PERSON1 suggested that we go to the beach @CAPS11 meet up with his cousin ""@CAPS3 has a nice house right on the beach @CAPS11 probably wouldn't care if we stopped by."" @CAPS3 said. The three of us looked at each other @CAPS11 looked an @PERSON1 @CAPS11 said ""lets go!"" We packed our boards, guitars, @CAPS11 food @CAPS11 we headed out. On the way we decided to go to the @CAPS4 city skate park, none of us had ever been @CAPS5. We drove around for at least an hour looking for it. Aggravated @CAPS11 about to give up on finding the park we decided to take one @DATE1 loop @CAPS11 @CAPS10 what happened. ""@CAPS5 it is"" yelled @CAPS2 ""@CAPS5's the park i found it."" We looked off in the distance @CAPS11 @CAPS5 it was. The cradle, the snake run, everything. we pulled in @CAPS11 parked. We got out of the car ready to skate, but then out of nowhere it started pouring @CAPS11 the park was soaked. we headed back to the car seeking shelter only to find that @PERSON3 had locked his keys in the car. Luckily @CAPS3 had @CAPS7 so @CAPS3 called them @CAPS11 had them come @CAPS11 unlock the car. it took them an hour @CAPS11 a half to find us @CAPS11 unlock the car. Now we were all mad @CAPS11 wondering if it was a good choice to go on this trip. @CAPS8 leaving the park we decided it would just be best if we went to @PERSON1's cousins house @CAPS11 stayed @CAPS5 for the @TIME1. When we got @CAPS5 we were greeted with open arms @CAPS11 warm clothes, ""looks like you guys have had a rough one"" @CAPS3 said, ""I'm @PERSON2, I'm sure @PERSON1 has told you all about me by now."" @CAPS8 we changed in to the clothes @PERSON2 had given us we went @CAPS11 sat by his fireplace to warm up. The five of us sat @CAPS5 @CAPS11 talk for what felt like forever. Then I said ""i wish we could have a big fire on the beach."" ""we can"" @PERSON2 said, ""i know the perfect place."" @CAPS3 took us to a small bay on the beach about @NUM1 yards away from his house, @CAPS3 called it driftwood bay. ""@CAPS10, told you i had the perfect spot."" @CAPS11 it was perfect, secluded, sandy, @CAPS11 all the firewood you could ever need. We built a fire @CAPS11 kept throwing wood on it until it was over @NUM2 feet tall. For the rest of the day @CAPS11 on through the @TIME1 we sat around the fire, playing our guitars in a circle, @CAPS11 telling the story of our day. Laughing @CAPS11 noticing that even tho the beginning of our day wasn't very fun we closed it the only way we could have wanted, sitting around a fire, music playing in the @TIME1, @CAPS11 sharing a good laugh with your friends. As the night came to an end, we knew that this day would be one we would always remember with a smile on our faces."

684	21575	8	3	To me, laughter is someone showing joy and excitement to the others around them. Laughter can sometimes be used in the wrong kind of way, such as when someone gets hurt and others laugh at them. When I can make someone else laugh or giggle, it not only makes me feel good but also the other person I was talking to. It shows both of us that we can be happy and that there is joy between us.   I have a friend at school who always looks grumpy and upset. When someone asks him what is wrong or if he is okay, he seems to get even angrier. As one of his closer friends, I try to help him by making him laugh and smile. Every time I see him in the hallway or even outside of school, I say something to him to get him to smile and laugh. By showing him that I care and that I don't want him to be grumpy to others, we have grown closer and spend more time together.   Being in a better mood makes his whole day at school a lot more fun and enjoyable for him and for those around him. If I were to describe myself, I would say that I am a very happy person with respect for others, and I express that through bringing joy and laughter to those around me. Laughter is an important part of daily life and it brings people closer together, so don't be afraid to use it.
685	21577	8	3	Laughter is crucial in any relationship as it strengthens the bond between individuals, especially during challenging situations. In @ORGANIZATION1, where students are dissecting cats, humor plays a vital role in alleviating the stress and discomfort associated with the task. Working with partners, the task of skinning the cat, identifying muscles, bones, and organs, and examining them closely can be overwhelming. However, with the support of friends and the shared laughter, the experience becomes more bearable. Despite the gross and fascinating nature of the dissection process, the presence of laughter helps to maintain a sense of sanity and camaraderie among the students. In essence, laughter not only brings joy and light-heartedness but also serves as a coping mechanism during challenging and demanding situations, like the cat dissections in @ORGANIZATION1.
686	21578	8	3	A couple years ago when I was in middle school, I met one of my best friends with whom I have shared great times. Our friendship started in math class, where she had an assigned seat next to mine. Despite not knowing each other very well at first, laughter became the bridge that brought us closer. We would laugh at random things, even if we didn't fully understand each other's jokes. It was laughter that initially kept us connected as we navigated through our early days of friendship.  As time passed, we grew closer and discovered more about each other beyond just laughter. We found common interests and were able to have meaningful conversations. While laughter still played a role in our friendship, it was no longer the only thing holding us together. We learned to bond over shared experiences, interests, and values.  Reflecting on my friendships, I realized that laughter may indeed be a short distance between two people, but there are other factors that contribute to a strong bond. Each friendship is unique, shaped by how individuals connect, communicate, and support each other. While laughter can create moments of joy and connection, it is the deeper understanding and shared experiences that truly strengthen a friendship.  In conclusion, laughter is a valuable aspect of friendship, but it is not the sole foundation. True closeness is built on mutual respect, trust, and shared values. Each friendship is a unique blend of laughter, understanding, and support, making it a special and cherished connection in our lives.
687	21579	8	3	One day when I was going to school with my friends, I stepped in dog poo, and all of my friends laughed at me. It was so embarrassing, and I was mad that my shoes were dirty. I had to go back home to clean my shoes that I had just received for my birthday. I dreaded telling my mom about the incident, thinking she would be upset since she worked hard to buy me those shoes.  The following day at school, my friends continued to tease me about the dog poo incident. I tried to focus on my math work, but the jokes made me upset. My best friend approached me and showed me a drawing of a dog pooping on a girl, which angered me even more. When I returned home, I didn't want to tell my mom about the rough day I had, but she reminded me that not everyone is kind.  In conclusion, the experience taught me that not everyone will treat me well, but it is essential to stay resilient in the face of challenges.
688	21581	8	3	Laughter is indeed the cornerstone of any relationship, whether it be with family, friends, or a romantic partner. It has the power to break down barriers, create bonds, and bring people closer together. I have witnessed how a simple laugh can pave the way for deeper connections and meaningful moments. My best friend, with whom I have shared countless adventures and memories, has shown me the true value of being myself and embracing laughter in our relationship. Our recent snowboarding trip was a perfect example of how laughter can strengthen our bond and create lasting memories. As we navigated the slopes together, teaching and supporting each other, the sound of our laughter filled the air and brought warmth to our hearts. It was during this trip that my best friend expressed her love and appreciation for our friendship, a moment that will forever hold a special place in my heart. Laughing together has not only brought us joy and happiness but has also deepened our connection and made our friendship stronger. Looking ahead, I know that laughter will continue to be a vital part of our relationship, bringing us closer together and creating unforgettable moments.
689	21582	8	3	I am so good at making people laugh, it's just one of my very awesome qualities. One time, on the way to camp with my friends, I spotted a funny sign that made everyone in the car burst into laughter. Later, during a stop at a store, we had a hilarious adventure racing down the aisles in shopping baskets. The doughnuts we bought turned out to be a disappointment, but the experience of throwing them out the window was a memorable moment of laughter. On the drive back, I played pranks on my friend, causing a series of comical reactions. Despite a run-in with the law for speeding, even the encounter with the clueless cop became a source of amusement for us. My ability to bring joy and laughter to those around me is truly a special gift that I cherish.
690	21584	8	3	Laughter is a complex and indescribable phenomenon that brings joy and positivity to our lives. For some, laughter is a daily occurrence, a natural response to humor, memories, or even exhaustion. The contagious nature of laughter can brighten someone's day and create a sense of connection and happiness. However, there are times when laughter is absent, when someone has lost the ability to truly experience joy and happiness. This was the case for a dear friend who had endured immense hardships, including abuse and the loss of a beloved childhood friend. Despite his struggles, he maintained a facade of laughter, a hollow, emotionless sound that masked his inner pain. As a caring friend, the narrator is determined to help him find genuine laughter and experience true joy once again. Laughter is a powerful force that has the ability to heal, uplift, and bring light to even the darkest of times. The narrator's commitment to bringing laughter back into their friend's life is a testament to the importance of joy and connection in overcoming adversity. Through the support and love of those around him, the friend will hopefully find his way back to the sound of genuine, heartfelt laughter.
691	21586	8	3	When I think of laughter, memories of my time at my cousin's ranch in @ORGANIZATION1 come to mind. One particular memory stands out from when I was about six years old. It was a visit filled with joy and laughter, especially with my best friend @PERSON1 by my side. We spent hours playing games, exploring the farm, and sharing moments of pure happiness. The sound of our laughter echoed through the house and the fields, creating a bond that would last a lifetime.  Despite the passing of time, the memory of that visit remains vivid in my mind. The tragic news of @PERSON1's untimely passing shook me to the core, but it also reinforced the importance of cherishing every moment of laughter and joy. @PERSON1 taught me valuable lessons in friendship, love, and living life to the fullest. Whenever I need a pick-me-up, I think back to the last time I saw him, and I am reminded to embrace laughter and create lasting memories with the ones I hold dear. Though he may no longer be physically present, his spirit lives on in the laughter and joy that he brought into my life.
692	21587	8	3	I believe that laughter is essential in life as it can make difficult situations easier to handle. When we laugh, we feel happier and more optimistic about the future. Personally, my family and friends play a significant role in making me laugh and lift my spirits. Their simple jokes and silly antics never fail to bring a smile to my face, even on my worst days. However, I draw the line at finding humor in someone else's physical pain or misfortune. It's important to be mindful of others' feelings and show empathy in such situations. Additionally, I find it unappealing when people boast about reckless behavior like excessive drinking or drug use. Such behavior only serves to harm oneself and is not something to be proud of. In conclusion, laughter is a powerful tool that can bring joy and light-heartedness to our lives, but it should always be used responsibly and with consideration for others.
693	21589	8	3	"They say laughter is the best medicine. I personally think that's true. Jokes can be a great source of laughter, although some jokes are funnier than others. Laughter automatically puts you in a good mood, which is something I always strive for. I love those moments when I'm laughing so hard that I can't even breathe. One of my favorite laughter-filled memories is from a birthday party at my grandma's house. We were playing a game called ""@CAPS4,"" where players try to avoid being tagged by a designated person. The game led to hilarious moments, like when my cousin went flying backward after being startled. The sight of him on the ground, coupled with the popping balloons, had everyone in stitches. It was a moment of pure joy and laughter that I will always cherish. Laughter has always been a constant in my life, and I believe that any time is a good time for laughter."
694	21592	8	3	We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter is definitely the most important part of my best friends and I relationship. Without laughter, we couldn't possibly have as much fun together as we do. If I am having a bad day, I can always count on my best friend to make me crack up, and forget about the day I have had. If we are out and about, or just relaxing at home, my best friend and I are always laughing. The end result is usually us both with tear streaked faces from laughing so hard. There are actually quite a few different instances in which I remember laughing particularity hard. This last @CAPS1 @CAPS2's eve for example, it started snowing at around three a.m, so my best friend and I ran outside screaming at the top of our lungs. Snowballs started coming from every direction. During a game of hide and go seek, we decided to bury ourselves in a snow covered leaf pile. Within ten minutes, our legs were freezing. So what did we do? We put on our swim suits and jumped into the bath tub together. Having her there to laugh with me, made the situation a lot better. Another situation in which I remember being particularly funny, was the entire third trimester of freshman @CAPS2. I needed a first period class and the only thing open was intro to manufacturing. I definitely was not looking forward to it, until I found out that my best friend had it with me. We made a bad situation a lot better by laughing at every single stupid mistake we made. Since we are not exactly experienced in the field of metal, there were quite a few mistakes. With out my best friend there to laugh with me, I have no idea what I would have done. I believe that whenever I am in a bad situation, laughter will always help me. One last situation in which laughter helped a lot, is when I used it to cheer up my best friend. A couple of days ago, my friend had, had a really bad day. Things just weren't going her way. After school I could tell something was wrong. I tried talking to her about it, but that wasn't really helping. So, I brought up some of our past experiences together. Within a few minutes she was laughing and I could tell she felt a lot better. Laughter really does help us out of some tough situations. Laughter is by far the most important factor in my best friends and I relationship. Our relationship is mainly based on laughter. Without it, we just wouldn't be as close as we are today. If we need it to cheer each other up, or cure boredom, I know that laughter will always be on our side.
695	21594	8	3	"It was midsummer, and i could feel the cool ocean breeze washing over my skin. You would think everything would be calm, but it was the exact oppasite.I wouldnt talk to him or even look at him. He was trying so hard to get me to laugh but i just couldnt. I was so furious with him that i thought nothing between us would ever bee the same again. I thought that our three months together was up, and it scared me so much. He left for his trip the next day, and he left without saying a word.       I cried myself to sleep for a week. I knew he was back in town already, but he hadent called or said anything to me. After weeks of wondering and waiting, i could feel th at it was over. I talked to my sister and she told me that he would come around again and i had to be patient. I tried to take her words in my heart and i wanted to believe that it was true. I called his house everynight, but everynight i got the same answer, ""he's not home, but i'll let him know you called"". i wanted to believe that i would hear from him, so to pass the time i kept my self busy with cleaning and going out with my family. A couple of day's of not thinking and worrying about him did me good. I was smiling and laughing again. I felt like i could begin to breath a little and have fun. My sister's advice ended up working cos a week later he called me and told me that he wanted to see me. I told him he could come by @DATE1 and that i was very excited to see him again. The call ended and i was smiling from ear to ear.            The next couple of day's i was in a complete fenzy, getting everything clean, figuring out what i was going to wear. Everyone thought i was going crazy, but the truth is that i was scared. Scared of what he will say to me, and were we would go from here. Th days seemed to fly by and the next thing i knew, he was knocking on my door. I let him in and he took my by surprise with a big hug. We sepnt hours jsut talking and listening to music. It was as if nothing had ever changed. Before we knew it it was dark out and he was leaving. I walked him to the front of my trailer park, and he sat me down on the side walk and took my hand's. I was shocked and didnt know what to do but listen. He told me that he was sorry for the way he acted and that tonight he realized how much he wanted to be with me, and that he was completely in love with me. I couldnt do anything except cry and laugh at the same time, and soon enough he was laughing with me. I couldnt have asked for a more perfect moment.      It's been six months since @TIME1. We are better than ever becuase we have the laughter. It's what help's keep our relationship solid, and it keep's us close. Everyone need's a little laughter in there life. Im glad that i found someone special enough to always keep me laughing. It's like we never stopped. If you ever feel hopeless and like there's nothing for you. Remember to laugh, it's what makes the world go round. Laughter truly is the best medicine for any relationship, bringing joy, closeness, and a sense of connection that can withstand any challenge. So, keep laughing, keep loving, and keep cherishing those special moments that make life truly beautiful."
696	21595	8	3	Have you ever experienced a time with your friends or family where you laughed so hard your stomach hurt, and your eyes were filled with tears? Laughing is something every person needs. A great laugh can make a persons day and put a smile on their face. If no one laughed the world would be a terribly sad place.  My friends and I are always laughing, to the point where were rolling on the ground, clutching our stomachs laughing. We sometimes laugh over absolutely nothing. I honestly don't know who I'd be if I didn't laugh, or what I would become. I remember this one time when my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1, and I were having a off day. We all woke up in bad moods and everything seemed to be going wrong, especially since we were woken up by my mom in the kitchen banging pans and pots around. When we woke up our favorite cereal was gone and so we wanted to go to the donut shop but no one would take us, and even though I realize that's not the end of the world now, it seemed like it then. My brother and sisters, with the @LOCATION1 blasting and running around the house yelling, were irritating us and we were already mad. The dog and cats, who kept trying to keep sneak in the house, were annoying us too. The weather outside was all gloomy and disappointing. We were all ready done with the day before it had even started.  We eventually decided to get up and get ready. We came up with a plan to walk down to river behind my house even in the poor weather. The river was after our big backyard and past the quad track so it was about a mile away. When we asked my mom if we could go down to the river she said no she didn't want us walking down there by ourselves, which we had already done a few times before. We begged until we knew she wasn't going to let us. That put us yet again in a foul mood. We had to go find something new to do and it didn't seem like there was many options. We lived clear out of town about @NUM1 miles, not exactly walking distance.
697	21596	8	3	I woke up just like any other day happy yet lacking sleep. As i got out of bed i would have never known that to day would be the funniest day of my life. I got ready for school after getting out of bed. When i got to school every thing seemed like our normal homecoming tell there was a announcement on the intercoms that had told every body out of no where there was a dance tonight. So after school was done me and my friends were going to head over to our house's to get dressed for the dance. After we were all dressed @PERSON1 picked us all up and we headed to the dance looking fly.  When we got there every body was looking dressed to dance except one guy, he was wearing corduroy pants with a red tucked in flannel and some brown worn out work boots. We look at him from head to toe and we thought to our self are we in a messed up hillbilly dream? That was just the beginning of what was yet to come. As every body started to get in grove of the beat we soon all started dancing to the music the music was good and every body was having a good time even the kid with the flannel. But just as every thing was going good a song came on that was called cotton eyed @CAPS1 when the flanneled kid heard this song he almost jumped out of his corduroy pants he soon stared kicking and swinging his feet and arms like if they had no bone or joints in them. Every body started to form a circular around the kid and every body was laughing and copying the kids movement even us. He didn't rely care he just kept dancing and singing to the song. The funnest thing about this was that the dance was a formal one and yet this kid manged to pull off wearing a flannel, some boots, and a pair ofcorduroy pants this kid was out of his mind in fact we still laugh and talk about it tell this day.
698	21598	8	3	Laughter is a crucial aspect of my life, whether it's my friends making me laugh or me making them laugh. One memorable occasion was on a hunting trip with three of my closest buddies. Despite the fact that we had a terrible hunting experience - missing two bears and a massive buck - we found ourselves in fits of laughter as exhaustion set in. It may have been a failed trip, but the time spent together, joking and teasing, made it a truly enjoyable experience.  Another example was a fishing trip with two boatloads of friends to a serene spot called Lake Tranquil. While out on the water, a hilarious incident occurred when one of the kids in the canoe almost fell overboard, leaving only his feet and hands in the boat. This moment became a lasting memory that we still laugh about to this day. Despite our adventures often taking unexpected turns, they always end up being filled with laughter and joy.laughter and joy.
699	21599	8	3	I sat at the table, speechless, as they told me their story. The @CAPS1 had been through a lot in the past seven years. @PERSON1's youngest son was born three weeks early and the doctor told her he would only live for three days at the most. As she told me, she stared off into the distance as if she were reliving the moment. She told me that her baby, @PERSON2, had a rare disease. Half of his brain was smooth, instead of the the normal rigid. She told me about those first days and how scared she was. Seeing @PERSON2 next her was the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears. He had lived longer. @PERSON1 told me about how as @PERSON2 grew older he couldn't walk. His pediatrician told her that @PERSON2 would never be able to take his first steps and would have to live life confined in a wheel chair. @PERSON2 was given another miracle. He walked. With the aide of a camouflage cane he beat the odds once again. @PERSON1 told me about how @PERSON2 couldn't talk. He only speaks through sign language. She also taught me how to take care of him. He was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and @CAPS2. He wasn't any different then the rest of the kids. This was going to be a roller coaster of a week.  I had only met the @CAPS1 early that @TIME1 when they had arrived to @CAPS4 @CAPS5, a @DATE1 @CAPS4 for disabled kids. I had only known them for a few hours and they were telling me their life story. I got the next week to become best friends with @PERSON2. We went swimming in the river, played with sticks, went on nature walks, even rode a horse. The smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face lit up my day every time I saw it. @PERSON2 got to experience things that a child of his kind would never be able to in a lifetime. We got to go tubing, ride on jet skis, and fish in a stock pond where we were sure to catch something. Having the best time of our lives we parted each night to bed, him in his cabin, and I in my tent. Each night as I left I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having. To be a part of making a child happy was the cherry on top of my @CAPS4 experience. One event in particular from @CAPS4 that week will always stay close to my heart. @PERSON2 had been experimenting around on a tricycle made specifically for children with disabilities. He tried for hours to make it go. No matter how hard her tried he couldn't move. My heart broke when I saw him start to cry. He was so frustrated. @PERSON2 gave up and moved on to the swings instead. The rest of the day was filled with the look of sorrow and frustration on his face. I wanted to fix it. I had to fix it. He needed to be happy. That night I went to our @CAPS4 directer, @PERSON3, and I told him about what had happened and he brought me to the garage. The garage was so chaotic and unorganized. I didn't quite understand what he was doing until he emerged with a brand new shiny bike. One with foot straps and supportive seat complete with dragons, and a bell. It was the perfect thing. I was so excited to let @PERSON2 try it out in the @TIME1. The next @TIME1, after a delicious blueberry pancake breakfast, we set off to try out the new toy. This moment was big for @PERSON2 and his parents. He was told he'd never walk, or ever be able to ride a bike, or talk. He had lived through miracles before. He could do it again. @PERSON3 strapped @PERSON2 on the bike, put a helmet on him and started him off. The anticipation was almost too much. After a few seconds passed, the wheels began to turn. @PERSON2 was riding a bike. Tears streamed down our faces, this was the greatest moment of @ORGANIZATION1's life. The way he smiled and laughed at his new found capability was a great sight. To be part of something so special was an honor. @PERSON2 rode his bike all around @CAPS4 that day. He even rode it into his cabin, and continued to ride in circles around his bunk. I left the family to enjoy their night and went off to bed myself.  The rest of the week was filled with a great deal of fun, but when the end came the goodbyes were hard. We didn't want to leave each other. I had
700	21601	8	3	As I remember back, it was @DATE1. It was a hot, humid day. I can remember that day like it was yesterday. I woke up that morning and decided I was going to go swimming. But the only problem was I had no one to go with me, and @CAPS2 attitude was turning for the worst. The day @CAPS1 off fairly well for the most part. I called around to all @CAPS2 friends to see what they were doing for that particular day, but as I went down @CAPS2 friend line everyone seemed to be too busy to go anywhere with me. I was most certainly bummed. @CAPS2 happy go lucky attitude turned into the dumps really fast. The only thing that was left for me to do was use @CAPS2 back up plan, @CAPS2 aunt. We gathered our swimming gear, blankets, tanning lotion, and ourselves and packed it in the back of the van and headed towards @ORGANIZATION1. I was really not in the best of moods, and it seemed that everyone that was around me was turning into a grump as well. Totally bummed that all of @CAPS2 friends had ditched me and left me to hang with @CAPS2 aunt all day wasn't @CAPS2 explanation of fun, sorry enough to say, but it wasn't.  As the day went on the more I thought about @CAPS2 friends the more I got frustrated. Then finally it came to me, why let their stupidity of ditching (the best thing that had happened to them) me, ruin @CAPS2 day. I @CAPS1 to loosen up and have a good time. Jumping off rocks, making a fool of myself, laughing, and having a good time. We spent the whole day enjoying with what we had.  When I got home and I had realized what an awesome day @CAPS2 day had turned out to be, I realized that I shouldn't let @CAPS2 friends get me down. Laughing and having a good time can make any day turn around for the best. The most important lesson that I have learned from @CAPS2 experience that day, is to make the best out of each situation. Don't let crushed plans crush your self confidence. Put a smile on your face and turn your frown upside down and laugh. Laughter makes life better.
701	21603	8	3	"Those eyes, it was like I was looking out into a warm Caribbean sunset with a flash of green while relaxing on the beach without a care in the world. Her skin was kissed by the sun and flawless in every way. Those lush ruby red lips looked about as juicy and refreshing as the taste of a freshly picked pink lady apple. From the moment she sat down across from me, I could've sworn I was dreaming. How can any woman look so perfect and exist outside of a movie or game? That's all I could think of, that's all I wanted to imagine. Just me and her together, but the thought of it was too great to come true. I couldn't find a way to bridge this gap I felt between us. Neither of us had ever met or seen each other before, and yet still, I couldn't resist. It was like when Adam was presented with the golden apple from Eve. That smile, perfectly straight teeth with that sparkling shine that could blind anyone without sunglasses. That's when she finally spoke and said, ""@CAPS1, do you know the answer to number three?""   I was stunned by her voice. It reminded me of a thousand violins played by angels. My mouth dropped, and all I could say was, ""nope."" I was a complete mook, nothing more than a hoser, but then I noticed she was wearing a cross to match her outfit. So I attempted to redeem myself with, ""that's an amazing cross you're wearing, what kind of gem is that in the center?"" She smiled and batted her eyelashes and told me, ""thank you, I like your cross too. Mine has a ruby in it."" I smiled back, then I got a text message from my friend with a new joke he wanted me to hear. As I read it, I started to burst out laughing. The angel in front of me was then curious about what I was laughing about. When I finally finished the joke, she too burst out laughing, and I finally gave myself a proper introduction and told her my name. She was smiling from ear to ear after the laugh we shared, and she told me her name was ""@CAPS2."" Ah, @CAPS2, surely it had to be a name given to angels. To this day, I still thank my friend who gave me that joke because if I had not made her laugh, then we probably wouldn't have gotten to know each other. If we had not gotten to know each other, then she probably wouldn't be my girlfriend. To this day, I still feel like the luckiest man in the world, and if fate sees fit to split us apart, then I will always remember that laughing is the best way to get to know someone. And in that moment, I knew that our laughter would always bind us together, no matter what challenges we faced."

703	21605	8	3	"Laughter is an integral element to many situations. These situations vary greatly, disasters to the desire to be cheered up to simply wanting to be amused. Humor can make light of circumstances no matter how grave, terrifying or uneasing. The recent earthquakes and subsequent tsunami in @LOCATION2 made me very worried for my friend @CAPS1. He lives in @LOCATION1 which I at the time I, and many of my other friends thought was close to some of the more affected areas. Of course, we were all scared for him, but we tried to the best of our ability to make light of this disaster. Our fears were made even worse when he never logged onto the ning or facebook, but we know now that was just because electricity was down for him that night (night for us). When we learned he was safe, at least for the time being we were all incredibly relieved. Humor really helped diffuse the situation, as it has many times before. As of now this is still a story in the making because as this is being written there are still great dangers for that region, not the least of which is the threat of nuclear meltdown. The jokes are continuing into the week. I believe humor can be very helpful during worrying times because making light of a serious situation in a way, makes it feel less serious.  Of course many people look down upon doing this, which is completely understandable. They either don't see that we are legitimately fearful or don't understand and believe we're just joking about it to be ""edgy"" or ""offensive"". People who feel the need to joke about dangerous situations aren't intent upon being malicious or uncaring, they, most often, are people with with a sense of humor and a sense of distress."
704	21606	8	3	One time I was at my friend @PERSON1's house, and her dog @PERSON3 was going crazy. She would run up and down the stairs as fast as she could and no one had any idea why. I thought it was so funny, but @PERSON1 was getting super mad at @PERSON3. So eventually @ORGANIZATION1 into her room to see if she would calm down, but to her dismay @PERSON3 did not. She was running hot laps back and forth all around the room and the more she did that the harder I laughed. It was like the most funniest thing I have ever experienced in my life. This dog had obviously gotten a hold of some kind of energy source to be this happen. Yet we still couldn't figure out what it was, but @PERSON3 was on a sugar high or something. So @PERSON1 and I went down stairs to see if her mom @CAPS1 knew why @PERSON3 was acting so ridiculous. She had no clue. So then we went and asked her dad @PERSON2, and he was convinced the dog was just crazy. Obviously the dog had some issues, but that wasn't the problem because @PERSON3 never usually acted this hyper before. Then @CAPS2, @PERSON1's sister came down stairs and told us to shut the dog up, but we couldn't. @PERSON3 was running to fast to catch her and was way to crazy to try and calm her down. So we took @PERSON3 back in @ORGANIZATION1's room and just laughed and laughed because there was nothing else to do but to sit there and wonder what the heck was wrong with this dog. To be honest, we never did find out what was wrong with @PERSON3, she was just insanely hyper and out of this world that @TIME1. So after @PERSON3 had calmed down about @NUM1 hours later, @PERSON1 and I went on a walk. We were with her friend @PERSON4 and I was trying to explain to him the story of how @PERSON3 went crazy that @TIME1 and they didn't find it as funny as me. I thought it was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in my life! And while I was explaining it to him, they had warned me I was about to trip over a curb, but I was laughing way to hard to notice and I fell. That was like the icing on the cake of @TIME1. I just sat there on the ground and laughed, and so did they. It was pretty funny! I haven't laughed that hard since then. The end.
705	21607	8	3	Laughter played a crucial role in helping the students cope with the sudden loss of their beloved teacher, @PERSON2. The day started with shock and sorrow, but as they shared memories and funny stories, the atmosphere shifted. Laughter replaced tears, and the students found solace in celebrating @PERSON2's life rather than mourning his death. The healing power of laughter brought them together and allowed them to remember the joy and positivity that @PERSON2 had brought into their lives. In the midst of grief, laughter became a source of comfort and strength, helping them navigate through the difficult emotions of loss. Through laughter, they honored @PERSON2's memory and found a way to keep his spirit alive in their hearts.
706	21608	8	3	One thing that people in the world love to do the most is laugh. Why is it that we like to laugh? Laughter is very important in our lives because it brings us joy, happiness, and fills our stomachs with butterflies. One major aspect of laughter is its ability to strengthen relationships. Whether it's between romantic partners, parents and children, family members, or friends, laughter plays a crucial role in building strong bonds. It can create memorable moments, ease tension, and foster a sense of connection. However, it is essential to use laughter in a positive way, as it can also have negative consequences if used to hurt or belittle others. Overall, laughter is a vital element in life that brings people together, creates happiness, and helps us navigate through difficult times. It is a powerful tool that should be cherished and shared with others to make the world a brighter and more joyful place.
707	21609	8	3	Laughter, to me, is an important aspect of my relationship with anyone. I cherish laughter, and I employ it at every chance that I receive. To many, laughter may be trivial, but to me, it holds the key to my relationships with other people. Without laughter, many of the wonderful people I have met in my life might not be there because I used laughter to develop them into friendships.  Friends were hard to come by in my childhood. I did not make good choices, not with whom I associated myself with; rather, with how I approached other people for the first time. I would come off as brash, rude, or annoying, among other things. I had no experience with making relationships, and the first impression is very important. Just like any meal, the first sense that is appealed to is sight. The image of the meal floods the mind, next, the aroma floats aimlessly towards you, and you begin to salivate in anticipation. And like any recipe, to perfect it, you must practice, and that is what I did.  It was a long and arduous process, but come my sophomore year in high school, I began to feel like I mastered the art of making other people laugh. As students and individuals, people come and go, we may truly end up forgetting their entire being, or we may leave an impression on their mind. I try this through laughter; to be remembered, if not only for a day.  Using laughter, I acquired new opportunities to make friends, and I did not squander those opportunities. I surrounded myself in a net of laughter, I developed the necessary skills to make people laugh. One relationship that I built is with a young woman. I had never spoken to her before until our teacher put us into a group together. Laughter was the essential building block of our future relationship. I was myself, I would not pretend to be someone I'm not, I would express puns that our youth are so fond of, euphemisms our generation knows all too well.  We would listen to the same music, and gradually, our relationship was nurtured into a steadfast friendship. It has developed to the point where, in class, we long for each other's company. We look for classes to have together because we love to make each other laugh. And because of laughter, I have made a friend with whom I share secrets, time, and moments that I shall forever cherish.  Recently, she has decided to start playing tennis. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. I would like nothing more than to help her, and whoever so decides to partake in my leadership. I do not necessarily claim to be the best, but I am confident in my abilities to teach the techniques and fundamentals of the game.  There is not much more I would like to do than to play the sport that I love with the woman I love. Most of the credit belongs to laughter because when her amiable face lights up from something I said, it means all the world to me, whether she knows it or not.  I have many such connections with other people from both sexes, but none so much as hers. I worked hard to build connections with other people because they would make life that much easier and that much more enjoyable. In high school, there are no exclusive social groups or roving bands of football players ready to pick out the weakest of the student population. We are all friends, we are all one community, we all belong, and that is due, in part, to laughter.  Laughter connects people from around the world; it is the universal language every race, skin color, and religion all speak. It can bring us together or it can tear us apart, but in life, the medicine most prescribed is laughter.
708	21610	8	3	"People always say that the worst parts of life are the sad parts, the moments where no one is there to make you laugh or smile. These sad moments trump the problems caused by work, or by the society, and show how important laughter is in our lives. A time when someone is feeling joy so strong that it pours out of them in the way of a suppressed giggle or booming laugh, are the times that make life worth living, worth the jobs and the bad breakups and the over priced society. It has been said by those infamous ""they"" that your worst most tragic moments are the ones remembered forever because they hold the most emotion, but i have to disagree with ""them"". Moments in the life whether they be seconds, hours, weeks or years, can be cherished also if they are built up by the bonds of love and laughter. Just recently was my birthday. This year it fell on a @DATE1 and I had made no plans to celebrate in any way. Sure my parents had gotten me loads of presents but the joy and jittery excitement that i had always felt previous to my birthday wasn't in me. These feelings were most likely because this year i had decided that now that i was in high school, birthday parties were a no go. With no plans or exciting activities to await, my birthday was not eagerly looked forward to as it had been every year previous. What would i do?! I definitely didn't want to spend the day home in my pajamas with my parents and two sisters, that's what i did almost every other normal @DATE1. These thoughts and realizations brought that sad lonely feeling in me, those feelings that make up the worst parts of life. My mom, noticing my birthday gloom, suggested a trip to the beach and a one night stay in a yurt. I love the beach, I would even go as far as to say that its my favorite place in the world. I also love yurts. Yurts are big round cabins made from canvas draped around a wood structure, with a skylight directly at the top of the pointed roof where you could see the stars at night. Staying in a yurt at the beach sounded better to me then being at home, so naturally I agreed to the beach trip. Way deep down I was excited, I was thrilled, a beach trip with my family! In my head I was stuck still in my foggy state of gloom as thoughts swirled in my head about how I would not have a good time if there were no friends to laugh and hang out with, and how much of a loser I was for not doing anything with friends but instead my family. Our household consists of my mom, dad, and two sisters ages four and @NUM1 months. We are not the most well functioning family. I find my older sister to be an annoying brat sent by the devil to ruin my life and make everything my fault. Two out of the three of us girls have to always be in some kind of brawl, and that drives my mother crazy which gets her all flustered and my dad angry until we realize that buzz light year has ruffled all of our feathers. This scene is exactly what I imagined my family birthday beach trip to turn out like, but caused by a long car drive and hungry kids rather than buzz light year.  The day approached and we woke early to pack our bags and pack the car. My mom, bless her, made a family announcement to us that today was my day and anything I wanted was what I got. This meant that I got to choose what we would eat, what we would do and could make any comment including telling my little sisters to bug off if i wanted to. By lunch, we had visited the beach, gotten settled in our yurt, and enjoyed a lunch made up of various snacks we had brought along and I found that I was enjoying myself. No one had fought all day, raised a voice, make a snarky comment or do anything to upset the happy atmosphere we were in. I was laughing. As we visited the aquarium with all its odd fish i laughed. I laughed at my sisters when they were doing silly things. I laughed at the things my mother told me. We all laughed at a bicyclist running into a pole, and fish doing vacuum like motions with their lips. All the laughing, all the smiles did a lot for me. It pushed those negative thoughts straight out of my mind and told them never to come back. Laughing helped me to see all of the love that circled around in my family, it made the love visible. Its healthy to laugh. Without laughter in our lives, some things like love, that can sometimes be invisible, become visible again through laughter. Laughing is truly important and necessary for a happy and fulfilling life."
709	21611	8	3	"Why is it that people can look back at something and laugh, but not while the action is taking place? For example, if you were to witness someone being hit by a car. During that event, nobody would be laughing. There would most likely be people rushing frantically for help and ambulances everywhere. But we see people get hit by cars all of the time on the internet and it is considered comedic. On a hot summer day, something quite similar happened to me and my friends. I live next to the lake. I know of this one spot on the lake, its called Green Cove Springs. It has a pretty strange name due to the fact that the water is actually a greenish color because of the reflection of the trees that surround it. The lake is about thirty yards wide, nobody knows how deep it is because it is impossible to touch the bottom. The main attraction is a cliff-side, which ranges from 15 feet to 25 feet. On the other side of the lake, there is a beautiful, golden beach with massive trees behind it. The hike to Green Cove Springs is about one mile of steep decline, which leads right to the cliff's edge. The lake bed and the gorge are lined up just the way that it is shaded for most of the day, except in the mornings. On this particular day, I was going to bring my friends, Alex, Sarah, and Jake. My friend Alex is a dare-devil. Although he's not very good at athletic things, he is willing to try just about anything. He was also homeschooled until freshman year of high school, so he's also pretty socially awkward and definitely not used to resisting negative peer pressure. On the other hand, I am the kid to do crazy things, but I can pull them off. I was doing gainers off of the cliff's edge that was only about 15 feet off the water. Somehow, Alex ended up getting pressured into trying one as well. As he was getting mentally prepared for this stunt, we all gave him a countdown. 3, 2, 1, jump! We all shouted at the same time. He ran to the cliff-side, just like I showed him, he jumped out, then brought his knees to his chest. Nothing happened! That was the problem, Alex tucked but he never rotated. He fell like a rock. His back aimed straight at the water. There was what seemed like a split-second pause between the moment he jumped off the cliff and the moment he smacked the water. His upper back was the first thing to make contact with the water, there was a giant splash, and the sound of a clap almost as loud as a small firecracker. 5 seconds later, Alex emerged from the water, he was attempting to breathe but no air was entering his lungs. Sarah, Jake, and I were all on the shore of the beach across the lake! Simultaneously, we looked at each other, nobody was laughing, everyone looked worried. All at once we booked it into the water. It was about a 30 yard swim to get all the way to Alex. I was the first one there. He was panting by then, but he was still in an intense state of panic. I stayed away from him until Jake got there. Jake is almost 6'3 and 190 pounds, so he grabbed Alex around the torso first. I grabbed his legs, when Sarah and Alex finally got there they took hold of his arms. We all pulled him to the beach where he could safely put his feet on dry land. Who knows what would have happened if the panicked Alex would have made it to the beach all by himself. Although, it was kind of our fault for pressuring him in the first place. After almost 5 hours of basking in the sun and calming down, the sun started setting behind the gorge, there were shadows closing in on us from the shoreline. It was only 5 o'clock. We decided to explore down the lake a little bit, also to find some more sunshine. We all stood up and noticed that Alex's entire backside was purple! Not only because of his ginger skin, but the impact on the water created quite the contusion. Everyone except Alex saw it and busted out laughing at the memory of what had previously just happened. Alex looked behind him and saw his discolored back and couldn't hold back bursts of laughter. Laughter was coming from everyone. This was the first time that Alex, Sarah, Jake, and I had ever hung out. Laughter was what brought us together. Now we share our lake spot with all of our own other friends but nothing sticks out to me like that day did. To this day we all still reminisce about that hot summer day at Green Cove Springs when Alex attempted a gainer off the cliff. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two (or five"
710	21613	8	3	Before my best friend moved away, we would stay up at night just laughing for no reason at all. I don't know what would get us started, but it would not stop until our stomachs hurt so bad from laughing that we just fell asleep. On these nights, her mom would come in around @TIME1 and ask us nicely to please quiet down, which just made us laugh more. When we are together, it is quite dangerous to be around. We have gotten so close that we are practically sisters in a way. Laughter is important in all of my relationships. I grew up in a large family where laughter is key, and positive attitudes were expected.  Over the @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I work together, so we have lots of time to get our thinking on the same track. If we are on a short car ride and we want to go somewhere, we make it happen. We are very good at manipulating our elders, a skill acquired from years of practicing on @CAPS2. All it takes is one look to see what the other is plotting, then a laugh will follow, letting the manipulated know that it is doomed, or very soon to be. Our schemes are generally harmless, possibly just a little side ache from being tickled too hard. It does not help that we are both small, strong, and packed full of energy, just waiting for the right person to come along. @CAPS1 and I find ways to stir up mischief all around us, whether it be jumping out from behind corners or taking the manager's keys.  When I go somewhere, I am generally aiming for positive places with an upbeat atmosphere and people that make me happy. I dislike and avoid places I don't enjoy, I am one to make jokes or be sarcastic when things are too quiet or too serious. Serious environments intimidate me, @CAPS6 are out of my comfort zone. Laughter brings people together, and it lightens people's moods. Nobody likes the awkward situations where no one is saying anything, so I generally will break the silence with a blond joke or something.  I was flying home to @ORGANIZATION2 from @LOCATION3, @CAPS3 and met a couple great people on the way. When I boarded the plane I looked around for a place to sit then decided on the seat between an elderly woman and a man who resembled my father (I was alone on the flight). I thought, for the next hour I will be with these people, so I had better make it something to remember. The man had helped me get my carry-on into the overhead storage, which was very nice of him. The elderly woman and I started talking, and the subject of horses came up, and when horses come up in conversion, @CAPS6 are usually paired with lots of falling stories. She talked about this @CAPS4 horse called @CAPS4 @CAPS5, how he had a mind of his own, and how he would do things his way. The problem with horses is this: @CAPS6 know that @CAPS6 are a slight deal bigger than us, and can really do as @CAPS6 please, but most choose to listen as @CAPS6 don't like to be corrected. I told about my first few rides, and how I didn't know much besides how to steer the massive animal beneath me. Before we knew it, we were landing in @LOCATION1, and my new friends got off the plane.  When my plane landed in @LOCATION1, I figured I would be flying to @ORGANIZATION2 sitting alone. After a few minutes, a teenage girl got on and sat next to me. The first thing she did was offer me a piece of gum, which I accepted. The first bit of the ride was quiet, but after awhile the crying baby got annoying to listen to so we started talking. She was flying to @LOCATION2 to her dad's house. We talked about our families and hobbies, and had a good time. After we flew into @ORGANIZATION1, I welcomed myself back home, I was back in the eternal rain state, and couldn't see anything besides clouds out of my window. Laughter is all around us, and there are always things to laugh about, look on the bright side of life. People are more attracted to those who can make them laugh, so get a sense of humor and you will be in good company. Giggles and smiles make the world go around, so keep laughing. Laughter truly is the best medicine, and it can bring joy to even the most mundane situations. Embrace laughter, share it with others, and watch how it can brighten everyone's day.
711	21615	8	3	"@ORGANIZATION1                                    @DATE1 for my @CAPS1 birthday we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for a week, @CAPS16 was so much fun when we got there but the drive was not fun at all. When we got to the house that @TIME1 is was so beautiful the snow was falling and @CAPS16 was coming down so hard @CAPS16 looked like white cotton balls and the snow on the house was just amazingly marvelous I mean @CAPS16 seriously looked like @CAPS16 could have belonged in a story book as a princess castle. When we got in the house @CAPS16 was really relaxed and nobody really wanted to do anything we all pretty much fell asleep on the couch.  The next morning when we woke up we were all eating breakfast and watching the snow @DATE2, there was a knock on the door, so of course I had to @CAPS9 get @CAPS16 because my @CAPS17 was ""too tired"" so i got up and went and opened the the door and three huge boys came in and picked me up now at first i was like ""@CAPS2 who are these boys?"" but then after they took their hoods off i noticed @CAPS16 was my cousin @PERSON1, his best friend @PERSON2 and his other friend @CAPS3. So they carried me back to the table and sat me down and @CAPS16 was funny because my whole @CAPS17 was laughing so hard they couldn't breathe and i still had a horrified look on my face.  They yelled""@CAPS4"" and then went out back and started building snow ramps to snowboard off of. So i got dressed and went out back with them and at first they were like ""@CAPS5 great she is out here"". And they usually give me a lot of attention but they weren't so i decided i needed more attention so when they weren't looking i went and sat down and the snowboard ramp the had built and of course @PERSON2 knew why i was doing @CAPS16 but @CAPS3 and @PERSON1 were still clueless so of course they told me to get off but i told them ""@CAPS7"" and that irritated them so @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS8 girl if you don't move i am going to jump over you"", well of course i was super mad at this point and wanted to see if he would actually do @CAPS16 so i told him ""@CAPS9 ahead"" @PERSON1 started to @CAPS9 but then @PERSON2 grabbed him,@CAPS10 him off the snowboard and started yelling at him @CAPS11 the time the whole argument was over, witch @CAPS11 the way lasted almost the whole day. I went to bed @TIME1 and @PERSON1@NUM1 and @CAPS3 went to the bar and the next morning I was told to sleep in but i was woken up at seven o'clock @CAPS11 @PERSON2 and @CAPS3 screaming at @PERSON1 to get up but they didn't get him up they got me up I was so mad I felt like a mama bear who just got woken up in the middle of hibernation. @CAPS16 was so irritating to be a house with three hungover twenty-one @DATE1 old's but i had fun anyways, That @TIME1 they were not home @CAPS14 god but with them not there is was peace and quiet so we played @CAPS15 and @LOCATION3, @CAPS16 was so much fun we had a blast. The next morning wasn't all that fun because we had another @CAPS17, @CAPS18 us. I swear i was so irritated I wanted to pounce on them like and angry tiger getting ready to catch her prey. So i tried to stay away as much as possible, witch was kind of hard because they all love me but i just decided to lock myself in my room for the day to avoid them, @CAPS16 kind of sucked but @CAPS16 was a lot better than having them yell in my ear every five seconds. The day after we cleaned and started getting ready to leave, @CAPS16 was not fun at all but my @CAPS17 made sure i was cleaning and we ate three meals and after every meal we cleaned again but that @TIME1 we went to bed and you didn't hear a peep out of anybody because we were so tired but the next morning we left at seven o'clock and started driving back to @LOCATION2 @CAPS16 was so fun being at @LOCATION1 we have made @CAPS16 a tradition but we weren't able to @CAPS9 this @DATE1 because of winter formal but we are definitely going back this @DATE1 and we will have"
712	21617	8	3	Morose and somnolent, I woke up to go to @LOCATION1. I was supposed to watch basketball games, but I couldn't play due to my injury. I joined my friends on the bus ride to the destination, feeling lackadaisical and out of place. When we arrived at the school, it felt deserted and eerie. After waiting for our turn to play, I watched from the sidelines as my teammates enjoyed the game. Despite my sadness, I cheered them on during the match. We had a good first half but struggled in the second, leading to a disappointing loss. I stayed to watch two more games, experiencing a mix of emotions throughout. After the games, my cousin and I grabbed a meal at @ORGANIZATION1, where we encountered some comical mishaps with our orders. Despite the initial gloominess of the day, unexpected laughter and fun filled our journey home. In the end, the day turned out to be much brighter than I had anticipated.
713	21618	8	3	"A while back my mom had decided to send me to @DATE3 camp. When I heard this I was pretty upset, @CAPS1 I wouldn't know anyone there. Before camp started I did all I could to let my mom not let me go. After a while of that I knew I wouldn't get my way, and before I knew it I was off to camp. When I got to the place that was taking us to camp, there wasn't a lot of people there.  When I got to the camp I was wrong, there was a lot of people that I didn't know. It was extremely scary, but it was to late to go home now. Walking to my cabin was nerve racking, @CAPS1 I didn't know who would be in my cabin. Meeting the girls in my cabin was awkward, mainly @CAPS1 we didn't know each other and secondly our counselor was so weird. Right after meeting each other our counselor made all of us play a game of @CAPS2. Playing @CAPS2 at first with strangers was strange, but after a while we started laughing. We played and laughed for hours and hours, until it was time for lunch. Lunch with the girls was not so scary since we had so muh fun playing @CAPS2, but we still didn't really know each other.  When lunch was over the first thing we did was play @CAPS2, the more we laughed and had fun the more and more we started to get to know each other. All @DATE1 we played the silly little game of @CAPS2, and just giggled and laughed. @DATE2 came along the second @DATE1 of camp and all of us had almost become friend by just laughing and playing @CAPS2. We played it so much the first @DATE1 that we just called it ""@CAPS6 @CAPS2"" instead of @CAPS2. Like other things we got tired of @CAPS2 and went our separate ways for free time. Everyone agreed that free time that @DATE1 was so boring so we played @CAPS2 again. Laughing and laughing till our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard, that I think was the @DATE1 all of us really became friends.  We had become thick as thieves in just a couple of days, we did everything together. We talked,we swam, we played tennis, and most importantly we laughed together. Camp was not what I expected it to be, it was way better. All the girls in my cabin had become friends so fast that it was strange to other people,not realy but it was kind of weird to become best friends in just a couple of days. Camp was flying by for us and before we all knew it it was almost the @DATE1. Things were so good, until one of us got sick. I was the one who ended up sick, it was horrible I stayed in bed all @DATE1 missing everything that was going on. Even worse I had almost lost my voice, laying in bed without laughing with my friends and having fun was just torture. @DATE4 the @DATE1 of camp was fastly approaching, and all I could do was stay in bed. @DATE4 was there, but it was a relief when I could talk again. The rest of the @DATE1 @DATE1 of camp I could be out of bed and enjoying camp.  When @DATE1 time was ending and evening was arriving, we had our cabin party. Our party was so much fun, even though we had to stay inside our cabin. We ate all of our treats we saved from the concession stand, and all of the treats our counselor brought. It was almost @TIME1 so we had to go to bed soon, @CAPS1 we where leaving in the @TIME2. There was one @DATE1 thing we had to do, and it was one @DATE1 game of @CAPS2. We played for about in hour, @CAPS1 another counselor had to come tell us to be quiet.  Looking back at my first year of camp, I always remember how all of us became friends. We still talk about it every year at camp, and we do still play @CAPS2. That year at camp I think is one at my favorite memories, @CAPS1 we all became friends by just playing @CAPS2 and laughing together. All the memories made at camp will be cherished forever."
714	21619	8	3	I dont like computers, mainly because I find them difficult to use. The complexity of navigating through different programs and understanding technical jargon often frustrates me. Additionally, I prefer more hands-on activities and find the screen time required by computers to be excessive. I also worry about the potential negative effects of prolonged computer use on my health, such as eye strain and posture issues. Overall, my discomfort with computers stems from a combination of usability issues and concerns about their impact on my well-being.
715	21620	8	3	"Everyone knows how important a laugh can be. Everyone has a different laugh, it can be powerful and moving or devastating and hurtful. Someone said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I agree with this statement, everyone has a different laugh and laughs for many different reasons. Laughing is so powerful, someone can make you laugh when you're upset or unhappy and they could change everything and how you are feeling. Laughing is a way of connecting with others; you laugh when you are having a good time or are hurt and need someone.  Over the summer, I was moving back to my hometown from a different city, and I was nervous about being the new kid again. However, reuniting with old friends from second grade brought back a sense of familiarity and comfort. We shared laughs, stories, and crazy moments, reminiscing about our past and realizing how much we had all changed over the years. Despite the challenges we faced individually, our friendship remained strong, and spending time with them was a reminder of the bond we shared.  As the end of summer approached, my friends and I decided to have one last memorable sleepover before school started. The night was filled with laughter, joy, and reminiscing about the good old days. We ended up going ""TP'ing"" around the neighborhood, disguising ourselves and having a blast despite being caught up in our loud chatter and laughter. The unexpected encounter with some other friends from school added to the fun, making it a night to remember.  This experience was a reminder of the power of laughter and friendship. Despite the challenges and changes we had gone through, coming together and sharing moments of joy and laughter made everything feel lighter and more manageable. The laughter we shared that night will always be a cherished memory, reinforcing the strength and importance of true friendship."
716	21621	8	3	Laughter is an essential element in my family dynamic. We share moments of joy, unity, and even in times of conflict, we find a way to laugh together. This bond through humor is what keeps us connected and close as a family. One particular incident that stands out is when my stepdad, in a fit of frustration, recounted a hilarious yet embarrassing situation involving my sister and a lack of toilet paper. The absurdity of the situation, combined with the unexpected turn of events, had us all in stitches. Despite the initial tension, the laughter that followed brought us closer together. Even after the incident, the humor persisted, with my stepdad playfully withholding toilet paper as a form of lighthearted revenge. Through laughter and shared experiences, we find strength and unity as a family, forming memories that will last a lifetime.
717	21623	8	3	"Laughter is an important part of any relationship, whether it be with family, friends, or a significant other. It has the power to bring people together, create lasting memories, and strengthen bonds. A personal experience that highlights the significance of laughter in relationships is a family camping trip that turned into a series of mishaps and adventures.  Initially, the family seemed disconnected, each member engrossed in their own electronic devices, not fully engaging with one another. However, a series of comical events, such as a raccoon attack and a runaway "" @CAPS1 "" followed by a mud pit incident, brought unexpected laughter and unity among the family members. Despite the challenges they faced, the family found humor in the situation, bonding over shared experiences and creating a stronger connection.  Through laughter, the family was able to let go of tension, communicate openly, and enjoy each other's company. The camping trip ultimately transformed their relationship, bringing them closer together and allowing them to appreciate the importance of laughter in fostering strong and meaningful connections. This experience serves as a reminder of the power of laughter in building and maintaining healthy relationships."
718	21624	8	3	Sometime ago on a hot summer day my friends and I were looking for ways to escape the extreme heat. We considered various options like going to a friend's house with air conditioning, walking to a swim hole, visiting a pool, or even camping at the coast. After some deliberation, we decided to drive to the coast for a camping trip. The drive was long but scenic, passing through tunnels, rivers, mountains, and redwood forests. Upon reaching the coast, we enjoyed the cool breeze and refreshing water, although we accidentally swam in a rip tide advisory zone. Despite the brief stay, we had a memorable time before having to return to the heat of the city. Overall, our spontaneous trip to the coast provided a much-needed break from the summer heat.

They have gone through moments of being enemies, constantly arguing and fighting over trivial matters. But as time passed and they faced challenges together, their bond grew stronger. The mother and daughter, named LOCATION5 and LOCATION2, found solace in laughter, which helped them overcome their differences and connect on a deeper level. Laughter became a way for them to block out past traumas and focus on the joy they shared in each other's company. Despite the physical distance that now separates them, they still find ways to laugh and cherish the moments they have together, whether through singing a special song or recalling funny memories. Their shared sense of humor and ability to find lightness in dark times have solidified their friendship and made their relationship stronger than ever before. Laughter truly has the power to bring people together, as evidenced by the unbreakable bond between this mother and daughter.
720	21628	8	3	"I never understood the meaning laughter is the shortest distance between two people, tell I dated @PERSON2. We started to date in the @NUM1 grade. @CAPS6 indeed, you @MONTH1 think it was puppy love, @CAPS4 i still think to this day it was real true love. We lived about an hour a half an hour away from each other and only got to see each other two or three times a month, @CAPS4 it was still the best time of my life, with all the good and fun times we had. We met through my ex-boyfriend, and his best friend @PERSON1 @CAPS1. @PERSON1 went to school with me and @PERSON1's mom and Nick's mom were best friends, so they grew up together and were best friends as well. To sum up how we met is, I was dating @PERSON1 and was supposed to go to the movies with him and his friend, @CAPS4 @PERSON1 didn't show so I was stuck with @PERSON2 and we hit it off right after that. The more time we spent together the more times we laughed, had fun and as well as that, made memories to last a lifetime. If we couldn't see each other we would talk on the phone for hours. (and when I say hours I mean like, @NUM2 hours.) or we would text nonstop. we would make funny jokes, talk crap about people we hated, talk crap about family, and last @CAPS4 not least make fun of each other. we would just have so many good times just talking and laughing our time away. After about @NUM2 months of dating, things went for the worst."" I just can't do this long-distance thing anymore"" said @PERSON2."" @CAPS2? @CAPS2 can't we just work things out?"" I said with tears starting to come out."""" @CAPS3 it just isn't fair to us."" @PERSON2 said with hesitance in his voice."" @CAPS4 think about all the good times we had? all the laughs and fun times we had?"" I started to smile, just thinking about all those times we had."" @CAPS5 yeah, @CAPS4 is that fair to us?"" @PERSON2 Said."" @CAPS6 it is, as long as we have each other nothing is too bad for us. hehe"" I said knowing that he was changing his mind slowly. "" @CAPS7 now I know I need you."" he said laughing in the background. After that night everything was good, for a while. we had fights like that on and off and thing with my family and his family made it very hard for us to be together. @CAPS4 we did it for a year and a half. @CAPS4 even after a year and a half of our life's we still couldn't make it. not ever laughter or good time kept us together. @CAPS4 it did keep us together for that long. Laughter was a big impact in that relationship and I thank god that it was. Even to this very day, I can still look back and laugh at all the good and funny times we had together. Laughter can keep two people that leave from afar together, @CAPS4 the real question is how long can that laughter keep them together? For a day? A year? Three years? Or maybe a whole lifetime? Only time could tell. Laughter is indeed a powerful bond that can bring people together in the most challenging of circumstances, making memories that last a lifetime."
721	21629	8	3	"When you laugh, is it out of habit, or is it because of a cause? What are the causes for laughing? Is there even such a thing as a ""cause"" for laughter? I'm sure that if you were to get a scientist's opinion, you would be given an in-depth, technical explanation for the cause of laughter; but does that mean that laughing is simply a message sent from the brain to the required muscles? Certainly not! The true cause is what was said or done to cause the brain to send the message to the required muscles to physically make a person laugh. So what makes people laugh? A funny joke, a senseless action, a misunderstanding? It can be anything! Without a doubt, one thing that makes people laugh is having a delightful time with a friend or two. Today, my older sister and I unknowingly went out on an adventure to visit our very best friends who happened to be almost completely identical to us in personality. Whenever the four of us got together, there was no telling what kind of humorous and insane memories we would all go home with. This particular day, both my friend and I were in desperate need of each other's full attention and up-lifting spirits. We decided to meet up at their house and as soon as we arrived, the laughter began. We were all completely immersed in our own conversations when suddenly, my friend blurted out a hilarious question that sent us all into fits of laughter. We laughed until tears streamed down our faces, and that moment of pure joy and connection is something we still reminisce about to this day. Laughter truly is the best medicine, especially when shared with the ones we hold dear."
722	21630	8	3	"Trippin' on fences I am @NUM1 years young, and in those short @NUM1 years, all I can ever remember, is laughing hysterically. Whether it was about something stupid I did, or my best friend doing something stupid, or most of the time when we got together and did something outrageous. Someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". With my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 and I, that's exactly the case. I always get a good ab workout whenever I'm with her, because I'm always bursting with laughter. It was my @NUM3 grade year at @ORGANIZATION1 here in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3. I was hanging out with my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 during our lunch break outside. I was showing her my new jeans I'd just gotten the day before, at @LOCATION2. I was also telling her about a note that had been passed to me, by a boy who had apparently had a crush on me for sometime, this boy had also asked me out on the note. @ORGANIZATION2 had asked me if she could see it, when I handed it over to her, all of a sudden, she chucked the note over the fence. Clearly, the guy didn't have @ORGANIZATION2's approval. I couldn't just leave the guy hanging without an answer, especially when at the time, I liked him back. I begged @ORGANIZATION2 to give me my note back, but she refused. What was I supposed to do, just let an unanswered note lay on the other side of the fence? No. The only solution was to hop over the fence and grab it. So I, in my new jeans might I add, practically straddled the fence, and ripped a big hole on the inner side of my thigh, in my brand new jeans. I was so mad. I grabbed the note, and climbed back over the fence in my new and improved hobo jeans. On my way back over, I lost my balance, and fell of the fence. I ended up losing the note again and planting head first into a pile of mud and pine cones.  What an idiot I was, I'd climbed over that stupid fence, ripped my jeans, biffed it and lost my balance, and lost it again. I was so frustrated with myself, I started laughing. I'm not sure if it was because I was embarrassed or what, but I randomly started cracking up. Then @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing, and when she laughs I laugh, because her laughter is so contagious. Pretty soon, we were both hysterically laughing like a couple of dorks. ""Laughter really was the shortest distance between two people"" that day. Even though I probably should have been mad.... But why do that when @CAPS1 can just laugh about it? That's what life is all about, living. With this silly but funny memory, it'll stay with me forever. Especially now that @ORGANIZATION2 has moved away. It @MONTH1 seem stupid, but it was funny to us. I guess it really was one of those ""@CAPS1 had to be there"" kind of moments. But it reminds me of the good old days with @ORGANIZATION2. It's good to have memories filled with laughter. If @CAPS1 don't, your life can almost feel dull without it. Even if @CAPS1 laugh at just the smallest things in life. That's why to me anyways, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""."
723	21633	8	3	Many people believe that laughter can improve your life. Laughing lets out endorphins that give your body energy for daily activities. Relationships are usually better if both the people are happy. Happiness is like shaking up a soda bottle. Happy emotions build up in your body and when shaken, release with an explosion of positive emotions such as laughing. When I was born, my mother said that I was the most chubby baby in the world. As she said this, she laughed, in constant thought that I will eventually become a young adult. I giggled in the backseat of the car as we drove home together. I was taught by my mother, who laughed all the time until her eyes were full of tears, to laugh at every chance I had. Through my years as an infant, I giggled, chuckled, and laughed my way to adolescence. As I moved into adolescence, I was diagnosed with @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1, a mild autistic @CAPS1 that has a variation of side effects. Some people who have @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 develop cases where their emotions do not show physically. This case is similar to the physical features of @CAPS3 @CAPS1. My main case with having @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 is that I do not receive all the information given to me at one time. When people tell me a joke that they think is hilarious, I tend to miss the important parts of the joke, which are funny. As the joke comes to an end, everybody around me is laughing, but I am standing there with a blank look on my face. Sometimes I tell people I cannot laugh. Though I say this, I know it is not true. I can laugh, it is just really hard for me to find the right time. Most times, I laugh at a situation that really is not funny and everybody else has a blank gaze on their face. This usually makes me feel embarrassed and I don't feel normal. A lot of people tell me I look expressionless and then try to perk me up, or smile. I don't feel the need to smile, even in happy times in my life. I have not laughed enough, but have been learning in how to make bad situations into great and happy ones. Learning that at any moment I can laugh is important. Even if there is no joke being told, I can laugh. Most people would probably look a me in a weird way, but I wouldn't care because I am the one that feels happiness inside. Laughing relieves stress, makes other people feel good, and allows people with mental disabilities to feel more comfortable in the community they live in. I have finally learned that even with @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1, I can laugh just as much as anyone.
