Also the text said ""It was a close knit community of honest, hardworking imigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.""

When Narciso describes the way his parents struggled during the cold winters, yet they always let others in, shows a very caring mood in the memoir.

345	12171	5	3	I am proud of my Cuban heritage and the strong relationship I have with my family. Growing up, I was surrounded by love, laughter, and unforgettable memories in Cuba. My parents worked hard to provide for our family, and we lived in a beautiful house filled with warmth and happiness.  Leaving Cuba was a difficult decision, as I had to say goodbye to the place I called home and the people I loved. However, coming to America opened up new opportunities for me and my family.

346	12172	5	3	The mood in this memoir is happy. I think the mood is happy because Narciso Rodriguez was grateful for mostly everything in his life.

348	12174	5	3	A house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its trails, struggles, and happiness. The mood in the memoir was to show what family is, that its much more than blood. It's unity, friendship and laughter, its the tears, pain and heartache. Its about how you can start in the slums and work your way up but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, but about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happpness, and imagination come together in one unorganized way, but it doesnt mean that it won't have trails like racism that almost every minority has to deal with even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it. I deal with it to, I get called cracker and n**** on a daily baised, I dont know how I would get through it without family. Home is where we find solace and support in the face of adversity, where we draw strength and courage to face the challenges of the world. Family is the anchor that keeps us grounded and the light that guides us through the darkness. In the end, it is the love and bond we share with our family that truly makes a house a home.

354	12180	5	3	The mood that the author was trying to show was calm. I think that's what he was trying to show because Narciso is talking about his family and when he was growing up.

""Family"" to him didn't mean you were related but were loved and cared for by other and with that mindset he had a huge family. His parent left behind their lives in Cuba where they were both scientists and had friends and family there for their son.

866	12692	5	3	"The mood of this memoir is grateful and content. The author conveys this mood with his quotes that he puts in. ""I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That shows that the author did not care that much about house looks, price or its location. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family... [that it] had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" He is grateful for all the people that he now considers his ""family"". Also, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"". That is right in the quote that he is feeling grateful! The author also puts some phrases in parentheses, just to add a bit more, ""(after which I eternally grateful)"", ""(which I adore to this day)"". Those show he is happy and grateful with his life, and last this next quote shows that his ""family"" members were all grateful for each other. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"". The author's gratitude and contentment shine through in his memoir, highlighting the importance of family, sacrifice, and community in shaping his life and values."
867	12693	5	3	"The mood created by the essay is one of friendship and love. When the author's parents moved to the United States, they created a traditional home with the heart being the kitchen. ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" In the kitchen, celebrations, childhood, friends, and family formed the backdrop of their life. The author learned that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. The neighborhood they lived in consisted of many different cultures blending together to form a small community of honest, hard-working immigrants who helped each other in times of need. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family."" The immigrants gave up their lives in Cuba to move to the US for a better life for their children, despite not knowing the language or culture. The author will always be thankful to her parents for that reason. She cannot fully express her gratitude for their love and sacrifices when she was just a child, and for teaching her the importance of family and friends. The author states, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" They transformed it with love and friendship, leaving a lasting impact on her life."

Lastly, he tells us about how grateful he is that his parents brought him to a neighborhood that he would soon learn to love. This piece makes me think about and appreciate my family, and my home.  I am reminded of the laughter shared with friends over a warm meal, the support given during tough times, and the sense of belonging that comes with being surrounded by those who care for you.

Narciso explains the tragedies his parents had to face in order for him to live in his current location. So by reading the excerpt based on the poverty and struggles his family faced makes you feel sad for them. I also chose love. In the excerpt it states, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family.' And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" In the excerpt, the author explains the love he learned to form for the ""family"" in the neighborhood. Therefore, that's why I think love is another mood created by the author.

To me, that sentence was all about making people feel comfortable and at home. It put out a sense of family in the story. The feeling of love was easily put into the story at paragraph 2, when the author talked about his family. Especially where the author had said ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.

For example in paragraph 1 it says, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language Or culture...

Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish-speaking individuals who looked out for one another as if we were all part of one big extended family. The bonds we formed were strong and enduring, based on shared experiences, mutual support, and a deep sense of community. This taught me that family is not just about genetics, but about the connections we create with those around us who care for and support us through thick and thin. These relationships, built on love, trust, and respect, are what truly define the concept of family, transcending traditional definitions and boundaries. In my upbringing, I learned that family is not limited by blood, but by the strength of the bonds we forge with others in our lives."

In the memoir, paragraph @NUM2 ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" The last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about: love, loyalty and friendship. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM3 ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

Narciso Rodriguez thank his parents many times for moving to @LOCATION1 and giving up their lives in Cuba to give him a better life. He also thanks them for his childhood. He thank them for teaching him so many things as a child and the environment he grew up in. When the author says how his parents cooking was passed on to him he cuts away from the article specifically to thank his parents.

1093	12919	5	3	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author depicts a mood with distinct traits. One trait of the mood is selflessness and courage. It is shown in paragraph when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Would you be able to throw away your life into an alien world just so that your children would have a better future? Doing this would take lots of selflessness and courage. Also, the mood has gratefulness. The author shows this in paragraph when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.""

1097	12923	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it explains how your house can effect you as a child and when you grow up. The mood of this memoir to me is comforting. I think this because when the memoir said that he had plenty of relatives around, and freinds that probably made him feel comfortable. Also his parents were very welcoming and kind so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too. That is what I think the mood of the memoir is and why. The warmth and sense of belonging that comes from a supportive family and close-knit community can create a comforting environment that shapes a person's sense of security and well-being, both in childhood and throughout their life. This memoir highlights the importance of a nurturing home environment in fostering a sense of comfort and stability.

The walls echoed with laughter, stories of hope, and the aroma of homemade food that filled the air. It was a place where bonds were formed, memories were made, and love was the foundation that held everything together. This house may have been modest in size, but it was rich in warmth and hospitality, a true reflection of the love and compassion that filled our hearts. It was in this house that I learned the true meaning of family, not bound by blood, but by the connections we create with those who touch our lives in profound ways. Love was not just a word in this house; it was a feeling that enveloped us all, making us feel safe, cherished, and valued.

1102	12928	5	3	In the memoir, the mood created by the author I think was more of a serious, informative, and uplifting mood. The reason for why I think this is that the way his lifestyle is described as a happy and enjoyable life of also being able to talk about some serious topics like his culture and the diversity of the cultures of the people that live on the street. Also by how he feels so comfortable with all the people that are in his apartment building and all the people that come to his house for dinner to call them family. The author's ability to convey both the joys of community and the importance of cultural understanding creates a tone that is both enlightening and heartwarming, making the reader feel inspired and informed by his experiences.

His parents, who loved to cook, are still with him today, and for which I am eternally grateful. Passionate music, which he adores today. His neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants like his family. His mother and father had come to this country with such courage without any knowledge of the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.

The focus on family and happiness within the home is clear, with the author mentioning how his parents always had their arms and doors open for anyone in need. This welcoming attitude extended beyond blood relatives, as many people were invited to share meals with them, fostering a strong sense of community in their neighborhood. Surrounding themselves with Cuban food and music further emphasized their pride in their heritage and created a peaceful and harmonious environment in their new home."
1138	12964	5	3	The author reminisced about her childhood home, filled with love, warmth, and celebrations. Her parents, who emigrated from Cuba for a better life, instilled in her a love for cooking and family gatherings. The sounds of passionate Cuban music and the aroma of delicious food always lingered in the air. In this welcoming environment, family and friends gathered for endless celebrations, creating a peaceful and joyful atmosphere that defined her childhood.
1139	12965	5	3	"In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives the mood was very happy and made me thankful. My grandparents moved to the @CAPS2.S when my mom was just six. They wanted to give her and her brothers and sisters a better life. This is why I am thankful. I live in the @LOCATION1. The mood is also happy because everyone loved each other. They didn't have the nicest home, but it was full of love. The music was always playing and Family came a lot. The door was always open in the Rodriguez house. The last sentence in this memoir ""I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This made me smile it was so beautiful. This is how the mood was happy and made me thankful. The next time I see my grandparents I will make sure to thank them for moving to the @CAPS2.S and giving our Family a better life. I am grateful for the love and warmth that filled our home, and I will always cherish the memories we created together."
1140	12966	5	3	I beleive the mood that sets off in the beginning of the story is how in her house Cuban music and great aromas float through the air. It gives a picture of laughter and happiness. Throughout the story, it is evident that the narrator realizes through spending time with the community that his parents are teaching him a valuable lesson. Just because someone isn't blood related doesn't mean they can't be like family, as stated in the passage. The narrator's family is always open to taking care of people they love and those in need of help. The narrator soon realizes that all his family gave up from their old lives was to provide a nice home for him and teach him the true meaning of family.
1141	12967	5	3	In the memoir, the author sets the mood by describing his parents' humble living conditions in a poor neighborhood. They had immigrated to @LOCATION1, where the author, Narciso, was born and raised in a ghetto. The author recalls the difficult times of racism and segregation that characterized his upbringing. It wasn't until 1970 that Narciso finally got to meet his real grandparents, who had been living in Cuba until they were allowed to leave. Through these details, the author effectively conveys the challenging and somber atmosphere of his early life.
1142	12968	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is warm, grateful, and very palpable to the reader. One mood the author conveys very deeply is that of his love of his family. However, his ""family"" not only consisted of blood relatives, but also of the immigrants living in the neighborhood. He says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is obvious that the author feels very strongly about the good relationships his family had with the other immigrants around them. His mood is warm and compassionate as he talks about how much each one of his community was important to him. The next mood conveyed by the author is gratitude and admiration for his parents. In paragraph @NUM1, he talks about how he will be forever grateful for his parents' sacrifices and their hard work and the numerous times he has told them of his admiration for their strength and courage. However, he does not feel it is enough and says, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood shown in this quote is that of thankfulness, and even a small bit of frustration that he cannot fully express his gratitude towards his parents."
1143	12969	5	3	The mood is grateful because in Cuba, which has a central government, people had to sneak in. @CAPS2 felt grateful for what his parents did to give him a better life. I used to be like him; my parents took a plane to @LOCATION1 for a limited stay, but we ended up staying longer. We had nothing and no documents, but over the years, we obtained proper documentation and finally received the coveted green card. So, @CAPS2 was very grateful and honored his parents for their sacrifices and efforts.
1144	12970	5	3	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by himself from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the fashion designer reflects on his upbringing and the influence of his immigrant parents. Rodriguez, whose parents came from Cuba in 1956, describes how his neighborhood was a mix of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, fostering a sense of community and belonging. Despite the prevalent racism and segregation in the United States at that time, Rodriguez found solace and warmth in his diverse surroundings. He fondly recalls his family home, emphasizing the valuable lessons about love and relationships that he learned there. The mood created by these memories shapes Rodriguez's identity and influences his perspective on family and belonging.
1145	12971	5	3	The author creates many moods in the story. While reading this story I felt happy, sometimes sad and overall it made me feel good. The mood that the author is trying to sell is happiness and unity. Even though many cultures and ethnic backgrounds were in his neighborhood they all came together as one. Then at other times I felt sad because he grew up with racism still in America. The story makes me feel good because the author is trying to say that it is not the materialistic things that make you happy it is the family and friends that surround you every single day.
1146	12972	5	3	"The mood, or general atmosphere created in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez is happy, peaceful, and gratefulness.

""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" They didn't only consider blood relatives family. Many people were family to them. They always had each others backs and had many celebrations. Most of the time, it was just about a group of people who love each other having a good time with each other. The author was also grateful, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifices."" The author's parents moved to the @LOCATION1 to do what was best for their child. They had to find new jobs and give their child a happy life. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. From the family gatherings to the cultural exchanges, every corner of our humble abode was filled with love and joy."" Their home was a place of warmth and acceptance, where memories were created and cherished. The author's gratitude towards their parents for creating such a loving and welcoming environment is evident throughout the narrative."
1147	12973	5	3	"I believe there was more of a ""thank you"" in the memoir and here are three reasons. I think Narciso Rodriguez is thanking his parents for making him have a good childhood. Like in the excerpt ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Another reason I think he's thanking his parents is because he was praising them. In the excerpt ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done,"" Narciso is forever grateful to his parents. Like in the excerpt ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" These are the three ways the mood was more of a ""thank you"" kind of thing in the memoir."

1153	12979	5	3	The main mood that is portrayed by the author is coziness or family, because his parents gave up everything and came to the United States so that Narciso could have a great childhood and he did.

They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" The author is grateful because her parents came to the new country. But she is grateful because they didn't come for themselves, they came for her. They gave up everything they had for her.

1155	12981	5	3	"The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is very loving, grateful, and warm. Firstly, the way that Narciso describes his family and friends and home life is very endearing and clearly expresses the love that he had for the people around him and the building he lived in. The memoir states, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

This definitely shows how much he loved his family, home, and friends, and how they taught him how to care for and love others. It brings a great feeling of lovingness this to the reader. Another large contributor to the mood of the story is the gratefullness Narciso feels to have grown up in such a wonderful home.

In paragraph 1 it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.

The end of paragraph 2 states ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.

1162	12988	5	3	In this paragraph, I'm going to tell you the mood created by the author in the memoir I just read. One mood that the author had was happy. The reason why I said that is because every time he spoke about being Cuban or about his family, he spoke with this joy or pride in his voice. Also, when he was talking about Spanish, Italian, and Cuban all being like a family. Another mood he had was kind of sad. The reason why I say that is because when he was talking about how he couldn't meet his real grandparents until 1970. He sounded a little depressed about that. I also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir. Those are the moods that I think the author created during the memoir.

""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a warm, happy environment. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a friend or family member in the house. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and laughter and warmth, creates a positive influence that remains instilled in a person forever.

1267	13093	5	3	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents' hard work that shaped who he is today.  The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive one, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""   Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and courage they established themselves in a warm home. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home.  The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent but life and love."" The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author writes: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity within the community definitely distills a happy mood within the reader.  Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir."

He has often told them how courageous they are for letting people into their home. He loves them for their strength and perseverance and has thanked them repeatedly. But in reality, there is no way to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity and support they instilled in him at such an early age, and how he knows how important family and friends are.

The boy is thankful that his parents were able to preserve their Cuban heritage, not forgetting where they came from. However, there may also be an undercurrent of sadness, as he realizes that he was the reason for all the changes. If he had never been born, he might never have experienced the meaning of family. This memoir captures a mix of gratitude, love, and a touch of sadness.
1642	13468	5	3	The mood created in the author in the memoir was distinct from others due to their unique emotional fluctuations. While everyone experiences mood swings, some individuals exhibit consistent behavior that remains unchanged. It is essential to adapt how we interact with others based on their individual temperament, rather than assuming they will behave the same as friends. Understanding and accepting people for who they are can lead to more authentic and meaningful connections.
1643	13469	5	3	"The mood created in the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 is happy & warm. The memoir is happy & warm because it describes how a small home can be very happy like in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."" This shows that love fills the air which is happy. That is how the author creates a mood. The memoir captures the essence of a loving and joyful home, where the air is always filled with love and happiness."
1644	13470	5	3	"Home The Blueprints of our Lives is a warm tribute to the parents of Narciso Rodriguez. The author of this memoir had said, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso Rodriguez would change the way a reader would perceive this memoir. It would be a story of a young child who has perceived the physical and mental qualities of adults. Narciso Rodriguez acknowledges the troubles he and his parents are in. For his neighborhood including his family being immigrants, in a time of racism and segregation, he learned how to appreciate this ""close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants."" He understood how to Narciso Rodriguez Sr, and his mother struggled personally and financially. He became grateful for his opportunity to live in this Cuban home of Newark, New Jersey. Though his parents had worked in a laboratory and studied chemical engineering, they struggle to find work in financial times. Narciso adores them. The author writes, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Without these relationships, and the lives of various people, this memoir would be a selfish story of a child. Narciso appreciates everything the family has done. There was too much generosity impressed upon a boy of such an early age. He had learned how to respect his parents. In the end, Narciso Rodriguez would write a memoir devoted to the bonds he created with his parents and the refugees amongst them."
1645	13471	5	3	In this memoir, the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three: love, gratitude, and caring. The mood of love was established because the author emphasizes that family isn't solely blood relatives but can also include anyone who is loved. This idea resonates with the reader, evoking feelings of warmth and affection. Furthermore, the mood of gratitude surfaces as the author expresses his thankfulness for his parents' sacrifices, such as moving to a new town for his betterment. This sentiment of appreciation strikes a chord with readers who can relate to the selfless actions of their own parents. Lastly, the mood of caring emanates from the narrative as the author recounts how his family would offer support to those in need, allowing them to stay until they were able to stand on their own feet. This act of compassion showcases the family's nurturing nature, fostering a sense of empathy and kindness. Through these various moods, the author successfully conveys the depth of familial bonds and the importance of love, gratitude, and caring in our lives.
1646	13472	5	3	"In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez speaks with nothing but warm fondness and gratitude as she describes her childhood home.

Obviously, she is very grateful for everything her parents did for her and the chance for her to grow up in such a tender community - where ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The entire memoir is written with such care and attention to sweet detail. The author clearly feels blessed that her parents sacrificed their safety in their homeland to bring her to New York City in order for her to live a better life, to experience the importance of friends and family, and to learn about the true meaning of love through Cuban culture.

1648	13474	5	3	I think that the mood that the author created was unpleasant. Living in a one-room apartment suggests a sense of poverty, indicating that the protagonist may not have the means to afford a larger living space. This setting also implies a lack of resources, possibly in a town where access to food and other necessities is limited. The overall atmosphere painted by these details is one of hardship and struggle, contributing to a feeling of unease for the reader.
1649	13475	5	3	The mood in this memoir is one of gratitude. This is first seen in paragraph when he talks about cooking and Cuban music.

The mood in this memoir is gratitude and it is easiest to see in these paragraphs.
1650	13476	5	3	"The mood created by the author in the memoir could be strong to many people once they put it together. Narciso's parents started of in a home that meant nothing. However, Narciso's parents turned it into something great. In the last sentence of the memoir Narciso states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. What he was trying to explain was your home is what you make of it. That is what I believe the mood created by the author in the memoir is. The transformation of a humble dwelling into a warm and inviting home through the efforts and love of Narciso's parents resonates deeply, emphasizing the idea that home is truly what one makes of it."
