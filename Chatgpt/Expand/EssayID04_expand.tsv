Then when she saw it in the United States she was surprised that it grew in a pot. For example she described the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent."" This is why she concluded the story like this; because of how she felt about the plant."
55	8917	4	3	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows Saeng's passion for gardening. How she's willing to take the test is to see if her plants can grow when spring comes around and the hibiscus starts to bud she will attempt to grow it which shows how anxious Saeng is for gardening and to try and get the hibiscus to grow during the spring. Saeng's determination and dedication to her plants highlight her deep love for gardening and her desire to see them flourish in the upcoming season.
56	8918	4	3	The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.
57	8919	4	3	"Change and disappointment can be overwhelming for some people, especially when they come all at once. Saeng, the main character in ""Winter Hibiscus,"" faces both when she moves to @LOCATION1 and fails her driver's exam. Feeling helpless and lost in her new surroundings, Saeng finds solace in a winter hibiscus plant she purchases. She makes a promise to herself to retake the driving test when the plant blooms in the spring. The resilience of the winter hibiscus and the hope it represents inspire Saeng to not give up and try again. The plant serves as a symbol of renewal and the possibility of starting fresh, giving Saeng the strength to face her fears and embrace change. By holding on to this hope, Saeng learns to navigate through the challenges in her life and find the courage to move forward."
58	8920	4	3	I think the author wanted to express Saeng's emotions when he made a vow and to convey the depth of his feelings. The statement was likely included to pique the interest of readers and enhance their understanding of the character. This helps to create a more engaging and immersive reading experience.
59	8921	4	3	For shadowing, future reference, and continuous behavior are all reasons why the last paragraph is significant. Saeng makes a promise to herself to retake a test in the future, referencing the return of spring, the melting snow, and the blooming hibiscus. This statement foreshadows her actions and indicates her commitment to maintaining her behavior in the upcoming year. The repetition of this cycle demonstrates her determination and sets the stage for future developments in the story.
60	8922	4	3	"I believe that the author concludes the story like this to show a sense of continuation in life. In the story Saeng takes a test and fails. She goes out and buys a hibiscus plant for well over what she should have paid for it. Her test is to try to get over the memories of her real home that Saeng now only cries about when she thinks of it. To Saeng, the plant represents memories and a life that she once had but no longer does, however, she does want it back. Her vow to herself is that when the geese come flying back over her, she will go back to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of her home and try once again to say ""home"" without breaking down and without having something extremely expensive."
61	8923	4	3	"In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice, it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story, Saeng's longing for her homeland is overpowering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus are obviously painful and part of her everyday life. Saeng is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are some things she doesn't need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive; she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentence of the story is so empowering because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together: memory and change. ""When this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again."""
62	8924	4	3	"The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country. Saeng missed her home. It was hard for her to say her countryís home without crying. ""Itís not like the wind we had at-at-."" She also spent $1 on a plant because it reminds her of back at home. One could infer she adapted because she was familiar with the season change and it states when the geese return she is going to take the test again. Saeng's willingness to embrace the changes in her new environment and her determination to continue pursuing her goals demonstrate her growing resilience and adaptability in her new home."
63	8925	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes Saeng feel more at home. For example it say, ""the snow melt, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" I think the author says this because all the thing in that sentence remind her of home. For example the plant the geese are things she had at home, so when winter is over she will feel better and take the test."
64	8926	4	3	The reason why the author ended with Saeng vowed is because she is very committed. She failed the first time but now she really wants to pass it, so she is waiting until the snow melts and the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. When all these signs appear, she will come back and give it another try.
65	8927	4	3	I think that the author concluded the story like that because of who throw out the whole Story the plot was in the winter. She might wanted to try it in a different season to see if she might do better with the hot situation. That is why I think the author concluded the story like that.
66	8928	4	3	"I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more. For example, she added ""hibiscus is budding."" Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it."
67	8929	4	3	In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, I will take that test again. Just like the changing seasons, there is always a chance for new beginnings. Whether it's a failed test or a missed opportunity, I will not give up. I will keep trying until I succeed, just like waiting for the perfect moment when everything falls into place. The key is to have patience and determination, knowing that with each new attempt, there is a possibility for a fresh start.
68	8930	4	3	"In this story Saeng shows her mother how passionate she is about planting and her love for plants. She expresses her dedication by stating, ""I will try this test again,"" indicating her willingness to persist until she achieves the desired results. This determination highlights Saeng's genuine enthusiasm for gardening, as she is willing to put in the effort to perfect her skills and nurture her plants. Her commitment to improving and her unwavering passion for planting are evident in her words, demonstrating the depth of her connection to this fulfilling hobby."
69	8931	4	3	"The author concludes that the individual in the paragraph demonstrates a strong sense of confidence and determination, as evidenced by the statement, ""then I will take that test again."" This assertion reflects a willingness to persevere and try again even in the face of initial failure. This attitude of persistence and self-assurance suggests that the individual is motivated and confident in their abilities, willing to tackle challenges head-on with a positive outlook on future success."
70	8932	4	3	I took a deep breath and looked out at the vast ocean before me. The salty breeze tangled my hair as I watched the sun dip below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the water. Despite the setbacks and challenges I had faced, I knew deep down that I had not given up on my dreams. As the sky turned pink and orange, filling me with a sense of hope and determination, I made a silent promise to myself to keep pushing forward, no matter what obstacles may come my way. With a renewed sense of purpose, I set my sights on the future, ready to chase after my dreams with unwavering passion and resilience.
71	8933	4	3	"Hope, a new beginning, and adjustment are all reasons why the speaker concludes by saying, ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The hibiscus flower gives the girl hope as it reminds her of her grandmother and home, where things were wonderful. By seeing the flower blooming, she realizes that beauty can exist in her current surroundings too. In the spring, she will have a fresh start, adjusting to her new environment, making new friends, and creating new memories. The hibiscus will continue to bring her hope and comfort as she navigates through these changes."
72	8934	4	3	The author is saying that sheís not doing nothing until it is a nice day outside. She wants the weather to be not too cold, but also not too hot, so that she can come out and play with her children. She mentions that she will wait and take her time until a perfect day comes along for her to enjoy the outdoors with her family.
73	8935	4	3	"The author ends the story with this conclusion to show that Saeng is very passionate about connecting her life in the United States to how life was in Vietnam and bringing them together somehow. In the story, Saeng talks about how she misses home and how she is still trying to adapt to her new life away from the home she knew. When Saeng says that she has failed the test and wants to take it again, she means that she wants to show that she can survive in the United States without disappointing her mother. When Saeng spent $100 on a plant, her mom was in disbelief because Saeng knows how hard it is to survive. When the conclusion says, ""I will take the test again,"" it shows that Saeng is willing to try to make it in the United States from Vietnam, proving that she can make a better life for herself and her family by working hard. While still keeping traditions in Vietnam alive, Saeng simply wanted to make her new home feel like Vietnam by buying a plant she knew her mother would like."
74	8936	4	3	As he gathered his thoughts and reflected on his mistakes, he knew that this was not the end of his journey. With renewed determination, he made a plan to study harder, seek help when needed, and approach the test with a different mindset. Failure was not an option this time. He was ready to rise from the ashes and conquer the challenges that lay ahead. This setback was just a stepping stone towards his ultimate success, and he was determined to make the most of it. With a sense of purpose and a new perspective, he set out on his path to redemption, ready to prove to himself and others that he was capable of achieving greatness.
75	8937	4	3	"The author had concluded her paragraph with emotion, expressing her disappointment in not being able to garden during the winter when all her plants die. However, she finds solace in knowing that spring, or ""saeng,"" will come back. She anticipates the end of the snow, frosts, and cold weather so she can resume her gardening activities. By stating, ""I will take the test again"" saeng, she implies that she is ready to face the challenges of tending to her garden and nurturing her plants alongside her mother in the next season. This cycle of growth and renewal brings hope and a sense of purpose to her gardening endeavors."
76	8938	4	3	I think that the author concludes the paragraph as his ending because that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year - staying with her mother and helping out in the garden. The girl will have no friends to distract her, just her mother for company. This simple and peaceful life of tending to the garden with her mother will be her focus and source of comfort in the coming days.
77	8939	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng has found strength from the hibiscus plant. Like the plant, Saeng is determined to overcome her obstacles. She will try the driving test again, just as the plant will persevere through the harsh winter months and bloom beautifully in the spring. Saeng, too, will overcome the adversity she faced when she failed her driving test and realized how much she missed her homeland. The hibiscus serves as a reminder to her of resilience and perseverance. Saeng will bloom like the Winter Hibiscus, learning to overcome obstacles and find happiness despite the challenges she faces.
78	8940	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is going to accept her new home and recognize the similarities from her old home and hold memories close to help her overcome obstacles that she is facing in life. ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters."" This sets similarities from their old home to their new home. This shows that things do change but they are also the same. This leads to the conclusion because this is where Saeng realizes that she will always have the memories of her old home and will use them to help her overcome the troubles she's going through."
79	8941	4	3	"The author ends the story the way she did to show how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are alike and how Saeng will overcome her obstacle when the plant overcomes its obstacle. Saeng's obstacle is adjusting to her new life, and the first step in that is passing her driver's test. The reader knows she has to pass because Saeng tells her mother, ""I-I failed the test."" The hibiscus must make it through the winter, it also has to adjust to new surroundings to survive, just like Saeng. The mother says to Saeng, ""but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters."" So, if the winter hibiscus's job, or hurdle that it has to jump, is to make it, to stay alive during the winter months, then its job will be done in the spring. The author ends the story with Saeng telling herself, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" If Saeng's obstacle is completing and passing the driver's test, and she passes in the spring, right as the hibiscus passes its ""test,"" the symbolism between the two, showing a determined spirit to adapt, will grow deeper because they will both adapt and pass their obstacles at the same time."
80	8942	4	3	I think that the story came back to this because that is what the story starts off with. It all started with Saeng going to take a test but she did not pass it. So when the weather is better she would have a batter time trying to pass that test. This is way I think she came back that the test. Additionally, Saeng had studied hard for the test and was determined to do her best. The test was important for her future, so it was natural for her to focus on it. The outcome of the test would have a significant impact on her academic and personal life, which is why she kept coming back to it in her thoughts. Despite the initial setback, Saeng was determined to persevere and eventually succeed in passing the test. This determination and focus on her goal drove her to keep revisiting the test in her mind, reflecting on what went wrong and how she could improve. Ultimately, the test served as a pivotal moment in Saeng's journey, shaping her character and propelling her towards success.
81	8943	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspense: wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test.
82	8944	4	3	"When they arrived back home, Saeng knew that her journey was far from over. She had faced many challenges and grown stronger through them, but she still had one more hurdle to overcome - retaking the test. With determination in her heart, Saeng declared, ""Then I will take the test again."" She was not content to settle for anything less than success. Saeng knew that her personal growth would continue, and she was ready to face whatever lay ahead. The next chapter in Saeng's story was yet to be written, and she was prepared to seize it with unwavering resolve."
83	8945	4	3	The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring. An example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family, and also in the winter, the hibiscus leaves will die, and then in the spring, they will have a new start. I think the author uses this paragraph last because it’s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start, and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life.
84	8946	4	3	Saeng watched as the geese returned, flying in formation overhead. Their honking filled the air, signaling the changing of the seasons. As she looked out at the hibiscus plant, she felt a renewed sense of hope and determination. The winter would pass, and with it, her chance to pass the driving test would come again. Spring was a time of renewal and birth, and Saeng knew that she too would have the opportunity to start fresh and try again. With faith and encouragement, she would face the test once more, ready to overcome any challenges that came her way. The geese and the hibiscus plant were a reminder that with perseverance and belief in oneself, anything was possible. Saeng smiled, feeling a sense of peace and readiness for the journey ahead.
85	8947	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to say that he will wake up in springtime when the snow melts and geese return. Also, I think that the author likes the setting of spring to see the sunny skies and geese floating in a pond. I also would like that setting because it gives me more ideas, and it's a very lovely setting to be around. That is why I think the author picked that paragraph to conclude the story. In the end, the anticipation of spring and the return of nature's beauty provide a sense of hope and renewal.
86	8948	4	3	"The short story, Winter Hibiscus, is about a girl who moved with her mother to a new location. The story follows the girl's struggle to adapt to a different culture. Throughout the narrative, there are references to a test that the girl must pass. At the end of the story, the girl mentions taking the test again in the spring. This suggests that she needs to learn to navigate change and embrace her new surroundings. When the girl describes the winter hibiscus plant as ""not a real one,"" it reflects her longing for her home and the memories associated with it. Additionally, her preference for her own culture over foreign fast food like the Big Mac highlights her difficulty in fully integrating into the new environment. Ultimately, the girl's test may involve finding a balance between her past and present, embracing change, and cherishing her memories with a sense of contentment rather than sorrow."
87	8949	4	3	The author concludes the story with that ending because he wanted to show the reader that if you just try, you might like it. This is why the girl said she would come back next spring when the snows melt so she can take the test again. This highlights the importance of perseverance and not giving up after initial setbacks. It also signifies the girl's determination and willingness to improve, which are valuable traits in achieving success. By coming back to retake the test, she demonstrates a growth mindset and a positive attitude towards challenges. Ultimately, the author's choice to end the story in this way conveys a message of resilience, optimism, and the belief that with effort and persistence, one can overcome obstacles and achieve their goals.
88	8950	4	3	Carefully, Saeng picked up the flower she had bought from the shop and smiled. She closed her eyes and breathed in deeply, the familiar fragrance filling her lungs. Memories of Vietnam flooded back to her, connecting her past with her present in the United States. The flower she held in her hands was more than just a simple purchase; it was a bridge between two worlds, reminding her of where she came from and where she was now. As she stood there, enveloped in the comforting scent, Saeng felt a sense of peace and belonging wash over her. In that moment, she knew that no matter where life took her, she would always carry a piece of her homeland with her, symbolized by the delicate bloom in her grasp.
89	8951	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it's telling us that Saeng is going to try to pass the test in the spring. Getting that hibiscus reminded her of her homeland and gave her memories of then. It also made her believe in herself and want to try again. The author mentions ""when snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" to help indicate that it's going to be spring when she tries to take her test again. This symbolizes a new beginning for Saeng, filled with hope and determination to succeed."
90	8952	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to leave readers with a sense of hope and determination. Despite the setbacks and failures the protagonist faced, she remains resilient and determined to try again. This ending emphasizes the character's perseverance and willingness to keep pursuing her goals, no matter the obstacles in her way. It serves as a reminder that failure is not the end, but rather a stepping stone towards future success. The author's decision to end the story on this note reinforces the theme of resilience and the importance of never giving up on one's dreams.
91	8953	4	3	The author concludes the story the way that they did to signify that the girl will not give up trying to pass her test and will adapt to her new found home and make it what her home in Vietnam was to her. The girl is reminiscent of her past life and wishes to go back and have the life she had in her home country. When she is finally able to pass her test and feels more comfortable in her new surroundings, she begins to realize that she can create a new home filled with memories and warmth just like the one she left behind. With determination and a positive attitude, she knows that she can make the best of her situation and find happiness in her new home.
92	8954	4	3	"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says ""when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" (Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."
93	8955	4	3	After Saeng fails her driverís test, she gives up hope for the future. The sight of the hibiscus plant reminds her to never give up, no matter how tough the situation. In the story, Saengís mother says, ìIts flowers arenít as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thatís what matters.î This quote shows how even though its not an object of beauty, it can do what it takes to survive. Saeng feels that she is also like the hibiscus, having the strength to be able to survive in a new environment. Even though she is new to this country, Saeng had proved that no matter how big the situation, anything can be overcomed if you believe in yourself and your family. The hibiscus plant serves as a symbol of resilience and determination, inspiring Saeng to face her challenges head-on and continue moving forward with a positive attitude. By drawing strength from the winter hibiscus, Saeng learns to persevere and never lose hope in the face of adversity. Just like the resilient plant, she too can weather the storms of life and emerge stronger on the other side.
94	8956	4	3	I failed the test. The geese were flying south for the winter, and the hibiscus was blooming when I should have been studying. But next year will be different. I will be prepared. I will take the test again, and this time, I will succeed. The sight of the geese flying overhead and the vibrant hibiscus will serve as a reminder of my determination to do better. This time next year, I will be ready.
95	8957	4	3	The author concludes the end of the story the way he/she did because it shows how much the plant truly means. S'aeng is going to wait till the flower blooms because it means so much to her. The flower represents her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is ready to bloom, she will be ready to drive. The plant gives her hope for a new tomorrow, a new chance. The last paragraph helps the reader realize how much the plant means to the girl, its significance. It makes her feel more at home, and her home makes her feel stranger; makes her joyful and happy after the misery of failing the driving test. It symbolizes her resilience and determination, her ability to find solace and strength in the simple beauty of nature. The hibiscus plant becomes a source of comfort and motivation for S'aeng, reminding her that even after setbacks, there is always the potential for growth and renewal. Ultimately, the plant serves as a powerful metaphor for S'aeng's own journey towards self-discovery and success.
96	8958	4	3	She concludes with this the story this paragraph because she wants @DATE1 to come again. She says ìwhen the snow meltsî. She wants to look at the events again and take care of them. She eagerly anticipates revisiting the memories when the snow melts, reflecting on the past and addressing any unresolved issues. Her invitation for @DATE1 to return hints at a desire to confront the past, learn from it, and move forward with a renewed perspective. The melting snow symbolizes a fresh start and the opportunity for growth and healing. So, she waits for @DATE1 to return, ready to face whatever challenges or revelations may come their way.
97	8959	4	3	In this short story, Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring because she knows that she will be able to pass it once she has accepted living in this new place. After Saeng moved, she was very upset and missed her old home, family, and lifestyle. This prevented her from focusing on the test. However, once she realized that the flowers are beautiful in her new home too, she began to accept the changes. The geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. Saeng also probably made this vow because she didn't want her mother to be disappointed in her again. After seeing her mother's disappointment and loving kindness, Saeng was determined to pass the test. When Saeng takes the test again in the spring, she will be ready because she has adjusted to and accepted her new life.
98	8960	4	3	The author concludes their story with the paragraph because in the beginning of the story, her family moved to the United States from Vietnam. Saeng was walking home from failing her driver's test when she saw a familiar plant. Later, she went to a florist shop to see if the plant could be purchased. She got the plant seeds and planted them so that when they start to bloom, she will go to her driving test she failed. In the end, she used the flowers for good luck. This connection between the plant and her failed test ties the story together, emphasizing the theme of perseverance and hope in the face of challenges.
99	8961	4	3	"The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obstacles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become... almost familiar to her now"" & this is saying she is getting used to the changes in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas."
100	8962	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story with the paragraph for a few reasons. One reason is that she is trying to overcome change and wants to make the situation better. She tries doing that by taking the test again. The author also concludes with the paragraph because she feels heartbroken that life is not going her way and that she needs to do something about it. That's why the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show you if she is determined or not. If she will stick through it or not. In this way, the author leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation and curiosity about what the future holds for the protagonist and whether she will be able to overcome the challenges she faces."
101	8963	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country. This is a good way to leave off the story because you donít know if she will or not; it leaves you on a cliffhanger. I also think this is a good way to leave it off because he could write a sequel to it and make a series out of it.
102	8964	4	3	The author concludes this with the story because the snow is pretty and geese are animals that make it pretty so they want you to think that our outdoors is the nices thing around. The peaceful sight of geese gracefully gliding across a pristine blanket of snow serves as a reminder of the beauty that can be found in the natural world. Their presence enhances the picturesque landscape, making it a truly captivating scene. This story aims to evoke a sense of appreciation for the outdoors and all the wonders it has to offer. So, next time you see a flock of geese in the snow, take a moment to admire the beauty of nature that surrounds us.
103	8965	4	3	"The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph to show Saeng starting over. In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, it connects to her life, as she is starting fresh in a way. Although she may miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine-toothed comb, she is making an effort to ""take that test again."" By retaking the test, she shows that she is not ready to give in to feelings of loss and grief. Saeng is determined to move forward and embrace the new beginning that lies ahead."
104	8966	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows all of this stuff going on will probably come back up again. Just like how he said the geese will come back every year, so he is definitely saying that all of this will come back up. That is what I think.
105	8967	4	3	I think that the author made that the concluding sentence because it means that when Saeng is ready then she will take the test again. I think that she is comparing herself to the snow, the snow the geese, and the hibiscus. I think so because she says that when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. So I think that she is saying that she is not ready for the test and when she does get ready then that is when she will take it.
106	8968	4	3	The author's conclusion to the story shows how Saeng interpreted the experience of that day. She uses a springtime setting to show when her confidence in herself is reborn. Seeing her hibiscus bud in the spring will give herself newfound integrity to go try that driving test again. As the season changes and new life begins to bloom, Saeng feels a sense of renewal and determination to overcome her previous challenges. With a fresh perspective and a rejuvenated spirit, she is ready to face the road ahead and tackle the driving test with a newfound sense of self-assurance. The hibiscus bud serves as a symbol of hope and growth, inspiring Saeng to believe in herself and her abilities. In this season of new beginnings, she is determined to succeed and prove to herself that she is capable of achieving her goals.
107	8969	4	3	Hope, positivity, and helpfulness are evident in the way the author concludes the story. Saeng's decision to retake the test shows her sense of hope as she looks towards a better future. Additionally, her positive attitude is reflected in her gesture of buying a flower to replace the dead ones and her determination to try again in the spring. Furthermore, Saeng's helpful nature is highlighted through her actions of digging a hole for the new flower for her mother and her understanding of her mother's disappointment.

That's what matters."" Saeng is the winter hibiscus that's strong enough to make it through winter and failing the test won't matter until spring when she will take it and pass. That's represented when the hibiscus is in bloom. I also think the story ended this way because it ties in Saeng's feelings throughout the story of her new home and old home.

136	8998	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because heís trying to prove his point. I think that Saeng was comparing herself to the flower. For example the flower was originally a wild flower and then and then it was planted in a pot. Saeng was free happy girl but then she had to move to @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng feel like they are out of place. Since in the story Saeng is similar to the flower then at the end then at the end of the story I think that Saeng thinks that if the flower can survive the winter then she can survive @LOCATION1 and she can pass the test.

139	9001	4	3	@CAPS2, memories, and hard @CAPS1 all play significant roles in why the author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test.

Secondly, the memories of her grandmother evoke strong emotions, motivating Saeng to honor her legacy through her actions. Additionally, the hardships her grandmother endured serve as a reminder of the sacrifices made for her, inspiring Saeng to persevere. Therefore, the decision to end the story with Saeng's resolution to retake the test encapsulates the themes of resilience, remembrance, and gratitude that permeate the narrative.
140	9002	4	3	The author includes the last paragraph to show that she still has hope.

When spring comes, so will a new beginning, not only for Saeng's plant but also for her life in a different country. This demonstrates that even in the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope for a brighter future.

After reading that statement, I realized saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus bidding) the author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working toward her goal and wonít give up. ìSaeng  vowed silently to herself, ìI will take that test againî. Finally, I think the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how they want. For example, I know saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, however, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again.
143	9005	4	3	The girl's journey to obtain her driver's license was like the cycle of the geese and the hibiscus.

145	9007	4	3	The author concludes the story the way that she does because it shows Saengís willingness to adapt to her surroundings, just like the hibiscus. Saeng needs to adapt to her new home in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the upcoming winter. Saeng vows to herself, îWhen the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddingÖî @CAPS1 from this, you can tell that Saeng has hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was very reluctant to accept her home. She says of the hibiscus, ìitís not like the kind we had before.î But she realized that the hibiscus could be a reminder of home as well as a reminder to change for her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could survive living somewhere new. Saengís determination to adapt and thrive, just like the hibiscus, shows her strength and resilience in the face of change.
146	9008	4	3	The author concludes this story with the promise Saeng made to herself to take the test again, come springtime, because Saeng is having trouble adapting to her new home, and she won't give up on fitting in after only one failure.

The hibiscus and other familiar flowers she found comforted her, because they reminded her of home. At springtime when the geese return and the hibiscus starts blooming, Saeng will feel ready again to take the test, the spring represents the chance for another try, and a new beginning. The scent of the hibiscus and the sound of the geese flying overhead will serve as a reminder of her determination to succeed and find her place in her new surroundings.

Just as the geese will return when the time is right, Saeng will have another chance to prove herself when the season changes, hopeful for a better outcome.
148	9010	4	3	I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant represents being determined to survive. In other words, the hibiscus brings Saeng good luck for her next driving test after the winter season when the hibiscus is budding. Also, the reason why the author concluded the sentence to show what her plan for the future.

151	9013	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. In this story, it's about a girl named Lily and her mother. Lily is given $10 to buy plant seeds. She spends the money on this plant.

154	9016	4	3	I believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think that the author will feel more comfortable and ready to take the test. I was able to come to this conclusion because by waiting for winter to be over to take the test again, she is giving herself time to prepare. Also, she is waiting for the hibiscus plant to bud. Something I was able to extract from the fact that she wants to wait for the hibiscus is the presence of comfort, the whole story revolves around how Saeng was able to comfort herself by reminiscing on her past experiences in Vietnam. When she feels that an important part of her life is returning, that she can become comfortable and focused. I think the author would conclude the story with this paragraph is because the author wants to stress the importance of this flower involving how Saeng lives her life.
155	9017	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show she has hope. She believes that she can pass the test when everything is back to normal, in the spring.

The hibiscus serves as a comforting presence for Saeng, bridging the gap between her past and present. Additionally, the sight of geese flying overhead in the familiar ""V"" shape brings a sense of belonging and familiarity to Saeng's new surroundings. These small connections to her past give Saeng the strength and resolve to face the challenges ahead, including retaking her driving test. With each passing day, Saeng is growing more accustomed to her new life in the United States, proving to herself that she can adapt and thrive in this new environment."
158	9020	4	3	I think that the author put that sentence to get a little personal with the character so you can relate to that person. The mention of the character's inner thoughts and emotions helps to create a connection between the reader and the character, making the story more engaging and relatable. This personal touch allows readers to empathize with the character and become more invested in the narrative, ultimately enhancing the overall reading experience.
159	9021	4	3	As the geese flew overhead, their honking echoing through the clear spring sky, she felt a sense of renewal wash over her. Just like the changing of the seasons, she knew that she too could embrace a fresh start. The geese served as a reminder that with each new beginning, there is a chance to overcome past challenges and grow. And as she watched them disappear into the distance, she felt a newfound determination to tackle the driversí test once more. Spring had arrived, bringing with it a sense of hope and opportunity, and she was ready to seize it with both hands.
160	9022	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author Minfong Ho concludes the story with that paragraph because it was a way of saying she's going to forget about what happened in the past with her failing her test and she's going to do better the next time. It's like the author is saying she will be reborn again like the hibiscus when the spring comes. Through the story, Saeng had to adjust just like the hibiscus. And the hibiscus inspired Saeng to do well where she's at. So it's a new beginning for Saeng, after all her learning from the hibiscus. With this newfound inspiration and determination, Saeng is ready to face her challenges and strive for success in the future, just like the hibiscus blooming anew in the spring."
161	9023	4	3	Itís kind of like a theme for the story. The hibiscus inspire her to want to do things. I guess it brings memories of her home country and makes her want to try new things. This is significant to the story because it shows you how important the hibiscus was to Saeng. The vibrant colors and delicate petals of the hibiscus flowers reminded Saeng of the lush landscapes and warm, tropical climate of her homeland. Each time she saw a hibiscus, it stirred up a sense of nostalgia and longing for her past life. This emotional connection to the flower motivated Saeng to step out of her comfort zone and embrace new opportunities, just like she did back home. The hibiscus became a symbol of courage and resilience for Saeng, guiding her through unfamiliar experiences and reminding her of the strength she carried within. As the story unfolds, the hibiscus serves as a constant source of inspiration for Saeng, pushing her to pursue her dreams and overcome challenges with grace and determination. In essence, the hibiscus not only represents Saengís cultural heritage but also acts as a driving force behind her personal growth and transformation.
162	9024	4	3	The author chose to end the story in this way to show that the girl finds solace in the flower, bringing her a sense of peace and nostalgia. By remembering her past and focusing on this small, simple beauty, she is able to find happiness amidst the challenges of her life. This ending emphasizes the idea that even in difficult times, there is always something that can bring comfort and joy, allowing us to find moments of tranquility and contentment.
163	9025	4	3	She knows that passing this test is crucial for her future success, and she is determined to make it happen. With unwavering dedication and a strong will, she is ready to put in the hard work and effort required to achieve her goal. No matter how challenging the test may be, she is prepared to face it head-on and overcome any obstacles in her way. Failure is not an option for her; she will keep pushing forward until she finally conquers the test and emerges victorious. This mindset of perseverance and determination will surely lead her to success, and she is not going to give up until she reaches her ultimate goal.
164	9026	4	3	The reason why I feel the author ended the story with this paragraph is because she is showing how the character has matured and grown in her circumstances. This shows that because you failed once doesn't mean you're going to fail again. It's okay to feel out of place; there will always be a time in life where a new beginning is going to start, so it is your choice to take that chance or be stuck in your own ways. The decision is always up to you.
165	9027	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, Saeng vows silently to herself that she will retake the driving test in the spring when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. Despite failing the test, Saeng is determined to try again. The symbolism of the geese returning north and the hibiscus budding represents starting over and trying again. Saeng is inspired by the resilience of nature and understands that failure is a part of the journey to success. Minfong ends the story with this quote to emphasize the importance of perseverance and hard work in achieving one's goals. Success can only be achieved through dedication and the willingness to keep trying, even after facing setbacks. Saeng's determination to try again reflects the author's belief that resilience and commitment are key qualities of a strong individual."
166	9028	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the paragraph with that sentence is because he wants to let the reader know that it's not over. He wants the reader to know @ORGANIZATION1 will not forget. And also that all this will happen again. It serves as a warning and a reminder that the issues discussed in the paragraph are ongoing and will continue to affect the organization in the future. The author wants to emphasize the importance of staying vigilant and proactive in addressing these challenges to prevent them from recurring. This statement leaves a sense of urgency and a call to action for the reader to take the necessary steps to prevent history from repeating itself.
167	9029	4	3	The author concludes the ending as ìI will take that test againî meaning that the things she going through now is going to happen again but next time she will be prepared. Saeng has a very difficult time moving to another country and getting comfortable in the place the mother supports her as she goes through winter. The hibiscus that she bought is a symbol that represents more than itself. In this text of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the hibiscus that she bought when she was in the worst time, she went through winter with the hibiscus. At the last paragraph of the story, it expresses ìwhen the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddingî she is thinking of the future and how she ìSaeng vowed silently to herself in the spring. She canít wait until winter is over and is just waiting for the spring to come. Saeng has found solace and hope in the hibiscus, and she looks forward to the new beginnings that the spring will bring.
168	9030	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does once she gets back in the spring. That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants. When she gets back she wants the snow to melt and everything. That is what the author is telling me from the story.
169	9031	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to ensure the reader that she will say again. Also, the author concludes the story this way to show the reader that no matter where you go in life it will always be something and or someone their to assure you of everything. The author also wanted the reader to feel a sence of similarity to the character meaning no matter how out of place you feel its always something you can relate to.

171	9033	4	3	"In this story, the author decides to end the story with this paragraph, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Saeng wants to take the test when everything is in its natural state, for example, she desires to have everything she likes in her environment, such as the flowers, the geese, and the weather. Additionally, the author ends the story with that paragraph because Saeng longs to be in an environment similar to her home country where there was no snow, and it was like springtime all year round. This is why the author chose to conclude the story in this manner."
172	9034	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, that cannot pass the test until it is. ìalmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of before had become through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. This shows how much she really does believe in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants because she is thinking back to other times where things have been strange during the winter and better in the spring and summer seasons when the plants are budding, so she believes that she will actually pass the drivers test when she feels comfortable, when the plants have budded.
173	9035	4	3	The geese flying south for the winter and the hibiscus budding are normal things to Saeng. Saeng wanted to have the geese and hibiscus there to feel more comfortable while taking her driving test. Saeng still longs for home and does not quite feel like she fits in the U.S. The hibiscus gives her that comfort feeling like she is home again, in Vietnam. Saeng still feels homesick because she wants things to be how they were. The plants in the greenhouse, along with the disappointment of failing her driving test, bring her to the emotional state that she was in. In the second to last paragraph, the author talks about the feeling of repetition Saeng has when seeing the V formation. Saeng feels that in the winter, she will not have the same comfort feeling as when she can see the hibiscus and the geese flying overhead. It says when Saeng arrived in the U.S., she had nothing that was familiar to her. Now she gets that feeling from the geese and plants. The author concludes by saying Saeng will take her driving test when the winter ends, giving insight into what Saeng is going to do.
174	9036	4	3	"I think the author concludes the sentence then they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" is that because it was winter and the school was closed. When the geese come back it will be spring, so it will be time to go back to school. I think that's the reason."
175	9037	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with an odd ending. ""When they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again."" This signifies Saeng's willingness to adapt to the new country, as failing her driver's test symbolized her struggle to accept the change. By vowing to try again, she shows her determination to give the country another chance. ""She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home..."" indicates that Saeng still holds onto her past and hasn't fully embraced the new place as her home yet. This suggests that she is in a transitional phase, trying to find her place in the unfamiliar surroundings."
176	9038	4	3	Saeng was disappointed when she failed the first time, but she didn't let that stop her. Instead of giving up, she decided to try again. With determination in her heart, she knew that she wouldn't let one setback define her. Saeng was resilient and refused to be held back by fear of failure. She understood that success often comes after facing challenges and obstacles. Saeng was ready to persevere and keep pushing forward, no matter what hurdles came her way. Failure was just a temporary setback for her, not the end of her journey. Saeng's story was far from over; she was determined to keep pursuing her dreams until she succeeded.
177	9039	4	3	"The last sentence of the story, ""I will take that test again,"" highlights the girl's strong determination to succeed. This determination emphasizes the theme of new beginnings, as she plans to retake the test in the spring, symbolizing a fresh start in her life. This ending leaves the reader with a sense of hope and resilience, showcasing the protagonist's unwavering spirit in the face of challenges."
178	9040	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" made a good choice to conclude the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become ""almost familiar to her now."" The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng's life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her ""obstacle,"" and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saeng's life will have come full circle. In this way, the author effectively ties together the themes of change, adaptation, and growth in Saeng's journey, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and resolution for her future."
179	9041	4	3	When the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. It will be a moment of truth, a chance to see how much I have grown and learned since the last time. The anticipation builds as I prepare myself mentally and emotionally for the challenge that lies ahead. With each passing day, I feel more determined and focused, ready to face whatever comes my way. And when the time finally comes, I will give it my all, knowing that I have done everything in my power to succeed. The future may be uncertain, but one thing is clear - I will not back down from this opportunity to prove myself once again.
180	9042	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph that emphasizes Saeng's willingness to retake the test when it returns. This final paragraph shows that Saeng is adapting to her new surroundings and beginning to find familiarity in them. The repetition of seasons has made the once strange environment feel almost familiar to her. Despite the changes and challenges she faces, Saeng is learning to appreciate the new place and the meaning it holds for her. The author's choice to end the story with this paragraph effectively highlights Saeng's growth and acceptance of her surroundings."
181	9043	4	3	"The last paragraph states ""in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" I believe the author has ended with that paragraph to state the fact when her new home is like her old home maybe she will feel more confident and more in her place, instead of cold winter total opposite of where she use to live. The feeling of her old home, in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable. So then she will take the test feeling at home and pass."
182	9044	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author portrays the girl's struggle with adapting to a new culture while missing her home. Saeng finds comfort in memories but eventually realizes the similarities between her old and new homes. As she slowly embraces the changes around her, she starts to feel more at ease with her new surroundings. The process of acclimating to her new home brings Saeng a sense of hope and confidence. Through the gentle passage of time and the accumulation of new memories, she begins to find courage to face her challenges. Despite initial difficulties, Saeng's willingness to adapt signifies the positive impact of change and the possibility of creating a happy home filled with both old and new memories."
183	9045	4	3	The author simply points out the obvious in this brief tale. It is clear that once spring arrives, she will return to the green space filled with plants. Upon her arrival, the girl will try to replicate the wild plant from her home country and cultivate it in her new surroundings. This shows her desire to bring a piece of her past into her present environment, bridging the gap between the two worlds. In doing so, she creates a sense of continuity and connection between where she came from and where she is now. This act of nurturing and growth symbolizes her resilience and adaptability in the face of change. Ultimately, the story conveys a message of hope and renewal, illustrating the beauty of embracing new beginnings while honoring the past.
184	9046	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think heís trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she thought as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season  that was almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have next season when the plant has grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again. This highlights the theme of resilience and adaptation in the face of change, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and the ability to find familiarity in the unknown.
185	9047	4	3	"Saeng's determination to retake the test showed her resilience and willingness to overcome challenges. Her words, ""I will take that test again,"" reflected her strong resolve to not be defeated by failure. This determination is a testament to Saeng's character and her belief in her own abilities. It shows that she is not willing to give up easily and is willing to put in the effort to achieve her goals. Saeng's decision to try again exemplifies the idea that success is not always immediate, but through perseverance and hard work, one can ultimately achieve their dreams."
186	9048	4	3	The author ends the story this way to show that there can always be a happy ending. The geese came back, and the girl was happy because of it. The sight of the geese returning filled her heart with joy and hope, reminding her that even after difficult times, there is always a chance for things to get better. As she watched the geese fly overhead, she felt a sense of peace and renewal wash over her. It was a simple yet powerful moment that reminded her to always hold onto hope, even in the darkest of times. And with that, she smiled, knowing that there was always a possibility for a happy ending, no matter how things may seem.
187	9049	4	3	The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isn't going to give up on. She is trying to say that when everything she believes in succeeds that's when she is going to take her driving test. Her mother says that the flower is never going to give up and it's strong enough to live through the winter. The geese are going to always come back. That is exactly what she is going to do with her test. She is not going to give up on the test, she is going to keep trying until she passes. She will persevere like the flower and the geese, and she will eventually succeed in passing her driving test.
188	9050	4	3	Saeng feels more comfortable in the spring because it reminds her of home. She probably never experienced snow or winter before. So nothing in this time of year reminds her of home. In the spring it does because the geese return and the hibiscus grow again, making everything feel like it's her home again. Confidence is what she receives when spring comes again. The familiar sights and sounds of the season bring her a sense of belonging and security that she longs for, making her feel more at ease and confident in her surroundings.
189	9051	4	3	"The author concludes the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" with that paragraph because it sums up everything the hibiscus has given Saeng for strength and courage. Just like the hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place in this new country and the hibiscus helps her realize the importance in adapting to her survival in order to live happily. She can't always be dwelling in the past but learn to like where she lives now. Therefore, when the author writes, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" it is a direct symbol of Saeng budding or opening her mind to new ways, like learning to drive."
190	9052	4	3	"I believe the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" used this for the last paragraph because it is saying when she sees that hibiscus it will give her memories of home again which will bring encouragement for the test. ""The geese symbolize Saeng's determination to pass the test and try like the new country. Saeng explains, 'she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.' This quote creates a vivid image in my mind that lets me know Saeng will really go and take that test when she has encouragement from not only the geese but the hibiscus also."
191	9053	4	3	The author concludes with that paragraph because it is in a way letting you know that everythingís going to be alright. Saeng is going to retry her drivers test again and everything is back to the way she likes best. It gives you a sense of hope, that everything is going to be alright with her. Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life. I believe itís saying to that is why I think the author concludes with that paragraph.
192	9054	4	3	"The Author uses this paragraph to end the story because it shows how Saeng wants to adapt to this country and she is already beginning to understand and like it. When she says, ""and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" it is a metaphor about herself when she begins to bloom and grow, just like the hibiscus. This signifies her personal growth and development as she starts to embrace her new environment. This is why the Author concluded with this passage."
193	9055	4	3	Saeng's attachment to the tree she bought is evident in her decision to postpone taking the test until it starts budding. She believes that the presence of the plant is essential for her to feel prepared and confident. The tree holds sentimental value for her, representing a constant in her life. Without it, she feels lost and unsure of herself. While some may see this reliance on a plant as unnecessary, for Saeng, it provides a sense of comfort and stability. Ultimately, the budding of the tree will signal to her that she is ready to face the test, with the familiar presence of her beloved plant by her side.
194	9056	4	3	The author hesitated to believe that Saeng was prepared for the test without more information. Saeng, preoccupied with thoughts of gardening due to her lack of friends at school, was reluctant to attend. However, the author recognized that Saeng's determination was key, as without trying, she would never know her potential outcome. Thus, the author came to the conclusion that Saeng would ultimately take the test and succeed.
195	9057	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memories of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to the fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautiful for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.
196	9058	4	3	"After reading the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author ends the story in a unique way that demonstrates a will to survive. The plants ""dok faeng-noi"" have adapted to the cold environment, showing the instinct to survive by changing and adapting. Saeng, the protagonist, plans to try taking the test again in the spring, showing her determination to overcome failure and adapt to her new life in a new country. This desire to survive and thrive in challenging circumstances is a common theme throughout the story, highlighting the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity."
197	9059	4	3	I reached the end of the road, my tires struggling to find traction on the thick blanket of snow. As I looked back at the treacherous path I had just traversed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. The snowstorm had tested my skills as a driver, but I had made it through unscathed. As I parked my car and stepped out into the cold, crisp air, I couldn't help but marvel at the beauty of the snow-covered landscape. It was a reminder of the importance of being cautious and watching where you're going, especially in the face of adversity. The snows on the roads had posed a challenge, but I had emerged victorious, a little wiser and more prepared for whatever obstacles lay ahead.
198	9060	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng vows to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, ""then I will take the test again."" The author concludes with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings her comfort from home and confidence, ""almost familiar to her now."" This quote from the story shows that things are starting to be right, and she is starting to feel comforting her by making her realize that where she is living now can be similar to where she used to live. When around the hibiscus, it brings back memories of the flowers that they used to have where they lived. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home. For example, in the story, the mother says, ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus. In conclusion, the author concludes this story with that paragraph because it helps readers to understand the importance of the girl's memory of where she used to live."
199	9061	4	3	The author chose this ending to show that Saeng hasn't given up on her current situation yet. Despite facing challenges and feeling distressed, she is determined to try her best to overcome them. This ending gives hope to the reader that Saeng will find a way to adapt and move forward, despite the difficulties she is currently facing. It highlights her resilience and determination to make the best of her circumstances.
200	9062	4	3	In the story Winter Hibiscus, the author Minfong Ho ends the story with Sophea realizing that she is free from her past and able to embrace her future. The image of the blooming hibiscus plant symbolizes Sophea's own growth and transformation. Through her interactions with Mr. Mendel and the kind stranger, Sophea learns to let go of her fears and move forward with hope and courage. The ending is hopeful and uplifting, showing that even in the midst of darkness, there is always a chance for new beginnings and a brighter tomorrow.
201	9063	4	3	As the winter frost slowly melted away, she found herself eagerly anticipating the arrival of spring. The thought of the hibiscus blooming once again brought a sense of joy and renewal to her heart. It was a reminder that even in the coldest and darkest of times, there was always the promise of new life and beauty waiting just around the corner. With each passing day, she could feel the warmth of the sun growing stronger, signaling the imminent arrival of the season of growth and blossoming. And so, with hope in her heart, she looked forward to the colorful display that the hibiscus would soon bring, filling her world with vibrant hues and the sweet fragrance of spring.
202	9064	4	3	"The reason why she ended the story with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the testî is because she believes that just like the birds and the plant, she too can thrive in her new home. By waiting for the birds to return and the plant to bud, she symbolizes her own process of growth and adaptation. She understands that by being patient and allowing herself time to adjust, she will eventually feel safe and secure enough to face new challenges. Ultimately, she looks forward to a time when everything will be in harmony, signaling her readiness to move forward."
203	9065	4	3	The author ended the story in a way that left readers wondering about the possibility of a sequel. By doing so, he sparked curiosity and anticipation for what might happen next in the characters' lives. This deliberate choice not only engaged the audience but also set the stage for a potential continuation of the narrative. With this open-ended conclusion, the author cleverly paved the way for a part two, allowing for further development of the story and the characters. The unresolved ending serves as a strategic move to keep the readers invested and eager for more, ensuring that they will be eagerly awaiting the next installment to see how the story unfolds.
204	9066	4	3	She vowed this because just as the geese would return she shall. also as the test themselves to learn and grow she would. Furthermore she faced the test of love, survival, and family tradition she would know that coming back was destiny. In example they come to raise their young for the journey that they shall face and help them to realize that they always will come back because their lives started there and to always escape cold and mankind that wants to harm their lives. The winter months are very harsh there so they know that they have to leave just to survive. She learns the lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival. As the geese return to their home, she too will return to face her challenges and embrace her destiny with strength and determination.
205	9067	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he made a commitment to himself of taking the test all over again. He probably said that because there's always a next time for everything. Mostly the reason he said it was to remind himself that there's always another try of everything. Finally, most people should know that everyone gets a second chance. This mindset of perseverance and resilience is crucial in facing challenges and setbacks in life. It serves as a reminder that failure is not the end, but rather an opportunity to learn and grow. Embracing the idea of second chances can lead to personal growth and eventual success.
206	9068	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because the seasons are changing and there finishing their cycle and starting a new one. Thus I think this is a good way to end a story like this because it kind of sets a mood and a feel at the end of the story. The crisp autumn air signaled the end of summer, as the leaves began to change from green to vibrant reds and oranges. It was a time of transition, a time of endings and new beginnings. The characters in the story also found themselves at a crossroads, ready to embark on a new chapter in their lives. Just as the world around them was transforming, so too were they. And as they looked towards the future with hope and uncertainty, they knew that change was inevitable, but also filled with endless possibilities. The closing of one season marked the beginning of another, a reminder that life was constantly evolving and that they too would continue to grow and change with the passing of time.
207	9069	4	3	"The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph because it conveys the theme of the story, adjusting to changes in life. So many things have changed for Saeng, and she hasn't fully adjusted yet to the way of life. Yet she learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive like Hibiscus. The text states, ""In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding."" The hibiscus teaches Saeng to never give up, like the hibiscus doesn't give up and survives during the winter. She learns to be determined, and even though she failed the test the first time, her memories have helped her, and she is going to go for it again. These ideas are in the last paragraph because they summarize the idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place. She has slowly gotten used to this new place and recognizes the seasons now as she thinks this last thought."
208	9070	4	3	The geese flew in perfect formation, their sleek bodies cutting through the crisp morning air. Their feathers glistened in the sunlight, showcasing shades of grey and white that blended seamlessly together. As they honked in unison, their synchronized movements were a sight to behold.  Looking at the geese, one couldn't help but admire their beauty and grace. Each bird seemed to know its place in the group, playing a crucial role in maintaining the formation.

Also, saying that she will wait till the spring, means she is going to try again, and not give up. The author has a sentimental value to. Insince she is waiting for the hibiscus to bud, I believe she is referring that hibiscus to her country.

This extreme statement highlights the author's strong aversion to the idea of retaking the test, making it clear that he is adamant in his decision.
262	9125	4	3	The reason why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because she wants to test the hibiscus again when it returns. FOR evidence in the last paragraph it says, ìwhen they come back saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return And this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î Thatís why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph.
263	9126	4	3	The author puts that as the conclusion because it is like a cycle. And he didnít finish it with the end of the cycle because leaving readers with that curiosity edge gives suspense. This was a well-written story and conclusion. The cyclical nature of the narrative keeps readers engaged and wondering about what comes next, leaving them eager for more. The author's decision to end the story in this way adds depth and intrigue, ensuring that the impact of the tale lingers in the minds of the audience.

This ending signifies the girl's determination to start afresh and strive for success in the future."
265	9128	4	3	"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and straight forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."
266	9129	4	3	Because she is going to practice and get better at driving and when the flower blooms she will go take the test again. And she will try harder next time, focusing on areas where she struggled before. By putting in the effort to improve her skills and knowledge, she is setting herself up for success the next time she faces the driving test.

For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty. She wants to embrace the new season and focus on the present, letting go of the past and the memories that come with it. It's a fresh start, a chance to create new experiences and memories in the city without being haunted by what was left behind.

The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so itís fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.
272	9135	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new beginning is starting. For example, the fact that they moved to a different country symbolizes a fresh start. This is represented by the coming of spring, which signifies new life. Additionally, the melting snow symbolizes the fading of past hardships. The budding hibiscus flower further reinforces the idea of a new beginning. Overall, the paragraph emphasizes the need for a fresh start and the hope for better days ahead.
273	9136	4	3	Saeng believes she deserves another chance at taking the garden test, despite having failed before and disappointing her mother. She is determined to approach the test with more confidence this time around.
274	9137	4	3	The snow began to melt, revealing patches of green grass underneath. The sun shone brightly in the clear blue sky, warming the earth after months of cold.

The change in the season marked the end of one chapter and the beginning of another, bringing a sense of renewal and hope for the future. Winter had finally passed, making way for the beauty and growth of spring.
275	9138	4	3	The author probably ends the story like that because it creates a sense of hope and wonder. I feel the story is essentially about over coming things. For example, Saeng had a driving test and failed it. She also seemed a bit overwhelmed by the thought of ìhomeî. Saeng obviously cares about failing the test or she wouldnít have put any time into thinking about it, which led her to a green house. At the green house she was looking for a specific plant to buy, which reminded her of home. Thinking of home and her grandmother upsets her. Saeng has almost this internal war with her-self and the author ends the story that way to end the story giving the reader a sense of hope for Saeng and wonder.

277	9140	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed to get a certain plant because it died but winter is over in spring is here itís her chance to get that flower. For example in the story it says Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. Itís not her fault because in the story, it says the wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remarks of green and chicory weeds. The concludes because it will be a next time when you see Saeng again with a beautiful plant in her hand.

This ending leaves readers with a sense of hope and anticipation for Saeng's future success, mirroring the growth and progress symbolized by the budding hibiscus. It implies that despite setbacks, there is always a chance for redemption and achievement with perseverance and determination.

Its beauty and resilience reminded Saeng that setbacks are temporary and that she could overcome this obstacle. As she gazed at the hibiscus, a sense of calm washed over her, and she knew that she would keep trying until she succeeded. The hibiscus served as a symbol of resilience and perseverance, inspiring Saeng to stay strong and determined in the face of adversity.
286	9149	4	3	Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story ìWinter Hibiscusî the author uses the conclusion ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test againî he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says ìand in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wentî It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didnít pass her test she doesnít think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world. Saeng's determination to try again reflects her resilience and willingness to learn, embracing the challenges of adapting to a new culture.
287	9150	4	3	The author concludes this because she wants to show her that she won't give up. She will take the test again and try harder next time to overcome her challenge, and not give up. The author wants to show her that she's not a quitter, and she's filled with determination even though she has conflicts.

This final paragraph adds depth to the story and leaves readers with a sense of optimism and possibility.
289	9152	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said ""Then I will take that test again,"" it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong-willed and won't give up easily. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don't succeed the first time, try and try again. In the story, it says ""she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season."" In that part, I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she'll do great."
290	9153	4	3	"I think the author chose to end the story the way he did because it shows determination to pass the test. The test was to be able to make the garden grow. You know this because it says ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This shows that the test she took had to do with spring and the budding of flowers and that she is trying to grow something. In this story, they mention her helping her mother in the garden. So I think when the plants didn't grow, she wanted to try again. That's why I think they chose to end with the statement saying about taking the test again in the spring."
291	9154	4	3	The author uses this paragraph to evoke memories of a significant moment involving Saeng and the winter hibiscus, as well as her struggles with a test. Saeng's connection to the hibiscus is profound, as it symbolizes hope and renewal for her. The image of the Canada geese flying by adds a sense of fleeting beauty and the passage of time. Saeng's dependence on the hibiscus to find the courage to retake her test reflects the resilience and determination she possesses.

As they worked together under the warm spring sun, Saeng felt a sense of peace and contentment. The flowers bloomed beautifully, symbolizing the new beginnings and growth that they had experienced together. It was a simple yet profound reminder of the beauty that could be found in the smallest moments of life. With each flower they planted, Saeng and her mother strengthened their bond and created lasting memories that would stay with them forever. And as they stood back to admire their handiwork, a sense of gratitude washed over them, knowing that their garden was not just a collection of flowers, but a reflection of their love and connection. In that moment, surrounded by the beauty of nature, Saeng and her mother found solace and joy, grateful for the simple pleasures that filled their lives.
293	9156	4	3	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she wonít give up if they donít. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reappear if they survive. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surroundings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life.
294	9157	4	3	I think the author concludes the story the way he did is because it will make people want to read the next story to see if the test is passed. It adds suspense to the story and leaves readers eager to find out what happens next.
295	9158	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because that represents saengís decision to try again and to overcome obstacles in her way. It is used instead of her saying ì I will try again next spring ì to show diction and to show her goal or decision in a different way for example, It says ì, Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now.î At first, geese flying in the sky was new to her, but now sheís use to it. Maybe the author is making a reference to the geese since it will be familiar (the driving test) and she will pass like she got use to and familiar with geese. Since her family came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, sheís been adjusting to changes in her life and to circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it. The paragraph is saying simply that sheíll take the test again next spring, but the author put that paragraph there to show diction by emphasizing the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It overtones the point in the story, which is to not give up and the will to survive.
296	9159	4	3	The author loves plants, so after every winter, her passion for planting and growing beautiful plants is reignited. The spring is the perfect time for her to indulge in this hobby, and she turns to the organization known as The Spring Garden for unique and exquisite plant varieties. Her goal is to cultivate a garden full of vibrant plants and vegetables, just like her mother used to. With dedication and hard work, she brings her garden to life each year, creating a colorful and thriving oasis to enjoy.
297	9160	4	3	He was talking about how beautiful nature was. He also thought that since Saeng loved nature so much, she would be willing to go back to school to finish the test, even though she could be at home in the garden taking care of the plants. This shows how much he admires nature and values Saeng's dedication to it.
298	9161	4	3	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story revolves around Saeng's feelings of failure and shame after failing her driving test. Finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a renewed sense of hope and purpose. By purchasing the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home and, by placing the plant in a new environment, she mirrored her own journey of adaptation and growth. The arrival of spring signifies the start of a new year, while the budding hibiscus represents the plant's fresh start. Just as the plant begins anew, Saeng too is inspired to restart her life, including retaking her driving test."
299	9162	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the symbolism of this paragraph tells that when everything returns to normal and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding that I will take that test again. This signifies a sense of renewal and the readiness to face challenges once more. The return of the geese and the budding hibiscus represent the cyclical nature of life and the opportunity for growth and new beginnings. By deciding to take the test again, the narrator shows determination and resilience, ready to move forward and embrace whatever may come next.
300	9163	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about retaking the test to show that Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and even the smallest of things can hold memories for us. The paragraph shows Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2 by showing us that she isn't going to give up on @LOCATION2 and that she will keep working at understanding our customs. The last paragraph also shows that our memories last forever by the hibiscus representing Vietnam and her home there. It also shows that she can start anew here just like the hibiscus does at her house. Finally, the paragraph shows that even the smallest of things can hold our memories, with the hibiscus representing her home in Vietnam. The hibiscus brings many memories back for Saeng and helps her cope with @LOCATION2. This is how the last paragraph shows us that Saeng is getting used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and the smallest things can hold memories.
301	9164	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by @PERSON1, a teenage girl named Saeng and her family have recently moved to the United States from Vietnam. After failing her driver's test, Saeng comes across a familiar plant, a winter hibiscus, and decides to purchase it from a florist shop. When she returns home and confesses her failure to her mother, she is met with disappointment. However, as her mother prepares dinner and they admire the new plant together, Saeng begins to feel a sense of comfort and hope. Reflecting on the upcoming spring when the snow will melt, the geese will return, and the hibiscus will bloom, Saeng resolves to retake her driver's test with newfound confidence and optimism. She believes that with the support of her family and the symbol of the winter hibiscus, everything will fall into place when the time is right."
302	9165	4	3	The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, ìIn the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.
303	9166	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author ends with the paragraph, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" This shows Saeng's determination to keep trying until she succeeds. Geese migrate every year, and hibiscus flowers bloom annually, symbolizing perseverance and renewal. Saeng's resolve to return and pass the test mirrors the cyclical nature of nature itself. Her determination to fit into her new society shines through, as she refuses to give up on her goals. By ending the story with this paragraph, the author emphasizes Saeng's resilience and unwavering commitment to achieving her dreams."
304	9167	4	3	"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for the future. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is upset about failing her driver's test and then on top of that she gets upset about seeing the native plants of her homeland. “When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub.” This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote: “when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this plant. This is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in her location, which is why she ended the story with this sentence."
305	9168	4	3	"The author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life. When everything turns back she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school. For example, she wrote ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like geese."" This means that she has been used to change and has accepted the situation."
306	9169	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the snow doesn't melt in the spring, geese don't return in the winter, and the hibiscus is not budding until spring either. The hibiscus is a beautiful plant Saeng loved, and its absence in the winter emphasizes the loss and emptiness felt without her presence. The seasonal changes serve as a poignant reminder of Saeng's absence and the lasting impact she had on those around her. The hibiscus not blooming until spring symbolizes the hope for new beginnings and the possibility of growth and renewal after a period of mourning. In this way, the natural world mirrors the emotional journey of the characters, highlighting the cyclical nature of life and the potential for healing and transformation in the face of loss.
307	9170	4	3	The whole story about Saeng buying the hibiscus is in response to her failing the driving test. This crushed her. She wants to be reminded of her old homeland where she did not read to past the driving lessons. So she goes to a green house to find plants that are similar to the ones she used to have in her homeland. She does this to try to make herself feel better but still ìin the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.î Saeng feels she failed and the hibiscus gives her hope and memories of her old country. Her mom clearly sees and understands this when she doesnít yell at Saeng for spending @NUM1$ on the plant. ìIím glad you got it,î Saengís mom says because she knows it comforts her daughter. Together the plant the hibiscus. By doing this they are planting Saengís hope to grow, not only to pass the driving test but to make it in the new country. *The story ends with those lines because Saeng decides if the hibiscus will grow then so will she. She will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support and because she adapted. *The hibiscus, although it is not the one she had in the old country, she knows they can adapt to their surroundings and so the plant has in the new country. The plant will grow if it can adapt. Saeng can grow if she adapts to this new country.
308	9171	4	3	The author is trying to communicate that Saeng will never give up and her confidence will grow so she can retake her test like the hibiscus in the spring. Comparing Saeng to the hibiscus plant in the last paragraph was to show how she will grow and advance to take the test again when itís the right time. The snow melting represents her sorrows going away as the sun shows how she will succeed and grow like the hibiscus plant she had bought. The plant growing in the sunlight would represent her confidence to take the test next time, getting rid of the cold brisk snow which is like her negative self esteem and attitude. The author chose to compare Saeng to the plant in the last paragraph to show how it related to her life and attitude, and how her life will change in result of the hibiscus plant. Saeng will bloom like the hibiscus, with renewed strength and determination, ready to face her challenges and succeed in her endeavors.

The return of the geese also signifies the start of their nesting season, adding to the sense of renewal and new beginnings that come with the arrival of spring. So, as we bid farewell to winter and welcome back the geese, we can look forward to the beauty and promise of the season ahead.

With renewed confidence, she is determined to succeed and is ready to take on the challenge once more.
312	9175	4	3	The author concludes this sentence in the conclusion because she wants to show the courage the girl has in immigrating to a new country. After having failed her drivers test Saeng was feeling defeated and worthless. Her mother took into consideration and didnít get mad at her for failing. In fact, she decided to plant the flower to show Saeng that everything would work out in the end. When Saeng began to see her mother doing this, she became overwhelmed with determination and took over planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is difficult and many immigrants face problems on a daily basis. Saengís mother was out in the cold planting and trying to make the best of her situation. By setting this example, Saeng realized that she too could make the best out of her situation. This is why in the end Saeng decides to take her driver's test again, and ultimately live with the same attitude her mother has.
313	9176	4	3	In both the story and the statement, the theme of perseverance and resilience is evident. The protagonist in the story demonstrates determination by not giving up despite facing challenges, while the individual retaking the test also shows persistence by attempting it again. This common thread of perseverance ties the two instances together, emphasizing the importance of resilience in overcoming obstacles. By comparing the story and the statement, we can see the parallel between the protagonist's journey and the test-taker's experience, highlighting the universal value of perseverance in achieving success.
314	9177	4	3	Saeng's journey of preparation for the test was filled with challenges and setbacks.

317	9180	4	3	The author chose to conclude the last paragraph with the story to show that she has not given up. It shows that she has not given up because it says ìoverhead...geese...honk...familiar to Saeng now (second to last paragraph).î When she buys the hibiscus, because, it holds many memories from home, to keep her going. Her mother still making an ìomelet with slices of bitter melonî made her math water, reminding her of home, gave her hope to not give up. This connection to her roots and the familiar sights and smells of home provide her with the strength and determination to persevere in the face of adversity. The memories and traditions of her past serve as a source of inspiration and motivation, guiding her through the challenges she faces in her new environment.
318	9181	4	3	Saeng's love for flowers and plants is evident in her eagerness for winter to end so she can see them bloom again in the spring. She values the beauty and life that plants bring, finding joy in planting and caring for them.

As winter fades away, Saeng eagerly anticipates the new life that will soon emerge, symbolizing hope and renewal in her life.
319	9182	4	3	The author ends the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng feels connected to the plant that reminds her of home. This connection is important because it shows how people can find ways to deal with changes in their lives. Saeng does this by buying and planting the hibiscus plant so that she can see it and be reminded of home. She also buys the plant so that it motivates her to take the test she failed again in the spring when the flower is budding. This connection to her roots gives her the strength and determination to face challenges and move forward with hope and resilience. By nurturing the hibiscus plant, Saeng is nurturing her own sense of belonging and identity, finding comfort and inspiration in the beauty of nature. In the end, it is this simple act of planting a flower that helps Saeng navigate the complexities of life and find solace in the familiar, wherever she may be.
320	9183	4	3	Because she is still adjusting to the new country, she is feeling confused and out of place. As she anxiously waits for the flower to bloom, she finds comfort in the familiar sight. She believes that once the flower blossoms, she will feel more at home and be able to focus better on her test. The blooming of the flower symbolizes a sense of belonging and stability, which she hopes will help her perform well in her exam. With the flower in bloom, she feels a sense of calm and confidence, ready to tackle her test with a clear mind and a renewed sense of purpose.
321	9184	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus makes her comfort, she says ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". Since the author failed the test as it is told in the story, she will feel comfort taking the test again when the hibiscus come again after the snow season."
322	9185	4	3	The author concludes the story by expressing her determination to try again when the geese return in the spring, embodying the adage of persevering in the face of initial failure. This resolution signifies Saeng's enduring longing for her homeland in Vietnam, despite having resided in @LOCATION2 for several years. It highlights the emotional depth of her attachment to her roots and the ongoing struggle to reconcile her past with her present circumstances. The upcoming seasonal return of the geese serves as a poignant reminder of the passage of time and the cyclical nature of life, prompting Saeng to reflect on her journey and renew her resolve to overcome the challenges that lie ahead.
323	9186	4	3	She thinks she is gonna pass the test because on spring because everything gets back on live again flowers start growing again trees start to get green every thing starts to get Green the Geese are returning animals are starting to come out people go to the beach to distract their selves and that might be what she wants to do. The warm weather and the vibrant colors of nature during spring provide a sense of renewal and rejuvenation, which can boost her mood and motivation to study and excel in her test. The energy and vitality that come with the changing season may give her the extra push she needs to succeed.
324	9187	4	3	The author most likely concludes this story with the quote because she has renewed hope. She was feeling really upset because she had failed the driving test and when she saw the hibiscus flower, she got even more emotional because she misses her home but when she sees the geese as she finishes planting the flower, she decides sheís going to try to retake the test next spring.
325	9188	4	3	The author concludes the story with, ìin the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î to show Saeng growing up. As another year passes, Saeng will be more comfortable with her circumstances, and ready to start over fresh, just like all the plants will be blooming and budding. Failing her drivers test, really upset Saeng, so by waiting another year, she will be able to practice more, and become better, so that when she goes back and retests, she will be an even better driver, by having the time to practice, and start over. Itís almost like a new beginning for Saeng, another year has past, and new when her familiar plant buds, and begins to start over, so will she. Since the hibiscus plant is familiar to Saeng, she is better able to relate to it, and as it buds, and start fresh, so will Saeng. In conclusion, this is why the author concluded the story with that phrase.
326	9189	4	3	The author includes this paragraph in the story because it makes sense for the geese to come back home after the snow melts. Saeng, determined to take her test again, plans to do so around that time when the geese return. This timing is significant as it symbolizes a new beginning and a fresh start for Saeng as she prepares to retake her test. The return of the geese aligns with Saeng's own journey of perseverance and determination, creating a sense of hope and renewal in the story. Ultimately, the author uses this detail to highlight the connection between nature's cycles and Saeng's personal growth and resilience.
327	9190	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, Saeng struggles with adjusting to her new home in @LOCATION1 after moving from her familiar surroundings. She clings to memories of her old home, hoping to find familiarity in the new place, only to realize that everything is different in @LOCATION1, even the plant she buys. Initially frustrated by the changes, Saeng eventually comes to terms with the fact that different doesn't always mean bad. In the end, she decides to give this new culture a chance, understanding that it will take time for her to fully adapt. The author concludes the story with Saeng expressing her readiness to retake the test in the spring, symbolizing her willingness to embrace the changes around her, albeit gradually."
328	9191	4	3	The author concludes the story with that ending paragraph because when the spring comes back, Saeng is determined to try again. Her mother's question about what happened and Saeng's response that she failed the test indicate that her mother will likely offer more support with studying and gardening in the future. As the snow melts, Saeng makes a vow to herself that she will work harder this time and pass the test. With renewed determination and the support of her mother, Saeng is ready to face the challenge once more when the opportunity arises.
329	9192	4	3	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because that is when she will take the test again. Also because the geese made her realize, that many of the things that she had thought were strange before had become familiar. Just like the geese. It was through the quiet repitition of season upon season.
330	9193	4	3	She ends with that paragraph because it starts over. When the geese came back and the hibiscus is budding its like restart and she can try again, dealing with her memories of home and her adaption to the new country. I think she will be able deal with it better and take it again, it shows that she wont give up.
331	9194	4	3	She says that because she had failed to keep the tropical plant alive. She was disappointed in herself and that's why she said. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. When she failed and her mother said it will be okay you can always try again. So, she decided to give it another shot when the hibiscus blooms again in the spring.
332	9195	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to convey to the reader and herself that she will give working in the garden another chance to see if it sparks her interest. This is evident from the fact that at the beginning of the story, the author did not show any enthusiasm for the garden or the world around her, as seen when she used her mother's money to buy herself a big mac instead of seeds for the garden. The author's decision to give the garden another try signifies a potential shift in her perspective and interests. This conclusion ties up the story by hinting at a possible change in the author's mindset and future actions regarding the garden.
333	9196	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She knew that she had to prove to herself and others that she was capable of overcoming challenges. The lessons she learned from her mother that day had sparked a newfound determination within her. With a renewed sense of purpose, Saeng was ready to face the test once more and show everyone, including herself, that she was capable of achieving success. The changing seasons symbolized a fresh start for Saeng, a chance to grow and bloom just like the hibiscus in her garden. She was prepared to embrace the challenge and emerge victorious, ready to face whatever obstacles came her way.
334	9197	4	3	The author might have concluded the story with that sentence to show that she still cares about the test and not mostly about a measly plant that's going to die anyways. Also, because she needs to pass the test, and the author is implying that in the end, the girl is going to pass and not have to retake the test all over again. The author includes this to emphasize that school is more important than material possessions and that success in education should be prioritized above all else.
335	9198	4	3	"The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the last paragraph was due to the girl failing her driving test and returning home with a saebba hedge, a beloved plant for the family. The family, newcomers to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, values the driving test as a significant achievement. The daughter's determination to retake the test and make her parents proud reflects the cultural importance of driving in their family and the high regard placed on such accomplishments. Her decision to try again symbolizes her perseverance and commitment to meeting their expectations, ensuring a sense of pride and honor for the family."
336	9199	4	3	It is clear that Saeng is in the midst of struggle during a time of homesickness after recently moving from Vietnam. But as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland. As Saeng moves through the story it is apparent that she longs for memories of her homeland, but is beginning to find new things to enjoy about her new home. For example, while she is touched by the memories aroused by the hibiscus flower, she is intrigued by the new experiences, such as eating Big @CAPS1 and new friends. While homesickness has caused her to struggle she knows that with time she will be able to overcome the obstacle of leaving the old ways, for the new without completely obliterating either. She is convinced that by spring she will be able to overcome this obstacle and have the confidence to pursue any that will arise in her future.
337	9200	4	3	The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saengís mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the mountains even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel. Saeng's journey will continue in the changing seasons, just like the cycle of nature.
338	9201	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to say whenever something leaves their home they always come back. The hibiscus reminds her of home and that is where she wants to go. Saeng had failed her drivers test and she said when the geese come back I will do it again. The plant reminds her of home but its, ìNot like the tird we had beforeî (Ho). She is trying to say that the ones over at Vietnam are better and she wants to go back because she misses it. The hibiscus plant serves as a symbol of her longing for her homeland and the sense of belonging that she feels there. The connection between the plant and her desire to return home is strong, highlighting the deep-rooted ties that she has to her past and the place where she truly feels at peace.
339	9202	4	3	Saeng eagerly anticipates the arrival of spring, when flowers will bloom once again. She is determined to retake the test after the snow has melted, showing her unwavering resolve. As the wind picks up, stripping the last traces of green from the chicory weeds, she eagerly looks forward to the opportunity to plant again. With the changing seasons, Saeng is filled with hope and determination for a fresh start in the coming spring.
340	9203	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is saying when everything comes back to the way they were she will do everything again so things aren't the same as they used to be and she wants them to. She longs for the familiarity and comfort of the past, wishing to recreate the moments that once brought her joy and contentment. Despite knowing that time has passed and things may never be exactly as they were before, she is determined to make an effort to restore what once was. This desire to go back and relive those cherished memories showcases her deep emotional attachment to the past and her yearning for the return of happier times.
341	9204	4	3	The girl, Saeng, seems to be attached to nature and enjoys the arrival of spring, signaling a new beginning. She expresses her motivation to retake the test she failed, indicating a sense of determination and resilience. The author likely concluded with this paragraph to emphasize the hope and potential for improvement in Saeng's situation. Despite her initial dissatisfaction with her new home, the upcoming spring brings the promise of new opportunities and a fresh start. Saeng's willingness to embrace change and work towards a better future reflects her strength and adaptability. As the season transitions and blooms with new life, Saeng is poised to embark on a journey of growth and transformation in her new home country.
342	9205	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved i didnít like it because I didnít have many friend but in like a year or two I was fine because I had a lot of friend. This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it. In conclusion that is why he put that at the end of the story. After some time, Saeng may find solace in her new surroundings and make new memories to cherish, just like I did when I moved and eventually found comfort in the friendships I made. Time has a way of healing and adapting, and perhaps Saeng will come to embrace her new home with the same warmth and joy as she did her old one.
343	9206	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng vowed at the end to love her life again when everything starts up again.

By making this vow, Saeng is setting a positive intention for the future, showing her commitment to embracing joy and fulfillment in all aspects of her life. This declaration represents a turning point for Saeng, indicating her readiness to move forward with optimism and hope. Ultimately, Saeng's promise encapsulates her belief in the possibility of a brighter future and her willingness to actively pursue a life filled with love and happiness."
344	9207	4	3	The author in @LOCATION1 is determined to overcome the obstacles she faces, even if her initial attempts have failed. This story highlights the resilience she possesses and the lengths she is willing to go to in order to achieve her goals. It underscores the importance of perseverance and the drive to never give up. In the face of adversity, the author is committed to finding a way to succeed, even if it means taking unconventional measures. The narrative emphasizes the idea that sometimes success requires stepping out of one's comfort zone and being willing to do whatever it takes to reach the desired outcome. Ultimately, the author's journey serves as a reminder that with determination and hard work, anything is possible.
345	9208	4	3	"I believe that the author chose to end with that paragraph because the paragraph represents new beginnings and starting over. When Saeng fails her driving test she has a moment of weakness, she feels lonely and then she sees a plant that reminds her of her home in Vietnam. In a since, the plant comforts her. ""it's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" In this quote Saeng's mother tells her that the flower is too, out of place but yet has found the courage and determination to still grow. In the closing paragraph Saeng decides that, like the flower and the birds, she can also find the courage to face fears. She decides to retake the tests."
346	9209	4	3	I won't give up. And I won't let you give up either, Mom. We may face challenges and obstacles, but just like the winter hibiscus, we will continue to bloom and thrive in the face of adversity. Our roots run deep, and our spirits are resilient. Together, we will weather the storms and emerge stronger on the other side. So let's stand tall, face the world with courage, and show everyone that we are capable of overcoming anything that comes our way. I believe in us, Mom. Let's keep pushing forward, one step at a time, until we reach the bright and beautiful future that awaits us.
347	9210	4	3	I believe the author was suggesting a fresh start. This is evident from the idea of everything coming back around in the story. Additionally, Saeng now understands what is truly important and is prepared to take it seriously. This signifies a new beginning and a chance for growth and improvement.
348	9211	4	3	"During ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, a young girl named Saeng and her mother moved to a new place, and Saeng was struggling to adjust. She found solace in a plant called dok faeng-noi, which reminded her of home. Despite her initial disappointment, Saeng's mother found joy in the plant as well, realizing the significance it held for her daughter. As Saeng planted the beautiful dok faeng-noi, she made a promise to herself to do better when spring arrived. The hibiscus blooming would signify her readiness to retake the test with newfound strength and courage. Through this experience, Saeng learned to respect herself and believe in her abilities, setting the stage for a hopeful future."
349	9212	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story. It shows her getting used to the new home. Saeng failed the test because she bought the hibiscus, which made her homesick. The paragraph suggests that with time, Saeng will adapt to her new surroundings and resist the temptation of things from home. This final thought ties back to the beginning of the story when Saeng failed the test, emphasizing the theme of adjusting to a new environment and overcoming challenges. As the geese return in the spring, Saeng's growth and resilience will be evident as she navigates her new life without succumbing to homesickness.
350	9213	4	3	As the winter hibiscus bloomed in the courtyard, Thuy realized that even in the midst of hardship, there was beauty and hope to be found. The delicate petals of the flower served as a reminder that resilience and strength could thrive in the most unexpected places. With a newfound sense of determination, Thuy vowed to face the challenges ahead with the same grace and courage as the winter hibiscus. And as she looked out at the flower swaying in the breeze, she knew that just like the hibiscus, she too would find a way to flourish in the face of adversity.
351	9214	4	3	The author concludes the story with, ìwhen they come back, saeng vowed Silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî, to show that even though she failed her test she isnít giving up and that she will persevere over this and continue to try. This ending shows the determination in Saengís heart. Saeng has enough determination inside of her to go on even though she failed her test and failed her grandmother to continue trying and continue to try to complete for her grandmother and herself. I really liked this ending and I am glad that the author decided to use this ending in the story.
352	9215	4	3	Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, ìÖ and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. As the hibiscus plant begins to bud, Saeng finds hope and determination to face her challenges and emerge stronger. The blooming of the hibiscus signifies a new chapter in her life, one where she is ready to tackle difficulties and grow from her experiences. Just like the resilient hibiscus, Saeng is prepared to blossom despite the adversities she has faced.

354	9217	4	3	"The author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. Saeng decides that she will take the test again in the spring, symbolizing a fresh start and her ability to overcome failure. The hibiscus budding in the spring signifies new beginnings, just like Saeng embarking on a new chapter in her life. By purchasing a hibiscus and observing the geese, Saeng finds solace and a sense of familiarity in her new surroundings. The concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's resilience and adaptability as she navigates through challenging times and embraces change."

By stating that she will take the test again and make another attempt, she signifies her commitment to keep pushing forward despite setbacks. This closing remark serves as a reminder that success often requires multiple efforts and the willingness to keep trying until the desired outcome is achieved.
356	9219	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the story ends with Saeng promising herself that she will take the test again in the spring. The author most likely ends this way because it shows how Saeng is getting over her sorrow test in the spring when the Hibiscus is in @LOCATION1. This is shown when Saeng says ""I-I failed the test (@NUM1) this shows @CAPS2 leaving her homeland and makes her even more so sad, but she then promises herself that in the spring when flowers @LOCATION1 she will try again. She does this when she says to herself ""Öin the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.""(pg @NUM2) this shows her getting over her sorrow and becoming determined and looking forward and taking the test again."
357	9220	4	3	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again"". The author does this to show how Saeng was able to slowly adjust to change while not forgetting where she came from. This is shown by using symbols of geese and hibiscus together. The geese represent the new home and sounds Saeng had to become adjusted to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland. Putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places. By mentioning that she'll take the test again in the spring shows how she will be ready for the change because the test represents how she feels about her new home and by passing the test she allows herself to pass with her new home and adjust to the change in her life."
358	9221	4	3	They used this sentence because she wants to see the flower bud and feels like she is at home again. Then she will take the test. She also will feel lucky and have a memory of home so saeng vowed silently to herself. As she gazed at the delicate flower bud, a sense of calm washed over her, reminding her of the familiar sights and scents of her childhood home. With a renewed sense of belonging and comfort, she prepared herself for the upcoming test, feeling grateful for this moment of serenity amidst the challenges ahead. The memory of the flower bud would stay with her, a symbol of hope and resilience in times of uncertainty.
359	9222	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the sentence, ""When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The story tells us most of the hard times and obstacles Saeng has had to go through. The two major ones in this story were moving to a new place and failing her arriving test. Saeng had a hard time trying to overcome these events and others. So I think this sentence was put at the end so the readers could see that she was going to be okay and overcome everything that happened. Now we know this special plant will help Saeng with future problems."
360	9223	4	3	"After reading the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, I believe that the quote, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" was included for a reason. This quote concludes the story by conveying a tone of hope. The plant that Saeng carefully plants represents her memories of her grandmother and brings back happy moments, pushing her to overcome the pain of loss. The quote signifies Saeng's determination for hope and peace, as she looks forward to the hibiscus blooming in the spring, symbolizing a renewed sense of optimism and joy."
361	9224	4	3	"""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, is a story about transition to a new place and finding strength within oneself. Saeng, who had failed her driving test, felt disheartened as she made her way home. However, her spirits were lifted when she came across a plant in a florist shop that reminded her of home. This plant stirred memories of her homeland, prompting her to plant it at home and resolve to retake the driving test. When the geese returned, the plant served as a symbol of encouragement for Saeng, reminding her of her determination to succeed. The Winter Hibiscus not only brought a piece of her past to her new surroundings but also served as a source of inspiration for her future endeavors."
362	9225	4	3	I got used to the rhythm of nature and the cycle of life. I found comfort in the repetition of the seasons, the blooming of flowers, and the falling of leaves. As I watched everything happen again and again, I realized that there is a beauty in the predictability of nature. And so, when everything happens again, I will do the same. I will embrace the familiar and find peace in the continuity of life.
363	9226	4	3	I think the author includes that because she might have failed and needs more time to study to get things right. This indicates that the author is willing to put in the effort to improve and succeed, despite facing challenges. It also suggests a sense of determination and perseverance in the face of setbacks. By acknowledging the need for further study and preparation, the author shows a commitment to self-improvement and growth. This willingness to learn from mistakes and strive for success is a valuable trait that can ultimately lead to achieving goals and overcoming obstacles.
364	9227	4	3	The author uses this sentence to conclude the story to show that Saeng's hope is restored. Throughout the story Saeng is sad and misses her home. She feels hopeless in this new land, the hibiscus reminds her of home and brings back memories of her being at home with her grandmother, which makes her want to be back at home. The author adds the part about the geese leaving because they also have to leave their home. The hibiscus is to symbolize her being strong and that she will make it through moving to just strange land. The geese leaving also represent the idea that leaving home is a difficult but necessary part of life, and just like the geese, Saeng will find her way and thrive in her new surroundings.
365	9228	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng wonít give up & will keep trying. In the story all the memories of her old country encouraged her to be strong. For example the flower made her sad but in the end it made her better. Also in the beginning she didnít really like new changes and she missed home, but at the end some of the same memories she had back home were in her new country. Those are the reasons I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph. This shows that Saeng has found a way to integrate her past with her present, giving her the strength to move forward and embrace the new chapter in her life with courage and resilience.
366	9229	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that if the Hibiscus plant has enough strength to come back and flourish, then she has enough strength to come back and take the test again. For example, in the story it says ""but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months."" This quote shows that the hibiscus plant is strong. And Saeng sees that as if the plant is strong enough to return after a cold winter than she can return to the test after failing.

The snow melting and the hibiscus budding show spring and spring is usually the start of a fresh and new beginning. The last paragraph is like a symbol for starting fresh.

It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didnít feel so bad about failing the test.

As the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud, Saeng's spirit is rejuvenated, ready to tackle whatever obstacles come her way. With unwavering hope in her heart, she is poised to conquer the test and any other challenges that may come her way.
421	9284	4	3	Honestly I'm not quite sure. Maybe because she feels assured now. Maybe it's a mental trial we all must face. Maybe the geese returning and the plants budding is a metaphoric test too. Perhaps witnessing the cycle of nature rejuvenating itself gives her a sense of hope and renewal, allowing her to confront her inner challenges with a newfound strength and confidence. As she observes the signs of life and growth around her, she may draw inspiration from the resilience of the natural world, finding comfort in the idea that just as the seasons change and new life emerges, she too can overcome obstacles and blossom into a stronger version of herself.
422	9285	4	3	The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved. The cycle of nature mirrors Saeng's own journey, showing that with perseverance and hope, one can always find a way to start anew.

She expressed her commitment by stating, ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This shows that despite failing once, she is not giving up. Saeng also revealed her feelings towards the geese and the hibiscus, saying, ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" It is evident that she does not regret her decision to buy the hibiscus."
425	9288	4	3	"The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" this way because she is creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her driver's test. The author describes this scene as ""The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds."" The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng sees geese and realizes that ""many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her."" This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom."
426	9289	4	3	She wanted to catch them, that was her whole goal and purpose of hunting. Trying to catch geese. She saw her grandparents try to do it. In conclusion this is why she made that last statement. Her determination was fueled by the memories of her grandparents attempting to catch geese, instilling in her a desire to continue their tradition and prove her skills in the art of hunting.

Through the repetition of seasons, Saeng begins to see the once strange things as almost familiar. As she watches the geese flying in their distinctive V shape against the evening sky, she is reminded of her old home. With each passing season, Saeng adapts more to her new home, finding comfort in the changes around her. The natural cycle of rebirth and familiarity brings Saeng a sense of belonging and peace in her new environment."
429	9292	4	3	In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from Vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the new location spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, the geese, and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, showing how when everything familiar to her in Vietnam is symbolized in the new location, she will continue to try to adapt to the changes it has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles and is determined to do so. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds Saeng of her old home. In an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family to adapt and thrive in their new surroundings.
430	9293	4	3	"The author concluded the story with this paragraph, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.""

I know this because of this quote, ""one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it."" This quote show that she cares for the little things in nature. Another quote that show Saeng is caring towards nature is, ""she tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand."" This shows that Saeng is very caring to a small plant, which is part of nature. So in conclusion the author concluded the story with the paragraph above to show the Saeng is a caring person towards nature."
431	9294	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it helps to explain the significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus are very important to her and her culture. When there hibiscus around, Saeng feels that she can do anything. That is why she failed the test in the first place. So she is saying that the next time she takes the test, she will have the strength from the hibiscus to help her pass the test.
432	9295	4	3	This shows that she has not given up and is going to try hard to adapt and do well in this new land. It leaves a sad story off with a happy ending. The hibiscus is a sign of hope, and so is spring. This makes the entire thing more hopeful. Without this part, the story would be a sad one, but with it, there is a sense of hope. The way that the rest of the story is told suggests that this is a turning point or an end to the entire book. It is a resolution without a resolution, leaving room for the reader to imagine a brighter future for the protagonist.
433	9296	4	3	In the end, as I reflect on all the turmoil and chaos that has surrounded me, I am aware that it will take time to adapt and find my footing once more. Just like a plant that has been uprooted and replanted, I know that I too need time to heal and grow anew. With patience and perseverance, I believe that I will be able to start afresh and embrace the opportunities that lie ahead. Time is a great healer, and I am willing to give myself the time needed to heal and flourish once again.
434	9297	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to make a goal for herself in the future. She wants to pass the test, and she will try hard to do it next year. For example, her mother was mad she didn’t pass the test, but then soon forgot about it. Saeng did not forget about failing the test. She vowed herself to the hibiscus because she loves that plant and will do anything for it. Saeng spent countless hours studying, determined to succeed the following year. She knew that with hard work and perseverance, she could achieve her goal of passing the test and making her mother proud.
435	9298	4	3	The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succeed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new country in time but not if she spends her time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to her of starting anew and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver's test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again. This symbolizes the importance of perseverance and resilience in the face of challenges, highlighting that success often comes to those who are willing to keep trying despite setbacks. Just as the hibiscus blooms again after each cycle, Saeng too will have the opportunity to try again and eventually thrive in her new environment.
436	9299	4	3	She is determined to retake the test once the snow has melted in the spring. This way, she can enjoy the sight of geese and watch the hibiscus buds blooming while she focuses on her exam. By immersing herself in the beauty of nature during the test, she hopes to improve her chances of passing.
437	9300	4	3	The author ended this story with this paragraph because that's how Saeng felt. She felt connected to the geese and the hibiscus. She had lifted her head and watched as their distinctive was etched, almost familiar to her now. She will retake the test in the spring. The hibiscus and the flower will make her feel better in the spring. She should pass the test.
438	9301	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how the hibiscus flower profoundly implanted Saengís life and gave her new found courage and strength. For example, while on her way home after failing her driverís test, Saeng sees a flower and says, ì[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.î This shows the deep concentration between Saeng and the hibiscus and it is this connection that will guide her through the tough times. Saeng subsequently was into a flower shop and identified all the flower there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting into her knew life. Another example is when in the text it states, ìShe realized that many of the things she thought of was strange before had becomeÖalmost familiar to her now.î Saeng comes to this realization by listening to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower which normally survived at her old home would be able to survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big @CAPS1 here would be strange anymore. It is in this way that the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage and even strength. This newfound connection to her past and the hibiscus flower gives Saeng the courage and strength to face the challenges of her new life, just as the flower thrives in its new environment.
439	9302	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. So, when they come back, she has to make a test up so they don't have to worry about it later. On their trip, they saw a lot of different things. The soil was cold and hard, and they couldn't do much with it. Saeng felt like she was walking into another world, a hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Friends and plants of various shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. Beside them was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home, the wind blowing hard and tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds growing through the cracks of the sidewalk. They saw things they had never seen before, like the weeds growing through the sidewalk.
440	9303	4	3	I think the author includes this to show the determination to pass this test no matter what. This determination is evident in the protagonist's actions as they study tirelessly, sacrifice personal time, and seek out additional resources to ensure success. Despite facing challenges and setbacks, the protagonist remains steadfast in their goal, demonstrating a strong will and unwavering commitment. This level of determination not only drives the protagonist to overcome obstacles but also serves as an inspiration to others who may be facing similar struggles. Ultimately, the author's inclusion of this theme highlights the power of perseverance and the impact it can have on achieving one's goals.
441	9304	4	3	The girl looked at the flower and felt a surge of determination. She remembered how important this flower was to her, a symbol of hope and pride. As she thought of her grandmother, who used to pick the same flower with her, she knew that she had the strength to overcome any challenge. Just like the flower that could withstand the harsh winter weather, she believed that she too could persevere and succeed. With renewed confidence, she set out to face the test, knowing that when the flower blooms, she will be ready to bloom too.
442	9305	4	3	When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She wanted to prove to herself that she could successfully grow hibiscus in the winter time. Having failed the first time, she was determined to redeem herself and do it right on her second attempt. With great care, she planted the hibiscus, ensuring the soil was packed firmly around the plant. Saeng was focused and diligent, making sure she did everything differently this time around. She was ready to nurture her hibiscus and watch it bloom beautifully in the coming spring.
443	9306	4	3	The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. When she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @DATE1 to bloom. As the hibiscus bloomed, it signified her own readiness to bloom and thrive in her new environment. The connection she felt with her country through the plant served as a source of strength and motivation for her to keep growing and pushing forward. The hibiscus became a tangible representation of her journey and her ability to adapt and flourish, just like the plant itself. Through the blooming of the hibiscus, she found solace and encouragement, knowing that she was not alone in her growth and that she was supported by her roots.
444	9307	4	3	Then I will take that test again. Saeng's determination to pass the test was evident throughout the story. Despite initially failing, she found solace in the memories of her homeland and sought comfort in the presence of Malik. This led to a heartwarming bond with her mother and renewed hope for her future. Looking ahead to the coming spring, with the promise of new beginnings, Saeng felt confident in her ability to tackle the test once more. The hibiscus budding symbolized growth and resilience, reflecting Saeng's own journey towards success.
445	9308	4	3	Saeng had spent her whole life surrounded by the beauty of nature, finding solace and joy in the simplicity of the outdoors. However, as she reflected on her future, she realized that in order to pursue her dreams, she needed to step out of her comfort zone and face her fears. With a newfound determination, Saeng made the decision to take the test, knowing that it was the first step towards achieving her goals. As she set out on this new path, she felt a sense of excitement and anticipation, ready to embrace the challenges that lay ahead. And so, with a sense of purpose and drive, Saeng embarked on her journey, knowing that she was finally on the right track towards realizing her full potential.
446	9309	4	3	Saeg did not dare look at her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus, knowing that it was important to her. Despite the disappointment of failing the test, she had a newfound determination to try again. Saeg realized that she needed to work harder and not give up, even when faced with challenges. With the hibiscus as a symbol of resilience and perseverance, she was ready to tackle the test once more, determined to succeed this time.

And so, with a renewed sense of purpose, Saeg set her sights on mastering the test, knowing that the journey would be difficult but ultimately rewarding.
447	9310	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" ends by, ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes that story with that quote because the author sees spring as a new beginning. The author knows to work hard and needs to start over.

Spring represents a fresh start, a time for growth and transformation, inspiring Saeng to approach her future endeavors with renewed vigor and determination."
448	9311	4	3	The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring, as it was impossible to travel or make any arrangements during the harsh winter months. This meant that she had to patiently wait for the snow to melt and for the roads to clear before she could even think about taking the test. It was a frustrating situation to be in, but she knew that she had no choice but to wait it out. Spring seemed like a distant dream at that point, but she held onto the hope that eventually, the snow would melt, and she would be able to move forward with her plans. Until then, all she could do was prepare as best as she could and wait for the seasons to change.
449	9312	4	3	Saeng stood at the door, taking in the sight of her new plant. As she admired the vibrant colors of the hibiscus, a sense of peace washed over her. She realized that it didn't matter if the plant wasn't exactly like the ones back home. What mattered was that she was creating new memories, building a new life for herself.

The past would always hold a special place in her heart, but the future held endless possibilities, waiting to be explored.

With the promise of spring on the horizon, the author leaves us with a sense of hope and renewal, knowing that the beauty of the world will once again blossom and flourish.
451	9314	4	3	The snow began to melt, signaling the arrival of winter. The once pristine white blanket covering the ground slowly turned into slush as the temperature rose. Winter had definitely settled in, bringing with it its characteristic cold and frosty weather. The trees stood bare, stripped of their leaves by the harsh winter winds. It was a season of quiet beauty, with the landscape transformed into a winter wonderland. As the days grew shorter and the nights longer, the chill in the air served as a constant reminder that winter was here to stay.
452	9315	4	3	"Tisaeng had failed her drivers test after she went to ""flour is it and boughtî a plant it was the ""dok faeng ñ noi"", she had fond memories about the plant. She remembered it from Vietnam, and how it used to be everywhere all the time. She had bought ì@CAPS1 hibiscusî as a comfort to herself.

However, with time, she grows in confidence. In the end, the last sentence gives the reader a sense that Saeng will be better off than she was at the start of the story, conveying a feeling of hope for her future and her growing confidence."
455	9318	4	3	The meaning of the last phrase is to see if the winter hibiscus can reseed and go through everything to become a flower for the year and repeat the process. The cycle of growth, from seed to flower, is a natural and beautiful phenomenon that showcases the resilience and beauty of nature. By observing the winter hibiscus as it goes through this process, we gain a deeper appreciation for the intricate and delicate balance of life.

Just as the flower can survive the cold months and bloom again in spring, Saeng too can overcome her obstacles and start anew. The final paragraph of the story encapsulates this message of resilience, growth, and the possibility of a fresh start for Saeng."
457	9320	4	3	I think that this sentence was chosen to be the last sentence because it shows that Saeng can pass the test. Although she is not at her homeland, she still has the ability to do things. As the plant that reminds her of home returns and begins to grow, Saeng will do the same. I think that it is a good sentence to be at the end, and it leaves you wondering if she will pass the test.
458	9321	4	3	She end, the story with that because the flower gives her strength. It gives her hope and reminds her of home. At her home they were every where, she had to buy this one. She planted it so it can grow through winter. After winter the flower gets huge and she passes her driver test. For reward her mom get her a real Vietnam flower. The vibrant petals of the Vietnam flower brought a piece of her homeland to her new place, filling her heart with nostalgia and joy.

This gift was not just a flower, but a connection to her past and a beacon of hope for the future.
459	9322	4	3	I think he concludes his story with that paragraph because she knows she was wrong and she wants to make it up to her mother. Also, she is showing her mother how much she really likes nature. In the end, she realizes the importance of apologizing and showing appreciation to those we care about, especially when we have made mistakes. By expressing her love for nature, she is also indirectly expressing her love for her mother, connecting the two important aspects of her life.

This response also highlights the patience and perseverance needed in nurturing a garden, as the process of planting and caring for flowers is ongoing and cyclical. Overall, it emphasizes the commitment and passion involved in tending to a garden, where each season presents an opportunity to cultivate and enjoy the natural beauty of blooming flowers.

464	9327	4	3	Saeng was filled with a mix of emotions as she walked through the green house, reminiscing about the plants that reminded her of home. The familiar names brought back memories of her past, but as she continued her tour, she realized that some memories were still missing, leaving her feeling lost and incomplete. When she returned home and confessed her failure to her mother, she was met with understanding and compassion. Her mother, sensing her daughter's sadness, decided to plant a beautiful hibiscus to bring hope and joy back into Saeng's life.

466	9329	4	3	The author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph. This paragraph talks about overcoming obstacles and encourages the reader to keep trying. It is important to never give up and to persevere until you succeed. In the story, Saeng had just moved away from Vietnam and missed it terribly. To add to her troubles, she failed her driver's test. Feeling defeated, she looked up and saw a group of geese flying above her. She thought about how they overcome the cold by flying south for the winter.

Saeng made a decision to retake her driver's test in the spring, symbolizing her determination to overcome her setbacks. The story teaches us that no matter how challenging the situation may seem, with persistence and resilience, we can conquer any obstacles that come our way.
467	9330	4	3	"The short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" ends the way it does because the narrator realizes that with winter comes a new chance or opportunity to start over, a rebirth.

Just like the hibiscus, Saeng will not give up after failing; she will regroup, reattempt the test, and start anew in the spring. This parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus emphasizes the idea that setbacks are a natural part of growth and development, and that perseverance and determination are key to overcoming challenges and achieving success. Through this comparison, the author conveys the message that like the hibiscus, Saeng too will flourish despite the obstacles she faces.
470	9333	4	3	My response is that if is about winter, so really it is going to be about winter walking around having fun and all them things. Winter is a magical time of year when the world is covered in a blanket of snow, creating a serene and picturesque landscape. Walking around in the crisp, cold air, you can't help but feel invigorated and alive. The sound of snow crunching beneath your feet and the sight of icicles glistening in the sunlight are truly a feast for the senses. Whether you're building a snowman, having a snowball fight, or simply taking a leisurely stroll through the winter wonderland, there's no shortage of fun to be had. So bundle up, embrace the chill, and enjoy all that winter has to offer.
471	9334	4	3	The author concludes the story like that to make the reader more interested and to understand it will all happen again and again year after year. The cycle of events that unfold in the narrative are meant to convey the idea of eternal recurrence, where history repeats itself in a never-ending loop. This cyclical nature of existence is a central theme in the story, emphasizing the inevitability of certain events and the futility of trying to escape or change them. By ending the story with this realization, the author leaves the reader with a sense of both foreboding and resignation, highlighting the endless repetition of human experiences throughout time. As the characters in the story grapple with their destinies and the forces that shape their lives, the reader is reminded that these struggles are not unique to them, but rather part of a larger pattern that plays out endlessly in the grand scheme of things. In this way, the conclusion serves to underscore the timeless and universal nature of the story's themes, inviting the reader to reflect on the cyclical nature of life and the inevitability of certain outcomes.
472	9335	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he wants to show that the flower was her inspiration to take the test before. The way I got my response was, throughout the story, @PERSON1 was always either gardening the hibiscus or had one. This obviously showed me that she was inspired by this flower and its beauty. In conclusion, the author ends the story like this to show the importance of the Hibiscus flower to Saeng.
473	9336	4	3	"The author ends the story in this way because it represents the new birth that will take place. It's almost as if she's saying that she will hibernate during the winter, and when spring returns and everything begins a new cycle of life, then so will she. Saeng ""realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" She is saying that when the new season begins it will be her beginning and she'll have a different outlook on her new life."
474	9337	4	3	The author ends the story this way to wrap everything up. The author incorporated nature and descriptions of it. This was so the reader would get an image in their head of how beautiful or calming spring supposedly is. The gentle breeze rustled the newly blooming flowers, filling the air with their sweet fragrance. The warm sun shone brightly in the clear blue sky, casting a golden glow over the lush green landscape. Birds chirped merrily in the trees, adding to the symphony of nature's awakening. It was a picture-perfect day, a true celebration of the beauty and tranquility of spring. And as the protagonist gazed out at this idyllic scene, a sense of peace washed over them, filling their heart with joy and contentment. Spring had arrived in all its glory, bringing with it a renewed sense of hope and possibility. And in that moment, the protagonist knew that everything was going to be okay.
475	9338	4	3	In conclusion, the author ends the story by hinting at the protagonist's growing strength, which will coincide with the blooming of the flowers. This symbolism suggests that the character will be ready to face the upcoming test with newfound resilience and determination. The anticipation of the flowers' arrival mirrors the protagonist's own anticipation of facing challenges head-on and emerging victorious. Just as the flowers will bloom in their own time, so too will the protagonist's inner strength blossom when the time is right. This closing paragraph leaves the reader with a sense of hope and optimism for the protagonist's future endeavors.
476	9339	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story that paragraph because she wants to show the determination the girl in the story possesses. At first, the girl could not help herself and bought the expensive flower. She did not want her mother to be disappointed though, so she was determined to ""pass the test."" In the spring when it is time to buy more seeds, the girl wants to be able to buy the seeds. So the author is showing the trait of determination that the girl controls. This determination is essential for the girl to prove herself, both to her mother and to herself. By demonstrating such strong determination, the girl is able to overcome challenges and achieve her goals, no matter how difficult they may seem. This perseverance and resolve ultimately lead to her growth and success in the story."
477	9340	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The hibiscus budding would symbolize starting over and Saeng taking the test again is giving her a chance to start over fresh and try again. The hibiscus doesn't stop budding so Saeng shouldn't stop trying!
478	9341	4	3	In the last paragraph of the story, the author concludes the story like that because the author means to say that the hibiscus is the symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, @CAPS1 mother says ìIts flowers arenít pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months.î This is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months, in which the weather is rough. In Saengís case, she is a girl who will make it in a foreign country. Thus, in the last paragraph, when Saeng vows silently to herself that she will take the drivers test again when the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the obstacle of failing the test. That is why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph.
479	9342	4	3	Saeng wiped away her tears, determined to try again. She thought about her homeland in Vietnam, her family, and the new beginning she could make. Just like the geese that migrate and return, she would start fresh with the drivers test. The hibiscus blossoming in the spring symbolized her own opportunity for a new beginning. With renewed determination, Saeng would face the test once more, ready to overcome any challenges that came her way.
480	9343	4	3	Saeng didn't let her initial failure discourage her. Instead, she embraced it as a learning opportunity and was determined to try again. This determination and resilience are powerful lessons for us all. Giving up is not an option; it's about getting back up and trying again, no matter how many times you may fall. Saeng's story serves as a reminder that success often comes after multiple attempts, and it's essential to keep pushing forward despite setbacks. So, let Saeng's perseverance inspire you to never give up on your dreams and goals, no matter the challenges you may face.
481	9344	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldn't push things off. You should always deal with them as they come up. So in the story, the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things.
482	9345	4	3	She should understand that each plant is unique and cannot be replaced with an identical one. Each plant has its own characteristics, growth patterns, and needs that make it irreplaceable. By trying to replace a plant with an exact replica, she is not valuing the individuality and essence of each plant. It is essential for her to learn this lesson in life so that she can appreciate the distinctiveness of every living being and understand that nothing can truly replace what was once lost. This realization will not only help her appreciate the beauty of nature but also teach her the importance of cherishing the uniqueness of every living thing.
483	9346	4	3	"The author ends the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will follow nature and try to fit into her new land. Saeng has failed her driver's test and feels out of place in her new home. The text states, ""As Saebba nedae tall and lush. And surrounded there garden"" (No 1). When she sees the @CAPS1 it reminds her of old home where she fit in. Now she wants to wait to see that flower grown so when she takes the driver's test again. Also, she sees geese fly over her head when she plants her flower. The author writes, ""She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become...almost familiar to her how"" (No 1). The geese coming back in the spring will now also remind her of her new name and how she must try to live there happily now. In the last paragraph the author writes, ""I will take that test again"" (No 1). This gives the feeling of Saeng trying to start a new beginning in this new home."
484	9347	4	3	Saeng is determined to try again because she has been comforted by the symbol of her homeland. The hibiscus plant has served as a friend and a reminder of where she comes from. Seeing it bloom again will give her the strength and confidence to face the test once more. This plant has played a significant role in Saeng's life, providing her with the comfort and support she needed during challenging times. The hibiscus represents resilience, hope, and the enduring connection to her roots. Ultimately, it is a powerful symbol that helps heal Saeng's spirit and motivates her to persevere.
485	9348	4	3	I think the author is just trying to show that you never give up. I think the author is trying to show the beautie of nature. The author used that because in the story Saeng failed the test but at the end it says that she will take the test again. In the story it talks about the winter hibiscus that she planted and that is concluded in the conclusion. The conclusion basiclly saying is there will be a new beginning. The beauty of nature and the resilience of the human spirit are highlighted in this story, where despite facing challenges and setbacks, there is always the possibility of a new beginning on the horizon. The symbolism of the winter hibiscus serves as a reminder that even in difficult times, there is hope for growth and renewal. Saeng's determination to retake the test reflects the theme of perseverance and the belief that with persistence, success can be achieved. Just as the winter hibiscus blooms again after the cold winter, Saeng is ready to face her challenges and embrace the opportunity for a fresh start.
486	9349	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The cycle of nature mirrored the cycle of her determination, each season bringing a new opportunity to prove herself. As the flowers bloomed once more, so would her perseverance and resilience. And when the time came, she would be ready to face the challenge once again, armed with experience and a renewed sense of purpose. The changing of the seasons marked not only the passage of time but also the continuous growth and evolution of Saeng's journey.
487	9350	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the readers know that she doesn't give up. They may have thought that she thought the test back home was more important, so she wouldn't care about passing this test because she misses her home and wouldn't care about those tests. However, she proves them wrong by showing determination and perseverance in facing challenges and achieving her goals. This ending demonstrates her resilience and commitment to success, regardless of the obstacles she may encounter along the way.
488	9351	4	3	I think the author ended the story like that as a metaphor for people to think outside the box or thing. The author might have ended it like that so people can get a vivid picture in their head about what she was talking about. This open-ended conclusion allows readers to interpret the story in their own unique way and encourages them to engage with the text on a deeper level. It challenges readers to think creatively and critically, expanding their perspective beyond the confines of the narrative. By leaving the ending open to interpretation, the author invites readers to actively participate in the story, making it a more immersive and thought-provoking experience.
489	9352	4	3	With a renewed sense of determination, Saeng took a deep breath and reassured herself that she would do better next time. She knew that she had the strength and resilience to overcome any challenges that came her way. As she reflected on the events that had transpired, she felt a sense of peace wash over her. Saeng was ready to face the future with confidence and grace, knowing that she was capable of achieving her goals.
490	9353	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes the story with the line ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending suggests that the author wants Saeng to emulate the resilience and renewal of the hibiscus flower. Just as the hibiscus blooms again after the winter, Saeng is encouraged to try again and start anew in the spring. This symbolizes the idea of growth, perseverance, and the possibility of a fresh start."
491	9354	4	3	Saeng failed her driverís test at the beginning of the story. She finds a hibiscus plant and buys it because it reminds her of her life in Vietnam. She states, ìThe familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmotherís long grey hair.î The flower reminds her of her grandmother. The mother says, ì??? Seen this kind blooming along the lake, itís flowers arenít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make through the cold months.î Sheís trying to make her daughter feel better. It states, ìOverhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by their fault honks clear and yes-familiar to Saeng now. She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.î Saeng is slowly finding comfort and familiarity in her new surroundings, despite the challenges she faced at the beginning.
492	9355	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the end she realizes that the things that seemed strange before she had just realized as the seasons were changing and the plants. So the author put that paragraph at the end because in the spring she goes back to school to take the test again. As she walked through the familiar halls of the school, she couldn't help but notice the buds on the trees outside starting to bloom. The vibrant colors and fresh scents of spring filled the air, bringing a sense of renewal and hope. With a newfound perspective, she entered the classroom to retake the test, feeling more confident and at peace with herself. The changing seasons mirrored her own growth and understanding, showing her that sometimes what seems confusing or out of place can simply be a matter of timing and perspective. And as she completed the test with a sense of clarity and purpose, she knew that she was ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
493	9356	4	3	The author concludes the story the way he or she does because it shows that the time she found the plant that she will get her license. It is a reminder for her. I also think she did it that way because when the plant blooms, it starts over, and so when she sets on goes to take a chance at the test, she is starting new.
494	9357	4	3	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to show that the peace that the peace that the flower gave will build her confidence and she will not give up. I know this because in the story the main character fails her driving test and when she sees the flower it helps remind her of the home she had in Vietnam. Another reason is because the flower blooms in spring and it never stops blooming. She knows it will never give up and she relaizes that she shouldnít either. Plus the plant gives her stength to try again. So the reason the author ends her story with that paragraph is to show the power the flower that was know to her, give her and how she will no give up.
495	9358	4	3	The author concludes the story with this ending paragraph because. It combine the two imperfect situations. When she said when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again. She will prove her point and abbreviated the situation.
496	9359	4	3	The author is saying that she would take the test again in the spring instead of the winter because she would be more focused solely on the test and not distracted by thoughts of planting during that busy time of year. In the spring, she would have a clearer mind to concentrate on preparing and performing well on the test without the added stress of planting responsibilities. This strategic decision would likely lead to better results and a more successful outcome.
497	9360	4	3	I think she ended the story with that because throughout the whole story she tries to work hard. And this last sentence is saying that it's not over, that she will be back to take the test again. She tries to prove herself during the whole book. And she will continue working hard to get what she wants.
498	9361	4	3	"In the story, the author concludes the story the way she did because it is metaphoric. She compares herself to the hibiscus plant, which must overcome harsh conditions like the cold. The author states, ""its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus."" Just like the hibiscus, she will bloom again and face the test of surviving the cold. By passing this test, she will have the opportunity to overcome her own challenges. That is why the author concludes the story as she did, symbolizing resilience and the ability to endure hardships to ultimately thrive."
499	9362	4	3	In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, Saeng sees this as a new opportunity to start fresh and try again. The transition from winter to spring mirrors Saeng's struggle to adapt to her new surroundings, just like the hibiscus adapting to its new environment. As she watches the geese return and the hibiscus bloom, Saeng understands that she too can thrive in this new place, leaving behind the hardships of her past in Vietnam. Spring brings hope and a chance for a new beginning, allowing Saeng to embrace change and look towards a brighter future.
500	9363	4	3	The author concludes with this because it had the most impact. The ending also gave the most meaning. The meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she is now living. It also incorporates the hibiscus flower and how it will bloom again, this could have a double meaning, and mean that the authors life will bloom again. Overall it was a good way to conclude the paragraph. She found comfort in the thought that just like the hibiscus flower, she too would find a way to bloom again in her new surroundings.
501	9364	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the decision to end the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again when the snows melt and the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, signifies her determination to overcome disappointment and adjust to life in a new country. The symbolic meaning of a flower bud, representing growth and prosperity, highlights Saeng's personal development and resilience. This positive ending emphasizes the importance of growth and progress in facing life's challenges."
502	9365	4	3	Saeng realizes that she also must adapt in her new home, just like the hibiscus plant. She understands that adaptation is key to success in this new environment. As she watches the hibiscus preparing to bloom in the spring, she makes a firm decision to restart and retake the test, ready to grow and flourish just like the resilient plant. In that moment, she feels a deep connection to the hibiscus, a symbol of her own journey of adaptation and growth in her new surroundings.
503	9366	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, the author's final paragraph highlights the significance of the hibiscus in the protagonist's journey. The hibiscus symbolizes resilience and strength, mirroring the girl's own inner fortitude needed to pass her driving test. Placing this paragraph at the end underscores the message that just as the hibiscus can bloom again after winter, so too can the girl overcome her challenges and emerge victorious. Through this use of symbolism, the author conveys a powerful message of hope and perseverance, inspiring readers to face their own obstacles with courage and determination."
504	9367	4	3	The story is full of emotion and homesickness that it can be a bit depressing, so the author wanted to end with a message of hope. After Saeng failed the test in the main shelter of the greenhouse, she broke down and wept. It's inspiring to know that she'll keep trying despite all her hardships. I know firsthand that homesickness can be pretty bad, and finding the strength to keep going and make the promise to take that test again can be very hard but worthwhile. The author also used the ending to give another meaning to the hibiscus. When the geese return and the hibiscus is blooming, when the winter is over, hard times are past, there will be new hope in a new, beautiful spring.
505	9368	4	3	The reason why the author concluded the story with that paragraph was because at basically explained everything You needed to know for the ending. It basically explains that she is willing to take the time to study for the test she had previously taken and did not pass and wants to take it again once spring arrives. For example, the geese had left for the winter, and once they return in the spring, she will take the test over again. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it best explains the ending of the story.
506	9369	4	3	"Saeng had truly embraced her new life in the United States. When she said ""I-I failed the test,"" it wasn't about failing to adapt or feeling out of place; it was a sign of her growth and acceptance. She had come a long way from her initial doubts and uncertainties, now feeling hopeful and confident about her future in this new land. Saeng had passed the most important test of all - the test of finding comfort and belonging in a foreign place. As she looked around at the bustling streets and diverse faces around her, she knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be."
507	9370	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with Saeng vowing to herself to take the test again in the spring when the hibiscus is budding. This shows that she is determined to fight for what is right and what she believes in."
508	9371	4	3	Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower to, in a sense, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower. The vibrant red of the hibiscus reminded her of the warm sunsets in her homeland. Its delicate petals symbolized her own resilience and beauty, even in the face of challenges. As the days grew longer and the air warmer, Saeng felt a renewed sense of hope and determination. With the hibiscus by her side, she was ready to face whatever the future held in her new home.
509	9372	4	3	Saeng felt a mixture of emotions as she called Fil in to help her with purchasing something that could benefit her but also make her miss where she came from. Her mother would likely be upset at the high price she paid for it. Despite this, Saeng silently vowed to herself in the spring that she would retake the test again.
510	9373	4	3	"Saeng was feeling nervous as she sat in the driver's seat, waiting for the examiner to start the test. She took a deep breath and reminded herself of all the hours she had spent practicing with her driving instructor. As the examiner got into the car and gave her instructions, Saeng felt a sense of calm wash over her. She carefully checked her mirrors, adjusted her seat, and confidently started the engine. As she smoothly navigated through the streets, confidently signaling at every turn, Saeng felt a sense of pride welling up inside her. When the test was finally over, the examiner turned to her and said, ""Congratulations, you've passed."" Saeng beamed with joy, knowing that all her hard work and determination had paid off. She had overcome her nerves and proved to herself that she was capable of achieving anything she set her mind to."
511	9374	4	3	The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has told already & the future is a whole different story. It doesnít matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter. The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person & her mother. The mystery and anticipation of what is to come add depth and intrigue to the narrative, leaving readers to ponder the possibilities and outcomes that lie ahead. Ultimately, it is this element of uncertainty that keeps the story engaging and thought-provoking, inviting readers to imagine the potential paths and resolutions that may unfold in the future.
512	9375	4	3	Saeng feels out of place in her new home and new country. She vows silently that in a year she will take the test again. She vows that in a year she will be used to her new home and new country and will start to enjoy life again. The author concluded with this paragraph because the girl Saeng will hopefully enjoy her new home and in a year she will be used to what happens in her new country. Saeng just feels out of place and she wants to wait a while until she tries to retake the test. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she made a vow to herself and hopefully she will keep the vow and make it happen.
513	9376	4	3	Saeng watched as the geese adapted to their new surroundings, finding a way to make their home work despite the challenges. Seeing their resilience, she felt a renewed sense of determination. When the geese eventually disappeared, Saeng didn't give up. Instead, she picked herself up and declared that she was not one to stop trying; she was one to work harder. With a newfound commitment to trying new things and adapting to changes, Saeng embraced the challenge ahead of her, ready to face whatever obstacles came her way.
514	9377	4	3	I think she ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the test in the springtime when it wonít be so hard on her. It will be warm again and itís not quite as cold. The winter months can be tough for her, but she knows that when the weather starts to warm up, she will have a better chance at succeeding in the test. By waiting for the right time, she is giving herself the best opportunity to do well and achieve her goals. The change in seasons symbolizes a fresh start and renewed hope for her future endeavors. With patience and perseverance, she is ready to face the challenges ahead and come out victorious.
515	9378	4	3	In the spring, the warm and sunny weather brought a sense of hope and happiness to Saeng. As she looked at the hibiscus plant thriving in the garden, she was reminded of her own resilience and ability to adapt to new surroundings. Just like the hibiscus would bloom again after the winter, Saeng knew that she too would flourish in her new home. With determination in her heart, she promised herself that she would not let her mother down. The bright petals of the hibiscus served as a beautiful reminder that with patience and perseverance, she could overcome any challenges that came her way.
516	9379	4	3	In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. If they can adapt to the changing seasons and thrive, then I can too. Just like the geese flying back home and the flowers blooming anew, I will embrace change and grow in this new environment. I have the resilience and determination to overcome challenges and make a fresh start. The coming spring will mark a new beginning for me, a time to prove my adaptability and strength. Just like nature, I will flourish and bloom once more.
517	9380	4	3	Authors often end stories with a paragraph that makes readers wonder what happens next. In Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author leaves the story open-ended by expressing her intention to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus blooms. This signifies a new beginning for her, filled with hope and the possibility of success. By mentioning the geese, blooming hibiscus, and melting snow, she finds solace in the familiar signs of nature and believes that passing the test is within reach. The author's hopeful outlook on the future is reflected in the imagery of the changing seasons, indicating a fresh start and the potential for a brighter tomorrow.
518	9381	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because they wanted readers to understand the resolution of the main character's journey. Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in the spring when the snow melts and the hibiscus blooms signifies her determination and hope for the future. This final paragraph leaves readers with a sense of closure and a glimpse into Saeng's mindset as she faces new challenges ahead.
519	9382	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the geese and the hibiscus were both things that were familiar to Saeng. They remind her of her homeland. When the familiar things return, she will have the strength to face the test again and hopefully do better. The narrator says, ""Overhead a of Canada geese flew by, their faint hunks clear and familiar to Saeng now."" This shows how the geese are a symbol of the familiar things from her homeland that help Saeng feel more comfortable in her new home. This sense of familiarity and connection to her roots gives Saeng the confidence she needs to overcome challenges and thrive in her new environment."
520	9383	4	3	"The author included that paragraph because the hibiscus plant makes her think of where she is from and helps her to succeed a certain things. I know that the hibiscus is from her homeland because in the story she says ""I mean, not like the kind we had atñat-"", she found that she was still to shaky to say the words at home. She misses being home and this plant helps her bring back memorys of being there. Therefore the author included that paragraph to show the reader that she misses her homeland. The hibiscus plant serves as a comforting reminder of her roots and provides her with a sense of connection to her past, making it an essential element in her life as she navigates through new experiences away from her homeland."
521	9384	4	3	Saeng had always felt a deep connection to the land where she grew up. As the snow blanketed the ground, she longed for the warmth of spring when she could once again plant and nurture the earth. Despite the challenges she faced in school, she was determined to return in the spring and try again. For Saeng, her roots were a source of strength and comfort, and she knew that no matter where life took her, she would always find her way back to the place she called home.
522	9385	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is blooming, then I will take the test again. This plant has given her a newfound belief in herself to strive for improvement in the future.
523	9386	4	3	The author concludes the story this way for a few reasons. One reason is that she will have more experience with her new country. She only left her homeland a few months before so in about six more months she will be more knowledgeable about the ways of the new country. This will make her more capable of passing the CAPS Ed test. Also in the spring is when the flower will be beautiful again and this will give her new-found strength that will cause her to pass. The few months' time will allow the author time to mentally and physically prepare for the exam. Mentally, she will be able to study and learn all she needs to know. And physically she will age which will also teach her new things. With this additional time, she will be better equipped to face the challenges ahead and succeed in her new life.
524	9387	4	3	"In order to get over her failure, Saeng bought a flower that reminded her of home. Saengís started to cry when she bought the flower. She wanted to be back home. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show how she will take the test when she feels like she is at home. ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" Saeng said to herself. Those things make her feel welcome and feeling that way will help her with her test. The paragraph concludes the story with all the things she is comfortable with. This conclusion helps the reader understand what reminds her of home. Also explains how much the hibiscus flower meant to her. Buying the flower helps her with her troubles. Seeing the geese fly reminds her of her home. The author concludes the story with the memories that will help Saeng in the future."
525	9388	4	3	I think the author ended this story with this conclusion because, every one should have fresh starts, or second chances. I guess the author was leaving in a message stating if you fail once you should at least try again. When Saeng failed the test it seems as though her self-esteem lowered, and her mother tried cheering her up, and eventually she realized it will be bad giving up and not trying again with a fresh start.
526	9389	4	3	"Minfong Ho included the last paragraph in the story because it alluded to the fact that saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of home. when saeng saw the hibiscus she got a feeling ""so intense, it was almost visceral.î The flower was creatively used by Ho. She said that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months, which made the reader think after reading the last paragraph, that this flower must give saeng hope and confidence. Also, the geese make a V which I infured would mean Vietnam to saeng which is what the author is trying to get her reader to think. That is why ìand the geese return.î is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wants her readers to realize that objects that make us more comfortable and happy are what make us strong and confident in the end. The author did a great job placing that last thought into the last paragraph because it perfectly sums up the lesson, and that is that you should do things when you feel confident and it feels like home to you. You @MONTH1 be small and fragile, but if you ìplantî yourself you can thrive with confidence."
527	9390	4	3	Saeng eagerly awaited the arrival of spring, hoping it would come early so she could see her beloved hibiscus bloom. The snow had covered her garden for far too long, and she longed to see the vibrant colors of her favorite flower. If spring didn't come soon, the snow wouldn't melt, and she would miss out on the beauty of her hibiscus. As Saeng prepared to face the challenges ahead, she held onto the hope that she would be able to take the test and see her hibiscus once again.
528	9391	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didnít have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."
529	9392	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story.
530	9393	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the author thought that in two sentences he could summarize the most important things in the story. I think that the author did a great job. This concise ending allows the reader to reflect on the significance of small details and how they can have a big impact on the overall story. It emphasizes the idea that sometimes, simplicity can convey the most powerful message.
531	9394	4	3	Saeng has decided to wait until the hibiscus blooms and the snow melts before retaking the test. She believes that this timing might offer her a better chance at success. Therefore, she plans to prepare diligently during this period and give her best effort when the conditions are more favorable. With determination and patience, Saeng is hopeful that waiting for the right moment will lead to a positive outcome when she retakes the test.
532	9395	4	3	The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she canít do it until the spring because that when the geese come back. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test. In the spring, as the geese return and the hibiscus buds, Saeng believes it will be a time of renewal and growth for her. She sees herself blooming like the flowers around her, ready to face the challenges ahead with a newfound strength and determination.
533	9396	4	3	The author includes this paragraph in the story because the grandmother might think that it is a test to see what she can get done in a limited time. The grandmother might end up getting more tasks accomplished than expected, showcasing her resourcefulness and efficiency. This situation could potentially reveal the grandmother's ability to adapt and thrive under pressure, highlighting her strength and determination in the face of challenges. Overall, this paragraph adds depth to the grandmother's character and further develops the theme of resilience in the story.
534	9397	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story like that because she is saying that by that time sheíll be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that by that time when that happens in spring she would be prepared and more confident of herself. The author was trying to say that just like the beginning of a new spring, it would be a new beginning for her.
535	9398	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph.
536	9399	4	3	The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so she's bummed about that. The concluding sentence makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings. This parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus highlights the resilience and potential for growth that exists within both of them.
537	9400	4	3	The author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng's mother hope. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test. Saeng's determination and hard work have been evident throughout his preparation for the exam, and his positive attitude towards studying is a good sign. With his commitment and perseverance, there is a strong possibility that Saeng will be able to achieve success in his upcoming test. This potential outcome could bring a sense of relief and optimism to his mother, who may have been feeling anxious about the results. Ultimately, the author's inclusion of this detail serves to offer a glimmer of hope in what may be a challenging and uncertain situation for Saeng and his family.
538	9401	4	3	It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, ìThis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader.  The hibiscus symbolizes hope, resilience, and a fresh start for Saeng, providing her with the courage to face her challenges and move forward in her new life. The concluding paragraph ties together the themes of the story, giving closure to Saeng's journey and leaving the reader with a sense of optimism for her future.
539	9402	4	3	Including the bit about taking the test again when the hibiscus is budding provides a sense of closure and lesson to an otherwise open ending. Saeng fails the driver's test early in the story, then on her way home she buys a hibiscus. The reader really doesn't see a connection until this last paragraph. The hibiscus represents perseverance and strength. After a harsh winter, this hibiscus can bloom again and continue to live. Even after moving from Vietnam and struggling to adapt, Saeng must recover and keep trying. Just like the flower blooming again, so will Saeng. She will take the test a second time and pass. She will adapt to her environment and keep going, just like the hibiscus. This symbol of resilience and determination will guide Saeng through her challenges, reminding her that like the hibiscus, she too can overcome obstacles and flourish in the face of adversity.
540	9403	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The hibiscus in the garden serves as a reminder of Saeng's homeland, evoking a sense of comfort within her. As a flock of Canada geese flew by, Saeng felt a profound connection to her roots, realizing that if she had passed her driving test earlier, she would have never discovered the beauty and solace of the hibiscus. This moment of reflection solidified Saeng's determination to try again and succeed in her driving test, as she embraced the lessons learned from her previous setback and found inspiration in the simple yet profound beauty of nature.
541	9404	4	3	The author's mother had taken the test in the past and successfully passed it, inspiring the daughter to follow in her footsteps. The daughter was determined to take the test in the spring when flowers were in bloom, as it was not administered during the winter months. This connection to her mother and the symbolic significance of taking the test amidst the beauty of blooming flowers added a deeper meaning to the daughter's own journey towards success.
542	9405	4	3	In think the author is trying to show that Saeng is finally starting to accept and get over the struggles in life. It is showing that she has finally gotten used to @LOCATION1 and the customs, but she still hasnít forgotten her heritage. ìBut she had herself much preferred it to a big Mac.î It also proves that she is going to be positive and not let discouragement overshadow her. Sheís going to retake it and try again. During the beginning look at her situations in life. But after visiting the floral shop, she discovers a more cheery, optimistic outlook on her situation and decides to do something about it. This shift in perspective indicates that Saeng is ready to embrace change and take control of her own happiness.
543	9406	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason I think is because sheís concluding that the winter is there, and when winter is over, she is going to start flowering and planting again. In the story it said, ìthe winter hibiscus was in the ground now,Ö.î So, now she has to wait for winter to pass by then the hibiscus will be starting to grow and will hopefully be alone by spring. So, that is why I think she concluded the story the way she did.
544	9407	4	3	To her, the plant felt smooth and cool just as she had known it, which was comforting. She closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes, with sadness, and maybe disappointment, which she probably would not want to deal with for a while. Her mother even uttered a small cry of surprise and delight to see the flower, even before being shocked when Saeng reveals she paid all over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I believe that she will be more comfortable at the time planned because she'll have new and old things to come home to, such as the geese and plant.
545	9408	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author includes this ending paragraph because she wants to show that next time around she will be prepared and ready for the garden and the challenges it holds. This first time, she wasn't ready, and she didn't know about the winter hibiscus because she never did anything like it before. She realizes the importance of being knowledgeable and equipped for the task at hand. With this experience under her belt, she will approach future gardening endeavors with confidence and a better understanding of the plants she chooses to cultivate. The winter hibiscus may have been a surprise this time, but it won't catch her off guard again. She is determined to learn and grow, just like the beautiful flowers she tends to in her garden."
546	9409	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist's determination to retake the test in the spring reflects her resilience and willingness to keep trying despite setbacks. The budding hibiscus symbolizes hope, renewal, and the potential for growth and change. Just as the hibiscus blooms after the snow melts, the protagonist is ready to face her challenges anew with a fresh perspective. This ending suggests that she is not defeated by failure but is instead empowered to overcome obstacles and strive for success. Like the changing seasons and the blooming hibiscus, she is ready to embrace transformation and seize opportunities for personal development and achievement."
547	9410	4	3	The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test. Additionally, the vibrant colors and fresh scents of the blooming flowers could bring her a sense of comfort and familiarity, helping her feel more relaxed and focused as she prepares for her test. In this way, the blooming flowers serve as a source of motivation and emotional support for the girl during a challenging time in her life.
548	9411	4	3	The hibiscus stood alone in the yard, its vivid red petals a stark contrast against the melting snow. As the geese returned overhead, honking in the distance, the hibiscus began to bud, a symbol of resilience and renewal in the changing seasons. It was a solitary figure in the landscape, yet it held its own beauty and strength, a reminder that even in isolation, life continues to thrive and bloom. And as the snow slowly melted away, revealing the promise of spring, the hibiscus stood tall and proud, a testament to the enduring power of nature.
549	9412	4	3	Saeng watched as the leaves turned from vibrant greens to fiery reds and oranges, signaling the arrival of winter. She couldn't help but feel a sense of melancholy as the days grew shorter and the air turned colder. Knowing that she would have to wait until spring to see the vibrant colors return once again made her heart heavy. But she also knew that with winter came a time of rest and reflection, a time to prepare for the new growth that would come with the arrival of spring. And so, she embraced the changing seasons, finding beauty in the cycle of life and nature.
550	9413	4	3	Saeng's deep care for the flowers is evident in her meticulous attention to each individual bloom. She values the natural uniqueness and beauty that each flower possesses, nurturing them with dedication. This connection she has with the flowers allows her to appreciate the subtle differences and special characteristics that make each one stand out. Saeng's commitment to these natural wonders highlights her genuine passion for their growth and well-being. She understands the importance of allowing them to flourish in their own way, embracing their distinct qualities with admiration and respect. Through her nurturing touch, Saeng ensures that the flowers thrive in their own unique way, celebrating the diversity and wonder of the natural world.
551	9414	4	3	In the story, the author mentioned that she wouldn't retake the tests she had already completed. Perhaps she was reflecting on the sense of relief that comes with finishing a challenging task like taking tests. As she looked back on her time in school, she realized that the pressure of exams was now a thing of the past. With school behind her, she could move forward without the weight of academic stress on her shoulders. The author seemed to be embracing the idea that certain experiences, like taking tests, are finite and once they are completed, there is no need to revisit them. This acceptance of the transient nature of academic challenges marked a new chapter in her life, one where she could focus on new opportunities and growth without being held back by past tests and exams.
552	9415	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph into the story because they needed an ending that would best fit the overall narrative. This conclusion ties up loose ends and provides a sense of closure for the reader. By carefully selecting the conclusion, the author ensures that the story leaves a lasting impact on the audience.
553	9416	4	3	I believe that the author chose to conclude the story the way they did because the story was about perseverance. For example, the story was based around the winter hibiscus plant. This is a good example because in the end Saeng vows that she will persevere and take her test again, just like the hibiscus perseveres and forges through the winter without allowing itself to die. Additionally, Saeng's mother worked outside in the cold to get her gardening done, showing a strong sense of determination. This relates to the story because she stayed out in the cold to finish her job, just like Saeng decided to try her test again instead of giving up. Both Saeng and the hibiscus plant show the importance of not giving up and pushing through challenges. The theme of perseverance is evident throughout the story, emphasizing the value of determination and resilience in achieving one's goals.
554	9417	4	3	I think the author ended the story like that because it means that she hasn't given up yet and even though she failed the first time, she is going to try again. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, she will give it another shot. The story was pretty bad because I don't even know what she failed at, so I didn't like it.
555	9418	4	3	"I think the reason why the author ended the story with this ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again."" paragraph because like this the plant didnít have a fight chance for survival in the winter and was same with the girl when she took her driving test but in spring the plant has chance bloom so she has a chance to pass the test because because there time and place for everything."
556	9419	4	3	Emotion, commitment, and hope are all evident in the way the author chose to end the story. The final paragraph where Saeng silently vows to herself to retake the test in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, reflects her deep emotional connection to the situation. This decision also showcases her strong commitment to improving herself and redeeming her previous failures. Additionally, the mention of waiting for the hibiscus to bloom again symbolizes hope for a fresh start and a brighter future. It is clear that these powerful emotions, unwavering commitment, and hopeful outlook are the driving forces behind Saeng's decision to try again, highlighting the resilience and determination within her character.
557	9420	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, ""she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiarizes to her."" At this point she has an epiphany, and realizes that life is like seasons. In the end paragraph she intercedes this by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter, and then blooms in the spring, she must be strong during these hard times. One day her time will come for her to ""bloom."" She experiences hard times, but we all must be strong and steadfast as we wait for our time to ""bloom."""
558	9421	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because, he wanted to show that she wasnít going to give up just because she failed one time. She failed the test one time already. She was very sad about it. She went and bought a plant. Saengís mom told her that they were going to do it the right way. Saeng was crying when she told her mom about it. Her mom was very understanding thought. Her mom could have been very mad with her. She could of used a plant that they grew. The plant @MONTH1 not grow right now. She should of bought a real plant from someone else. Saeng was determined to make it right this time and was not going to let one failure discourage her from trying again.
559	9422	4	3	"Determined, new beginning, symbolism - each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like she's starting over so that she's able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author writes, ""and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,"" it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism - each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph."
560	9423	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî by Minfong Ho ends the story with the statement, ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,î because it showed that Saeng had overcome her problem and vowed to correct it. By ending with this statement, the author showed that the beauty of nature can help one to overcome their problems, as did Saeng. Upon seeing the Geese migratory and the ìWinter Hibiscusî, Saeng, ìrealized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.î Saeng realized that the test, although strange and different to her now, became familiar because of her experiences with nature. Seeing the geese and ìWinter Hibiscus,î this plant also made Saeng think of her past in Vietnam and all of her good times back at her home. ìThe familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost taste the light strokes of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly mashed.î The plant made her think of good experiences. The joy of the plant made her joyous enough not to think about the past but about the future, about taking the test again and her new life in the United States.
561	9424	4	3	The reason why the author puts that last line into the story of the end is to show us the raids and saeng that even though us almost over. She doesnít want it to end but she knows that it will also start up again. Next year when things go back to the way they were before everything changed. This is why I think the author put that line into the story.
562	9425	4	3	The author concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself ìin the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test againî to express her determination of fitting into new things and to express the change she was getting used to. Describing spring was important in the conclusion because it described what Saeng once thought was odd in @LOCATION1, but got used to the seasons and weather changing. Once she realized that she needed to deal with change, she knew that she would need to try the driving test again. It was very important that the authorís conclusion was ìin the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî because it expressed how Saeng was accepting change in her life. Saeng's determination to face her fears and embrace new challenges was evident as she looked forward to the changing seasons, symbolizing her readiness to take on whatever obstacles may come her way.
563	9426	4	3	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author uses the hibiscus flower as a symbol of finding beauty in unexpected places and adapting to a new life. At the end of the story, when Saeng looks at the hibiscus, she is reminded of her home country and her old life, which she cherished. Despite failing the test, she finds solace in the beauty of the hibiscus and realizes that everything will be okay. This serves as a reminder that even in times of disappointment, there is always a chance for redemption and new opportunities. By finding peace and beauty in the simple things, one can navigate through life's challenges with hope and resilience."
564	9427	4	3	Saeng's connection with the plant goes beyond just a simple comparison; it symbolizes her own resilience and determination. Just like the plant, Saeng knows that growth takes time and patience. She understands that in order to succeed, she must nurture her abilities and allow them to flourish, much like how the plant thrives in the spring. By drawing inspiration from the plant, Saeng finds the strength to continue working towards her goals, knowing that her efforts will bloom into success when the time is right. In the end, Saeng and the plant share a bond of perseverance and hope, both growing stronger as they prepare for the challenges ahead.
565	9428	4	3	"I believe the author ends the story with this paragraph because it refers to previous events in the story. For example, it says, ""and this hibiscus is budding"". This refers back to the beginning of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant and it reminded her of home. This is a good way to conclude a story. I wouldnít change it at all if I could. Also in the summary before the story it says how she had failed her driverís test and in the last paragraph it says, ""then I will take that test again,î I think Saeng didnít have much confidence before taking the test because of her new surroundings but is now that she is familiar with everything and found a hobby she will think of passing while taking the test again. I think she is looking to start over and forget about failing."
566	9429	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This time, she will face it with newfound confidence and determination, eager to prove her capabilities to herself. It will be a personal challenge, a chance to show her growth and resilience. Saeng knows that this time, she will approach the quiz with a different mindset, one that is driven by her own ambition and desire to succeed. And when she finally sits down to retake the test, she will do so with a sense of pride and self-assurance, ready to conquer whatever obstacles may come her way.
567	9430	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, a young girl named saeng recalls her life before she moved to @LOCATION1. She misses her homeland and all of the things she loved before she came here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that saeng vowed to take her drivers test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason. He/She wants to show that saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and will be ready when the weary days of winter are over, and the beautiful days of spring come. Saeng's mother states, ""Öit's strong enough to make it through the cold monthsÖ. That's what matters"". The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to saeng in that just like it, she is strong enough to survive the winter months. Saeng's determination and resilience, like that of the winter hibiscus, will see her through the tough times, and she will emerge stronger and ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead when spring arrives."
568	9431	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to make the reader want more. When an author ends the chapter of a story or an episode of a show it is always a good idea to use a cliffhanger to drag the audience along. In many stories have read this is used. In my @CAPS1, the @PERSON1 book it always ends with a cliff-hanger. Like in the end of the third book one of the soldiers is killed but you donít find out by who until the next book. This keeps readers engaged and eager to find out what happens next, ensuring they will continue to follow the story with anticipation.
569	9432	4	3	The author concludes this story the way she does to say that the girl is not going to give up on trying to fit in this new country. The author concludes this way because it refers that it's not over, and even though the test was a failure, it won't be next time. The author leads us to know that the little girl cares about the test and wants to prove to show people that she can pass it. She is reminded of her home by these flowers, and she has hope that with this reminder, she can retake it and do it right.
570	9434	4	3	Saeng didn't like the cold, so she would always wait until the snow melted and the geese returned before testing the plants again. This habit of hers showed that she was patient and determined, willing to wait for the right conditions to pursue her interests. Additionally, it demonstrated her strong connection to her roots and her mother, as she would always come back to visit her after the long winter months. This aspect of Saeng's character added depth and warmth to her story, highlighting her resilience and unwavering dedication to her family and passions.
571	9435	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and in the spring she will take the test over. This sets up anticipation for the readers as they wonder whether Saeng will be able to pass the test the second time around. It also highlights the theme of perseverance and determination, showing that even in the face of failure, Saeng is willing to try again. This resolution leaves the story open-ended, leaving room for growth and development in the character of Saeng.
572	9436	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you've also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way.
573	9437	4	3	Saeng felt a wave of nervousness as she received her test results. Unfortunately, she didn't quite pass the exam. Despite her fears, she knew she had to tell her mother the truth. When her mother found out, she was understandably upset. Saeng realized that she would have to retake the test after winter was over. She hoped that with more studying and preparation, she would be able to pass the test the second time around.
574	9438	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" because she wanted to make the story end with Saeng finding positive views on her new home and looking forward to the future. Throughout the short story, Saeng displays a sad disposition about her new home, and how the plants remind her of her recent home. ""I mean it's not the kind we at-at-"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again. This phrase shows that Saeng truly missed her home and was saddened by it. The concluding phrase shown before demonstrates that she found the strength to look positively at the future of her new home."
575	9439	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the beginning of the story Saeng went to take a driving test but didnít pass and so she goes and buys a hibiscus that reminds her of home and gives her strength and comfort. So her mother says this at the end because she knows Saeng is going through a hard time adapting to her new country and she doesnít want to put more pressure on her just because she knows Saeng is very upset and is trying to make it up to her by buy a flower for her so she says by next spring she should be adapted and ready for the test because the flower should give her hope. She wants her to know she is three for her.
576	9440	4	3	I think the author of ìWinter Hibiscusî said ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.î to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isnít giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of what's to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way. This determination and resilience portrayed by Saeng in the face of adversity gives a sense of empowerment and positivity to the readers. It leaves a lasting impression of the character's strength and the potential for a successful outcome in the future.
577	9441	4	3	The Winter Hibiscus story concludes by drawing a parallel between the hibiscus plant and @CAPS1. Just as the hibiscus must survive the winter in a plastic container before blooming in the spring, @CAPS1 is navigating through a challenging environment and must adapt to her new surroundings. By accepting the change and embracing the opportunity to start anew, she will grow and overcome the obstacles she faces, much like the hibiscus will thrive once it's planted in its natural habitat. This connection between the hibiscus and @CAPS1 symbolizes the resilience and potential for growth in both nature and human experiences.
578	9442	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test ""when the snow melts and the geese return."" This line is significant as it symbolizes Saeng's journey of growth and resilience. Just like the hibiscus flower, which wilts at first but blossoms later on, Saeng faces setbacks but ultimately finds the strength to overcome them. The hibiscus serves as a metaphor for Saeng's own experiences, showing her ability to wilt and blossom again. From feeling disappointed about failing her driver's test to finding comfort in a flower from her homeland, Saeng demonstrates her capacity to rise above challenges and find hope. Despite her initial fears and doubts, she ultimately resolves to try again in the spring, reflecting her determination to succeed. Like the hibiscus in its budding stage, Saeng is poised to bloom once more, showcasing her resilience and growth throughout the story."
579	9443	4	3	The author includes part of the story to illustrate Saeng's determination to pass a test she had failed before. Saeng had made a silent vow to herself in the spring that when the snow melted, the geese returned, and the hibiscus began to bud, she would take the test again. This shows her commitment to waiting for the right moment to try again, symbolized by the arrival of spring and the blooming of flowers. Saeng's decision to wait for this specific time demonstrates her belief in the cyclical nature of life and her faith that things will fall into place when the time is right.
580	9444	4	3	"I think the author concludes the story with this because she's proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise. Saeng said, ""It's not a real one, not like the kind we had before."" Saeng loved home and wished she was back there, but her new promise was what had mattered."
581	9445	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify the start of a new day, symbolizing a fresh beginning for the protagonist as she prepares to take the test. Just as the geese return in spring and the hibiscus buds bloom, the upcoming test represents a new season of growth and opportunity for the character. The use of this imagery suggests that the protagonist is ready to face the challenges ahead with a renewed sense of determination and optimism. This ending leaves the reader with a sense of hope and anticipation for what lies ahead in the character's journey.
582	9446	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the driving test in spring time. Spring time is a symbol of positive feelings she gets positive feelings from the blooming of the winter hibiscus.

This decision sets the tone for a hopeful and promising future, filled with new opportunities and possibilities.
583	9447	4	3	They had to come back so they did and they were walking into an old world over there in the corner and the childhood memories flooded back just as she had known it would feel. The familiar sights and sounds enveloped them as they stepped into the room, bringing back a rush of nostalgia. The faded wallpaper, the creaky floorboards, and the old rocking chair in the corner all transported them back to a simpler time. It was as if time had stood still in this little corner of the world, preserving the memories of days gone by. They could almost hear the laughter of their younger selves and feel the warmth of family gatherings that once filled the room. As they stood there, taking it all in, they were reminded of the cherished moments that had shaped their lives. It was a bittersweet feeling, knowing that they could never truly go back to that time, but grateful for the memories that would always remain. And so, they stood in the corner of the room, holding onto the past while looking towards the future, grateful for the journey that had brought them back to where it all began.
584	9448	4	3	This last paragraph is written for several reasons. First, she will try again when she feels the time is right. Just like the geese coming back, Saeng will come back to take the test, and so the Hibiscus plant will also bloom again. She feels that it is the right thing to do and it will be the right time to come back and take the test. This paragraph describes Saeng well about how she lives and how she will take the test again when she feels it is right. Saeng's determination and patience are evident in her decision to wait for the right moment to try again. Like nature's cycles, she believes that timing is crucial, and when the time is ripe, she will return to face the challenge with renewed strength and readiness. Just as the geese and the hibiscus plant demonstrate resilience and perseverance, Saeng embodies these qualities as she prepares to take the test once more. In her heart, she knows that success will come when the time is perfect, and she is willing to wait for that moment to arrive.
585	9449	4	3	"I believe that the author ends because the author is showing that Saeng is determined to pass the test. ""She paused as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes. ""(Ho) This quote shows that passing the test meant a lot to Saeng. She was crying because she couldn't help but buy the plant and fail the test. She didn't want to fail and showed her sadness by crying.î then I will take the test again.î (Ho) This quote shows that even though she failed, she is determined to pass the test and succeed. Failing hurt her greatly. so she can't wait to do it again and pass because she is determing to succeed.

As she continued to adapt to her surroundings and embrace her new life, Saeng's resolve remained unwavering. With her unwavering determination and positive attitude, there was no doubt that she would succeed in achieving her goals and building a bright future for herself in her new home."
587	9451	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was upset that she moved. She is also upset that she failed her drivers test. So she planted the plant and shes says that when spring comes, she will retry her drivers test. The plant serves as a symbol of hope and growth for her, reflecting her determination to overcome challenges and achieve her goals. By planning to retry her drivers test in the future, she shows resilience and a willingness to keep trying despite setbacks. The act of planting the plant represents a new beginning and a positive outlook towards the future, indicating that she is ready to face whatever obstacles come her way with optimism and perseverance.

This ending emphasizes the theme of never giving up, no matter the obstacles faced. Saeng's determination to try again in the spring encapsulates the message of resilience and the power of persistence in achieving success."
589	9453	4	3	The author concludes with this sentence for emphasis. It takes Saeng's mind off of the flower and she focuses on her test. By waiting until next spring to take the test it gives her something to look forward to. This statement also shows that you should never give up on anything that you do. The author ends on a good note explaining this, The last paragraph is also a break from the rest of the story and from what Saengës was just doing. It is Saeng's last and final thoughts.  As Saeng closed her eyes, she felt a sense of determination wash over her. She knew that waiting until spring to take the test was the right decision. It was a chance for her to grow, learn, and improve. With renewed focus and a heart filled with hope, Saeng was ready to face the challenges that lay ahead.

The cycle of growth and renewal will continue, and I will be there to embrace it with a renewed sense of determination and resilience.
591	9455	4	3	After a long and arduous journey, the lost hiker finally stumbled upon a clearing in the dense forest.

The hiker closed her eyes, listening to the peaceful sounds of nature surrounding her. In that moment, she felt a deep sense of gratitude for the beauty of the world and the resilience of the human spirit. And as the stars began to twinkle in the night sky above, she drifted off to sleep, knowing that she would rise with the sun to continue her journey, wherever it may lead.
592	9456	4	3	The author emphasizes the importance of maintaining the momentum of teamwork and hard work year after year, regardless of any changes that may occur. This consistency is crucial for continued success and progress.

593	9457	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too.
594	9458	4	3	Saeng took a deep breath as she looked around her new surroundings. She knew it would take time to adjust to this unfamiliar place, but she was determined to make it feel like home.

595	9459	4	3	"Saeng looked at the vibrant hibiscus blooming in front of her and felt a sense of determination wash over her. She whispered to herself, ""I won't give up."" The winter hibiscus, though not as beautiful as the ones back home, symbolized resilience and strength. It reminded her of the flowers she used to see along the lake, and it made her feel a connection to her roots. With renewed resolve, Saeng knew that she would continue to strive for her license, just like the winter hibiscus persevering through the cold months. She would not let setbacks discourage her, for she had found inspiration in the most unexpected of places. And as she gazed at the hibiscus, she felt a sense of homecoming that gave her the courage to face the challenges ahead."
596	9460	4	3	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think that the author includes this paragraph to show how persistent Saeng is. Saeng is persistent because she tries over and over again at this ""test"" and also she tries to get used to her new country. It demonstrates this in the story when it says the quote above. This quote shows that Saeng can try something and fail, then be determined to try and succeed again. Also in the story, Saeng has moved from one country to another. This is a huge jump and for her to be confident with herself is very persistent. The way the author concludes the story, with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" definitely portrays Saeng, the main character as a persistent person, and that is the purpose of the quote."
597	9461	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to ponder the implications of what has been said and to be left wanting more. By ending with a question or a statement that leaves room for interpretation, the author entices the reader to seek out further answers or continuation of the story. This type of conclusion serves as a hook, drawing the reader in and sparking curiosity about what comes next. It is a clever way to keep the audience engaged and eager to explore more of the narrative, ultimately leading to a deeper connection with the text and a desire to uncover the rest of the story.
598	9462	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. The author wanted to convey a sense of hope to show the growth of her character, and to show how things are going to change. In the last paragraph when she vows that she will take that test again it gives you a sense that everything will be okay. Earlier in the story she had been crying and missing her homeland, the tone was troubled and sad. This last paragraph suggests that the tone is now hopeful. Even though she failed the test she is still going to try again. The author also put the paragraph to show how much her character has grown. Saying that she will try again shows how much stronger and determined she is. Lastly, she had the story end with that paragraph to foreshadow what is to come. The geese coming back and the snow melting, and the hibiscus budding all show a change in the seasons. This represents the change that has occurred in her and it foreshadows that things will be different from now on.

By acknowledging the struggles she has overcome and embracing the idea of a new start, the author demonstrates strength and optimism in the face of adversity. This paragraph reflects a sense of hope and positivity, setting the tone for a brighter future filled with possibilities and opportunities for growth.
601	9465	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it meant a lot to Saeng. Saeng failed her driving test and was scared to tell her mother that she also spent nineteen dollars on a Dok Faeng-noi plant. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test, she sees a familiar plant. ""@PERSON1 uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. 'Dok Faeng-noi!' she said. 'Where did you get it?'"" Saeng's mother was excited to see the plant, and she expressed her happiness by saying, ""It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi. I'm glad you got it."" This moment of joy and appreciation from her mother made Saeng feel relieved and content despite her earlier disappointments."
602	9466	4	3	"Authors sometimes use intriguing sentences as their concluding sentence that readers may find challenging to fully grasp. In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author ends with Saeng making a silent vow to herself to retake a test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms again, indicating her need for further growth and learning. Saeng's mother expresses disappointment in her daughter's lack of experience in purchasing expensive items, particularly a plant, as shown through her incredulous reaction to the high price. The author uses these details to emphasize Saeng's emotional decision-making and the importance of learning from mistakes. Ultimately, Saeng must wait until the next year to try again and not repeat her past errors."
603	9467	4	3	Saeng eagerly awaited the arrival of spring, knowing that it heralded a time of new beginnings. Just like the hibiscus that bloomed anew each year, she too hoped for a fresh start.

Spring was a time for rebirth and growth, and Saeng was ready to embrace it fully. And so, she patiently waited for the arrival of spring, knowing that it would bring the chance for her own new beginning.
604	9468	4	3	I think the reason why the author ended the story with that paragraph was because that will be the time she thinks she will be ready to retake the driverís test. Before she made that move she was dishearted because she failed the test. Maybe she picked the spring time because that gives her time to get herself together and practice between them and the spring time.
605	9469	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

Saeng's resolve shines through as she commits to waiting a year to better prepare herself for the exam. Her unwavering determination will guide her towards success, as she focuses on her goal and works diligently towards achieving it. With patience and perseverance, Saeng is poised to conquer the test and overcome any obstacles that come her way.
606	9470	4	3	From the story of the girl who had recently moved from Vietnam to the United States, it is evident that adjusting to a new environment can be challenging, especially when it brings back memories of one's homeland. Despite facing difficulties and failing a test, Saeng's mother understands her struggle and offers comfort by allowing her to keep the hibiscus plant, a symbol of her connection to Vietnam. Saeng's longing for her home country is palpable, but she is determined to overcome the obstacles she faces in her new life. As she gazes at the budding hibiscus, a sense of hope and determination fills her heart, motivating her to strive for success and embrace her new surroundings while cherishing her memories of Vietnam.

Time to get warm and time to grow.
609	9473	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, Ho concludes the story with the paragraph due to the fact the flower represents her happiness from her home. The flower symbolizes the past and comfort, once Saeng began to dig the ""winter hibiscus"" In, ""she could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now,"" All of Saengís senses were beginning to return; she was happy. Likewise, the author uses the geese to explain the comfort of Saeng. The country around her began to feel like home. She became familiar with her surroundings. Many references to home were made throughout the piece because home is a place of comfort and happiness. Therefore, Saeng would gain more confidence, which explains the reason Ho concluded with that sentence.

The conclusion emphasizes the protagonist's resilience and commitment to preserving her cultural identity and memories, even as she navigates the changes and adjustments of her new environment.
613	9477	4	3	The plant served as a symbol of new beginnings, reflecting Saeng's vow to take better care of herself and her responsibilities. Caring for the plant was a lesson in patience and persistence, qualities she would need to cultivate in order to obtain her license. Through nurturing the plant, Saeng learned the importance of learning from mistakes and growing from them. As the plant thrived under her care, Saeng knew that she too could flourish and succeed with dedication and effort.
614	9478	4	3	"The author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life. ""I-I failed the test,"" Saeng had failed her driver's test and was very unhappy. She also disliked her new home. ""She was still too shaky to stay at home,"" she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up.

It is the natural progression of events, the culmination of her hard work and determination. Passing the test is not just a possibility, but a probability, given the circumstances.
617	9481	4	3	I believe that Saeng made that silent vow to herself because, after the plant goes through the hard winter and everything returns to how she likes it, the plant starts budding again. This process symbolizes her own struggles with moving. If the plant she loves so much can endure and thrive despite the challenges, then she too can overcome her difficulties. This silent vow serves as a reminder to Saeng that just like the plant, she has the strength and resilience to persevere and flourish in the face of adversity.
618	9482	4	3	"The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî concludes the story with the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî because it emphasizes Saeng's pain to come to an unknown place and fail her first test but also emphasizes Saeng's resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads ìAnd besides it was yet another old friend. a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.î This excerpt demonstrates Saeng's love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another example is when Saeng told her mother the bad news ""I-I failed the test"" @CAPS1 attention instantly was drawn to the flower and her mother could only be good.

He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would always be outside for every season. This perspective added a layer of depth to the character of Saeng and showed how he viewed his mother in connection to the changing seasons. It highlighted his attentiveness to her emotions and his desire for her to always be surrounded by the beauty of nature. This conclusion gave insight into Saeng's character and his relationship with his mother, leaving a lasting impression on the reader about the bond between them.
677	9541	4	3	Saeng failed her driver's test, but as she stood by the hibiscus plant, memories of her old home flooded back. The vibrant flowers reminded her of the place she had left behind. As she carefully planted the hibiscus, she glanced up and saw the geese with a new sense of familiarity. In that moment, she felt a connection to both her past and her present. The memories stirred by the hibiscus plant and the sight of the geese filled her with determination. She realized that she could adapt to her new surroundings while still treasuring the memories of her past. With renewed resolve, Saeng decided to give her driver's test another try, knowing that she carried pieces of both homes with her wherever she went.
678	9542	4	3	He was emphasizing the importance of perseverance and resilience, drawing a parallel between our struggles and the natural world. Just as plants endure the harsh winter months and bloom again in spring, we should also persist through challenges and keep pushing forward. Like the plants that eventually flourish with the arrival of warmer weather, our efforts will eventually bear fruit if we continue to persevere. So, no matter how tough the circumstances may seem, we must remember to stay determined and never give up, for just as the plants thrive in the spring, so too will we if we persist.
679	9543	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself.
680	9544	4	3	Saeng's lifestyle revolves around enjoying the warm climate and engaging in outdoor activities. The area they live in is known for its sunny weather, making it ideal for spending time outdoors. Saeng and their friends often take advantage of this by going on hikes, picnics, and beach outings. The warm weather also allows for a variety of sports and recreational activities to be enjoyed year-round. Overall, the pleasant climate plays a significant role in shaping Saeng's lifestyle and the activities they partake in.
681	9545	4	3	The author decided to finish the story with that phrase to show that she will wait for her next year and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and prove that she can do it one more time and that she is used to living there now.
682	9546	4	3	The author concludes the story in this way to symbolize a new beginning in the spring.

The change in season serves as a metaphor for personal growth and renewal, suggesting that the protagonist will emerge from her struggles stronger and more resilient. By ending the story in this manner, the author leaves readers with a sense of hope and optimism for the future.

But as spring approached, she noticed small buds forming on the plant, a sign of new life and growth. Inspired by this natural transformation, Saeng made up her mind to give the test another try. Just like the hibiscus, she too would have a fresh start and a chance to thrive in a more favorable environment. With renewed determination, Saeng prepared to tackle the test once more, ready to embrace the opportunity for redemption and success.
684	9548	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesnít come out and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, thatís for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things. The open-ended conclusion allows readers to create their own endings and imagine the possibilities for the character's future, engaging them in the story even after it has ended.
685	9549	4	3	The author ended the story with that paragraph because that paragraph says when she is going to try to take the test and make changes in her changing life. For example she is sad in the story because she failed the test and want to go home. If she passes in the spring she might try to make changes and live here. This is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. She is determined to give it another shot and see if she can turn things around for herself. This decision marks a turning point in her life, showing that she is ready to face challenges head-on and strive for a better future.
686	9550	4	3	In the spring, the geese return, their honking calls echoing across the tranquil landscape. Saeng watches them fly away, their wings beating against the sky, carrying them to distant lands. As she stands there, surrounded by the beauty of nature, she feels a sense of peace wash over her. The memories of her old life, once so painful and heavy, now feel like distant echoes in her mind. She has finally found a sense of belonging in her new home, a place where she can let go of the past and embrace the present moment. With each passing day, Saeng grows more comfortable with her new way of life, letting go of the pain that once held her back. As the geese disappear into the horizon, she takes a deep breath, ready to embrace whatever the future may hold.
687	9551	4	3	This last paragraph reveals something special to the reader. Saeng was given new hope through her winter mother's understanding and the hibiscus plant. She felt hopeless, miserable, and incomparable upon seeing the hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland. When she came home, however, seeing the roots of the plant buried in the ground gave her new determination. The flower represents her. It adapted to be able to survive in cold weather, or hard times, in Saeng's case. The roots are her past and although they are buried, they are not forgotten. The actual flower represents a new life for Saeng in a new country. The author, Minfong Ho, gave personification or humanizing to non-living things in the story, using the last paragraph to convey this powerful message.
688	9552	4	3	The author concludes the story by emphasizing Saeng's determination, linking it to the hibiscus plant and her surroundings. The mention of how the greenhouse transports her back to her childhood highlights the impact her environment has on her motivation and mindset. Saeng finds inspiration in the vibrant greenery, which serves as a reminder of her roots and past experiences. Just as the plants in the greenhouse come to life, Saeng feels a renewed sense of purpose and drive. This connection between her surroundings and her personal growth suggests that when everything else starts thriving, she too will achieve her goals. It is evident that Saeng's journey is intertwined with the natural world, drawing strength and encouragement from the beauty and resilience of the hibiscus plant.
689	9553	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" Saeng finds comfort in the plant after she failed her test. The plant reminds her of home and connects her with her past experiences. Even though she failed the test the first time she feels that if she studies and tries again she can pass. This connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring it's pretty and blossoms again. Saeng feels a connection with the plant's rebirth and feels she can start over again too and do well on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph that Saeng vows to take the test again when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms. Saeng's determination to try again mirrors the hibiscus's cycle of renewal, giving her hope for a fresh start and success in the future."
690	9554	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with Saeng vowing silently to herself that she will retake the test in the spring is because she is determined to succeed. Saeng is confident that with time and perseverance, she will be able to pass the test with flying colors. This ending shows Saeng's resilience and belief in herself, leaving readers with a sense of hope and determination for the future.
691	9555	4	3	As the hibiscus plant began to bloom, I felt a sense of hope and determination filling my heart.

The sight of the blossoming hibiscus served as a gentle reminder that with patience and perseverance, I could overcome any obstacles that stood in my way. I believed that the plant had a special power to guide me, and I trusted that its flourishing would signal the perfect time for me to try again. With the hibiscus by my side, I was certain that success was within reach, and I was prepared to face the challenge with renewed confidence and strength.
692	9556	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events in the story. Everything that happened to Saeng while she was at the florist is summed up into something resembling vengeance. The whole reason that Saeng was sad in the first place was that she failed her driving test. In the final paragraph, she vows to take the test again when the hibiscus buds. The hibiscus that Saeng bought will begin budding in the spring when the snows melt. The last paragraph of the story gives room for Saeng to deal with her nostalgia over the winter season. Finally, the geese that fly south make Saeng feel sad, but they light a spark within her. She tells herself that she will take the driving test again when the geese return, when the hibiscus buds, and when the snows melt.
693	9557	4	3	In the last paragraph, the author looks forward to the end of winter and the arrival of spring. With the return of the hibiscus, it will feel like home once again. The geese will also come back, prompting her to retake the quiz with renewed hope of passing. The upcoming season signifies a fresh start, and she anticipates performing better with the hibiscus blooming again. A new beginning is on the horizon, bringing with it a sense of optimism and opportunity for improvement.
694	9558	4	3	"I think the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" finished with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" because it is showing the importance of the plant and how it will help her pass. It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to pass her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and the geese return,"" the author is relating that to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggles to survive the winter. It also says, ""Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly receding into the distance."" This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge and overcome it. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng, and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what they started."
695	9559	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has meaning. The author is saying that when these animals and living creatures get their chance she too, will get hers. For example, the geese will get to return, the hibiscus will get it's chance to bud and she will get her chance to take her drivers test. I know this because Saengís mother starts talking about how great the plant will be in the spring. She even says, ìBut its strong enough to make it through the cold monthsî. This indicates that the mom is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance. That is why the story ends with that sentence.
696	9560	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the cyclical nature of seasons and how they bring about change. Just as winter follows spring, bringing a stark contrast in the landscape, the cycle continues with each season offering something new and different. The title ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves as a reminder that after the vibrancy of spring with its beautiful flowers, winter brings a sense of dormancy and change in the environment. The transition from spring to winter symbolizes the inevitable changes in life, where things may not always remain the same, but new beginnings can still emerge from every season."
697	9561	4	3	In “Winter Hibiscus,” by CAPS Ho, Saeng demonstrates perseverance as she continues to strive for success. The author concludes the story with Saeng expressing her determination to try again in the future, highlighting the importance of resilience, open-mindedness, and staying connected to one's roots. Saeng's decision to take the test again in the spring signifies a belief in second chances and the significance of her homeland in her journey. This inspiring ending reinforces the story's theme of never giving up and embracing new opportunities. Saeng's words serve as a powerful reminder to approach challenges with optimism and to always remember where we come from.
698	9562	4	3	The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam.
699	9563	4	3	When the plants start overgrowing and the geese come back, she will try again. The plants have to grow their petals back, and the geese have to make their home and find food again. She is determined to take the test again when the geese return and the plants flourish once more.
700	9564	4	3	"The author wrote the paragraph because she went back inside the house to get dinner and because she wasn't going to see the garden until the next day. With winter approaching, she knew she wouldn't be able to play outside anymore until the cold season passed. As she mentioned, ""In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This quotation perfectly encapsulates why the author chooses to conclude the story in this manner."
701	9565	4	3	I would have to say that the reason that the narrator ended with this is because it is kind of a solution if you think about it. And you donít put the solution any where else but the end that is why she put it there.
702	9566	4	3	The winter hibiscus was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their honking filling the crisp air. Despite the challenges she had faced, Saeng was not giving up. Tending to her garden had become a new hobby, a source of joy and purpose. With each day, she found herself looking forward to caring for her plants and watching them grow. As she stood there, surrounded by nature's beauty, Saeng felt a sense of peace and contentment wash over her. She knew that no matter what life threw her way, she had found solace in the simple act of nurturing life.
703	9567	4	3	The author ended the story with that specific quote because it shows the grasp in understanding the beauty & marvels of nature. Saeng spent a lot of money to buy a distinct flower called dok faeng-nol. Saeng was taking a driver's test a license but was failing it, and during her test she found that plant. Ashamed that she failed the test, she still showed her mother the flower she found, which was not like the one at home. Her mother is pleased with the flowers and understands that Saeng failed her test. Her mother said about the flower, ìIts flowers arenít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That what matters that was a figurative speech that there's hope for Saeng to pass her test again when she her learned more refined and is ready to try again. And with the geese flying away for the winter and coming back in the spring signifies a fresh new start at success. The cycle of nature mirrors the cycle of life, giving hope for new beginnings and opportunities to grow and succeed.
704	9568	4	3	"The author concludes this way because they believe that when the weather improves and becomes warm and pleasant outside, they will be in a better mindset to retake the test. The current weather conditions are described as ""nasty,"" indicating that the author may be feeling demotivated or uncomfortable due to the unpleasant weather. Therefore, the author plans to wait for a more favorable time to attempt the test again, suggesting that they believe environmental factors can impact their performance. By choosing to wait for better weather, the author aims to optimize their chances of success in the test."
705	9569	4	3	It is actually a very powerful last statement, Even though she failed her driverís test, she has realized that she will just have to keep being strong and be patient. Soon the geese will come back and the snow will melt, and she will ìreturnî to take her test and will  be determined to pass. Saeng  bought the hibiscus to feel as if she were back in Vietnam, and felt as if it could fill that place in her heart were she misses it. ìI paid nineteen dollars for  itî. She  says it like she was disappointed  in failing the  test but also that saying which is free back in vietnam was so expensive in the united states. A hibiscus flower is tropical so when it blooms in the spring will be when she becomes ready to give the test a second try.
706	9570	4	3	The author concludes the story with this ending because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that.
707	9571	4	3	"In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The drivers test is not the main problem, itís adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much heartache. For example, in lines @NUM1 Saengís thoughtís are ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stang Saengës eyes now and swept over her ìandî in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept.î This piches that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because itís gone. I think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said ìand this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.î It means that she will overcome all that and move on."
708	9572	4	3	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion thatís why the author concludes that paragraph in the story. Saeng's connection to the hibiscus symbolized a sense of renewal and hope, which could inspire her to try the driving test once more with a positive mindset. The blooming of the hibiscus in spring could serve as a reminder of new beginnings and the possibility of success, giving her the motivation she needed to tackle the test again. This natural cycle of growth and rebirth mirrored Saeng's own journey towards achieving her goal, making the timing of the hibiscus bloom significant in her pursuit of obtaining her driver's license.
709	9573	4	3	The hibiscus flower served as a reminder for Saeng that she too can weather the challenges of her new environment. Just like the resilient flower that blooms along the lake even in the winter, Saeng can find the strength within herself to thrive in this new country. Despite her setback with the driver's test, she is determined to grow and adapt with the changing seasons. The hibiscus symbolizes hope and resilience, inspiring Saeng to face whatever obstacles come her way. With the support of her family and the determination to persevere, Saeng is ready to embrace the new chapter of her life with courage and optimism.
710	9574	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is blooming, then I will take that test again. Saeng had purchased the hibiscus plant as a reminder of her hometown, drawn back into her childhood world by familiar plants. Despite bad weather delaying her planting, she remained determined to try again in the spring when the hibiscus would once again bring memories of home flooding back.
711	9575	4	3	The author concludes the paragraph like this because it shows that she is not going to give up. This is evident as she silently vowed to herself that she was going to take the test again during the spring. Additionally, it was the audieres, not the gains in old year's seeds, that was motivating her. In conclusion, the determination and perseverance of the author shine through in her decision to continue striving for success.
712	9576	4	3	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho concludes with Saeng silently vowing to retake the test in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return, giving herself time to adjust to the new challenges.

The changing seasons symbolized new beginnings and opportunities for growth, fueling her resolve to try again. As she gazed at the hibiscus, she felt a sense of hope and renewal wash over her. With a steady gaze and a heart full of courage, Saeng was ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead on her journey to success.
716	9580	4	3	"The author concludes the story this way to show she will be alright, and remain determined. The way she speaks of future times shows confidence that she will make it till spring.

And with that determination in her heart, she was certain that she would emerge victorious, stronger than ever before."
717	9581	4	3	The author concluded the story with this sentence because she enjoys nature more than school. She finds solace in the beauty of the outdoors, where she can escape the pressures and stress of academic life. The peacefulness of nature brings her a sense of calm and rejuvenation that she cannot find within the confines of a classroom. For her, the freedom and tranquility of the natural world are more fulfilling and rewarding than the structured environment of school. Ultimately, her love for nature surpasses any academic pursuits, making it her true source of joy and contentment.
718	9582	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the flower, the hubiscus, has been a recurring theme throughout the narrative. The protagonist has been waiting for the hubiscus to bud before taking the test again, indicating a sense of hope and renewal associated with the blooming of the flower. The hubiscus serves as a symbol of growth, resilience, and the passage of time. By mentioning the hubiscus in the concluding paragraph, the author brings the story full circle, emphasizing the importance of patience, perseverance, and the beauty of nature in the protagonist's journey. As the hubiscus finally begins to bud, it signifies a new beginning and a fresh start for the protagonist, mirroring the cycle of life and growth in the natural world.
719	9583	4	3	When the snow finally melts, I know it will be time to roll up my sleeves and start all over again. Rebuilding the greenhouse will be a labor of love, a chance to create something new and beautiful from the ruins of winter. I will carefully tend to each plant, nurturing them back to life as the sun grows warmer and the days grow longer. And as I watch the first shoots of green push their way through the soil, I will be reminded once again of the resilience of nature, and the simple joy of seeing something grow and thrive under my care. The cycle will continue, as it always does, and I will be ready to embrace it with open arms.
720	9584	4	3	I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is almost familiar to her now. Saeng's resilience and perseverance are evident as she prepares to face the challenge once more, showcasing her unwavering determination to succeed despite the setbacks. In the face of adversity, she remains steadfast, ready to embrace whatever changes come her way. This ending underscores the theme of resilience and adaptability, highlighting Saeng's ability to overcome obstacles and thrive in the midst of change.

By choosing to start over and cultivate new beginnings, she is taking a crucial step towards healing and transformation.
723	9587	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, ìI failed the test,î (Ho) shows that Saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes Saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence.

When she seeís the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus. The hibiscus brings back memories of her childhood. She then takes it home and shows the plant to her mother. Her mother replies with a ìYou what?î hearing her daughter tell her how much it is. With the hibiscus bringing something of importance she acquires more hope.

727	9591	4	3	"The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because it appeared to be an important thought to ""Saeng"" and it was basically the main cause of everything rather the main subject of the story.

So the last sentence seemed to fit in as a comfort zone to make the reader a bit more relieved.
730	9594	4	3	"The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time ""when the snow melts."" Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, ""Saeng broke down and wept!"" The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the ""snow will melt"" and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, Saeng refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as ""yet another old friend."" If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using the theme of hope to drive home that We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he concludes that to make a hopeful home is a life lesson of courage."
731	9595	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî ends the story with this paragraph because it reveals the importance of the Winter Hibiscus. In the story Saeng moves from Vietnam and feels very homesick. She fails her drivers test and is very upset. When she sees the familiar plant she is reminded of her home in Vietnam. The Winter Hibiscus reminds Saeng of fond memories with her grandmother and simple things such as her fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red petals in her well water. When seeing the familiar plant, ìSaeng felt a shock recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. î This shows how important the hibiscus was to her. The author ended the story with that paragraph to show how the winter hibiscus is a comfort to Saeng and will encourage her to do better on her next driverís test. The Winter Hibiscus serves as a bridge between Saeng's past and her present, providing her with a sense of solace and connection to her roots in the midst of her struggles in a new country.
732	9596	4	3	"After reading ""Winter Hibiscus,"" I can tell that Saeng is a determined person who has a strong connection to nature. Her determination is evident as she strives to pass her driving test, even after initially failing. The author concludes the story with Saeng coming across a familiar plant on her walk home, which transports her back to her childhood memories. This final paragraph serves to remind us of the reason she walked home in the first place and how this unexpected encounter with nature brought back nostalgic feelings. Without failing her test, Saeng would have never experienced this moment of reflection and connection with her past. The author's choice to end the story in this way emphasizes the importance of embracing unexpected detours in life and finding beauty in the simple moments that surround us."
733	9597	4	3	The author concludes the story by suggesting that next spring will bring another opportunity for Saeng. Just as the blooms of the hibiscus plant will return, Saeng will have another chance to take the test. This leaves a cliffhanger, indicating that there is more to Saeng's story yet to unfold. Despite her struggles with change, Saeng's mother's encouragement lifts her spirits. As winter passes, Saeng looks forward to the fresh start that the next spring will bring, offering her another shot at success.
734	9598	4	3	When they come back, then I will take the test again because Saeng needs time just as the hibiscus to grow. Saeng didn't do well on a test but says she will try again after snow melts and the spring comes. After moving Saeng feels alone and wants to go back home but she feels in her heart that she can try given time. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of the flower back in her home country, this helps her see that she has to let go of her past and live in the now. As she waits for the return of her family, Saeng finds solace in the beauty of the hibiscus, a symbol of resilience and growth. Just like the flower, she knows that with time and patience, she can overcome her challenges and bloom once again in her new surroundings.
735	9599	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself that she would not let this setback deter her. She knew that she had the capability to overcome this challenge and succeed. With determination in her heart, she made a promise to start fresh and give it another try. Reflecting on her experience, she felt a sense of growth and resilience. Saeng was ready to face whatever obstacles came her way, knowing that she had the strength to persevere. This moment was just a stepping stone on her journey to achieving her goals, and she was prepared to embrace it with open arms.
736	9600	4	3	The author concludes the story with a sentence about retaking her test when the geese are back and the hibiscus is budding because they each represent something else. The geese represent change because they change their environment in the winter just like Saeng changes her environment by going to the plant place. The hibiscus reminds her of home because at her home there are similar plants. The hibiscus budding represents a new life just like the one Saeng has to live in a new home. Overall, the sentence that the author ends with is used to show Saeng's life as compared to the geese and hibiscus.
737	9601	4	3	Saeng was thrilled as the snow melted away, eagerly anticipating the arrival of spring. She looked forward to the sight of animals frolicking in her garden and the graceful return of geese after their long hibernation. With everything coming back to life, Saeng was confident that she would pass the test this time.
738	9602	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plant the flower. Saeng really likes this hibiscus, and she doesn't want it to die in the winter time. Saeng patiently waits for the arrival of spring, eagerly anticipating the moment when she can once again nurture her beloved flower and watch it bloom in all its glory. The hibiscus symbolizes hope and resilience for Saeng, reminding her that even in the darkest and coldest of times, there is always the promise of new beginnings and growth. And as the winter finally fades away, Saeng's heart is filled with joy and determination as she prepares to care for her precious plant once more.
739	9603	4	3	"The author concluded this story with this paragraph because she wanted to show how the flower gave the little girl strength. The girl was in a new place and back at home where she is from, there are a lot of beautiful flowers that she loved to look at. Being in a new place that doesn't have these flowers really gets her down and has her upset. She misses her home, so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers. For example, the girl says, ""It's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."" here she stops because she is so upset that she can't say home. The flower she has right now isn't real, but when the real one blossoms in the spring, seeing the flower will comfort her and give her confidence to retake the test."
740	9604	4	3	"The authorís conclusion explains her feels. The authors conclusion saids to me ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test"" again"", what means is that she is a newoman. For example, taking the test means that she will change. Also what it means is that she ready to take on new thing. For instance, the test to her is getting ready to take on a new thing. Thats what I got from the conclusion."
741	9605	4	3	Saeng had been through so much, but as she looked out at the world beyond her window, a glimmer of hope flickered in her eyes. Despite all the challenges she had faced, she knew that there was still a chance for her to overcome them. The thought of a future filled with possibilities brought a smile to her face. Perhaps, just perhaps, with determination and perseverance, she could make her dreams a reality. And as she closed her eyes, she pictured herself standing in a lush garden, surrounded by blooming flowers and thriving plants, a testament to her resilience and strength. In that moment, Saeng knew that no matter what obstacles lay ahead, she would face them head-on with unwavering hope in her heart.
742	9606	4	3	"I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. This final paragraph draws together and unites all the final paragraph on concluding idea. It tells us that in the spring when everything is coming to life Saeng will find the strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in thelast paragraph show how Saeng and her mother have adapted and that new things are started in the spring, as well as new possibilities. In the text it says, ìI know"", her mother said quietly. ìIíve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Itís flower arenít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.î This means and represents that even though life is different here away from Saeng home they will adapt and survive in their own way."
743	9607	4	3	"The author concludes the story the way she does because it shows that Saeng needs to heal from the failing of the test before she can take it again. Saeng already knows that she can heal. She realizes that she has gotten used to where she now lives, that things in her new land, like the sound of geese, are now familiar to her. The narrator of the story says, ""...she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now."" Things in Saeng's new home had been strange to her at first, but she had healed and gotten used to them. Saeng has also healed from leaving her original home of Vietnam. She was sad to leave her home, ""A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."", but she had healed. Saeng remembers the flowers that she had known in Vietnam as ""old friends"", showing that it did not hurt her to remember them. When Saeng heals from failing her driving test, like she had healed when moving from Vietnam to the United States, she can re-visit the test, without pain. Saeng's journey of healing and adaptation allows her to face challenges with a renewed strength and perspective, ready to overcome obstacles that come her way."
744	9608	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng, was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saengís mother says, ìIts flowers arenít as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,íí I think Saengís mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng. It's almost as if sheís saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change. Like anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try harder to pass it next time. Saeng isn't going to give up and sheíll keep holding on to make it through. Saeng knows itís hard to adjust to changes in life, but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, sheíll be able to get situated in this new place.
745	9609	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It is a promise she made to ensure that her garden can flourish once more after the harsh winter. By waiting for spring, she can assess the growth of her plants and ensure they are safe for consumption. Saeng's determination to retest her garden reflects her commitment to providing healthy and nourishing produce for herself and others.
746	9610	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.

The hibiscus blooming symbolized her own growth and transformation, ready to tackle any test that lay ahead. Saeng's determination and perseverance shone through as she looked towards the future with hope and confidence.
747	9611	4	3	The Hibiscus is a flower that represents beauty and vibrancy with its bright colors and intricate petals. Its budding signifies growth and renewal, making it a symbol of new beginnings and fresh opportunities. In the world of flowers, the Hibiscus stands out for its natural allure and unique charm. Its presence in gardens and landscapes brings joy and a sense of tranquility, making it a favorite among flower enthusiasts. The Hibiscus truly is a remarkable flower that captures the essence of nature's beauty in all its glory.
748	9612	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that was how he wanted the story to end. He wanted to end the story with her talking to herself, pondering the events that had transpired and contemplating her next steps. It was a way to provide closure to the narrative and leave readers with a sense of reflection on the character's journey. This internal dialogue served as a window into the character's thoughts and emotions, allowing readers to connect more deeply with her experiences and decisions. It was a poignant way to bring the story to a close, leaving a lasting impression on the reader's mind.
749	9613	4	3	"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus"". In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the United States. She has various remembrances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says ""In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again"". This shows Saeng's desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng's emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."
750	9614	4	3	Because she was promising herself that when spring comes back, then she will take the driver's test again, she had set her sights on a specific goal. With the arrival of spring, she knew it was time to conquer her fears and doubts about driving. The promise she made to herself was a commitment to face the challenge head-on and prove to herself that she could pass the test. As the flowers began to bloom and the weather warmed up, she felt a renewed sense of determination and motivation. Spring symbolized a fresh start and a new beginning, giving her the courage to pursue her goal with confidence. With each passing day, she prepared diligently, studying the rules of the road and practicing her driving skills. Finally, when the day of the test arrived, she felt ready and composed. As she sat behind the wheel, she took a deep breath and remembered the promise she had made to herself. With focus and determination, she successfully completed the test, fulfilling her commitment and proving to herself that she was capable of achieving her goals. Spring had indeed brought not only new beginnings but also a sense of accomplishment and empowerment.
751	9615	4	3	Saeng's determination to retake the driving test is fueled by the resilience of nature that she witnesses. The return of the geese and the budding hibiscus symbolize perseverance and renewal. Just like these natural elements, Saeng is determined to overcome her setback and succeed. Failing the test may have momentarily shaken her confidence, but the sight of nature's unwavering determination inspires her to try again. With a newfound sense of resolve, Saeng is ready to face the challenges ahead and prove to herself that she can succeed in her new environment.
752	9616	4	3	Saeng had already taken the test once, but as winter arrived and the flowers and plants withered away, she knew she would have to wait for them to bloom again before she could try again. Determined to prove to her mother that she could pass the test, Saeng spent nineteen dollars on a plant called dorl Faeng-noi. She hoped that by nurturing this plant, she could show her mother that she was capable of success. However, when her mother saw the plant and the amount of money Saeng had spent on it, she was disappointed. Nevertheless, Saeng remained determined to try again and prove herself when the time was right.
753	9617	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that when she sees the things from her home and living, it will comfort her in what she does. The author seems like she needs things from her homeland that help her make the best of things and bring back good memories of earlier life. I think that whenever I want to do a good job It helps to think of the good things that mean a lot to me so I will be happy and want to do good. The author is smart to want to see those things for her to retake her test because if she sees her plant doing well and sees the memory of the geese again it will be good luck for her.
754	9618	4	3	The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driverís test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, ìaware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengís eyes now swept over her. ìThrough the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. ìThe pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and Saengís mouth watered,î, ìThe winter hibiscusí was in the ground nowî, and, ìoverhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and ñ yes ñ Familiar to Saeng now.î This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. It summarizes Saengís newfound hope that she will learn to not just live in her new home, but to thrive in it.
755	9619	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this statement because it shows that to her the hibiscus symbolizes overcoming obstacles. It symbolizes this because she says ""...and the geese return and this is budding, I will take that test again"" (Ho @NUM1). This shows that even though she failed it this time when the hibiscus gets bigger she will retake the test, it shows perseverance in overcoming obstacles. Also, I believe that this symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it gives her strength from her old country. This shows that it symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it will help her overcome this test by providing her with strength and comfort. From this, you can tell that the author ends the story with this statement."
756	9620	4	3	Saeng was filled with a sense of determination as she walked back to the testing center. She knew that she had prepared to the best of her ability, and she believed in herself. The confidence that had been missing before was now radiating from her, giving her the strength to face the test head-on. With a newfound sense of self-assurance, she was ready to conquer whatever challenges lay ahead. Saeng took a deep breath, pushed open the door, and stepped inside, ready to show the world what she was truly capable of.
757	9621	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a test. ""I-I failed the test,"" Saeng said. This shows that she was taking a test about gardening. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was about spring, gardening, and the life of it to them. The paragraph talks about spring, and flowers. The daughter and mother live off of the plants by planting vegetables, and fruits."
758	9622	4	3	"The last paragraph of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho is important as it provides a definite ending for the reader. It signifies a new beginning and fresh start for the protagonist. The hibiscus, geese, and melting snow symbolize this new chapter in her life, giving her hope for the future. The author concludes by highlighting the significance of these symbols in helping her protagonist start over and embrace a new beginning."
759	9623	4	3	Saeng was very distraught knowing that she didnít pass the test and to her she felt as though it was a letdown or disappointment. This sentence shows the ambition and determination that Saeng has so that she will be able to pass this test. Despite the setback, Saeng was determined to study harder and prepare more effectively for the next opportunity to prove her knowledge and skills. She knew that with perseverance and dedication, she could overcome this challenge and achieve success in the future.
760	9624	4	3	"When they come back, they find Saeng has changed significantly since the beginning of the story. Initially, she described her new home as ""walking into another world,"" having moved from Vietnam to the United States as a teenager. The winter Hibiscus plant was a link between her past and present, offering familiar scents that filled her lungs and connected her to her previous life. The difficulty of adjusting to her new environment was evident, as even saying the words ""at home"" brought tears to her eyes. However, once the winter Hibiscus was planted, it transformed Saeng's perspective, helping her appreciate her current circumstances. The author chose to end the story with this reflection on the plant because it symbolized Saeng's growth and newfound appreciation for her life."
761	9625	4	3	"I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of showing how Saeng is adopting to her new home, yet still valuing her old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says, ""when the snows melt and the geese return"" this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also says, ""when this hibiscus is budding,"" and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam. Therefore, I feel that the author is showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this statement."
762	9626	4	3	I think that the author is saying that during winter, the hibiscus plant must endure the cold weather while other plants may not survive. The hibiscus stands strong in the face of winter, showing resilience and strength in unfavorable conditions. Despite the challenges of the season, the hibiscus continues to thrive, symbolizing perseverance and determination in the midst of adversity.
763	9627	4	3	I think the author includes this because she doesnít want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then ìI will take the test again.î This quote is saying she may have failed the test with the plant, but she is never going to give up. When spring comes, she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you donít know or understand, such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelled, it gave her old feelings about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so used to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. Seeing all this caused Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion, I feel as though the author added the paragraph at the end for understanding and to let you know that Saeng may be in a new place with a new culture, but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.
764	9628	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" purposely included the last paragraph to symbolize re-birth and a fresh start for the main character, Saeng. The mention of the snow melting, geese returning, and hibiscus budding signifies hope and a new opportunity for Saeng to succeed with her driver's license test. This sense of renewal and possibility provides a sense of completion to the story, offering a glimpse of a brighter future for Saeng as she navigates through her challenges."
765	9629	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to provide context and background information about the main character, Isaeng, and her family's recent move to the United States from Vietnam. This information helps the reader understand the circumstances surrounding the events in the story and allows for a deeper connection with Isaeng's experiences. By including this detail at the end of the story, the author ensures that the reader has a clear understanding of the setting and characters, wrapping up the narrative in a cohesive manner.
766	9630	4	3	"I believe the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" ends the story like she did because Saeng agrees to take the test again when spring arrives. Saeng plans to wait until the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding before attempting the driver's license test once more. She sees the winter hibiscus as a symbol of strength and resilience, something that can withstand the cold months. Moving from Vietnam to a new place, Saeng finds comfort in the idea of the winter hibiscus, using it as a guiding light as she prepares to try again in the spring. By waiting for the right time and drawing inspiration from the winter hibiscus, Saeng is determined to succeed in her goal."
767	9631	4	3	"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because its resembling that her mother is refreshing, waking, and restoring its self. And Saeng said she would retake the driving test when that happens. She was really sad she failed. ""I - I failed the test,"" she said, seeming embarrassed and sad. So that last paragraph does a good job describing what Saeng is going to do. She is going to look on the bright side of things and restore herself to come back and pass the test."
768	9632	4	3	I the narrator this paragraph in the story because hibiscus is a valuable plant and a garden is your own decision if you like to grow things like her mother grows hot pepper. A garden is a way to explore different types of foods you can plant and the different plants in the world like roses, lilies, and other plants. Each plant has its own beauty and purpose, adding diversity and vibrancy to your garden. It is a rewarding experience to watch these plants grow and flourish under your care, bringing joy and color to your surroundings. So, whether you choose to plant hibiscus or hot peppers, creating a garden is a personal choice that can bring beauty and fulfillment to your life.
769	9633	4	3	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driverís test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle. Saeng knows that just like the hibiscus blooms beautifully after facing the harsh winter, she too can overcome her challenges and achieve success. With determination and perseverance, Saeng is ready to tackle the driver's test once more, inspired by the resilience of the hibiscus plant.
770	9634	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how much the experience truly means to her and to emphasize that she is determined to try again. This demonstrates her commitment and dedication to the task at hand, highlighting her genuine care and concern for the outcome. Ultimately, this final paragraph serves to underscore the importance of perseverance and the willingness to keep striving for success, no matter the challenges faced.
771	9635	4	3	She ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to let everyone know she feels most comfortable in the spring. It also states that she cannot wait for the geese and the hibiscus to start budding because it is her favorite time of the year. The spring season brings a sense of renewal and growth, with nature coming back to life after the cold winter months. The blooming flowers, chirping birds, and longer days bring a sense of joy and optimism that she looks forward to every year. The warmth of the sun on her skin and the gentle breeze in the air make her feel alive and connected to the world around her. Spring is a time of new beginnings, and for her, it is the most magical time of the year.
772	9636	4	3	Saeng is feeling out of place in her new surroundings and is struggling to adapt to the changes since moving. However, she finds solace in a hibiscus plant that reminds her of her home in @LOCATION2. Despite the initial shock at the price she paid for the plant, Saeng's mother understands her daughter's longing for @LOCATION2. Saeng expresses her determination to retake her test in the spring, indicating a shift in her attitude towards living in @LOCATION1. With a renewed sense of purpose and a connection to her roots through the hibiscus plant, Saeng is ready to embrace her new life and make the most of her current situation.
773	9637	4	3	The author concludes that the geese are coming back. This indicates that the changing of seasons is upon us, and the return of the geese signifies the arrival of a new beginning. The anticipation of their return brings a sense of renewal and hope for what lies ahead. As the geese make their journey back, it serves as a reminder of the cyclical nature of life and the constant ebb and flow of time. Just as the geese come back year after year, so too do opportunities for growth and transformation present themselves in our lives. Embracing the return of the geese can serve as a metaphor for embracing change and welcoming new possibilities.
774	9638	4	3	The author concludes that because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. She moved to a place where she didnít like and knew no one. The author is trying to tell us no matter what, donít give up, have faith. At the end, Saeng has faith in herself that she can pass the test next time. She may have realized that just because you're in a place you don't want to be, it doesn't mean you can't go on. It is important to keep believing in yourself and pushing forward, even in challenging circumstances. Having faith and perseverance can lead to success, even when faced with adversity.
775	9639	4	3	The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you can't just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. That's why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that. This determination and resilience portrayed by Saeng can serve as a valuable lesson for readers, encouraging them to persevere in the face of challenges and setbacks. Life is full of ups and downs, but what truly matters is the willingness to keep trying and never giving up, just like Saeng's decision to return and try again.
776	9640	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that plant, it brought back memories of her old home and showed how much she missed it there. By saying she'll do the test again, it shows that she doesn't want to let this defeat her in her new home and her new life. She is determined to overcome her homesickness and make new memories in her current surroundings.
777	9641	4	3	The author concludes Saeng's journey in the story by highlighting her vow to overcome obstacles. Despite feeling like a failure after failing her driving test, Saeng finds courage in her hibiscus plant, symbolizing resilience. The geese in the story represent the importance of perseverance and never giving up, inspiring Saeng to keep trying her hardest to succeed. This demonstrates that Saeng does have the ability to overcome challenges and achieve her goals with determination and a positive mindset.
778	9642	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. ""...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng. This parallel between the budding hibiscus and Saeng's determination to try again creates a sense of hope and resilience, reminding us that new beginnings are always possible. It leaves the reader with a feeling of optimism and the belief that with perseverance, anything is achievable."
779	9643	4	3	When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eye now swept over her. She wants to be able to handle the loss better. The author wants to emphasize that the story is not yet over.
780	9644	4	3	There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, itís the end of the story so itís a good way to end it because itís the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and itís short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. Itís not like most endings to a story so itís unique. Because most stories arenít about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph.

784	9648	4	3	The author ended the story with the paragraph in order to show that Saeng is looking forward into her life and with a positive outlook. It shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore. The hibiscus is used as a device for this storyís plot. When changes happen with the hibiscus, changes happen in the story. At first, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees it, she remembers her past and is sad. Once she plans it, things start to look up.

The author concludes the story in a symbolic way that helps express the storyís themes.

The winter season had been harsh, making it difficult for plants to thrive, but Saeng was determined to overcome the challenges.

788	9652	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because to tell us that she will try and find that flower to bring back memories of her old home. To show us that they will be coming back again it will survive even though it's not from where she wanted it to be from. In the story, it says, ""I failed the test,"" meaning Saeng had bought the hibiscus that wasn't real or what she thought was not what she wanted it to be. In the last paragraph she says she will take that test again. Saying she will find winter hibiscus that is how it used to be in the homeland. She's hoping they survive and hoping she finds a flower like it because in that last paragraph it says, ""Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" meaning she hopes and prays she will find one like her old homeland."
789	9653	4	3	The Author was trying to end the story quick thats why he ended it with this one. The sudden resolution left readers with unanswered questions and a sense of abruptness. It would have been more satisfying if the Author had taken the time to provide a more detailed and thought-out conclusion to tie up loose ends and provide closure for the characters and plot. This rushed ending may have left readers feeling unsatisfied and wanting more from the story.
790	9654	4	3	When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant new seeds. The author concludes that because she didnít do good on the test the first time. But next year she is going to work with her plants then take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he donít want people to think that she just worries about the plants. She wants to show that she is determined and focused on improving her academic performance while also nurturing her passion for gardening. By balancing her priorities and setting goals for both her studies and her plants, she is demonstrating resilience and a strong work ethic. With dedication and perseverance, she is confident that she can succeed in both areas of her life.
791	9655	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng, her mother, and her grandmother share a deep love for flowers. Their days are filled with planting and tending to these beautiful blooms, finding joy in picking and arranging them. Saeng, however, feels a sense of unease when it comes to her mother, unable to meet her gaze directly. This unspoken tension adds a layer of complexity to their otherwise harmonious relationship centered around their shared passion for flowers."
792	9656	4	3	The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confidence in herself. Although she did not pass the test, she could take it again and know she can pass. She was upset about it, but when her mother talked to her, she felt good and confident to retake the test. This is why the author chose to end the story with that saying, highlighting the importance of self-belief and perseverance in overcoming challenges.
793	9657	4	3	When winter is over and the geese return from the south, bringing with them memories of her old country, she eagerly awaits the arrival of her favorite plant. As it starts to bloom once again, she is filled with a renewed sense of determination. This time, she feels more confident in pursuing what she had set out to do before. With the changing seasons, she finds the strength to try again, knowing that this time, success may be within reach. The return of the geese and her favorite plant symbolize a fresh start, a new beginning filled with hope and possibility.
794	9658	4	3	Saeng was determined to pass her driver's test, despite the initial setback. Like the geese facing hardships, she too would face the challenge again.

The drive to succeed burned brightly within her, propelling her towards the next attempt with unwavering resolve. Saeng was ready to face the test once more, knowing that with perseverance and resilience, she would eventually overcome any obstacles in her path.
795	9659	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author ends the story in a well-mannered fashion. The author's final paragraph suggests that Saeng is determined not to give up, even though she is far from home. At the beginning of the story, Saeng was in a downward spiral after failing a test, and the hibiscus plant stirred up feelings of nostalgia. Upon returning home, her mother greeted her with kind words and cooked her favorite foods, such as mild peppers and bitter melons. This act of kindness lifted Saeng's spirits and helped her see the positive aspects of life, giving her the confidence to believe that she could pass the test."
796	9660	4	3	"Well in the story, Saeng fails her driving test. When she is walking home she sees a familiar plant, she then goes to a florist and finds out the plant is called a hibiscus. She then buys the plant with the little money she has because it reminds her of her homeland and childhood. It also reminds her of her grandmother who she left behind so now she is connected to the plant. Also she sees geese fly overhead heading south for the winter, so she says ""When they come back,"" so she means when the geese fly north for spring. And when ""the snow melts,"" so when it becomes warmer and starts spring. When ""this hibiscus is budding,"" so when spring comes and the plant starts to bloom she will ""take that test again,"" so she says she will take the driving test that she failed when spring comes. She gives herself the winter to practice and get ready for the test. She vows to herself that come spring she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass."
797	9661	4	3	She said this to show the determination it takes to make it no matter how many times you fail you need to get back up and try again. She displays her courage in this way also, it takes a lot for someone to fail something and to get back up and try again on it. She isn't willing to accept failure, and she's trying to redeem her failure, so she says she'll try again. That is why she ended the story that way. It takes great resilience and inner strength to face failure and not give up, but instead, push through the challenges and keep trying until success is achieved. This mindset of perseverance and determination is what sets individuals apart and ultimately leads to personal growth and success.
798	9662	4	3	As the days grew longer and the snow began to melt, she knew that spring was approaching. With determination in her heart, she made a promise to herself that she would take the test again in the spring. The thought of studying harder and preparing more diligently filled her with a sense of hope and motivation. With renewed resolve, she looked forward to the challenges that lay ahead, knowing that she was ready to face them head-on.
799	9663	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes by highlighting the significance of the hibiscus flower to the protagonist. The flower symbolizes good luck and holds sentimental value, reminding her of her grandmother's essence. As winter approaches and the flower fades, the protagonist decides to wait until spring when the hibiscus blooms again before taking an important test. The rich, sweet scent of the flower serves as a comforting presence, connecting her to cherished memories. The hibiscus becomes a beacon of hope and a source of strength for the protagonist, guiding her through challenging times."
800	9664	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the same thing next year. She had enjoyed the experience so much that she couldn't wait to repeat it. The excitement of planning and executing the event brought her joy and fulfillment. As she walked away from the scene, she knew that this was not the end but just the beginning of a tradition she would continue to uphold. With a smile on her face and a twinkle in her eye, she looked forward to the next year's celebration, already envisioning how she could make it even better than before. The anticipation of the future filled her with hope and excitement, as she knew that this annual tradition would bring her joy for years to come.
801	9665	4	3	The author concludes the story with that because she wants to retake the test. She wants to pass the test for her mother. So she brought home the flower to apologize to her mother. Feeling remorseful for failing the first time, she is determined to study hard and make her mother proud by succeeding in her second attempt at the test. The flower symbolizes her sincerity and determination to do better, showing her mother that she is willing to put in the effort to achieve success. With a renewed sense of purpose, she sets out to retake the test and prove to her mother that she can overcome challenges and reach her goals.
802	9666	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because everything in the story will repeat such as the season changes and you will not be able to plant nor grow in the winter. For example she talked about how the plants are nothing like her home, but she has to adapt to the fact sheís not home, & adjust to her environment. I say this because if she doesnt she will just be an unhappen person worrying about where she came from.
803	9667	4	3	The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and depressed because she wants to go home. She is nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says ìIn the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.
804	9668	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding, then I will take that test again.
805	9669	4	3	"In ""Hibiscus"" by the author, the last paragraph is chosen because it aligns with the overall tone, hope, and representation of the essay. The tone throughout the story is one of sadness and disappointment, as the protagonist fails her driver's test and is overwhelmed by memories of her homeland when she sees a winter hibiscus. The plant serves as a poignant reminder of her past, making her yearn for the familiarity of Vietnam. As she reflects on the changes she has experienced over time, she realizes that what once seemed strange has now become familiar through the passage of seasons. The winter hibiscus triggers a deep emotional response in Saeng, leading her to tears and making it difficult for her to even utter the word ""home"" without breaking down. Despite the overwhelming emotions evoked by the plant, the final paragraph hints at a glimmer of hope as Saeng looks towards the coming spring and the possibility of trying again. This sense of renewed hope and resilience in the face of adversity ties back to the themes of the essay, making the last paragraph a fitting conclusion to the story."
806	9670	4	3	This was a very interesting story that depicted all the hardships the young girl, Saeng, had gone through. The author ended the story in a thought-provoking way, leaving a sense of hope for the future. The use of descriptive words throughout the story allowed the reader to feel Saeng's pain and struggles. The comparison of her hardships to the harsh winter, and the eventual melting away of the snow, symbolized a brighter future ahead. Despite the challenges she faced, there was a sense of optimism and resilience in Saeng's journey. The author did a great job of conveying the message that even in the darkest times, there is always the possibility of a new beginning, just like the blossoming of flowers in spring.
807	9671	4	3	"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She feels that when the hibiscus blooms she can too bloom by passing the test. Also Saeng is relating herself to the hibiscus. ""Its flower ain't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through in here, this winter hibiscus."" Her mother is trying to tell her she can be strong also. She too can make it through the cold months. Like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. Just like the geese, Saeng is realizing to be proud of herself and there will be other chances. Don't always doubt yourself because there will be other chances. Don't be afraid to try again."
808	9672	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home. After the winter passes, she will return to ensure the plant's well-being and to continue nurturing it with the same love and dedication as before, strengthening the connection between her current life and cherished memories of her hometown.
809	9674	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about the geese because it shows how Saeng, like the geese, will adopt to her new environment. It shows that she will do what needs to be done in order to survive just like the geese have to do. She will take the test again and will not give up. The paragraph shows how she wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states, ìÖ she noticed the tearstains on her daughterís cheeks and her puffy eyesî[No]. This example shows how Saeng is not used to being in the new country and that she does not like it. However, she will get used to it and do her best to do so, as shown in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, ìÖshe admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Macî[Ho]. This proves how even though she may not like things at times, Saeng is willing to try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, ìÖshe realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now ì[@NUM1].Saeng is getting more and more used to her surrounding and is adopting to them, just like the geese adapt, which is the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese. Just like the geese find a way to survive and thrive in their environment, Saeng will do the same in her new home.
810	9675	4	3	The reason why the author wrote the conclusion paragraph was to show that Saeng is looking forward to a brighter future. Saeng is hoping to see the geese once more that remind her of her homeland and that she wants to pass the driving test. In this story, I feel as though Saeng is a very sentimental person and so that is why I think that is the reason the author wrote the conclusion paragraph. Saeng's optimism and determination to overcome challenges indicate that she is ready to embrace new opportunities and create a fulfilling life for herself in her new home. The author's emphasis on Saeng's hope for the future serves to highlight the resilience and strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity. With the image of the geese symbolizing freedom and resilience, Saeng's story ends on a hopeful note, suggesting that she is prepared to navigate the uncertainties of her new life with courage and determination.
811	9676	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph in the story to emphasize the resilience and determination of the protagonist, drawing a parallel between her experiences and the continuous growth of a flower despite facing challenges. It serves as a reminder that no matter the hardships faced, one should persist in pursuing what they believe is right, just like the flower's unwavering return after enduring tough conditions.
812	9677	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for a reason. The hibiscus reminds her of Vietnam. The geese remind her of her home now. These two things make her strong. Therefore, she will take the test when they return. She thinks she can pass the test when the flower and the geese are in her life. The memories of Vietnam and the comfort of her current home blend together to give her the courage she needs to face the upcoming challenge. With the hibiscus and the geese by her side, she feels ready to tackle whatever obstacles come her way.
813	9678	4	3	Saeng had always been more interested in tending to the school garden than focusing on her studies. However, as the end of the school year approached, she realized that she needed to start taking her school work more seriously. She spent hours after school each day catching up on assignments and studying for exams. Saeng's hard work paid off when she received her grades and saw a significant improvement from the previous term. She felt a sense of pride in her accomplishments and knew that by prioritizing her school work, she was setting herself up for success in the future. Saeng had learned the importance of balancing her passions with her responsibilities, and she was determined to continue working hard to achieve her goals.
814	9679	4	3	"Saeng was discussing the testing of her plants to see if they were to the geese' liking. This was evident when she mentioned the geese in the previous paragraph and how they showed approval by saying ""yes"" to the newly planted hibiscus. By observing the geese's reactions to the plants, Saeng could determine their preferences and ensure that the garden was a welcoming environment for the feathered visitors."
815	9680	4	3	"Saeng gazed at the budding hibiscus with a sense of nostalgia, reminiscing about her homeland and the memories it held. As she watched the vibrant flower slowly unfurl its petals in the warm spring breeze, she made a silent vow to herself. ""When this hibiscus blooms in all its glory,"" she whispered to herself, ""I will be ready to face the test once again."" The hibiscus, with its delicate beauty and resilience, served as a symbol of hope and renewal for Saeng, inspiring her to continue striving towards her goals. With a renewed sense of determination, she knew that just like the hibiscus, she too would bloom brightly in the face of adversity."
816	9681	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is looking towards a new beginning. She mentions that she will be taking the test again, indicating a fresh start and a chance to improve. This ending provides a sense of hope and determination for the future, leaving the reader with a feeling of anticipation for what is to come.
817	9682	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind because she found a flower that reminds her of homeland. She is afraid that her parents are going to be mad at for not passing the test, therefore she buys a flower that she sees for it reminds. When she gets home and telling her mom how much she paid for the flower and how she didnít pass, mother is upset for only a second, then she is understanding of what her daughter is going through. By the end of the story she has more confidence that she will succeed next time.
818	9683	4	3	"Minfong tto ended the story with a phrase dialogue because it was about the main topic of the story. Saeng was to buy a plant and bring it home, but when she did so, her mother did not approve. The narrative states ""You what?"" Her mother stared at her incredulously""(Ho). When her mother said this, it showed that she was displeased. The narrative states, ""I-I failed the test""(Ho). Saeng was not proud to displease her parents in any way. By saying, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again""(Ho), the author is just showing Saeng's love and want to grow for her parents; it shows maturity. Saeng's determination to try again and make her parents proud demonstrates her growth and willingness to learn from her mistakes. This resolution signifies her commitment to improving and striving to meet her parents' expectations, reflecting her strong character and inner strength."
819	9684	4	3	"Saeng realized her mistake after failing the test and decided to retake it once the snow melted. She was determined to correct her errors and succeed this time. ""I will take that test again,"" she affirmed, eager to show that she had learned from her previous experience. As the winter days passed and the snow began to thaw, Saeng prepared herself for the challenge ahead. With a newfound sense of determination, she set out to conquer the test that had once defeated her, confident that this time, she would emerge victorious."
820	9685	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant was not budding, the geese were going away, and she failed the test, all of which made her sad. However, when the snow melts, the geese return and the plant starts budding, she will be happy again. In this state of happiness, she will take the test again and pass because her spirits are lifted.
821	9686	4	3	The author concludes the story this way for many reasons. One reason is to show Saeng is not going to give up and keep trying to pass her test. Another way is to show that even though your life has changed that donít mean that you have to give up. These are some of the way that the author concludes the story like he does.
822	9687	4	3	"I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they wanted to show that she is committed to her nature, especially to the hibiscus. She thought that the hibiscus was special because of what she did with it. Like when they said ""she reached out and touched petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center."" And that's why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She had found a connection with the hibiscus that was unique and meaningful to her, symbolizing her deep-rooted attachment to nature and her appreciation for the beauty it holds. The gentle touch on the petal represented her delicate yet profound relationship with the natural world, highlighting the importance of staying true to oneself and embracing the wonders of the environment. In that moment, she felt a sense of peace and belonging that she knew could only be found in the simplicity and purity of nature."
823	9688	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's determination and the symbolic significance of the budding hibiscus. Saeng believes that taking her driving test when the hibiscus is budding will be the right time for her. This decision showcases her perseverance and readiness to face challenges. The budding hibiscus serves as a metaphor for growth and new beginnings, highlighting Saeng's journey towards achieving her goal. The concluding paragraph captures the essence of Saeng's character, leaving readers with a sense of hope and anticipation for her future success.
824	9689	4	3	She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring. The hope that the hibiscus plant represents gives her the strength and determination to keep going, knowing that just like the plant, she too can overcome challenges and bloom beautifully.
825	9690	4	3	The author concludes the last paragraph in the story as a moral to the story, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and trying again until one succeeds. Without this final paragraph, the message of the story would not be fully understood. The protagonist's determination to try again when the time is right conveys a powerful lesson about resilience and the pursuit of one's goals.
826	9691	4	3	Saeng is a very helpful young lady to her mom. She makes things easier for her by taking care of tasks around the house and providing support whenever needed. Saeng's willingness to assist her mom shows her kind and caring nature, making her a valuable asset in their household. With Saeng's help, her mom can rely on her for assistance, creating a strong bond between them. Saeng's dedication to helping her mom highlights the importance of family support and unity in overcoming challenges together.
827	9692	4	3	The author concludes the story with that sentence because she wanted to explain to you that she will do this again when the hibiscus is back in season. As the vibrant colors of the hibiscus bloom once more, she will find herself drawn back to the peaceful garden, eager to capture its beauty on paper once more. The cycle of nature's beauty and her artistic inspiration will continue, just like the changing seasons. And so, with the promise of new beginnings on the horizon, she looks forward to the next chapter in her creative journey.
828	9693	4	3	I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is comfortable around the flowers, plants, and greens. This suggests that being in a natural environment helps her feel at ease and more focused, possibly leading to better performance on the test. Being surrounded by nature can have a calming effect on individuals, reducing stress and anxiety levels. Therefore, it is understandable that she prefers to be in a familiar and soothing setting while taking the test. Ultimately, creating the right environment can play a crucial role in achieving optimal results.
829	9694	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again which means that when she gets older and gets more confidence then she will blossom and get to take the test when she is ready just like the hibiscus will be ready to start budding again.
830	9695	4	3	The Author ends the story off with that paragraph because when dealing with flowers and nature, there are seasons when the flowers don't come up like winter for example. The paragraph is saying in the spring when the winter is over she tells herself that she will look forward to seeing all the plants that nature has to give. This sense of anticipation and hope for the future is a common theme in the cycle of nature, where each season brings its own beauty and renewal. By looking forward to the coming of spring and the blooming of flowers, the author is expressing a sense of optimism and appreciation for the wonders of the natural world. In a world that can often feel chaotic and unpredictable, finding joy in the simple pleasures of nature can bring a sense of peace and connection to something greater than ourselves. Ultimately, the author's reflection on the changing seasons serves as a reminder to embrace the beauty and impermanence of life, finding solace in the cyclical nature of the world around us.
831	9696	4	3	I believe he used this as the ending to ensure that she was strong and she would do whatever it took to persevere. Perhaps he wanted to leave her with a sense of empowerment, knowing that she had the inner strength to overcome any challenges that came her way. It was a message of resilience and determination, a reminder that she was capable of facing whatever life threw at her. This closing line served as a beacon of hope and a call to action, encouraging her to stand tall in the face of adversity and never give up on her dreams. It was a powerful way to conclude their conversation, leaving her with the belief that she had the power to shape her own destiny.
832	9697	4	3	The author includes this sentence in the paragraph because it signals a shift in focus towards a new perspective on the topic at hand. This transition sets the stage for exploring different angles and expanding on the ideas previously discussed. It serves as a bridge between the introductory context and the upcoming analysis, guiding the reader smoothly into the next phase of the discussion. By introducing this new beginning, the author ensures a coherent progression of thoughts and maintains the reader's engagement with the text. This deliberate choice in structuring the paragraph helps to maintain clarity and organization in the overall narrative, allowing for a seamless transition between ideas and enhancing the overall impact of the writing.
833	9698	4	3	In the story, Saeng purchases a hibiscus plant as a way to hold on to her memories of her old home. By planting it in her new garden, she is attempting to recreate a piece of her past in her new surroundings. This act symbolizes her desire to blend the familiar with the unfamiliar, showing her determination to adapt and find comfort in her new environment. Saeng's decision to retake the test in the spring further demonstrates her resilience and refusal to give up, highlighting her optimism for the future. Ultimately, the hibiscus plant serves as a reminder that while change may be inevitable, it is possible to find ways to hold on to what is important and make a new place feel like home.
834	9699	4	3	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus is budding. This is done to symbolize the many things that Saeng learnt. For example, she learnt she has to adjust to changes in her life and becoming familiar to the new things. The geese and snow she admits are the things that were ìstrange before [and] had become familiar to her nowî. The hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past, and comfort when needed. The last paragraph symbolizes many things, and if you look into it deeply, you will learn what Saeng learnt. Saeng's journey has taught her the importance of adaptation, resilience, and finding solace in familiarity amidst change. The symbolism of the geese, snow, and hibiscus encapsulates her growth and determination to face challenges head-on. As she looks towards the future with renewed confidence, Saeng's decision to take the test in the spring signifies her readiness to embrace new beginnings and opportunities with courage and grace.
835	9700	4	3	The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was ìMadagascar periwinkleî in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obstacles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flowerís significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today.
836	9701	4	3	The reason why I believe the author concluded the story like that is because she is always ready to start over. In the story, she mentioned failing a test and initially thought about giving up. This ending signifies her resilience and determination to keep pushing forward despite setbacks. It shows that she is not defined by her failures and is willing to persevere and try again. This conclusion highlights the theme of resilience and the importance of not giving up when faced with challenges.
837	9702	4	3	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because the author is trying to say that Saeng is going to start all over again just like the hibiscus would. Even though you go through bad times in your life just step and do it over again until it becomes better. The author also concluded the story with that paragraph because the paragraph pretty much starts the story all over again that like Saeng was going do.
838	9703	4	3	She means that when she returns, she is going to repeat the same task to determine if she can achieve better results.
839	9704	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself that in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, she would retake the test. Her mind wandered as she thought about the fallen hibiscus blossom, distracting her from the task at hand. Her mother, focused on the plants, brushed the green fragments off Saeng's hands without a word. Saeng carefully planted the 'winter hibiscus,' her mind drifting to images of geese. Her mother's presence brought a sense of calm, and Saeng decided to send a note to retake the driving test. The story of Saeng, a teenage girl from Vietnam adjusting to life in the United States, continued to unfold without mention of her family.
840	9705	4	3	"The author included this paragraph to show how much the girl missed Vietnam. When the girl saw the hibiscus it brought back memories of Vietnam. Seeing the hibiscus allows her to find comfort. So the paragraph is there to show how the United States is different from Vietnam. Since the United States has changing seasons it allows the girl to get used to the United States. The plant will always be there, but she has to look for the good that United States provides. The author states, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This quote shows how the girl was getting used to the United States. How she will always remember Vietnam, and finds things in the United States that remind her of Vietnam. In conclusion, the paragraph is used to show how much the girl missed Vietnam, but how she finds comfort within the United States. As time passes, she begins to appreciate the unique beauty and rhythm of her new surroundings, gradually finding a sense of belonging in this unfamiliar land."
841	9706	4	3	He will return, just like the geese that always come back. Their presence is constant, a reassuring cycle of nature that we can rely on. In the same way, he will reappear in our lives, bringing with him familiarity and comfort. Just as the geese migrate with the changing seasons, he will come back to us when the time is right. We can take solace in knowing that his absence is only temporary, and soon enough, he will be by our side once again. Like the geese returning home, he will find his way back to us, bringing warmth and joy back into our lives.
842	9707	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One being that she is still uncomfortable about talking about her old home. ""She was still too afraid to say the words at home."" So, the snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all serve as reminders of her home. Saeng mentions, ""Just as she knew it would feel... Back home, it just grows wild, just from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs."" These reminders give her comfort and confidence. Therefore, the author ends with this paragraph because when the geese, hibiscus, and the snow melting remind her of home, that is when she will take the test again, when she is confident and strong."
843	9708	4	3	When Saeng failed the test, she was miserable and heartbroken. However, after buying the hibiscus, she found hope and motivation. She decided, in the end, that she would take the test again in the spring, when the snow melted, the geese returned, and the hibiscus was budding. This hope at the end of the story helped put the reader at ease, knowing that Saeng was determined to overcome her obstacles. The author's message was clear - never give up, and find motivation in the simple things. It is important for both readers and writers to understand the purpose of a story and to express ideas clearly to an audience.
844	9709	4	3	"I think that the author uses this quote, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. ""But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?"" ""BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone,"" from Vietnam to a foreign land. One night she had so much hope, like abundance, then the next she is in a foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on, there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come, birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and light to her, and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle easier to get over and everything bearable."
845	9710	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng. In the springtime the hibiscus grows just like Saeng. When Saeng got to the new place she was small and puny just like the plant. ""Its leaves quavering in the wind"" (@NUM1). This quote tells us that the plant was weak and puny. If the plant was strong, it would not be quivering. The fact that Saeng broke down and bought the plant tells us she was not strong. And at the end, the author uses that paragraph to tell the reader that the hibiscus is strong and so is Saeng and they can overcome anything. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's journey of growth and resilience, mirroring the strength she finds within herself to face challenges and thrive in her new environment."
846	9711	4	3	The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says ìNot like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, ìÖ and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. Saeng's perseverance and deep connection to her past drive her to keep pursuing her goal, symbolized by the hibiscus, showcasing her unwavering determination and resilience in the face of challenges.
847	9712	4	3	In this story, the author concludes in a way that aims to create a comfortable tone for the character to approach the test again. The individual preparing to retake the test may have chosen this tone based on past experiences, possibly influenced by teachings from their parents or grandparents. Taking the time to prepare themselves indicates a sense of determination and a willingness to improve. By setting a tone that feels familiar and comfortable, the author suggests that the character is ready to face the challenge once more, armed with valuable lessons from the past. This approach not only conveys the importance of resilience and perseverance but also highlights the significance of drawing upon personal strengths and wisdom when navigating obstacles. Ultimately, the tone chosen by the author serves as a reminder that with dedication and a positive mindset, one can overcome challenges and achieve success.
848	9713	4	3	"The author concluded this because she thinks this is the right time to re take the test. She adds this because the snow is melted, the hibiscus is budding, and the geese return is a perfect time because everything is back and warm. She says ""when they come back...then I will take the test again.î means she will have all confidence to take the test. Saeng voweds to take it again and she will and she thinks this time she will pass. That's what the author concludes this to the story. Now, with the promise made and the signs of nature aligning, Saeng feels ready to face the test once more, with a newfound sense of confidence and determination."
849	9714	4	3	"The Author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope and the meaning of the hibiscus to Saeng. The author also ends the story like that because spring is a time for new beginnings and where everything comes back to life and starts to regrow so to say that when the snow melts and geese return. ""Its. saying its the right time for a second chance. I.t failed the test Saeng said.....She tore off a leaf shruddy it to pestsî. that shows the dying of the hope she had or the hibiscus symbolized it. So thatís why the author ended it like that b/c it shows new beginnings."
850	9715	4	3	Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, a moment that symbolizes her determination to succeed and fulfill the promise she made to her mother. It is a poignant reminder of the strength and resilience that lies within her, as she faces the challenges ahead with courage and hope for the future.
851	9716	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. This decision marked a turning point for Saeng, a determination to persevere and overcome the obstacles that had previously held her back. As she looked out at the world slowly awakening from winter's grasp, she felt a renewed sense of hope and purpose. The symbolism of the changing seasons mirrored Saeng's own journey of growth and transformation. With each passing day, she grew stronger in both mind and spirit, preparing herself for the challenges that lay ahead. And when the time finally came to face the test once more, Saeng was ready, armed with a newfound sense of confidence and resilience. The cycle of nature had come full circle, and so had Saeng, proving that with patience and perseverance, anything is possible.
852	9717	4	3	In many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such occurrence is in the short story ìWinter Hibiscusî. In the story the young girl finishes of by telling us when she will be taking her test again, although not directly to us as it says ìSaeng vowed silently to herselfî but it still informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last ìvoweî is to inform not only the reader of the future but to show the girls determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For example, when it says ìand this hibiscus is buddingî its showing the girls connection with the plant because of the comfort and canfidence it given her, ecpecially since she needs to take the test. In conclusion the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl was with her the flower and the homeland.
853	9718	4	3	In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that ìwhy they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome.
854	9719	4	3	After they come Saeng was silently to herself, In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is Saeng then I am take that test again. She say this sentence she is herself back to home. She thinks it familiar to Saeng was. She is herself how quiet it vowed to so every season. Her live is very quiet and leavy. She feels as of place. Due to failing her driving test things herself was thing for her to united state was so different from Vietnam and she expresses her feelings will she talk a about this something flower. In the midst of this quiet and unfamiliar environment, Saeng finds solace in the changing seasons and the promise of renewal they bring. The hibiscus flower symbolizes hope and the opportunity for a fresh start, motivating her to overcome her challenges and strive for success. Saeng's journey is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of nature to inspire growth and transformation.
855	9720	4	3	Saeng's journey from failing the test to successfully planting the hibiscus in the winter is a testament to his determination and resilience. Despite initial setbacks, he never gave up and continued to work hard towards his goal. It was through his perseverance and dedication that he was able to achieve success in the end. This story serves as a reminder that with hard work and perseverance, anything is possible.
856	9721	4	3	She concludes this story with a newfound sense of determination. The flower she received serves as a symbol of her strength and resilience, reminding her of her home and the support she has there. With this newfound self-awareness and belief in herself, she feels ready to face the challenges ahead and complete the task at hand. The journey may be difficult, but she is now equipped with the confidence and courage needed to succeed.
857	9722	4	3	The author concluded the story with this because just like the flower it will come back a new, and so will she. The flower represents determination, using the flower to show her own determination. Even though she failed her drivers test she still has determination to take it, and try to pass again. Even with failure she is determined to get over it. Just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back. Saeng is forgetting her failure and coming back a new. Just as the flower blooms again after the harsh winter, she too will rise above her setbacks and start afresh with renewed determination.
858	9723	4	3	"The author uses this paragraph as a symbol of realization, and a new beginning for Saeng. She spent so much time missing the past that she didnít know how to enjoy the present, which thematically conveys the message to ""live in the moment."" The hibiscus represents strength, as her mother said, ""It's strong enough to make it through the winter months... thatís what matters."" The author ultimately suggests that tough times are inevitable, so holding onto the moments that bring joy can help one persevere through difficult times. This symbolism of the hibiscus serves as a reminder to cherish the present and find strength in moments of happiness."
859	9724	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story, Saeng vows to herself that when winter is over, she will take the test again. This foreshadows a hopeful future for Saeng, indicating that she will take the time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before attempting the test again. It also demonstrates Saeng's courage and perseverance in facing challenges. When Saeng offers to help her mother dig a hole for the plant that represents her pastime, it shows her love and care for her family. The vow at the end of the story highlights Saeng's commitment and determination to succeed despite previous failures."
860	9725	4	3	The author puts that excerpt into the text to show the reader that she had made a mistake an will fix it in the future. I believe the other put it in  for that reason because in the text Saeng began to cry when she admitted to her mother that she failed the test. This shows that she was really upset by the fact she failed an hopes to improve in the near future. Another reason why I believe ëthe author concludes the story like this is to lead the reader on to believe Saeng is going to get over being homesick. Saeng's emotional reaction to her failure and her determination to do better in the future suggest that she is resilient and will overcome her challenges, including her homesickness. This ending sets the stage for Saeng's growth and development as she navigates through difficult times and emerges stronger on the other side.
861	9726	4	3	"The author ends the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the passage ""When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time. I think the hibiscus she bought comforted her and made her think of her homeland so she thought when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. The plant made her think positively. And instead of thinking she will fail, she is thinking she will pass the next time. I also think Saeng felt comforting her when she was upset, and I think that helped her feel a lot better."
862	9727	4	3	"The author concludes this story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" with that paragraph as a sign of reassurance. Saeng had just had a rough day after failing her driver's test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse, she says, ""That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?"" Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is a time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life."
863	9728	4	3	There is a sense of cyclical repetition in the ending of the story, suggesting that the protagonist's actions will continue in a never-ending cycle. Each season brings its own tasks and responsibilities, and the character seems resigned to the fact that this routine will repeat itself indefinitely. The mention of winter coming again implies a sense of inevitability and the eternal nature of the character's duties. This conclusion emphasizes the idea that life is a continuous loop of actions and events that will always circle back upon themselves.
864	9729	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Saeng's reliance on the hibiscus as a symbol of hope in her life reflects the profound connection she has with her culture. The choice of words used by the author emphasizes how Saeng's existence revolves around the delicate balance of nature and her inner strength. The hibiscus serves as a reminder of resilience and determination, guiding Saeng through life's challenges with unwavering faith. In the face of adversity, Saeng finds solace in the promise of renewal and growth, mirroring the cyclical nature of the seasons and the eternal hope they bring.
865	9730	4	3	Saeng watched as her mother carefully planted the winter hibiscus outside their house. The vibrant red flowers brought back memories of her childhood in Thailand, where these flowers bloomed abundantly. As she looked at the plant, Saeng couldn't help but see a reflection of herself. Just like the winter hibiscus, she was in a new environment, trying to take root and grow.  Saeng had recently moved to America and was struggling to adjust to the new language and culture. She had failed her English test, but she was determined to try again. Just like the plant needed time to adapt to its new surroundings, Saeng knew that she needed time to improve and succeed.  As the days passed, Saeng watered the plant diligently, watching it slowly grow and blossom. She saw herself in the plant, both of them facing challenges but determined to thrive. Saeng knew that just like the winter hibiscus, she would eventually find her place and flourish in her new home. The plant served as a reminder that growth takes time, but with patience and perseverance, success is possible. And as Saeng looked at the blooming flowers, she felt a renewed sense of hope and determination for her own journey ahead.
866	9731	4	3	Saeng realized that many of the things she had once found strange had become familiar through the quiet repetition of seasons. She understood that her initial perceptions had evolved over time, leading to a newfound sense of comfort and understanding. Despite any challenges she may face, Saeng remained determined to continue trying the test again, confident in her ability to adapt and grow through experience.
867	9732	4	3	A vow is a good ending, she vowed to take the test again because she failed it. It expresses how she feels and she made a commitment to pass. The author wanted to show a lot of feeling and how desperate she was. So she saw tons of beauty to keep her going. She promised herself that she would study harder, seek help if needed, and give it her all in order to succeed on the next attempt. This determination and perseverance would be her guiding light as she prepared to tackle the test once more.
868	9733	4	3	"When they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She buys the flower because she failed the drivers test. She has seen the familiar plant on her way home as she went to a florist shop to try to buy one. The flower makes her happy and reminds her of home. The author ends the story the way he does because it leaves hope, so that the story doesn't end sad. She still has hope of passing the drivers test. As she carefully tends to the delicate hibiscus, she imagines the day when she will finally succeed. The vibrant colors of the flower give her strength and determination to try again, knowing that with patience and perseverance, she will eventually achieve her goal. And so, with a renewed sense of optimism, Saeng looks forward to the coming spring, ready to face the challenge once more and prove to herself that she is capable of passing the test."
869	9734	4	3	She failed the test at the same day that she got the plant and saw the geese fly over. The plant and the geese represent symbols to her. The plant represents her home, where she used to live and the geese could represent how they are moving on in life, overcoming the obstacles of cold weather and snow to move on to something better, most likely a warmer climate. All of this is a symbol of a new beginning for her. So she wanted to take it again, around the time of a new beginning; when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels that since she failed, she should start over. This new beginning will give her the opportunity to succeed and move forward in her life, just like the geese flying over and the plant growing symbolize.
870	9735	4	3	The author included the story to emphasize the importance of perseverance and resilience in the face of failure. This addition serves to highlight the idea that setbacks should not deter individuals from trying again and striving for success. It also adds depth to the narrative, providing a real-life example of someone who overcame obstacles and achieved their goals through determination and hard work. Ultimately, the story serves to inspire readers to keep pushing forward, even when faced with challenges, in order to ultimately achieve their dreams.
871	9736	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author includes a paragraph where Saeng silently vows to herself that she will try planting the hibiscus again in the spring. This decision shows Saeng's determination to adapt to her new surroundings and her commitment to caring for the plant. By deciding to take the test again when the snows melt and the geese return, Saeng demonstrates her willingness to learn from her mistakes and try again. This determination to try planting again in the spring highlights Saeng's growth and resilience in the face of challenges."
872	9737	4	3	Saeng is determined to retake the test next spring, fueled by the hope instilled by her winter flower and the presence of her flock of geese. She firmly believes that this time, she will pass the test. The sight of buds blooming on her hibiscus will serve as a sign for her to attempt the test again. The initial disappointment of failing the test did not deter Saeng; instead, it motivated her to work harder and strive for success in the future. With her unwavering determination and positive outlook, Saeng is confident that she will achieve her goal when she attempts the test again in the upcoming spring.
873	9738	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng will take her driving test again. She says she will ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that saeng has new. found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again."" But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. ""Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng even buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again. By concluding with that paragraph, it shows Saeng's change in emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives her.  Saeng's journey from a place of despair to a place of hope is beautifully reflected in the symbolism of the hibiscus plant. It serves as a reminder of her homeland and a source of strength as she navigates her new life. The author's choice to end the story with Saeng's determination to try her driving test again when the hibiscus is budding encapsulates the theme of resilience and renewal, highlighting Saeng's newfound sense of hope and possibility."
874	9739	4	3	"The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, ""It's flowers aren't pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months - this winter hibiscus."" It shows that the mother wants saeng to learn that saeng should be strong even in times of difficulty. Another example is, when the narrator says, ""she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season..."" It shows that saeng realized that the new place that she's leaving right now is almost the same as their old home - In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be strong and follow the flow of life."
875	9740	4	3	In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test againî Saeng thinks to herself. Saeng finds herself in a new place where she has no friends. She finds comfort in a plant shop one day when she comes upon a Hibiscus flower. The flower calms her spirit and helps her begin to adjust to the changes in her life at this time. As she gazes at the delicate petals and vibrant colors of the Hibiscus, Saeng feels a sense of peace wash over her. The flower's beauty and resilience inspire her to face the challenges ahead with courage and grace. Each day, she visits the plant shop to admire the Hibiscus and feel its calming presence. Through this simple connection to nature, Saeng finds solace and strength as she navigates her new environment. The Hibiscus becomes a symbol of hope and renewal for her, a reminder that beauty and growth can emerge from even the most difficult circumstances. And when the time comes to retake the test she once feared, Saeng does so with a newfound sense of confidence, knowing that like the Hibiscus, she too can bloom and thrive in any season of life.
876	9741	4	3	The author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring, she will take her driving test again for one main reason. The girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over, she will start over too. In the essay Saeng, the young girl says, ìWhen they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.î Saeng failed the test the first time, She is going to wait until spring so that she can have a fresh start. In the essay, the ìwinter hibiscusî reminds Saeng of her grandmother and her home in LOCATION1. This at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time. Her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her driverís test again in the spring. When spring comes, just like the hibiscus blooming anew, Saeng will approach her driving test with renewed determination and a fresh perspective, drawing on the warmth of her memories to guide her forward.
877	9742	4	3	The author ends it with that paragraph because the girl is talking about when the @DATE1 or spring comes again she will try again. The author ends it with that because it explains how the girl feels about spring and the animals. The girl says a lot about the geese in the story, so we know from that she likes animals.

The mention of spring symbolizes hope, renewal, and a fresh start, all of which are important themes in the girl's story. It is a fitting conclusion that ties together the girl's feelings about nature and her determination to keep trying despite setbacks.
878	9743	4	3	Then author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sums up how the memories and the plant effects her. Just like the plant Saeng grows better in her own country and likes it better there but she can still survive in a new place if it is taken care of and fights to stay beautiful. The ending shows that Saeng realizes that if she trys harder she can survive like the plant, so she is going to take the test agian. Her mother say, ìIëve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arenít as pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months here.î Her mother is trying to tell the daughter its ok and she get through the hard times. In the end Saeng knows she can.
879	9744	4	3	In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, ìwhen they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents the ideas of resilience when faced with challenge, and the determination to adapt and succeed. Saengís situation is similar to the flowerís, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faced with the obstacle of failure in regards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home. Just as the Hibiscus blooms again in the spring, Saeng is determined to overcome her challenges and thrive in her new environment.
880	9745	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She knew that with a fresh start in the new season, she would have a better chance at success. Saeng was determined to put in the hard work and effort needed to achieve her goal. As the winter days passed, she eagerly awaited the arrival of spring, ready to face the challenge once more. And when the hibiscus finally bloomed, signaling the change of season, Saeng was prepared to prove herself and show everyone what she was capable of.
881	9746	4	3	"I know the reason why the author concludes the story the way he does and it is a good reason. It says that since she failed this year, next year when it is time to ready up the garden she will try again. That is a good moral because you have to keep trying and trying to succeed because even if you fail, you are not losing any progress. It is like what @PERSON1 had happen to him. Even though it took him @DATE1 tries to successfully make the light bulb, he simply said, ""I just found out @NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb."" So I do agree with this author and how he ended the story."
882	9747	4	3	She does this to show her struggle with her gardening battle. Each year, she has to work on her garden because the winter blows it away, killing the plants and flowers she has worked so hard to cultivate. This constant cycle of rebuilding and rejuvenating her garden reflects the resilience and determination she possesses in the face of nature's challenges. Her perseverance in tending to her garden mirrors her inner strength and ability to overcome obstacles, making her gardening efforts not just a hobby but a testament to her unwavering spirit.
883	9748	4	3	The author ending the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng wont give up. Saeng wants to make her mother proud so she is gonna try to do whatever it takes. All Saeng trys to do is make her mother happy. When she failed her mother was disappointed. Then suprisingly understanding. When Saeng told her mother she failed Saeng started to cry, but then her mother wiped the tears away. Saeng knows she needs to keep trying and never give up on making her mother proud.
884	9749	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it signifies that the protagonist will wait until the next spring to take the test again when the shovel grows again, the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud once more. This decision shows a sense of patience and determination in facing challenges and overcoming obstacles. It also highlights the cyclical nature of life and the opportunity for renewal and growth that each new season brings. By choosing to wait for the right moment to try again, the protagonist demonstrates a willingness to learn from past experiences and strive for success in the future.
885	9750	4	3	In the story the test was if she could overcome her homesickness. When she went to the greenhouse all of the plants and flowers brought back memories of her homeland. When she saw the flower, it reminded her of the times she would get water from the well and a flower was floating in it. So after the winter, she would go back to the place and see if she was still homesick. I feel she ended it that way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up and try again. The connection to her past and the determination to overcome her homesickness will drive her to keep trying and eventually find peace in her new surroundings.
886	9751	4	3	I think the author adds the last paragraph because the story could use a little part about Saeng. And what she is planning to do next. Also the author @MONTH1 have added that paragraph because she was maybe thinking about writing a second story of winter Hibiscus, and they wanted to write a part that could be about in the next story. It would make you wonder that if she does take the test again would she pass it this time after the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. I think this @MONTH1 be why the author added this paragraph in the story.
887	9752	4	3	I think the author concluded the Story with these lines because Saeng feels more confident. First, when Saeng first saw the hibiscus, she was sad, but after seeing the flower, she got happy. Next, her mother helps her plant it and Saeng is sure it'll be there in spring. Finally, Saeng feels better since she has reflected on her past, realizing that growth and new beginnings are always possible.
888	9753	4	3	"I think Minfong Ho concluded her story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the way she did to show the avid determination of Saeng, the main character. She failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test. Now that she had a moment of her homeland and her family there she was most likely reminded that they would've wanted her to succeed, and so she promises herself that she will take that test again when the hibiscus plant starts budding. This is why I feel that ""Winter Hibiscus"" was concluded in this way."
889	9754	4	3	"At the end of the essay ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, it ends in a positive manner. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The reason why I think that the author decided to put that there, was to show how Saeng felt about her country. So when the country that she is has spring again, she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring. Which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least take the test. That's why the author put that sentence at the end of the essay. In the end, Saeng's determination to retake the test in the familiar setting of spring symbolizes her hope and resilience in overcoming challenges, ultimately finding a sense of belonging and comfort in her new home."
890	9755	4	3	Saeng promises herself that ìIn the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's childhood and her longing for her homeland in Vietnam. As she copes with the challenges of moving to a new country, the blooming of the hibiscus represents her readiness to embrace change. Just like the geese migrating south in winter and returning home in the spring, Saeng is preparing herself to face the test when she feels more comfortable. The hibiscus and the geese serve as reminders of the inevitability of change and the importance of adapting to new circumstances. When the hibiscus finally blossoms, Saeng will know that she is ready to confront the challenges ahead and move forward with confidence.
891	9756	4	3	So she is planning to take the test next year, indicating her intention to prepare and sit for the examination in the coming year. This decision suggests that she is committed to advancing her education or career by obtaining a certain qualification or certification. By setting a timeline for when she will take the test, she is showing determination and focus on achieving her goal within a specific timeframe. This decision to delay the test until next year could be strategic, allowing her more time to study and adequately prepare for the exam to increase her chances of success. Overall, her plan to take the test next year demonstrates her proactive approach to reaching her objectives and highlights her dedication to personal and professional growth.
892	9757	4	3	The author concludes the end of the story because he wants to kind of say that he will be ready next year to sprout again. He will be ready to test himself to not cry and break down when he sees the plant, but instead to think of childhood memories. He will be ready to face the cycle of life with strength and resilience.
893	9758	4	3	Saeng buys a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden as a reminder of her homeland. Despite feeling upset about failing a test, her mother sympathetically overlooks the cost of the hibiscus. Saeng plants the hibiscus with determination, vowing to retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus is in bloom and the geese return. The mention of the budding hibiscus and returning geese suggests that the test can only be taken once a year, leaving readers curious about the nature of the test and whether Saeng will succeed in her second attempt.
894	9759	4	3	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is trying to tell the reader a message. The author is trying to say that if a plant can make it through the cold winter then she can pass her driverís test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. By drawing a parallel between the resilience of a plant in harsh conditions and the ability to overcome challenges in life, the author emphasizes the importance of perseverance and determination in achieving goals. This comparison serves as a reminder that with patience and effort, success is attainable even in the face of adversity.
895	9760	4	3	"The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself ""I will take that test again,"" shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng's good character. It shows Saeng's strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it."
896	9761	4	3	"The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost familiar to her now."" So the author lastly concludes that even though she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She just the point of the story across and its a ""cheerful"" way to end it. This ending brings a sense of optimism and resilience, highlighting Saeng's growth and adaptation to new challenges."
897	9762	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" to show that the hibiscus plant has given Saeng hope. It has helped her get through some rough and difficult times. In the story, Saeng has just failed her test and had to walk home. She was very upset. On her way home, Saeng saw a familiar flower. She had walked into a flower store to see if they sold the hibiscus that she had seen. The employee pointed her towards the flower. The hibiscus brought back many memories of her hometown in Vietnam. Saeng planted her flowers in the vegetable garden. That flower had given her hope. She is ready to try the test again. The hibiscus symbolizes a fresh start and a renewed determination for Saeng, inspiring her to face her challenges with resilience and courage."
898	9763	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example it is starting in the winter the hibiscuses are dying. Also she is leaving and wont come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring, and she will come back again when she takes the test over again. In conclusion that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.
899	9764	4	3	"The reason the author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end. It gives a certain lift of joy at the end of a moderately depressing story. It just goes to show that if you care enough you can keep moving forward. And that the end of your world comes when you make it so. That is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end. It emphasizes the idea that there is always a way to find hope and happiness, even in the darkest of times. It serves as a reminder that resilience and perseverance can lead to brighter days ahead, no matter how difficult the circumstances may be. The ending provides a sense of closure and optimism, leaving the reader with a feeling of possibility and renewal."
900	9765	4	3	The character has what seems to be a new found confidence and a new joy of the plant that reminds her of her home land comforting her and motivating her. She says when those things come back she will try hard to complete the test. She is setting a time to push herself. As most people try to do. This newfound determination and connection to her roots will surely propel her towards success in overcoming the challenges ahead. With this renewed sense of purpose, she is ready to face the test with all her strength and dedication, knowing that she has the support of her past and the promise of a brighter future.
901	9766	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows how sometimes you have to wait till the time is right for you to try again. For example, In the book it says ìMadagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, ìHow strange to see it in a pot.î Back home it just grew wild jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between roofs. This shows that anything can be done when the time is right.
902	9767	4	3	Emotions, symbolism, and the author's intentions all play a role in why the story concluded the way it did. The author wanted to evoke mixed emotions in the reader, such as sadness, hope, and wonder. The girl's failure on the test and longing for home create a sense of sadness, while the possibility of returning home gives a glimmer of hope. The unanswered questions and the significance of the plant and geese leave the reader wondering about the deeper meanings in the story. The author's use of symbolism with the plant and geese adds layers to the narrative, hinting at themes of home and belonging. Overall, the conclusion of the story leaves a lasting impact and invites reflection on the characters' journeys and choices.
903	9768	4	3	In the story Winter Hibiscus, Saeng cherished the beautiful flowers that once flourished in her homeland. Her favorite among them was the winter Hibiscus, with its lush red petals as soft as velvet. Despite her attachment to these blooms, Saeng faced disappointment when she failed a test. The story conveys the message that while nothing may compare to the comfort of home, sometimes we must be open to giving things another chance. This theme highlights the importance of resilience and perseverance in the face of adversity, urging us to remain open to new opportunities and possibilities.
904	9769	4	3	I think he did because he wanted to show how he loved everything in life, including the smallest details that may often go unnoticed by others. By capturing these moments in his work, he demonstrated his deep appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the world around him. This attention to detail not only showcased his artistic talent but also reflected his profound sense of gratitude for the experiences life had to offer. Through his art, he was able to express his love for all aspects of existence, no matter how insignificant they may seem to others. Ultimately, his work serves as a reminder to cherish the simple pleasures and find joy in the everyday moments that make life truly fulfilling.
905	9770	4	3	The reason why the author of the story ended the story like that is because after all the hard time that plant went through, it will still bad at the end of the winter. The author said that the plant will take that test again that test is surviving through the could winter and blunming at the end of the winter. Despite the challenges and hardships faced, the plant's resilience and determination shine through as it prepares to face another winter with the hope of blooming once again.
906	9771	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason is that the author is trying to say that she is going to overcome the obstacle (the test) no matter what. In the text it says ""it can make through the cold months."" A consumer her which supports the last paragraph also, she is in a new country and is starting a new beginning. In the text it says ""Not like the same kind we had before."" This implies that it is different in this country and she will soon adjust. Finally, it says, ""this hibiscus is budding"" which means she will bloom."
907	9772	4	3	Saeng took a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze brush against her face as she stood outside her new home. She glanced at the small garden she had lovingly tended to, the colorful flowers swaying gently in the wind. It was a stark contrast to the bustling city she had left behind. But somehow, in the midst of this serene setting, she found a sense of peace.  As she looked around, memories of her past life flooded back to her. The laughter of her friends, the warmth of her family, the taste of her favorite foods - they all seemed like distant echoes now. Yet, as she closed her eyes and took another deep breath, she realized that she was slowly getting used to her new surroundings.  With a newfound determination, Saeng made a silent promise to herself. She was going to try the test she had failed once again. She knew it wouldn't be easy, but she also knew that she had to keep moving forward. And as she took the first step towards her goal, she couldn't help but smile. For the first time since she had arrived, she felt like she belonged. And that was all the motivation she needed to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
908	9773	4	3	Saeng failed her driving test, and it was a blow to her confidence. However, instead of giving up, she decided to start over and try again in the spring. She understood that everyone makes mistakes, and the important thing is to learn from them and keep moving forward. By renewing herself and her determination, Saeng believes she will be better prepared for her next attempt. This story conveys the message that it is never too late to begin again, even after setbacks or failures. With a fresh perspective and renewed effort, success is always within reach.
909	9774	4	3	In the spring, when the snows melt and after return, Saeng will start planting again. She is eagerly waiting for her hibiscus to bud so she can begin tending to her beloved plant once more. Since coming to the United States, she has developed a deep love for this flower and is looking forward to filling her garden with its beauty. Saeng's enthusiasm and patience in nurturing her hibiscus reflect her connection to nature and the joy it brings her. This paragraph serves as a fitting conclusion to the story, emphasizing Saeng's passion for gardening and the happiness it brings her.
910	9775	4	3	Because to her, it is the best time to do things as all the happy memories come flooding back with the return of the geese and hibiscus. The vibrant colors and sounds of nature awaken a sense of joy and nostalgia within her, motivating her to seize the moment and make the most of this magical time of year. The familiar sights and scents of the season inspire her to embark on new adventures and create lasting memories that will bring her joy for years to come. Embracing the beauty of the season, she feels a renewed sense of energy and optimism that propels her forward towards her goals and dreams. In the company of nature's wonders, she finds solace and inspiration, making this time of year truly special and memorable for her.
911	9776	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus is motivating her to test for her drivers test. In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again.
912	9777	4	3	Several reasons, first, in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life. Also when the hibiscus starts budding she will feel comforted, as though it automatically brings back her childhood memories. It also is a link to her past home in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in ground soil, she will adjust and be ready to take the test again. It's as if, when the plant is ready to start budding, she will also be ready. The budding hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope and renewal, signaling a fresh start and a new beginning for her. Its vibrant colors and delicate petals remind her that life is full of beauty and possibilities. As the hibiscus blooms, so too will she blossom and thrive in her new environment. The hibiscus plant becomes a source of inspiration and motivation for her to persevere and overcome challenges, just like the plant perseveres through its own growth process. Ultimately, the hibiscus represents resilience, strength, and the ability to flourish in any circumstance.
913	9778	4	3	Saeng vowed to the flower, promising to return next year and try again with the hibiscus. He believed in the power of patience and determination, knowing that sometimes success takes time and persistence. With hope in his heart, Saeng bid farewell to the garden, already looking forward to his next chance to make the hibiscus bloom.
914	9779	4	3	The author put the paragraph in to show that he/she cares about the flowers. Flowers only come out during spring and @DATE2 time and that's when you plant study all that grows in a garden. So she can pass the test and be happy with the garden. Taking care of the flowers is a priority for the author, as they bring beauty and joy to the garden. By nurturing the flowers and ensuring they thrive, the author can create a vibrant and colorful garden that will be a source of happiness and satisfaction. Through careful attention and dedication, the author can cultivate a stunning garden that will be a testament to their love for nature and appreciation of its beauty.
915	9780	4	3	"The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî ends the story with the paragraph ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" for a couple of reasons. Most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents hope - the plant will survive through the winter months and will grow again and become strong. So, too, will Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange place where she doesnít want to be, she is able to overcome adversity and hardship. In the same way, the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the impression that Saeng still has hope. The blooming hibiscus serves as a symbol of resilience and renewal, mirroring Saeng's own journey of perseverance and growth. Just as the hibiscus will bloom again in the spring, Saeng will face her challenges with determination and courage, ready to embrace new opportunities and possibilities. This hopeful ending leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and faith in the resilience of the human spirit."
916	9781	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng makes a vow to herself. ìIn the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î this vow means that she will start fresh, make changes, and adapt to her new life. She doesn't want to disappoint her mother and she won't be broken down by her memories. She concluded the story like this to show in the future how her life will change and how she would learn to like where she is now. Saeng's determination to take the test again in the spring symbolizes her resilience and hope for a better future. It signifies her commitment to growth and moving forward, leaving behind the pain and struggles of the past. The promise she makes to herself marks a new beginning, a chance for redemption, and a belief in the possibility of transformation. Saeng's vow encapsulates a message of strength, perseverance, and the power of self-renewal, highlighting the potential for personal evolution and positive change."
917	9782	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This shows Saeng's determination to not give up and her willingness to wait for the right moment to try again. She believes that with patience and perseverance, she will be able to overcome the obstacles in her way and succeed in her endeavors. The changing seasons symbolize a new beginning and a fresh start, giving Saeng hope for a brighter future ahead.
918	9783	4	3	The author concludes the story with this last paragraph because it shows by spring she will be ready to retake her test. It shows that like the geese who care and come back, she will have time to study and pass her test. In the story the author includes this last paragraph to truly show her dedication to eventually grow to be comfortable in her new home and to pass her drivers test all in good time. Saeng wants to be comfortable with her new life but isnít yet because of what one misses. But she knows that after this she can go back and try again just like the geese do often our winter. This was a very effective way to end the story because it really communicated Saengís message of dedication and longing to overcome her obstacles, her new home and driving.
919	9784	4	3	"I think the author concludes like this because it's almost like a new beginning. The ending of the story makes you think that Saeng is going to get on with her life. It makes me think that she plans to start her life over in comparison with the hibiscus. Once the plant ""starts over"" (rebuds) she will start over once again. It also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in Vietnam. She will not let her life be distraught by her move from Vietnam. She hopes that she will be able to start her life over again. The ending is a ""cliff hanger"" to show that her story has not yet completely ended. It shows that there is still possibility that she can get on with her life. It also shows she doesn't let her failures control her. She is a strong young woman and is determined to overcome this."
920	9785	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it's a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention a little bit. Also, it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a determined story. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph. The girl took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and walked into the exam room with a steely look in her eyes. She was ready to conquer the test and prove to herself and everyone else that she had what it takes to succeed. And as she sat down at her desk, she couldn't help but feel a surge of confidence wash over her. Today was the day she would show the world what she was made of.
921	9786	4	3	The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng intends to try again. An example of her trying again is when she sees the plant and realizes what it symbolizes to her. Another example is her saying that she wants to plant the hibiscus herself so that she holds the memories forever. This is why the author concludes the story in this manner. Saeng's determination to move forward and create new memories is evident in her decision to plant the hibiscus, showing that she is ready to embrace the future while cherishing the past. By choosing to take this step, Saeng demonstrates her resilience and willingness to keep moving forward despite the challenges she has faced. This ending leaves readers with a sense of hope and possibility for Saeng's future endeavors.
922	9787	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was trying to say since the hibiscus is planted we are going to see how it does with the winter. And when spring arrives and it's still standing she can go take the test. I think the author was comparing the hibiscus to their life and obstacles they will go through, so if the hibiscus is still standing then that means everything will be fine to where she can go back and take the test. This symbolizes resilience and the ability to overcome challenges, just like the hibiscus enduring the winter and blooming in the spring. It gives hope that no matter what difficulties come their way, they can overcome them and emerge stronger on the other side.
923	9788	4	3	The last paragraph of ìWinter Hibiscusî describes determination and the growth of a person. Saeng says that when ìthis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î Just as the hibiscus blooms Saeng will bloom forth and strive through the winter to try and succeed in passing her test. Saeng concludes by saying this as a realization that she canít be sad forever. She must be determined in order to pass the test. The next season will be a sort of renewal, starting fresh and coming out beautiful as does a hibiscus in bloom.
924	9789	4	3	"The Author of ìWinter Hibiscusî, Minfong Ho, concluded her story with the paragraph about how when the geese are there, and the hibiscus is blooming, Saeng will take her drivers test again, because she wanted to end on a happy note. In the beginning of the story, Saeng, who had just moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2, failed her drivers test. She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her sad. ìI mean itís not like the kind we had at ñ at-"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.î (Ho, @NUM1) So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could think about that, and get her mind off of everything else."
925	9790	4	3	"The author concludes the story with these paragraph for a very good reason. In away she just letting it go and will wait to take it again. I think that is a good that she found the flower. That is because it let her and her mother and in away make her better. For example when it say's"" the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."
926	9791	4	3	"The author concludes the story this way to show how the main character, Saeng has changed from the beginning of the story to the end. It show a small amount of newfound confidence Saeng now has. This ending also shows how much of an effect the ""Winter hibiscus"" had on her. with bringing back memories of her old country. If Saeng wouldn't have found the hibiscus, she would have never started to reminisce about her old home. This reminiscing not only reminded her of her past, but it also helped her compare her new home to her old home. Through this she realized that life in @LOCATION1 is not so bad, and that she still has a little bit of her old home with her everyday. This realization gave her just enough hope and confidence to want to try the driving test again. This ending shows the change of heart Saeng feels for @LOCATION1 and her small gain of hope and confidence."
927	9792	4	3	The author decides to conclude the story with that because she wants the moral of the story to be burnt in your head. She believes that you will always have a chance to try again and the flower restarts its cycle and it gets another chance to bud and that symbolizes that you can start over and try again just like the girl is going to do on the test. She is doing the test again when she starts over so she can do it with the flower and the flower budding will support her and give her hope.
928	9793	4	3	I believe that the author ends the story the way she did because it talks about both of the subjects. The author is trying to say that when she takes her driving test next spring, the hibiscus will give her confidence to pass her driving test. The hibiscus symbolizes growth, resilience, and the ability to overcome challenges. By connecting her upcoming driving test to the blooming hibiscus, the author is highlighting the idea that like the flower, she too can blossom and succeed in the face of adversity. This ending ties together the themes of growth and perseverance, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and optimism for the author's future endeavors.
929	9794	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. When she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says, ""In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again."" She is saying that she wants to start over and adapt to her new country. Additionally, she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again because she says, ""when the snow melts and the geese return."" She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again. That is why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way."
930	9795	4	3	I think the author concludes the story like that because its showing the time that will be passing.

934	9799	4	3	"She feels very connected to this hibiscus plant because it reminds her of her homeland. I think she is trying to say that when the hibiscus plant shows its inner budding, she will too. The plant has to try hard to produce flowers, and the seed has to reach out to melt the snow. That means when it comes around to it, she needs to come out and melt all of her bad habits and do what she needs to do to pass the test. But still not forgetting where she came from and all the memories left behind. She vowed silently to herself, ""then I will take that test again."""

I guess that from the snow being on the ground cause her to make mistakes when taking the test. In conclusion, thatís why the author concludes the story with this paragraph."
939	9804	4	3	In ì@CAPS1 Hibiscus,î the author concludes the story with ìin the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î to make a point. She needs all of those things to happen for her to be sound enough to take the test again.

The return of the geese symbolizes a cycle of renewal and rebirth, mirroring her own journey towards growth and transformation.

941	9806	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a reason. He enjoys writing about geese and appreciates the beauty of plants budding in different seasons. He has decided to take a test in the spring and eagerly anticipates the snow melting so he can finally do so.
942	9807	4	3	As she walked out of the testing center, she couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over her. The weight of the exam was finally lifted off her shoulders, and she could now look forward to the future with hope and anticipation. The author knew that she had given it her all, and now it was time to relax and enjoy the things that truly mattered to her. She longed for the familiar comforts of her favorite coffee shop, the sound of laughter from her friends, and the feeling of being surrounded by loved ones. In that moment, she realized that no matter what the results of the test were, she already had everything she needed to be happy. And as she made her way back to her favorite spot in the park, she knew that she would always cherish the simple joys of life that made her truly content.
943	9808	4	3	The author's choice of words in the conclusion of the story, I believe sent of let the reader know that the story continues. But, I think that the test is that to remind her of home. This subtle hint at an ongoing narrative suggests that there are more adventures to come for the protagonist, perhaps leading her back to her roots and the comfort of familiar surroundings. The mention of home serves as a poignant reminder of where she comes from and the importance of staying connected to her past. It leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation and curiosity about what lies ahead for the character, hinting at a continuation of her journey and the exploration of her personal history.

She believed that the Winter Hibiscus brought good luck, as it disappeared along with the geese, symbolizing a fresh start. Saeng associated the return of the geese with the melting snow and budding Hibiscus as signs of renewal and opportunity. Therefore, she decided to wait for these natural occurrences before attempting the test again, hoping for better luck and success in the future.
945	9810	4	3	Saeng's story teaches us that there is always an opportunity to make amends for past mistakes. Just like how she plans to retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms, we too can seize the chance to try again and succeed. It's never too late to turn things around and strive for a better outcome. By staying determined and embracing second chances, we can overcome setbacks and reach our goals. Remember, like the changing seasons, there will always be another chance to grow and flourish.

When she finds that place she will find herself ready to ""take the test"" or do things normally.

947	9812	4	3	"The author concluded the story like that because she was being positive. Like the geese are coming back she is positive that she can take the test again. She knows that she will pass the test. In the story she said ""Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This means that when she had just moved here she thought that everything was strange because she had not seen anything like this before. Now as she is living here she would get used to it because she knows what will happen; nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now."
948	9813	4	3	The reader thinks the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl is saying she will try again, and take that test. In the story ìWinter Hibiscus,î Saeng, the girl took a test and failed it. And she got this flower that brought back memories from the past and decided to take this test now that things are going to get better again. Also when the girl saw those geese flying over her, she knew they will be coming back, coming back after winter in the spring, and when they do her flower will blossom, the one that brings back good memories from the past and she will retake that test and pass. Those are some examples of why I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph.
949	9814	4	3	The author concludes the story with that story because she loves her homeland and nature, especially her mother. She is enchanted by the lush greenery and eagerly anticipates the arrival of spring. Despite feeling out of place at times, she is willing to endure the challenges as a test to herself. This is why she chooses to end the story in this manner.
950	9815	4	3	Saeng stood there, her eyes fixed on the target in front of her. She took a deep breath, steadying herself as she raised her bow, focused and determined. With a swift motion, she released the arrow, watching as it sailed through the air towards the target.  As the arrow hit its mark, a sense of accomplishment washed over Saeng. She knew she had a long way to go before she could compete in the Winter Hibiscus tournament, but she was more determined than ever to succeed. With each practice session, she pushed herself harder, honing her skills and improving her accuracy.  As Saeng walked off the field that day, she couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation building inside her.

The journey ahead would be challenging, but she was ready to face it head-on, ready to show the world what she was capable of. With her bow in hand and her eyes on the prize, Saeng was ready to take on whatever obstacles stood in her way.
951	9816	4	3	Saeng was gradually settling into her new surroundings, finding comfort in the familiar sights and sounds that once seemed strange to her. The winter hibiscus, with its vibrant blooms, served as a reassuring link to her homeland. As she observed the geese flying in their distinctive V formation, she realized that she was beginning to embrace the quiet rhythm of the changing seasons. With each passing day, Saeng felt more at ease in her new home, hopeful for what the future held.
952	9817	4	3	When they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The authorís main porpuse of this lines wa to grab the readers attention by making a continuing paragraph that a closing sheís adapting to circumstances. Saeng values the uniqueness of plants, she is also consoled by memories of her homeland. As she stands there, surrounded by the beauty of nature, she finds solace in the familiar sights and sounds that remind her of where she came from. Each flower and tree holds a special place in her heart, connecting her to her roots and giving her the strength to face whatever challenges lie ahead. And so, with determination in her eyes, she looks forward to the coming spring, ready to embrace the new beginnings it will bring.
953	9818	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. After failing the test, Saeng found solace in small reminders of her home country. One such reminder was a plant that brought back memories of her past, helping her cope with the feeling of failure. When Saeng felt a deep sense of recognition that transported her back to her roots, she momentarily forgot about the challenges she faced, finding comfort in the familiarity of home. These moments of connection with her past gave Saeng the strength to face her difficulties with renewed determination. In the end, Saeng's decision to wait until the plants bloomed again symbolized her resilience and the hope of overcoming obstacles through the power of memories.
954	9819	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng will be staying for another year. She mentioned that all the new things that seemed strange to her at first have now become second nature. The hibiscus symbolizes hope and inspiration for her. It is clear that Saeng is beginning to accept that she is in a new home and is on her way to fully embracing this reality.
955	9820	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has faith for a new start. Saeng compares herself to the hibiscus. When the hibiscus is strong again, she will retake the test. This shows that when the hibiscus restarts its life, so will she. Saeng feels that when the hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold winter, then she is strong enough to pass her driver's test and live in a new country. Winter and cold represent death, and spring represents a new life or beginning. Saeng thinks to herself, ""in the spring... I will take the test again."" This is a new beginning for Saeng, a new hope."
956	9821	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author decided to end it with the sentence ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" showcasing the theme of perseverance and determination. Saeng, the main character, failed once but is willing to try again in the spring, just like the geese return and the hibiscus buds anew. This symbolizes the idea that all living things strive to succeed in their main purpose, with the flower rebudding and the geese coming back each spring. The author's choice to end the story with this quote serves as an inspiration for readers to keep trying and never give up on their goals, no matter how many times they may fail."
957	9822	4	3	In the last paragraph of the story, Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driving test again in the spring. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope that nature brings to her. She describes peaceful things in nature, like the geese and hibiscus, that she draws strength from because they remind her of her homeland. In this way, she'll always have a little piece of her past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng relates to nature and pulls strength from it. Her mother has a garden, and she relates to it in that she has a different past, preferring natural foods like bitter melons over @LOCATION1. This final paragraph shows the hope that the beautiful nature from her homeland has brought to Saeng, helping her adapt to living in a new place. The connection to nature provides her with comfort and a sense of familiarity in her new surroundings, giving her the courage to face challenges and move forward with determination.
958	9823	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that sheíll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean sheíll feel comfortable in her new environment and she won't miss her home as much. Also she tried the year but failed the best because she didnít get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story. After all the challenges and mistakes, she will learn from them and grow stronger in the future. It is through these experiences that she will become more resilient and better equipped to face whatever obstacles come her way. She will carry the lessons learned with her, allowing her to navigate life with more confidence and determination.
959	9824	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the main character, Saeng, adapting and trying her best with her new life style. For example, when she vowed to herself in the last paragraph saying, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show how someone is adapting to change.
960	9825	4	3	The author includes this because he's using metaphors to explain how the author felt about Saeng's personal life. Saeng's life was like a turbulent ocean, with waves of emotions crashing over him constantly. The author felt like he was navigating through treacherous waters when trying to understand Saeng's inner struggles and challenges. Just like a sailor braving a stormy sea, the author had to navigate carefully to uncover the hidden depths of Saeng's emotions and experiences. The use of metaphors helps to convey the complexity and intensity of Saeng's personal life, showing the reader the challenges and obstacles that he faced on a daily basis.
961	9826	4	3	The author concludes the story with paragraph because it shows Saengís sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she dissappointed her. For instance, she feels bad about upsetting her mom, and while her momís gardening, she says, ìHere, let me help, mother,î because her momís frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, ìSaeng didnít dare look her mother in the eye,î which shows Saengís concern for her motherís reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, ìItís a beautiful plant, Iím glad you got it,î which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship. This is why Saengís sympathy to better herself is shown in the storyís conclusion. Saeng's willingness to assist her mother in the garden and her consideration of her mother's feelings demonstrate her compassionate nature and desire to make amends for her mistakes. Through their interactions, it is evident that Saeng values her relationship with her mother and strives to improve herself for the betterment of their bond.
962	9827	4	3	As spring approached, Saeng noticed that her beloved winter hibiscus was starting to wither away, signaling the end of the cold season. Despite feeling a pang of sadness seeing the plant go, she also felt a sense of relief. With the winter hibiscus gone, Saeng realized that she could now shift her focus back to her studies.  Feeling determined, Saeng dedicated more time to her schoolwork, studying diligently for the test she had previously failed. As she immersed herself in her books, she found that her mind was clearer without the constant worry about her beloved plant.  When the day of the test arrived, Saeng felt more confident than ever. She answered each question thoughtfully, drawing on the knowledge she had worked hard to acquire. And when the results were finally announced, Saeng was overjoyed to discover that she had passed with flying colors.  With the winter hibiscus now just a fond memory, Saeng realized the importance of balance in her life. While she would always cherish her love for gardening, she now understood the value of focusing on her education as well. And as she looked forward to the coming seasons, Saeng knew that she could thrive both in the garden and in the classroom.
963	9828	4	3	The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memoryís of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject. Saeng's journey of adaptation and growth is symbolized by the blooming of the hibiscus plant, indicating her readiness to face new challenges and embrace her new life in the United States while still holding onto her Vietnamese roots.
964	9829	4	3	"The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a sentence about retaking the driver's test in the spring, to express the themes of adapting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character, Saeng, is an immigrant. Because this place is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance, when she sees the flower ""Madagascar penwinhle,"" she thinks ""how strange to see it in a pot"" because ""Back home it just grows wild."" The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says ""and the geese return,"" because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their patterns are becoming familiar. The very last line says ""I will take that test again."" This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver's test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus, Saeng observes that ""the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it."" Despite the difficulty, though, she ""dug out a hole"" and knows it's strong enough to move through the cold months, just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng's character."
965	9830	4	3	The author concluded the story with the paragraph to set the sonip theme. In the story, the @CAPS1 represents very important thing to saeng ñ confidence, beauty, adaptationÖ some things she can apply to herself, & her memories of her old homeland. She had failed the driving test. Afterwards, she bought the @CAPS1 to comfort her homesickness. I saw the @CAPS1 as a sort of metaphor to Saeng the same @CAPS1, but growing differently in a different area just as she is still the same but in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the @CAPS1 budding. It represents to Saeng her homeland by the @CAPS1 blossoming ,it can represent her love for the homeland. When the author wrote ìthen I will take that test againî it is referring to the new confidence she @MONTH1 have later when the @CAPS1 blooms (another @CAPS1 /person metaphor)
966	9831	4	3	"The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph to show Saeng starting over. In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, to her life, is that she is starting fresh in a way. Although she may miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine-toothed comb, she is making an effort to ""take that test again."" By relating the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to the weight of loss and to her grief."
967	9832	4	3	When they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The hibiscus, with its vibrant red petals and lush green leaves, serves as a reminder of her tropical home, a place of comfort and familiarity that she longs for. Just like the hibiscus blooms and thrives in the right conditions, Saeng believes that once she is surrounded by the warmth and memories of her home, she will find the courage and strength to face the test once more. The plant symbolizes hope and resilience, inspiring her to persevere in the face of challenges. As the hibiscus grows and flourishes, so does Saeng's determination to succeed, making her confident that she will overcome whatever obstacles come her way.
968	9833	4	3	"I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow, so will Saeng. After failing the drivers test, Saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant which reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam when they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is sad. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort to help her think about where she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So to boost her confidence she decides to plant it. ""The winter hibiscus was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around. Then she sees geese flying in the sky which is kind of a symbol for that day, something to remember it by, so the next year. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. These things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger."
969	9834	4	3	I think Saeng needs to retake the test to improve her grade. She is concerned about the snow in spring covering the flowers. Saeng's mother allows her to help with the peppers and melons and lets her host a dinner party.
970	9835	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that sheís not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that sheís not giving up ìÖthen I will take that teat againî which clearly states she still has hope. Author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.
971	9836	4	3	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because during winter everything dies down till springs where everything is lively again, the Saeng would feel more motivated to do well on the test. Saeng is sort of like the plant, strives and worries in the winter and then blooms beautifully in the spring. Also, I think the memories that the winter hibiscus plant brought her; motivated her to stop staying in the past and move on towards the future.
972	9837	4	3	He wrote this because he is discussing the impact of weather changes on our daily lives. The unpredictability of weather patterns can affect various aspects of our routines, from our clothing choices to our travel plans. By highlighting these changes, the author is emphasizing the importance of being prepared and adaptable in the face of fluctuating weather conditions. This awareness can help individuals make informed decisions and mitigate any potential disruptions caused by sudden weather shifts. In essence, the author's message underscores the significance of staying vigilant and flexible in response to the ever-changing weather.
973	9838	4	3	The author probably conclude the story with that paragraph because she is basically relating the plants to herself meaning as the plant bloom she will too by taking the test. and her reason could be b/c or is b/c reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Basically she did as the geese by lifting her head watching as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance. This is why I believe the author but this to conclude the story...because she was comparing herself in the geese and does as they did.
974	9839	4	3	The author describes the last quote because he wants her dream to achieve. Saeng is from Vietnam, and her family have an @CAPS1 dream. So the author wants that her family adapt their new life in @LOCATION2. She realized that many of the things that she had thought the quiet repetition of season, almost familiar to her now. Saeng's determination and strength will undoubtedly help her family overcome challenges and create a fulfilling life in their new home. By embracing the changes and opportunities that come their way, they can turn their dreams into reality and build a bright future together.
975	9840	4	3	She says this because right now it is winter and flowers can grow in the winter due to how cold it is. So she is saying when spring is back she will take the test of growing the flowers again. In conclusion, this is why the author states that conclusion at the end of the paragraph. When spring arrives, the author will have the opportunity to test her flower-growing skills once more in more favorable conditions.
976	9841	4	3	The author ends the story with that paragraph to give you a sense of hope and determination for the future that dwells within saeng at that time. Throughout the story, it seemed as though saeng was giving into despair at the remembrance of her homeland. She wasn't doing so well in her new country and had realized it the most when she had failed her driving test. But when she walked past the flower shop and saw all the plants that used to bloom so freely and beautifully in her homeland confined in those tiny pots and fighting to survive, it reminded her of herself here in @LOCATION1. As she began to plant her hibiscus, she again compared herself to it. That is why when her plant blooms in the spring, she will pass that test.
977	9842	4	3	The author concluded this by saying that the hibiscus is yet budding in the winter, indicating that there is still hope and new beginnings even in the coldest of times. Additionally, the mention of the geese returning home suggests the importance of finding comfort and solace in familiar surroundings during challenging periods. Overall, the author's words serve as a reminder to embrace the changing seasons of life and find warmth and shelter in the places and people that bring us joy and peace.
978	9843	4	3	The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng's attitude. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at the end of the story, it shows that she has hope, and she's not going to give up. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in the toughest situations. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way, that she too will change. In conclusion, the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons.

She was still going to take it again, she might get good luck from the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day from failing her driverís test and she realizes that she recognizes a flower so she went to a florist to see if she can buy it.

The Hibiscus plant symbolizes Saeng as it is not in its native home and faces similar challenges like the cold, small pot, and unfamiliar surroundings. The last paragraph connects Saeng and the plant, highlighting their shared circumstances and resilience in the face of adversity.
997	9862	4	3	The reason why the author used this paragraph is because he was sad to see the snow go away in springtime. He enjoyed the beauty and tranquility that the snow brought, and its disappearance signified the end of a season he cherished.

The change in scenery brought about by the melting snow may have evoked feelings of nostalgia and longing for the past. Overall, the author's sentiment towards the melting snow in springtime is one of wistfulness and a desire to hold onto the beauty of winter for just a little while longer.
998	9863	4	3	The last paragraph means only one thing. That one thing is to be like a Hibiscus to take the test again of life. See will come back in the spring just like the Hibiscus will.

The sight of the geese flying off serves as a poignant reminder that change is inevitable, but with courage and perseverance, she can navigate through this transition period and emerge stronger than before.
1000	9865	4	3	"The reason why the author ends the story with that statement is because when you fail at something you need time to dust yourself off and try again. When Saeng fails her driving test she is disappointed. After failing her test she went too greenery where she saw flowers of her homeland. Then where sh bought the hibiscus. It reminded her of how things were different. And how thing change when you go to different place. Sometimes they aren't so pleasant at first but you get use to them. Like when she first saw the geese flying in a ""V"". she though of how strange it was. But now it is farmiliar to her.

1001	9866	4	3	She concluded the paragraph with that statement to show that she is serious about her gardening and that she won't garden until the geese come back.

That is why the author ended this way.
1004	9869	4	3	She is determined to turn over a new leaf when spring arrives, ready to tackle her driving test with renewed determination. This decision shows her resilience and commitment to improving herself, promising a fresh start and a positive outlook for the future. With this mindset, Saeng is prepared to face the challenges ahead and strive for success in her endeavors.

1006	9871	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the cold was brutal and the author never wanted to be around while the cold was in session. At the time it was really cold, with temperatures dropping below freezing and a biting wind that seemed to cut through even the thickest layers of clothing. The author shivered uncontrollably, feeling the chill seep into their bones. As they hurried home, the thought of being cozy and warm indoors was the only thing that kept them going. The cold was relentless, but the author knew that soon it would pass, and they could once again enjoy the comfort of a heated home.
1007	9872	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One being the fact that she wants to snow sympathay for the hibiscus. Another reason would be showing that Saeng wants to make her mother very proud of her. Meaning that she doesnít want her mom to think that she is going to give up. This also contributes to the reason that Saeng believes in herself and she truly thinks she can pass the test. Lastly I think that this last paragraph snowed how Saeng wants people to know that even some as small and meaning less as a plant can help her overcome obsticles, and lead her to her dreams. The author chose this paragraph to end the story because of the main fact that how we know that Saeng will not stop believing in herself.
1008	9873	4	3	"The author of the story chooses to end the story with that sentence because the story is mainly about how Saeng failed her driver's test, but when she saw the hibiscus, it reminded her of home and made her feel better. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng says, ""And that rich, sweet scent - that was familiar too,"" talks about how nice the flowers were and how familiar they were because she recognized the scent. Saeng was already upset about leaving her home in @LOCATION1, then coming to @LOCATION2 and then failing her driver's test, just made it worse, but then she saw the flower and it reminded her of her home, so she felt a little better. So when the author uses that quote, they end the story that way to show that she will have enough courage to try again when the flower blooms."

Additionally, the mention of hibiscus blooming when the geese return and the idea of retaking a test connect back to earlier points in the story, providing a sense of closure and completeness. Overall, the author's choice to end the story with this paragraph serves to evoke a poignant response from the readers and bring together the various themes explored in ""Winter Hibiscus."""
1011	9876	4	3	Saeng, a young girl who had a deep love for the hibiscus plant, faced a challenging winter test that she unfortunately failed. However, the author suggests that Saeng's affinity for the hibiscus plant will help her through the difficulties she encounters. With the arrival of spring, a season symbolizing renewal and growth, Saeng may find the strength and determination to succeed in her future tests. Just as the hibiscus plant blooms vibrantly after a harsh winter, Saeng's resilience and passion for learning will guide her towards success in her academic endeavors.
1012	9877	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted the reader to know that just because she failed doesn't mean her life is over. She will recuperate and do the same thing next year.
1013	9878	4	3	Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. The once unfamiliar surroundings had started to feel like home, and she found herself more open to giving it another chance. Embracing the changes around her, she decided to approach the upcoming test with a newfound sense of determination and optimism. With a hopeful heart, she was ready to take on the challenges that lay ahead, knowing that she had grown accustomed to her new environment and was ready to make the most of it.
1014	9879	4	3	Maybe the author wrote that as the last sentence or paragraph because in the story she did something and failed at it, so she wants to do it again. As she looked back on her past attempts, she realized that giving up was not an option. With a newfound determination, she set out to try again, knowing that this time, she would succeed. The journey ahead may be challenging, but she was ready to face it head-on, armed with the lessons learned from her previous failures. Failure was not the end, but rather a stepping stone towards achieving her goals.

1015	9880	4	3	The Author of ìWinter Hibiscusî ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant ìdiesî in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle.
1016	9881	4	3	"After reading the quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test. From the story ""winter' Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, I think the author is trying to say that after the winter and fall pass she will be upto the challenge to plant again and feel good about herself. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive ""V"" was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. Reflecting back I feel Saeng felt that the geese was secretly letting her know what she was doing was right. The geese symbolize hope and a new beginning, urging Saeng to embrace change and face challenges with determination. Their departure signifies the passing of tough times and the arrival of a fresh start, motivating Saeng to take the test and embark on a journey towards growth and self-improvement. Saeng's connection with nature and her surroundings highlights the power of resilience and the ability to find inspiration in the world around us, guiding her towards a brighter future."
1017	9882	4	3	He ends the story this way to show that she wants to and is willing to overcome leaving her homeland. In the story she goes to a green house. She is in the green house to test herself. She finds a plant from her homeland and it reminds her of her grandmother. She finds other plants and they remind her of her homeland and she cries. I think she had a real connection with her grandmother. When they left their home country she probably cried for days its like she lost a part of her sole. The green house symbolizes her journey of self-discovery and healing. The plants serve as a bridge between her past and her present, allowing her to come to terms with her emotions and find a sense of belonging in her new surroundings. Through this experience, she learns to embrace her past while moving forward with strength and resilience.
1018	9883	4	3	The girl had been feeling down lately, struggling with the changes that came with moving to the United States and feeling defeated after failing her driver's test. She even bought a plant to cheer herself up, only to realize it wasn't real. However, despite these setbacks, she refused to give up on herself. Gradually, her self-esteem began to improve, and she started to feel more confident in her abilities. This shift in perspective gave her the strength to keep pushing forward and not let the challenges she faced hold her back. In the end, she learned that resilience and self-belief were essential in overcoming obstacles and achieving her goals.
1019	9884	4	3	The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explanatory that the metaphor compares Saeng and her test to the perennial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered a triathlon, and my goal was to place first, I placed first overall, then next year came, and I trained until the triathlon came again, and I placed second, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal.
1020	9885	4	3	The Author includes that part in his story because itís talking about nature and all the beautiful things in nature. There are the flowers, tall green grass, the white picket fence, and in the story, there are similar types of things that can be found in nature. This connection to nature helps set the scene and create a vivid picture for the readers, enhancing the overall reading experience. By incorporating these natural elements, the Author adds depth and richness to the story, making it more relatable and engaging for the audience.
1021	9886	4	3	"The author views the hibiscus plant as a new start. For example, when she says ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" she failed the first time and got the plant the next time she'll pass it. This symbolizes a fresh opportunity for success and growth, much like the hibiscus blooming after a harsh winter. It represents resilience, hope, and the chance to overcome past setbacks. The author's determination to try again, coupled with the budding hibiscus, foreshadows a positive outcome in the future. It signifies a new beginning and the potential for a brighter tomorrow. Just as the hibiscus blooms anew each spring, so too does the author have the chance to thrive and flourish after facing challenges."
1022	9887	4	3	The author includes these paragraphs in the story because it signifies the arrival of spring, a time when the snows melt away, and the geese return. It symbolizes the transition from the cold, harsh winter to the warmer, more vibrant season. The changing weather is highlighted, emphasizing the shift from snow-covered landscapes to blooming flowers and chirping birds. This transformation brings a sense of renewal and hope, showcasing the beauty of nature as it awakens from its slumber. Spring is portrayed as a time of rejuvenation and new beginnings, a period of growth and revitalization after the long winter months.
1023	9888	4	3	She was upset with herself because she bought the hibiscus and not the plant seeds. So she starts crying because she remembered how pretty their old one used to be. When the snow melts and the flowers start to bloom is when she is going to take the test again. The author ended the paragraph like that to show a new beginning next year. She vowed to care for the hibiscus diligently, nurturing it with love and attention, in the hopes of seeing it flourish into a beautiful plant just like the one they had before. The anticipation of its growth and blooming brought a sense of hope and renewal, signaling a fresh start in the coming year.
1024	9889	4	3	I believe that she included this because she wanted to show important it was to her. For example when she says in the spring she will take the test again. I think that meant she will work harder to make sure she does everything right. So that she can say she follows through on things that are important to her. These are my thoughts on why she included this paragraph in the story.
1025	9890	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test. It takes time for a hibiscus to bud. It sounds like a good end, and she would not want to take the test in the snow.
1026	9891	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let the readers know that how Saeng feels about the hibiscus. I think the author concludes this because he is telling the reader that the hibiscus gives Saeng good luck and with this good luck she will pass the test. In the story, it tells us how much Saeng adores the plant. For example, when she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool. That's why the author uses that paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng feels and how it makes her feel confident.
1027	9892	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The thought of the challenge ahead filled her with a mix of determination and apprehension. Would she be able to conquer her fears and doubts this time around? Only time would tell. As she gazed out at the serene landscape, a sense of anticipation settled in her heart. The future held endless possibilities, and Saeng was ready to face whatever may come her way. The hibiscus, with its delicate petals swaying in the breeze, seemed to whisper words of encouragement, fueling her resolve. With a deep breath, she turned away, ready to embark on the journey that lay ahead.
1028	9893	4	3	By ending the story in this way, the author effectively conveys Saeng's determination to overcome her struggles and challenges in a foreign land while longing for the comfort and familiarity of home. The repetition of her statement about retaking the test emphasizes her resilience and perseverance, leaving the reader with a sense of admiration for her strength and resilience. This conclusion serves to highlight Saeng's inner strength and determination, ultimately leaving a lasting impression on the reader about the power of resilience in the face of adversity.
1029	9894	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because now she has something to work for. The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph because she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could wait to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are reasons why i think the author put that conclude with the paragraph.
1030	9895	4	3	Saeng was determined to succeed. Despite facing failure, she did not give up. Instead, she set a new time to try again. Her ambition to achieve a good life was unwavering. Saeng was willing to explore new opportunities and push herself to the limit in order to make her dreams a reality. With her resilience and perseverance, there was no doubt that Saeng would eventually find success in this world.
1031	9896	4	3	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" is a heartwarming tale about a foreign girl adjusting to life in a new place. She finds solace in tropical flowers, particularly the hibiscus. The author's choice to end the story with the man leaving and the flowers beginning to bloom signifies the girl's determination to adapt and thrive in her new environment come spring. As the hibiscus flowers start to grow, it symbolizes her own growth and transformation as she navigates the challenges of fitting into her new home. In the face of change and uncertainty, the girl finds hope and resilience, much like the resilient winter hibiscus blooming in the cold season. With each bloom, she takes a step closer to finding her place and belonging in @LOCATION1."
1032	9897	4	3	I think the author used this paragraph for the ending because it's meaningful to Saeng. She really loves her garden, and it holds a special place in her heart. As the snow begins to melt, she looks forward to the day when she can finally take the test and hopefully obtain her driver's license. This moment symbolizes a new chapter in her life, filled with independence and opportunities to explore the world beyond her garden. The journey ahead is uncertain, but Saeng is ready to embrace it with determination and enthusiasm.
1033	9898	4	3	"I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because new beginnings. What I mean by this is, the hibiscus represents new beginnings. She says ""When the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This will be a new start for her. The plant blooming makes her happy and reminds her of her grandmother. She's saying by the time the spring comes around she would be ready for a new obstacle as so for the hibiscus plant."
1034	9899	4	3	I believe the author chooses to end the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The plant represents her home. But she realizes by the sight of the geese flying south that everyone has to leave home at some point. She has now come to terms with what is happening and she will try again for her driver's license soon. When the hibiscus buds again, it will be symbolic to her, and that is when she will be ready to try once again.
1035	9900	4	3	"I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because sheís showing she is trying she wants another chance. She realized her mistakeís and ready to start over, Even though she faild by trying to grow her hibiscus in the winter she is trying to start over when the @DATE1 comes in. for example in the story. It stated the ""winter hibiscus"" was in the ground now, and saeng tamped down the soil around it over head, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yes familiar to saeng snow. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."
1036	9901	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks itíll bring her good luck in the test. When she goes back to take the test sheíll have the comfort of her home land of the hibiscus plant to encourage her to pass the driving test. When she takes the test again sheíll ve mast to pass due to the comfort of home and sheíll be used to the area being different from her homeland. In order for her to do well in the test she needs something to help her have a little but more confident in herself. Having things to remind her of home and the house that she lives at now can help her a lot in being confident in herself. This sense of familiarity and connection to her roots will provide her with the strength and determination needed to succeed in her driving test. With the support of her home and the memories of her homeland, she will approach the test with renewed confidence and a positive mindset, increasing her chances of passing with flying colors.
1037	9902	4	3	She said that she was going to take the test again to show her mom that she can do it and pass it this time, instead of worrying over her old home. With determination in her heart, she knew that this was her chance to prove herself and make her loved ones proud. Pushing aside any doubts or fears, she focused on studying hard and preparing herself for success. This time, she was ready to face the challenge head-on and emerge victorious. The thought of her mom's smile when she sees the passing grade motivated her to strive for excellence. With a renewed sense of purpose, she was determined to achieve her goal and show everyone, especially herself, that she was capable of achieving great things.
1038	9903	4	3	I think that this shows hope because she had really missed her homeland and found peace and serenity by being around the flowers. She mentioned that at least she could hold on to the bud, which symbolizes a connection to her homeland. She missed the simple joys of her grandmother washing her hair and putting a dok mali flower into it. The hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother were all things she longed for. Despite being far from home, the flowers served as a reminder of her roots and brought her a sense of comfort and familiarity. The presence of the flowers allowed her to feel connected to her homeland even in a foreign place, giving her hope and solace in her longing for home.
1039	9904	4	3	"In the last paragraph, the reason why the author uses ""when they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test"" is because Saeng finally found comfort. After moving from her homeland Vietnam to the United States, she felt homesick. For example, she came across a flower that reminded her of the time she spent in her homeland. She remembered her grandmother's smell because of the plant. So when she finally got home to her mother, she showed the flower to her. They both planted the flower, and Saeng got a sense of relief. That's why she vowed that when winter was over and spring came, she would take that test because she had a sense of home in her that gave her encouragement and strength. It also shows that even when you are in a different area and you are new, there's always something that can make you remember the emotions and time spent where you came from."
1040	9905	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because it shows that she is determined to pass the test. It is also like if the birds can fly south she can pass that test. The resilience and perseverance displayed by the character in facing challenges are evident in her unwavering commitment to succeed. Just as the birds navigate their way south with determination and purpose, she too is focused on achieving her goal of passing the test. This comparison highlights her strong resolve and unwavering determination to overcome obstacles and achieve success.
1041	9906	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author does this for several reasons. The author wants to show you that Saeng still has hope and that she believes she can make it right. Also, to show Saeng will still try and adapt to her surrounding and make friends. Saeng is also, determined that she will pass the test next time she takes it. Last it is emphasizing the conflict and how Saeng overcame it."
1042	9907	4	3	"I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" proves that she's moving on with life and so will all the creatures in the world. Also, even though she moved to a new country doesn't mean she can't still enjoy the things from her homeland, ""but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac."" That's why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on."
1043	9908	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she really isn't worried about when they take the test again; she's only concerned with the plants she picked out. Also, she knows that it will be a really long time before she takes the test again, so that gives her more time to study and get more prepared and focused. The author also ends this article with this paragraph because she wants to let the readers know that since she failed the first time, she will be back again to take it over, and nothing will stop her from succeeding.
1044	9909	4	3	It shows not to give up, it ends almost the same way it began, and it shows that people should not stay too attached to the past.

Ultimately, the story encourages readers to keep striving for their goals, let go of past setbacks, and embrace new opportunities for growth and success.
1045	9910	4	3	Saeng was feeling disappointed after failing the test she had taken. It was clear that the test held great importance to her, as her disappointment was palpable. The author chose to end the story with a paragraph highlighting Saeng's determination and dedication to passing the test. It is evident that Saeng is committed to achieving success and earning the respect of her mother. The test likely involves spending a minimal amount of money, which adds to the pressure Saeng is feeling.

The reason for this conclusion is to re-establish the symbolism of the plant. The hibiscus buds in the spring, needing time to grow and adapt to its new environment, much like Saeng, who has recently moved from Vietnam and failed her driver's test. Feeling misunderstood and out of place in her new culture, Saeng is uncertain of her place. However, just as the hibiscus will adapt to its new life, Saeng will also find her way and adjust to her surroundings."
1047	9912	4	3	"The author concluded the story by saying she will take the test again in the spring and until then vow silently because the spring reminded Saeng of home. In Vietnam, there were many beautiful wild flowers. Saeng goes to the flower shop to get a piece of home. It said the flower's ""leaves quivering in the wind."" This shows that the plant was not the same because there were also no buds. She had just failed her driving test before this and needed hope, so all waiting until spring when the hibiscus will bloom again that will give Saeng a sense of home which will give her hope to do good on the driving test. She found solace in the thought of the hibiscus blooming again in the spring, connecting her to her homeland and providing her with the strength and hope she needed to try again."
1048	9913	4	3	Saeng's whole world revolved around the lush greenery of the plants. Their vibrant colors and graceful movements brought her joy and purpose. Without them, she felt lost and unmotivated. The absence of the plants left a void in her heart that could not be filled by anything else. Saeng knew that she needed to find a way to bring them back, for without them, life seemed dull and meaningless. And so, she set out on a journey to restore the beauty and vitality that once filled her world.
1049	9914	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng vowing to herself to take the test again in the spring when the snows melt and the hibiscus is budding.

This circular narrative structure serves to highlight the cyclical nature of the protagonist's journey, ultimately leading to a poignant and thought-provoking resolution. By returning to the initial premise, the author effectively ties up loose ends and provides a satisfying conclusion for the reader. Through this deliberate choice, the author leaves a lasting impact and conveys a deeper message about the interconnectedness of events in the story. Ultimately, the conclusion serves as a fitting end to the narrative, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
1051	9916	4	3	I really do not know why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Possibly because she started to talk. Perhaps she wanted to emphasize the importance of communication in resolving conflicts or to show the power of sharing one's thoughts and feelings. Overall, this ending leaves room for interpretation and reflection on the significance of verbal expression in relationships. By ending the story in this way, the author prompts readers to consider the impact of dialogue and conversation in addressing challenges and connecting with others on a deeper level.
1052	9917	4	3	In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Saeng's determination shines through as she looks forward to the changing seasons and the opportunity for a fresh start. Despite feeling out of place, she remains resilient and willing to face challenges head-on. As she embraces the new world around her, Saeng's strength and perseverance will guide her towards success in the face of adversity.
1053	9918	4	3	The author concludes the story saying that because she wants to show us that Saeng is confident in herself and will not hesitate to take the test again. She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. As she dug, she thought about the mistakes she had made during the test and how she could improve next time. With each shovel of dirt, she felt a sense of determination growing inside her. Saeng knew that she had what it takes to succeed, and she was ready to prove it. After carefully planting the seeds in the freshly dug hole, she stood up, brushed the dirt off her hands, and smiled. Saeng was ready for whatever challenges lay ahead, confident in her abilities and determined to reach her goals.
1054	9919	4	3	The author concludes with the blooming hibiscus representing Saeng's homeland, providing her comfort and a connection to her emotions.

The visual imagery of the flower's blossoming serves as a reminder that the rewards of perseverance and resilience are truly worth it.

But when this sentence comes the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will persevere whereas before she was so upset, when she said, ""I-I failed the test."" Then for Saeng to rebound from this event, gave the reader hope and that's why the author did this. Saeng's determination to overcome this setback shines through, and it is clear that she will emerge stronger from this experience."
1056	9921	4	3	Saeng failed the test, and as winter set in, the plant withered away. However, as the seasons changed and spring arrived, new buds began to form on the plant. It was a symbol of hope and new beginnings. Saeng knew that she would have another chance to retake the test and prove herself. Just like the plant, she was given the opportunity to start fresh and work towards success. With determination and perseverance, she was ready to embrace the new beginning that awaited her.
1057	9922	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, saeng vowed don't really like to talk. Saeng liked to be by her self sometimes. When spring come it was a different story. Saeng loved the spring and @DATE2. She would play outside all day every day. Saeng was just a nice girl who appreciated the beauty of nature and the joy of spending time outdoors.
1058	9923	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.
1059	9924	4	3	The author concludes the story with the idea of starting anew in the spring, as winter signifies a time for things to fade away.

Just like how hibiscus flowers bloom after a period of dormancy, setbacks can be overcome with determination and perseverance. The author's choice to end the story with this resolution serves as a reminder that failure is not permanent, and with time and effort, one can achieve their goals."
1061	9926	4	3	The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to set the final mood. The author wanted to show that Saeng will not give up and she will continue to adapt to her new surroundings. It made the end of the story feel warm and it also inspired. The end of the story encourages the reader to not give up as well. The last paragraph sets an example of how the reader can vow to improve as well. The author knew that the last paragraph would stand as an inspiration and maybe help a reader going through something similar to the story. Saeng's determination and resilience serve as a reminder that no matter what challenges we face, we can always find a way to overcome them. It's a powerful message that resonates with readers and leaves them with a sense of hope and motivation to keep pushing forward, no matter what obstacles may come their way.
1062	9927	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to remind her of her homeland which calms her and when it is budding she feels stronger. In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider and when she sees the plant she sees a part of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say ìat home.î When she says ìand this hibiscus is budding,î I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it says how see is getting used to the geese flying in a ìVî so she is getting more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again. The budding hibiscus symbolizes her growing connection to her new surroundings and her eventual acceptance of this place as her home.
1063	9928	4	3	"The author includes the paragraph, ""when they come back...then I will take that test again,"" to show that hibiscus is a symbol of time. Saeng uses the hibiscus to measure the amount of time there will be until she takes her test again. The hibiscus also symbolizes the power to get through struggling (stay strong). Saeng had trouble with her test, but the hibiscus is there to help push her through it to prepare her for the next test. The hibiscus also helps Saeng's mother push through her hard time of seeing her daughter sad from not succeeding on the test. The plant helps the mother try and stay positive and it also helps the mother by trying to do the right thing for her daughter. In the story, the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to make her daughter happy. The hibiscus shows strong symbolism and it helps Saeng and her mother stay strong throughout their struggles. The presence of the hibiscus serves as a reminder of perseverance and resilience, encouraging both Saeng and her mother to face challenges with determination and hope."
1064	9929	4	3	Saeng's determination to change and adapt to her new environment is being put to the test with the hibiscus plant. Although she failed this time, she is not giving up.

This journey of self-discovery and growth is essential for her happiness and understanding in this world. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of her willingness to keep pushing forward, to keep trying, and to never give up on her quest for inner peace and contentment. In the end, Saeng knows that persistence and resilience will lead her to the happiness she seeks.

Her determination to improve and succeed was evident in her words, showing that she was willing to learn from her mistake and strive for better results in the future.
1066	9931	4	3	I believe the author ended the story with the test because it is a big part of Saeng's life or part of her tradition. Throughout the story, Saeng's preparations and anxiety about the test are a central focus, showing the significance of this event in her life. The test represents a culmination of her hard work and determination, making it a fitting conclusion to the story. Additionally, the test serves as a way to showcase Saeng's character development and growth, allowing readers to see how far she has come since the beginning of the story. By ending with the test, the author highlights the importance of perseverance and dedication in achieving one's goals, leaving readers with a sense of closure and satisfaction.
1067	9932	4	3	There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author may have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up.
1068	9933	4	3	The author concludes the story with this sentence to highlight the dedication she and her child have towards gardening. It hints at the child's favorite plant, possibly the hibiscus, and suggests that gardening is a cherished activity they enjoy together.

This marks a turning point in her attitude towards her new country, as she begins to embrace the similarities between her old and new homes. The hibiscus inspires her to look forward to the future and start anew, accepting her present situation with a sense of hope and determination.
1070	9935	4	3	Saeng's decision to retake the driving test in the spring symbolized her determination to overcome challenges in her new life in @LOCATION1. As she walked home, the sight of a familiar flower sparked a sense of nostalgia and connection to her roots. Visiting the flower shop, she found solace in the array of blooms that reminded her of home. The hibiscus she purchased not only represented resilience but also served as a beacon of hope during the harsh winter months. Planting it with her mother reinforced Saeng's belief in her ability to adapt and thrive in @LOCATION1. Watching the birds soar above, she realized that like the hibiscus, she too had the strength to endure and flourish in her new environment. The hibiscus had become a symbol of courage and resilience, inspiring Saeng to face her challenges head-on and embrace her life in @LOCATION1 with renewed determination.
1071	9936	4	3	The reason I think the author concludes this story with this last paragraph is because this is Saeng's passion. She will do this every year with dedication and love for plants. The final paragraph highlights her commitment and deep appreciation for the spring season and the Hibiscus. Saeng's enthusiasm for gardening shines through, and she eagerly looks forward to repeating the process again. Her love for plants is evident, and she values the beauty and joy they bring to her life.
1072	9937	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and struggling to survive and fit in in its non-native land, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This is supported throughout the story when her mother comments on the hibiscus by the lake. She says, ""It's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters"" (Ho). Here, the author shows the comparison between the hibiscus' struggle through hard times in a foreign land similarly felt in Saeng's life. Both must be strong and fight through hard times where no one, ""not even her classmates or friends, or Mrs. Lambert"" (Ho), understood how alone and out of place she felt. So just as she vows to take the test again, she is promising herself she will fight through the hard times, grow strong, just like her winter hibiscus."
1073	9938	4	3	Primarily why she said that was she was saying with time comes change. She was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well. I depicted this by the idea you can tell that she is beginning to sit over missing her home in Vietnam and that is memory with time change comes along. That is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes change. But I think as much I did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. But otherwise and finally I believed Saeng said this because time brings change. She understands that as time passes, circumstances evolve, and people grow, leading to changes in one's performance and outlook.
1074	9939	4	3	The author ended the story with the discovery of a hibiscus plant to emphasize its significance in providing comfort and strength in a new environment. Despite being away from her native country, finding this plant symbolized resilience and determination. It served as a source of support, giving her the motivation to face any challenges that may come her way. The hibiscus plant became a representation of hope and empowerment, inspiring the author to overcome obstacles and achieve success.
1075	9940	4	3	The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way.
1076	9941	4	3	The author concludes the story with the protagonist deciding to try again in the spring, indicating a fresh start for both her and her plant. This ending suggests hope, resilience, and the possibility of growth and renewal. It leaves room for the story to continue in a spin-off, exploring the protagonist's journey towards nurturing her plant and herself, symbolizing new beginnings and second chances.
1077	9942	4	3	"The author concludes the story with, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" for several reasons. One reason is that the hibiscus flower will be adapting to spring just like Saeng should to her new environment in the United States. Another reason is like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has begun to grow older and much wiser of things, allowing her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Lastly, in the text it says, ""she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This shows Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease now where she is living, just how the hibiscus flower adapts to its place with ease and gets used to seasons."
1078	9943	4	3	The author further emphasizes Saeng's determination to retake the test upon her return, highlighting the idea that life itself can be seen as a series of tests and challenges. Through Saeng's perspective, the reader is reminded of the importance of appreciating the present moment and not taking things for granted. The metaphor of the test serves as a reflection of personal growth and the evolution of relationships, urging the reader to consider the significance of their experiences and the potential for growth that lies ahead. Ultimately, the story conveys a message of resilience and the continuous cycle of learning and self-discovery in life.
1079	9944	4	3	Because the Winter hibiscus was in the ground, Saeng carefully tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks echoing through the air. The serene moment was a reminder of the beauty of nature and the importance of taking care of our environment. Saeng smiled, feeling a sense of peace and connection with the world around them. The simple act of tending to the hibiscus had brought a moment of joy and harmony, a small but significant contribution to the well-being of the Earth. As the geese disappeared into the distance, Saeng stood up, grateful for the opportunity to witness such a beautiful sight and eager to continue nurturing the plants in their garden.
1080	9945	4	3	"The author includes this paragraph in the story because it shows an impression on work ethic and adaption to a new environment can be difficult. ""Not even @PERSON1, looked at it."" makes something to dislike apparent to a student that is new don't give them good. Work ethic and that will ensure them mentally also. Therefore, the girl is not comfortable and not enthused to work on something that none would appreciate."
1081	9946	4	3	The author concludes with this because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. For example, She writes ìshe vowed silently to herself.î When you vow to do something it usually means that you are very determined to do something. Everything else that she says after that she really means it. Therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show her devotion to her goal.
1082	9947	4	3	The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home. She wonít spend so much time dreaming about her past. ìAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.î I believe that's what she needed to get on with her life. Saeng's tears washed away the pain and sorrow of her past, allowing her to embrace the present and look forward to the future with hope and optimism. The release of her emotions in the greenhouse symbolized a turning point in her healing process, signifying her readiness to let go of the past and move on. Saeng's tears were not tears of sadness, but tears of liberation, setting her spirit free from the burdens that had weighed her down for so long. In that moment of vulnerability, she found strength and resilience, knowing that she had the power to overcome any challenges that may come her way. Saeng's tears were a catharsis, a cleansing of her soul, paving the way for a new beginning filled with possibilities and opportunities. With each tear that fell, Saeng felt lighter, as if a heavy weight had been lifted off her shoulders. She emerged from the greenhouse with a newfound sense of purpose and determination, ready to face whatever the future held for her. Saeng's tears were not the end of her journey, but the beginning of a new chapter in her life, one filled with growth, transformation, and ultimately, happiness.
1083	9948	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to let us know when she'll take it again. When the season changes is when she will take it again. Saeng is probably embarrassed which is why she wants to wait so long. Saeng took a long walk home and stopped at the flower shop. She tried getting her mind off failing the test by buying a nice flower or plant for @MONEY1. Her mother was upset at first, but then she realized her daughter wasn't happy and changed her mood. Saeng's small gesture of buying a gift for @MONEY1 shows her caring nature and desire to make amends for her disappointment. This thoughtful act also highlights the supportive relationship between Saeng and her mother, who is quick to understand and comfort her daughter in times of distress.
1084	9949	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to America from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in America. I think the geese represent something that is always changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her license. This shows her determination and resilience in the face of challenges, symbolizing her ability to adapt and overcome obstacles in her new environment. By using the image of the geese flying overhead, the author leaves us with a sense of hope and possibility for the protagonist's future endeavors in her new home.
1085	9950	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because now she has something to work for. The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph because she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could want to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are the reasons why I think the author put that conclude with the paragraph.
1086	9951	4	3	Saeng silently prepared herself for spring, knowing that she would have to face the challenges once again. As the season approached, she felt a sense of anticipation and determination. The plants around her bloomed beautifully, a sign of new beginnings. Despite the difficulties she had encountered before, Saeng felt ready to tackle them head-on. The ruler's strong stance on machines and technology only fueled her motivation to succeed. With spring just around the corner, she knew that the time had come to take the test again. The story had come full circle, with a sense of balance and readiness in the air. In the end, Saeng believed that this time, with spring as her ally, she would achieve a good ending.
1087	9952	4	3	The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to Saeng. To her, it is a symbol of strength and comfort. She knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of winter, she will not fail either. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's resilience and determination, giving her hope and motivation to overcome challenges. By waiting for the hibiscus to bud before taking her test again, she finds solace and connection to her homeland. Regardless of the outcome, seeing her favorite plant bloom brings her happiness and a sense of continuity. The hibiscus serves as a reminder that life goes on, and just like the plant, Saeng will persevere and thrive despite the obstacles she faces.
1088	9953	4	3	"I believe the author concluded the story with ìWhen they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.î because it shows the entire theme of the story. The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrates this when she says she will take the test again. The hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. For example ìThe familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair."" The hibiscus was something from home that gave her good memories. The hibiscus encouraged her to accept her new life and keep trying to make it better."
1089	9954	4	3	"The author most likely concludes the story that way because that is the time that Saeng feels most comfortable. Saeng and her mom moved from Vietnam, were the winter Hibiscus are popular and familiar to Saeng. She ends the text in this maner because it remins Saeng about Vietnam, and how she feels better during that time of year. When she says ""And beside it was yet another old friend,"" she feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable. This is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did."
1090	9955	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this saying because it will be a fresh start and it will be spring and beautiful. ""Plant it right now"" is telling me that she wants another try. She wants a fresh start and come spring when all of her pretty flowers are blooming and getting their chance, she wants her new chance to be at its best."
1091	9956	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of her sadness for what she did. The test she was telling about was how she was supposed to use the twenty dollars they had and buy one. Big that she spent most of money besides after to buy a plant which reminded her at home and this last paragraph is saying that when she has the chance to do the test again, that she will do what she is supposed to do.
1092	9957	4	3	"After failing her driving test, Saeng was devastated and unsure if she would ever succeed. However, the sight of a hibiscus plant sparked memories of her homeland in Vietnam, filling her with inspiration. Despite her mother's initial disapproval of the expensive purchase, seeing the joy it brought Saeng softened her heart. As Saeng planted the hibiscus, the act of nurturing new life encouraged her to face her fears and try the driving test again. Through overcoming the challenges of bringing the plant home and tending to it, Saeng found the strength to tackle her obstacles head-on. The ending paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" reinforces the theme of perseverance and resilience in the face of adversity, showing that with determination, one can triumph over any hindrance."
1093	9958	4	3	"The last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination. The Hibiscus reminded her that her ""home"" was her old life, but misses @CAPS1 in her new life. She gains determination through the reminder of this. She soon realizes that she is home, for things have come familiar to her, such as the V formation of the geese. She loved her old home, but she realized it was time to move on. The last paragraph does not only mean retaking a driving test, it symbolizes the determination to embrace her new home and life. In the end, she found solace in the realization that home is where the heart is, and she was determined to make the most of her new beginning."
1094	9959	4	3	I will take that test again. She has gained confidence from the hibiscus and snow. When the snow melts and hibiscus buds, then she will grow again, kind of growing with the hibiscus, so in all she is ready to have enough confidence for the test. As she continues to nurture her growth alongside the blooming hibiscus, her confidence steadily flourishes, just like the vibrant petals of the flower. With each passing day, she becomes more assured in her abilities, mirroring the resilience and beauty of the hibiscus in full bloom. Just as the hibiscus stands tall and proud, she too stands strong and confident, ready to face any challenge that comes her way.
1095	9960	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways. By facing his fears and challenges head-on, the protagonist demonstrates resilience and determination, setting a positive example for readers to follow in their own lives.
1096	9961	4	3	"The final paragraph in ""Winter Hibiscus"" by CAPS1 Ho reads, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This paragraph compares her to the flowers, showing her resilience and determination to take the test again next year and pass it. The decision to retake the test is a comforting reminder of home, symbolizing her strength and perseverance in the face of challenges."
1097	9962	4	3	"He ended the paragraph like that because he wanted you to read on, or it could be that he is showing you the comparison between the flower and Saeng. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" The quote is showing the flower can fight through the winter and come back. Saeng failed the test once and is now going back to retake the test. Which shows that they both have motivation and the integrity to come back. This determination and resilience are evident in both the hibiscus flower and Saeng, as they both face challenges but refuse to give up. The parallel drawn between the flower's return in spring and Saeng's decision to retake the test highlights the theme of perseverance and the ability to overcome obstacles. Ultimately, this comparison emphasizes the strength and fortitude of both the flower and Saeng, inspiring the reader to push through difficulties and strive for success."
1098	9963	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take that test againî. I believe the author concluded the story like this because it shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a new beginning and to restart what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it gave her comfort in a time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences, and the abilities she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, ìwhen the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", This implies a new beginning so the hibiscus is representing Saeng. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph."
1099	9964	4	3	"The last line is included in the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" because it showed the connection between Saeng and the flower. Even though Saeng failed the driving test the first time she decides to take it again in the spring. The hibiscus flower like Saeng is out of place and will have to make it through the winter into the spring so it can bud again. This shows how like the flower Saeng will bud again in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that saeng and the flower are not used to the conditions in @LOCATION1. So they both have to weather the winter months they are not used to. This shows again how the last line connects the girl and the flower together. In conclusion, the last line is used in the text to wrap up the story with a connection between the flower and Saeng. Saeng's determination to try again in the spring mirrors the hibiscus's resilience in surviving the winter, highlighting the theme of perseverance and renewal throughout the narrative."
1100	9965	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the author is determined to get used to the new country and surroundings. In the story, the author is showing home sickness. The author see a plant that is know where she come from and buy for over @NUM1 her mother couldnít believe it. She didnít want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say home or start crying again. The last sentence is showing that author is trying to adapt.
1101	9966	4	3	In conclusion, the hibiscus has become a source of comfort and joy for the author, serving as a respite in times of distress. Whether it be caring for the plant or simply admiring its beauty, the hibiscus has become a beloved hobby that brings solace and relaxation. Its vibrant blooms and delicate petals offer a sense of peace and tranquility, creating a sense of connection with nature and the simple pleasures it provides. As the author tends to the hibiscus, she/he finds a sense of calm and contentment, reminding her/him of the beauty that can be found in the midst of life's challenges.
1102	9967	4	3	The winter hibiscus was a plant that saeng remembered of life back home up to the story, so when she saw the plant, a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung saeng's eyes now swept over her. Saeng was unable to comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and help saeng to try to take the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Saeng mentions this so that she can get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and to come to grips with her failed test. Therefore by mentioning the things she does in the last paragraph, saeng uses familiar objects, foreign and domestic, to illustrate her coming to grips with her failure.
1103	9968	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it expresses the meaning of the story. Life continues no matter what, the hibiscus will return again in the spring. The hibiscus is like a symbol to Saeng's life. The plant normally doesn't survive in winter months, but this one did. The mother says, ""It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here..."" Saeng and her mother are just like the plant. They are strong and their lives will continue even though they are in a new environment. The author chose to end the story with that paragraph because even though she say the hibiscus will come back every spring the deeper meaning is that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will continue to live their lives."
1104	9969	4	3	"The author chooses to end the story in a very deep, connected way. It is ended on a note of rebirth and second chances when Saeng vows, ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, when the Hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again."" The author is connecting a sense of a new country and second chances and rebirth. Spring and snow melting could be connected to rebirth, while the geese returning could symbolize a second chance. This is connected to Saeng's second chance. The author also shows that Saeng is getting used to the new country, which shows a sense of hope. It shows that there is some hope for her test."
1105	9970	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morle of the story. I said this idea because in the story he talks about orchids, lanno bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vires surrounded her. It talks about how these flowers surrounded her to test her.
1106	9971	4	3	I think the Author concludes this in the story because. It is a key information for this story. Because. It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom. This connection to her mother's love for gardening helps to highlight the importance of family bonds and the influence they can have on shaping our passions and interests. By showcasing the protagonist's desire to follow in her mother's footsteps, the author emphasizes the lasting impact of familial relationships and the power they hold in guiding our paths in life. Ultimately, this conclusion serves to underscore the theme of legacy and the ways in which our loved ones can inspire us to pursue our dreams.
1107	9972	4	3	Saeng feels a deep sense of loss after leaving her grandmother behind. To fill this void, she purchases a hibiscus plant, reminiscent of her grandmother's comforting scent. Despite spending a significant amount on the plant, Saeng believes it is necessary for her to feel more connected to her roots. She reflects on the abruptness of leaving her country, feeling like it happened in the blink of an eye. Remembering her grandmother's strength, Saeng strives to be resilient and not succumb to tears when reminded of her past. As the hibiscus plant begins to bloom, she sees it as a symbol of growth and hopes to overcome her sadness. Saeng is determined to pass this emotional test and find solace in her memories of her grandmother, allowing herself to smile through the pain.
1108	9973	4	3	The reason I think that the author did it is because wanted you to know what time it took place and what the weather was like then it also so tells you how long she is going to wait like till the snow melts and that is going to be while and when the geese live and return home so this is why I think she tells you what is like. Additionally, providing these details helps set the scene and create a sense of anticipation for the reader, as they wait alongside the narrator for the snow to melt and the geese to return home. It adds depth to the story and immerses the reader in the passage of time and changing seasons.
1109	9974	4	3	I think that this is about winter hibiscus and hedge tall and lush bad surrounded their garden its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers, She said when she got to the hibiscus she reached out and touched a petal gently. The petals were soft to the touch, velvety in texture, and a vibrant shade of crimson. As she ran her fingers along the edges of the petals, she couldn't help but marvel at the intricate details of each flower. The hibiscus seemed to glow in the sunlight, its beauty mesmerizing her as she stood there admiring it. The fragrance wafting from the flowers was sweet and intoxicating, filling the air with a delightful aroma. It was a moment of pure bliss, connecting with nature in such a simple yet profound way. She closed her eyes, taking in the sights and scents around her, feeling at peace in the presence of these exquisite winter blooms. In that moment, all her worries and stresses melted away, replaced by a sense of calm and contentment. The hibiscus garden had become her sanctuary, a place where she could escape and find solace amidst the chaos of life. And as she opened her eyes once more, she knew that she would always return to this beautiful garden, where the hibiscus bloomed in all its splendor, welcoming her with open arms.
1110	9975	4	3	"The reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought. Also it symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng says, ""... this hibiscus is budding ..."" (Ho), she is also describing that they will start over when spring comes. And that leaves the reader with the last thought about Saeng, and how she has overcome living in the new place. Lastly, it ties up Saeng's feelings and experiences the whole time she had moved, ""... I will take the test again"" (Ho), which tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a shot. In conclusion, the reason for this quote being the last paragraph is to show that Saeng will continue to try to overcome the challenges she faces in her new environment."
1111	9976	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants there to be hope for the future seeing that hibiscus budding in the spring is what Saeng is waiting for. It gives her hope that she will be able to pass that test again. This is shown when she says, "".. and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" In the winter, Saeng hopes she will improve, and when the hibiscus buds, she will know that it is time to try again. Saeng sees the spring as a new beginning, a time to overcome her obstacles. The obstacle or test might be to not cry when she thinks about her old life in Vietnam. When she accomplishes this, she is growing just like the hibiscus."

Through her dedication to the garden, Saeng keeps her mother's spirit alive, embodying the love and care that was once bestowed upon her. With each seed planted and each flower bloomed, Saeng honors the past while creating a vibrant and flourishing future.
1114	9979	4	3	I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test. In the last paragraph, she states that after winter is over she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms. Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter.
1115	9980	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because she wants to do it right next time. She realizes that she can try every year to get it right and impress her mother. This determination to improve and make her mother proud drives her to keep striving for perfection. Through her ongoing efforts, she hopes to eventually succeed in her goal and create a lasting impact on her mother.
1116	9981	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author likely ends the story with the quote because she wants to show that Saeng thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flower; to her, it is also a memory. For Saeng, the Winter Hibiscus is like storybooks, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower. It unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her ""gentle grandmother"" from her first home. The author is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory or thought. The last sentence clearly states that Saeng cares deeply about her past, and to fit in with life today, she must not forget who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden, she can have a beautiful reminder of where she came from. This reasoning is the assumption as to why the author ended the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the selected paragraph."
1117	9982	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. For example, it shows a sense of hope, when she says ""this hibiscus is budding"". That indicates a new beginning or starting over. I think that is the idea the author is trying to get across. Obviously it was difficult for the author to adjust to her new country. For example, she was disappointed that the hibiscus wasn't the same as the one in her homeland. Even though she's feeling nostalgic; this paragraph reassures the reader that the author is willing to give her new country another chance. This willingness to embrace change and find beauty in new beginnings is a powerful message of resilience and adaptability."
1118	9983	4	3	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that ìwhen they come back ... I will take the test again,î (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, ìA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengís eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept ì(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character.
1119	9984	4	3	The author cherished the flowers, finding solace in their beauty. When she did not pass her driving test, she felt disheartened, but the presence of the flowers uplifted her spirits. As the snow begins to melt, she eagerly awaits the arrival of spring, knowing that the flowers will bloom once again. With renewed faith, she is determined to retake the test and persevere until she succeeds. The flowers symbolize hope and resilience, motivating her to keep moving forward despite setbacks. In the cycle of seasons, she finds comfort and strength, ready to face whatever challenges come her way.
1120	9985	4	3	The author concluded this sentence because he was letting everyone know that Saeng would return to the hibiscus and take care of it still, and that she has not forgotten about it. Saeng's dedication to the hibiscus plant was unwavering, and she made a promise to herself to always nurture and cherish it. Despite the passing of time and the busyness of life, Saeng remained committed to the well-being of the hibiscus, ensuring that it continued to thrive under her care. This small act of tending to the plant symbolized Saeng's enduring love and connection to nature, a bond that would never fade.
1121	9986	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, a teenager, Saeng, moves from Vietnam to the United States. She later takes a driver's test but does not succeed in passing, finding comfort in her memories of her homeland. The last paragraph states ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.""

Saeng will find it easier to get through hardships if she continues to find comfort from her past."
1122	9987	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to get the readers wondering. To show that sheís not going to give up on what she wants to do. She knows that the journey ahead will be challenging, but she is determined to overcome any obstacles in her way. With a strong sense of purpose and a clear vision of her goals, she is ready to face whatever may come her way.

The test symbolized a new beginning for Saeng, a chance to move forward and leave behind the past. Despite her initial attachment to the memories associated with a flower she purchased, Saeng eventually realizes that she can embrace both her old and new life. By vowing to try again and please both herself and her mother, Saeng demonstrates her willingness to start afresh and embark on a new chapter in her life.
1124	9989	4	3	Saeng realized that she needed to take a step back and give herself some time to prepare for the test. By acknowledging her need for a break and focusing on what she needed to do, she knew that she could improve her chances of passing. Taking the time to rest and study effectively would give her the opportunity to succeed. With a clear mind and dedication to her goals, Saeng was confident that she could overcome the challenges ahead and achieve her desired outcome.
1125	9990	4	3	Saeng's determination is further highlighted when she refuses to give up on her passion for plants, despite her mother's disapproval. She is willing to go to great lengths to recreate the beauty of her previous garden, even if it means spending a significant amount of money. This demonstrates her unwavering commitment to her goals and her resilience in the face of obstacles. Despite the challenges she faces in adapting to her new lifestyle, Saeng's determination and perseverance will undoubtedly lead her to success in the end.
1126	9991	4	3	When the hibiscus is budding and a new season starts, Saeng will be a new person and will be able to take the test. The cold snow, fleeing geese, and planted hibiscus all symbolize Saeng's current state of being - feeling cold, wanting to escape, and being restricted. However, as the geese return and the hibiscus grows freely, Saeng will also mature and be ready to face the challenges ahead. Like the hibiscus, she too will bloom and thrive in the new season, ready to conquer whatever comes her way.
1127	9992	4	3	The author ends the story with the sentence provided because she was looking forward to the time when winter would be over and she could test her gardening skills with the plants she had carefully planted.
1128	9993	4	3	Saeng decided to wait for the perfect moment to retake the test. She wanted to wait until the snow had melted, the geese had returned, and the hibiscus was budding. She knew that she needed more time to prepare herself mentally and emotionally for the challenge ahead. When the time came, Saeng would be ready to face the test once again. Patience and perseverance were key, and she was determined to succeed when the right moment arrived. Until then, she would continue to study and improve, knowing that her hard work would eventually pay off.
1129	9994	4	3	Because when the hibiscus started budding, it will give her inspiration to try and pass the test again. In order to pass the test, she wanted to feel like she was home, and to have memories of her home to encourage her to try again. Therefore, this is the reason the author concludes the story with the last paragraph. The hibiscus, with its vibrant blooms and familiar scent, represented a piece of her past and a source of strength for the challenges ahead. It was a reminder of where she came from and a symbol of resilience and determination. With the hibiscus by her side, she felt ready to face whatever obstacles came her way, knowing that she carried the spirit of home within her.

When she realized the hibiscus was different from what she was used to, a wave of nostalgia washed over her. She missed the familiarity of her past life. However, instead of giving up, she decided to embrace her new surroundings and make the best of it. As the geese flew back and the hibiscus began to bloom, she made a promise to herself to keep trying, to adapt, and to never lose sight of her goals. The author's message was clear - perseverance and resilience are key in facing challenges, and the narrator embodied this spirit as she moved forward in her new home.

This conclusion serves to tie up loose ends and provide a sense of closure for both the character and the reader, leaving them with a sense of resolution and satisfaction. Overall, the final paragraph effectively encapsulates the themes of the story and leaves a lasting impression on the audience.
1132	9997	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he messed up on the test and he is saying that when spring comes back around, he will be ready to take the test. I know it is spring because he said when the snow melts. This suggests that he will use the time to study and prepare himself better for the next opportunity to take the test. This shows a sense of determination and growth in the character, as he is willing to learn from his mistakes and improve himself for the future. By ending the story on this note, the author leaves the reader with a sense of hope and possibility for the protagonist's future success.
1133	9998	4	3	When she moved to America, she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring. She saw a blossom that caught her attention - it was called hibiscus. She felt a connection to it, as back where she came from, they grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in her grandmother's walls. The blossom reminded her of her grandmother with her long gray hair freshly washed. She decided to visit the florist to see if they had the hibiscus, hoping to bring a piece of her past into her new home in America.
1134	9999	4	3	"In the passage ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Monfong Ho, the quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again"" symbolizes Saeng's new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test, Saeng is having a personal discrepancy, missing her homeland as she states ""I failed the test."" This test meant more to her than just failing. It was a test of her ability to function in her new country and she failed. The ""when they came back..."" quote can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself. When the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new, stronger person, she will take the test again."

1137	10002	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, because that flower budding would make her feel confident about everything. The reason I think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland. Itís basically like she has a little piece of home in her new home. An example that represents this is, ìNot like the kind we had before,î this is explaining the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one from home, so this reminds her of home. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story the way they do.
1138	10003	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up. She is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story. But just like she was able to move away from her homeland she will eventually pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants. She obviously misses the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that just like Saeng will do on her test the next time.
1139	10004	4	3	Everything in the story is about to change. The winter will change to spring, the snow will melt and vanish, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will also change and mature as well. Saeng is just like the hibiscus plant, out of place on the road in the new country, and she must adapt like the hibiscus plant. The plant looks different in the United States than in Vietnam because it matured and grew. That is what Saeng must do - she must mature and grow in this new country. For example, Saeng observed how different the plant looked in the shop window than it did in her home country. She was observing herself and how different she appeared as well. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had matured already and putting it at the end to show that she had grown. Putting it at the beginning would not give the same effect. The hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winters change. Saeng is able to do that as well and she made the silent vow to take that test again when she has matured just as the things around her have. Like the hibiscus plant, Saeng will bloom beautifully in her new environment, showing the world her strength and resilience as she embraces the changes and challenges that come her way.
1140	10005	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorporating the geese, hibiscus, and her driver's test into the last paragraph. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the driver's test again through memories of Vietnam. Lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will ""take that test again"", she is shown as being realistic and not overly consistent. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story.  The next morning, as the sun rose over the horizon, she watched the geese fly overhead, their honking filling the air. The hibiscus in her garden bloomed brightly, a symbol of resilience and strength. She took a deep breath, feeling determined. ""I will take that test again,"" she thought to herself. And with that thought, she knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, she would face them head-on, just like she had done before. And as she walked back into her house, a sense of peace washed over her, knowing that she was ready for whatever the future held."
1141	10006	4	3	Saeng felt a pang of nostalgia as she caught sight of the hibiscus plant outside her window, its vibrant red blooms reminding her of home. Despite the twinge of longing for her homeland, she also felt a sense of comfort as she watched the familiar sight of the geese flying overhead. She knew that she was slowly adjusting to her new surroundings, finding solace in the small connections she made with the nature around her. As she contemplated retaking the driving test, she realized that she had the power to decide her own path, just like the geese following their migration patterns. Saeng was determined to embrace this new chapter of her life with resilience and optimism, knowing that she would always carry a piece of her past with her wherever she went.
1142	10007	4	3	Saeng took a deep breath and looked around at the unfamiliar surroundings. She felt a wave of anxiety wash over her as she realized she was not prepared for this test. However, as she walked further into the garden, she noticed some plants that reminded her of home. The sight of the familiar flowers brought her comfort, and she remembered that spring was just around the corner - a time when these plants would bloom beautifully. With renewed determination, Saeng knew that she would be ready to face the test again when the time came.
1143	10008	4	3	The reasoning for concluding this story this way is to state that the season of the flowers is over and is to be held off until the spring so that give the author a point where he/she can end the story and begin on a new one for when the flowers come back in the spring so inconclusion this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph that they chose.
1144	10009	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This determination burned within her, driving her to keep striving for success despite the setback she had faced. The thought of trying again filled her with renewed energy and resolve. With each passing day, she prepared herself diligently, eager for the opportunity to prove her capabilities. As the seasons changed and the hibiscus bloomed once more, Saeng stood ready to face the test once again, with unwavering determination and a steadfast belief in her ability to succeed.
1145	10010	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of how it related to when Saeng failed her driving test. But she was determined to take it over when she feels she's ready and the paragraph said ""in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again."" Saeng's resolve to try again in the future shows her perseverance and determination to overcome obstacles. The imagery of spring symbolizes renewal and growth, suggesting that Saeng will approach the test with a fresh perspective and a readiness to succeed. This ending leaves the reader with a sense of hope and anticipation for Saeng's future success in obtaining her driver's license."
1146	10011	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the protagonist's mother's disappointment serves as a driving force for the character's desire to change and improve. The constant feeling of letting her mother down may push her to seek ways to make amends and create a better future. This element of disappointment adds depth to the narrative, keeping the reader engaged and curious about the protagonist's journey towards self-improvement and reconciliation with her mother. The emotional weight of this disappointment likely motivates the character to reflect on her actions and strive for personal growth. Overall, the presence of her mother's disappointment adds a layer of complexity to the story, prompting the protagonist to take actions that lead to potential resolutions and character development."
1147	10012	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. Saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story but by the end she felt happy and optimistic. When she got home, her mother noticed the tear stains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes.
1148	10013	4	3	"The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the paragraph showcasing the girl's determination and resilience, despite her initial struggles and feelings of sadness. By highlighting her ability to adapt to her new environment and find familiarity in the once strange surroundings, the author emphasizes the girl's growing sense of hope and acceptance. This positive note at the end of the story leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and possibility for the girl's future journey."
1149	10014	4	3	The author concludes the story by highlighting the characters' deep connection with nature, emphasizing their appreciation for the beauty and mysteries it holds. This emphasis on nature suggests that the story itself may serve as a reflection of the wonders and changes that can be found in the natural world. Through their writing, the characters convey a profound respect and admiration for the environment, showcasing nature at its most captivating and enchanting. Overall, the story underscores the enduring allure and significance of the natural world in the lives of those who are attuned to its splendor.
1150	10015	4	3	The author wrote that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad; the author writes, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her.” Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom. The hibiscus flower symbolizes resilience and the beauty of new beginnings. Saeng's connection to her roots through the flower gives her the strength to face challenges and believe in a brighter future. The blooming of the hibiscus buds will not only mark the arrival of spring but also signify Saeng's own growth and transformation. As the hibiscus blooms, so will Saeng, ready to embrace the opportunities that come her way with courage and determination.
1151	10016	4	3	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. During the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. When she planting it itís winter and the hibiscus hasn't bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. And that's why I think the author ended with that paragraph. This shows that the hibiscus is not only a symbol of hope and renewal for Saeng but also a reflection of her own resilience and determination to bloom again despite the challenges she faces. It signifies her willingness to try again and not give up, just like the hibiscus that blooms anew each season. The connection between Saeng and the hibiscus runs deep, and it serves as a poignant reminder of her strength and perseverance in the face of adversity.
1152	10017	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it's saying that she can't work in the garden in winter, but ""when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,"" are all signs of spring. In the spring, she will take the test again; which implies that she will work in the garden."
1153	10018	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. This means that in spring, the hibiscus will bloom, signaling a time of renewal and growth for Saeng as she faces the challenge once more with determination and hope in her heart.
1154	10019	4	3	because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if it's because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place. Maybe the fresh air and blooming flowers will inspire her creativity, or perhaps the warmer weather will boost her energy levels. Whatever the reason, it's clear that she believes her performance will improve during the spring season. The familiar sights and sounds of spring may bring her comfort and a sense of belonging, helping her to feel more at ease and productive. Ultimately, her decision to wait until spring reflects her desire to create a workspace that feels like home and enables her to do her best work.
1155	10020	4	3	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph because it symbolizes Saeng's decision to try again. Things in nature are repetitive, seasons change but eventually, they appear again, geese migrate but they too return, and the author used this as a comparison to Saeng's decision to try for her license again. Just like Saeng, the winter hibiscus was out of its normal environment but was learning to adapt, which inspired Saeng to keep on trying even if she failed because the hibiscus was trying to survive the winter even though it was out of place. Saeng realized that just like the hibiscus, she too could adapt and thrive in new environments, making her determined to persevere and succeed in her endeavors.
1156	10021	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because no matter what she said or did she had to get the flower. It reminded her of where she used to live and how it was there, so she started to cry. The test was not to buy the flower and not to cry. In the spring, she is going to grow her own flower. That is what I think the test is about.
1157	10022	4	3	She sees if her plant will survive the winter just like the ones back at home. She thinks things will be the same. The familiarity of the plant's resilience brings her comfort and a sense of connection to her roots. As she tends to the plant, she is reminded of the strength and adaptability that runs in her blood. The changing seasons may be different in this new place, but the constants of nature provide her with a sense of stability and continuity. Just like her plant, she will weather the challenges of the winter and emerge stronger on the other side. The cycle of growth and renewal is a universal truth that transcends boundaries and brings a sense of belonging wherever she goes.
1158	10023	4	3	Its the start of a new life. She has a new new school and a new plant, Its is like she has a connection to the plant, when it grow she grows stronger and more confident. Thatís when she said when they come back when the hibiscus is budding she will be ready for that test. As the days passed, the hibiscus plant started to blossom, its vibrant red flowers bringing a sense of joy and hope to her. With each new bloom, she felt a surge of determination and resilience building within her. The upcoming test no longer seemed daunting, but rather an opportunity to showcase her growth and newfound strength. The connection she felt with the hibiscus served as a constant reminder of her own potential for growth and transformation. When the day of the test finally arrived, she faced it with a sense of calm and confidence, knowing that just like the hibiscus, she too had the power to bloom and thrive in any challenge that came her way.
1159	10024	4	3	The author ends it with that because it shows that she wonít give up and that she will give her new country a chance. She ends it with that to say that she will be strong like the flower and that she will stay no matter what! That she will be there, in that spot to see it grow back. That's why I think she concluded with that.
1160	10025	4	3	Throughout this story we are given background information on a girl who deferately misses her true home when we are first introduced to young saeng she is in a flouristís shop simply looking at flowers, we soon learn that she is not only looking at flowers but looking a pieces of her home and past, she then purchases a hibiscus which is a flower native to her vietnam. After discovering that she has just failed a test it becomes more apparent that buying the flower is a way to cope with her new situation in @LOCATION1 and feel comforted by her past. The author is able to conclude the story with that satement because it speaks of moving forward without clinging to the past, In the spring saeng will have a new home and find strength in her past, that is what I feel the final paragraph suggests.
1161	10026	4	3	Saeng is determined to pass the test, no matter what it takes. She knows that when spring arrives and the hibiscus flowers start to bloom, she will have another chance to retake the test. The sight of the hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, filling her with a sense of comfort and confidence. It brings back memories of her past successes and triumphs, making her believe that she is capable of achieving her goals. With renewed determination, Saeng is certain that she will do better next time. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope and resilience for her, motivating her to keep pushing forward and never give up on her dreams.
1162	10027	4	3	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. Itís just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring. Thatís the same as Saeng failing that test that year she can go back next time and take it again.
1163	10028	4	3	"When winter is gone, I'll be ready for that winter test again. They weren't prepared for the winter to come as they were planting. ""As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel."" That's why I believe they were caught off guard by winter's arrival."
1164	10029	4	3	The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away. This conclusion allows readers to empathize with Saeng's longing for familiarity and the struggles she faces in adjusting to a new and unfamiliar environment. It highlights the emotional toll that displacement and separation from one's roots can have on an individual, eliciting a sense of compassion and connection with Saeng's experiences. Through this poignant ending, the author effectively conveys the challenges and heartache that come with being uprooted from one's home and the profound impact it can have on a person's sense of identity and belonging.
1165	10030	4	3	He concludes the story because he was another chance to enact the test. As he reflected on his past actions and the consequences they brought, he realized that he needed to make amends and prove that he had learned from his mistakes. This second opportunity was a gift, a way for him to show that he was capable of change and growth. With determination in his heart, he embraced the challenge ahead, ready to demonstrate his newfound understanding and commitment to doing better. And as he set out on this new path, he was grateful for the chance to rewrite his story and create a brighter future for himself and those around him.
1166	10031	4	3	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a paragraph that emphasizes new life and new chances for the main character. The future setting in spring symbolizes rebirth and another start from the cold, hard winter. The author's structured choice of words conveys the theme of rebirth through phrases like ""the geese return"" and ""take the test again."" The budding hibiscus in spring further symbolizes this theme of rebirth, as in winter, the plant is dormant and less colorful, but in spring, it shows new life through vibrant buds. The author effectively conveys the theme of rebirth through these details, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and new beginnings for the main character."
1167	10032	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, it tells of a girl who just moved to a new country and is having a hard time adapting to the new land and its people. But I think the author put that quote at the end to lead you to believe to never give up, there is a new beginning and you will make it. I believe this because Saeng thinks to herself, ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her."" This shows that she has finally found comfort and is confident, like the geese going to adapt in a new area, and then will come back, and that the winter hibiscus never gives up and will keep living in the new weather conditions every season."
1168	10033	4	3	She concludes by stating that she will revisit the material once winter is over and will have the opportunity to retake the test in the spring. This shows her determination to improve and succeed in her academic endeavors.
1169	10034	4	3	The hibiscus plant that Saeng bought after failing her test reminded her of her old life and provided her with comfort in her new surroundings. The blooming flowers in the garden, the return of geese, and the melting snow in the spring all triggered memories of her past. With these familiar reminders, Saeng felt that she could adapt better to her new environment while holding onto the comfort of her memories.
1170	10035	4	3	"The author chose this paragraph because it fit right like a good conclusion showed for example the word again it means that you did something already and it's over but you miss so you retry what you miss, but in the paragraph it's talking about the nature and how they want to test it!(""again"")!. The researchers were eager to delve deeper into the mysteries of nature, to explore its wonders and unravel its secrets. Their insatiable curiosity drove them to conduct experiments and tests, pushing the boundaries of what was known and understood. As they embarked on this journey of discovery, they approached each new challenge with determination and enthusiasm, ready to face whatever obstacles lay ahead. Their quest to understand the natural world was not just a scientific endeavor, but a deeply personal one, driven by a sense of wonder and awe at the beauty and complexity of the world around them. And so, they ventured forth once again, eager to explore the unknown and unlock the mysteries of nature."
1171	10036	4	3	Saeng took a deep breath, feeling a mix of nerves and determination as he walked out of the testing center. Despite failing the test once again, he was not discouraged. In fact, he was more motivated than ever to study harder and prepare himself for the next opportunity to retake the test. As he looked up at the sky, he made a silent promise to himself that he would not stop until he passed with flying colors. The journey ahead was going to be tough, but Saeng was ready to face the challenge head-on. And with that thought in mind, he set off towards his next adventure, knowing that success was just around the corner.
1172	10037	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young girl from Vietnam moves to a new location and fails the driver's test. Feeling homesick, she decides to purchase a winter hibiscus plant to remind her of her homeland. As she waits for the snow to melt and the geese to return in the spring, she plans to take the driver's test again. The symbolism of the hibiscus blooming represents her readiness to try once more. She believes that just like the geese returning home and the hibiscus blossoming, she too will be prepared to face the challenge again. This connection to nature gives her hope and strength to persevere, reflecting her deep emotional ties to her roots and determination to succeed."
1173	10038	4	3	"She is talking about the flowers and when she says ""test"" I think she means how she looks and examines the flowers and sees the snow fall all over again. It sounds like the author is someone who admires flowers a lot, or maybe just this one hibiscus and how it buds. Maybe she is just someone who likes to see changes. The author seems to find joy in observing the beauty of nature and the cyclical patterns of growth and change in the flowers, particularly the hibiscus. The imagery of snow falling all over again suggests a sense of renewal and the author's appreciation for the fleeting moments of beauty in the natural world."
1174	10039	4	3	I believe the author adds this passage to the story to represent determination and resilience. While Saeng is not originally from America, she is determined and willing to adapt to her new surroundings. While the winter was cold and harsh in many ways for her, the spring will bring forgiveness and relief from her struggles. She will try to pass the driving test again to further integrate herself into American society, while the blooming of the Hibiscus will bring her closer to her sense of home.
1175	10040	4	3	"The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a good note. Also, the author wraps things familiar with Saeng, and things native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and missed her home greatly. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But once she gets home, and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're ""almost familiar"". The paragraph that ends the selection does a good job of tying her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese & the snow) and the drama of the story (failing the test) into one."
1176	10041	4	3	She watched her mother with admiration as they carefully planted the new addition to their garden. The vibrant green leaves and colorful petals of the plant brought a sense of joy and tranquility to their home. The daughter made a mental note to learn more about gardening and promised herself to grow a plant as beautiful as the one her mother was tending. With determination and enthusiasm, she looked forward to the next year when she could showcase her own gardening skills and create a masterpiece just like her mother's. The bond between mother and daughter grew stronger as they nurtured their plants together, creating memories that would last a lifetime.
1177	10042	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph to highlight the growth and independence of Saeng, now that she no longer lives with her mother. This signifies a significant change in Saeng's life and emphasizes the idea that her past experiences will always be a part of her memories.
1178	10043	4	3	"The author uses that passage to end the story to show that Saeng will try to adopt. When Saeng smells the Hibiscus, ""The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel. The light sounds of her grandmotherís long gray hair"" This indicates that Saeng was looking for things that were familiar to her and reminded her of her homeland. The fact that Saeng paid over nineteen dollars for a plant also shows how much she missed her homeland. ""d-d failed the test that Saeng paid."" shows that she attempted to adapt to her new home but failed. This makes her sad and causes her to miss the way things used to be. At the end of the story she said that ""I will late the test again."" seeing the familiar hibiscus and geese leave but knowing that they will return gives Saeng hope. The last line of the story indicates that she will always remember her homeland."
1179	10044	4	3	Saeng wiped the sweat off his brow, feeling the weight of exhaustion in his muscles. The task ahead seemed daunting, but he clenched his fists in determination. Giving up was not an option for him. With a steely glint in his eyes, he took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. Saeng knew that the road ahead would be tough, but he was ready to face whatever challenges came his way. He was fueled by a burning desire to succeed, and nothing was going to stand in his way. With unwavering resolve, he took the first step towards his goal, ready to conquer whatever obstacles lay ahead.
1180	10045	4	3	With the hibiscus around Saeng, she will have more courage and also have had more time to adapt in their new home. For Saeng, the hibiscus is like motivation and it also reminds her of her old homeland. The reason I think the author chose to end the story with the particular comment is to show that Saeng had in the end found courage and is ready to accept her tasks in this foreign land. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of strength and resilience for Saeng, helping her navigate the challenges of her new environment while holding onto her past. It represents a sense of familiarity and comfort amidst the unfamiliarity of her surroundings, giving her the confidence to face whatever may come her way. Saeng's journey is one of growth and transformation, and the hibiscus is a constant reminder of her ability to overcome obstacles and thrive in her new home.
1181	10046	4	3	The story concludes by emphasizing the importance of embracing change in life, just like the changes in weather and seasons. It suggests that facing challenges and adapting to new situations can be a way to understand oneself better. Just like the weather changes constantly, we must also learn to navigate the ups and downs in our lives. By accepting and overcoming these changes, we can grow and evolve as individuals.
1182	10047	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This decision shows Saeng's determination and resilience to not give up on her goal of passing the driver's test. It leaves the reader with a sense of hope and anticipation for Saeng's future endeavors. The imagery of spring symbolizes a new beginning and the possibility of achieving success after facing setbacks. Saeng's unwavering resolve to try again highlights her growth and perseverance, making the reader root for her as she embarks on her journey towards obtaining her driver's license.
1183	10048	4	3	"I believe that the author concludes the story with ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", was a great way to end it because I think that she sees how much the hibiscus can take then she can take just about anything mainly the test. Also when her mother said ""You what?"" ""Her mother stared at her incredulously"". She might have also understood that if her mum could get over being mad then she would overcome being upset about the test."
1184	10049	4	3	In conclusion, the changing seasons signal the inevitable cycle of life and death for the flowers. As they wither away, it is not the end, but merely a temporary pause. Just like how the flowers will bloom again when the season changes, we too have the opportunity to start anew, to take the test again and strive to fit in once more. Embracing change and facing challenges head-on is essential for growth and resilience, just as the flowers will bloom again after the harsh winter passes. So, let us remember that every ending is a new beginning, and every challenge is an opportunity for growth.
1185	10050	4	3	The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is taken over by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in @LOCATION1. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says ìwhen this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again.î The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on. The hibiscus flower serves as a reminder of the beauty and resilience of their homeland, encouraging Saeng to persevere and thrive in their new environment.
1186	10051	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first time, there is always a second chance, just like the way life returns in the spring after appearing to die in the winter. This message of hope and renewal serves as a reminder that setbacks are not permanent, and with perseverance, one can overcome obstacles and find success. Just as the cycle of nature continues, so too can individuals bounce back from adversity and thrive once again.
1187	10052	4	3	When the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author is said that because the girl Saeng failed the test but still found something that reminded her of her home. She was happy, but the plant was not exactly like the one from home. But she got used to it. The flower may not be the same but it's an exotic flower and she is getting used to being in a new place. When she goes back to take the test she will be ready and so will her plant. Her plant will be full of life. And she will feel more confident and at home in her new surroundings.
1188	10053	4	3	I think the author ends the story like this because of Saeng's respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a symbol of her home but also as a symbol of good luck. In the text, she holds the plant in a very high value, having paid 100 coins for it. So, I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing.
1189	10054	4	3	The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story because it connects Saeng to the geese and plant with symbolism. For Saeng, the snow represents her troubles adjusting to her new homeland, while the geese show her that she is gradually adapting to her surroundings as they seem familiar to her. The hibiscus she first encountered was delicate and pretty, much like her initial state in the new land. However, the new hibiscus, which symbolizes her current self since coming to the new location, is hardier and able to withstand the snow, reflecting her growth in resilience and ability to overcome challenges. The budding of the hibiscus signifies her becoming stronger and more capable of facing her obstacles, as she now feels ready to retake the test with newfound strength and determination. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to draw a parallel between the budding hibiscus and Saeng's personal growth, symbolizing her journey towards overcoming adversity and embracing her new life in the unfamiliar environment.
1190	10055	4	3	The author chose to conclude the story like that because she‚Äôs saying that it isn‚Äôt over and she‚Äôs going to take the test again. In the story Saeng says ‚ÄúI- I failed the test‚Äù so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.
1191	10056	4	3	I think what the author is trying to say is that she will take her driving test again in the spring when the flowers are out because it will make her feel more relaxed. The flowers put the author in a relaxed state of mind where she can focus. The fresh blooms and vibrant colors of spring create a serene and calming atmosphere, which can help ease any nerves or anxiety associated with taking a driving test. The beauty of nature can have a soothing effect on individuals, allowing them to feel more at ease and confident in their abilities. By choosing to take her test in the spring, the author is setting herself up for success by putting herself in a positive and relaxed frame of mind. Ultimately, this decision may lead to a more successful outcome on her driving test.
1192	10057	4	3	Because she is hopeful that when her eyebrows grow back, she will have another chance to take the test. She seems determined to improve her performance and not let the setback discourage her. With a positive mindset and a willingness to try again, she is poised to tackle the test with renewed confidence. It's evident that she is resilient and ready to face challenges head-on, showing a strong sense of perseverance. This attitude will likely serve her well in not only retaking the test but also in overcoming obstacles in the future.
1193	10058	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with the protagonist declaring, ""When they come back, then I will take the test again."" This statement signifies the end of the season for plant growth, but also hints at the protagonist's unwavering dedication to caring for her beloved plants. Despite the current snowfall, she remains committed to returning to tend to the flowers when the time is right. This conclusion leaves readers intrigued and eager to discover whether she will fulfill her promise and continue nurturing her cherished plants in the future."
1194	10059	4	3	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus"", the author uses the last paragraph to indicate that while memories of her old country will always remain with her, she will eventually adapt to her new surroundings. The mention of when the snow melts and the geese return suggests that she will still visit her old country from time to time. The final sentence, ""then I will take the test again"", implies that she will continue to embrace both her past and her present, finding a balance between the two worlds."
1195	10060	4	3	Saeng was determined to retake the test, despite all the setbacks she had faced. She clutched the hibiscus flower in her hand, a symbol of good luck and perseverance. As the snow began to melt and the geese returned, she knew it was time to try again. With a sense of renewed determination, Saeng set her sights on passing the test this time. The hibiscus would be her constant companion, a reminder to never give up on her dreams. In the end, Saeng's personal thoughts and feelings about the test reflected her unwavering resolve to succeed.
1196	10061	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, there I will take that test again. She knew that with dedication and hard work, she could overcome any obstacle that came her way. The thought of trying again filled her with determination and a sense of purpose. As she gazed out at the peaceful landscape, she felt a renewed sense of hope and confidence in her abilities. Saeng was ready to face the challenge head-on and prove to herself that she was capable of achieving her goals. With a smile on her face, she looked forward to the opportunity to show what she was truly made of when the time came.
1197	10062	4	3	I guess she felt that it was a good way to unite us all. Perhaps she saw it as a way to bring people together, to create a sense of community and solidarity. By organizing this event, she was able to bridge the gap between different groups and foster a sense of belonging. In a world that can often feel divided and fragmented, her initiative was a refreshing reminder of the power of coming together. Through this shared experience, we were able to connect on a deeper level and appreciate the diversity of perspectives and backgrounds that make us unique. In the end, her decision to unite us all proved to be a success, leaving a lasting impact on those who participated.
1198	10063	4	3	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng concludes by expressing her determination to retake the driver's test in the spring, symbolizing her readiness to face the challenges of her new life. When she purchased the hibiscus, she believed that as the winter faded and spring bloomed, she would find it easier to confront her fears and uncertainties in a foreign land. Saeng draws strength from the memories of her homeland, confident that they will guide her towards success in her new surroundings. As the story ends, it becomes evident that Saeng has developed resilience and optimism, setting her sights on a future filled with promise and achievement."
1199	10064	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the determination of the hibiscus plant. Despite facing challenges in the spring due to being a winter hibiscus, it remains resilient. The upcoming season will test its ability to survive, but the hibiscus's perseverance shines through. The plant's determination to thrive in adverse conditions serves as a powerful reminder of resilience and strength in the face of adversity.
1200	10065	4	3	I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was appreciating her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, ìitís strong enough to make it through the cold months hereî @CAPS1 itís telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng realized that things had a repetition season upon season she must had realized that she can do it too, and face the driving test again.
1201	10066	4	3	The author includes this last paragraph in the story, “Winter Hibiscus” to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to @LOCATION2 and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng’s mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not disappointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in @LOCATION2 that she is not used to. “When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam.
1202	10067	4	3	When the snow melts and the geese return in the spring, Saeng silently vowed to herself that she would take the test again. The hibiscus plant she purchased symbolized comfort in times of disappointment and a connection to her past experiences. As the hibiscus began to blossom, Saeng felt more confident and at ease in her surroundings. This is why she decided to retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus was in full bloom, as she believed she would feel more comfortable and prepared. The author MiNfoNg Ho concluded the story with this sentiment, emphasizing Saeng's growth and adaptation to new challenges.
1203	10068	4	3	"The past experiences of our lives often influence things in our life, whether we consciously know it or not. In this story, Saeng tries to go to the flower shop and pass the test of not buying the certain flower that reminds her of her home, but she fails. She is trying to get over the fact that she is not ""at home,"" that things and people that used to be around are no longer there. But there are new things that she is becoming used to. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did, to show that you can always change. She is trying to put things that make her feel more at home further back in her mind, and with time, she can do that maybe even by next year. It is always possible to do something if you really want to do it, and the author is showing that Saeng really wants to pass her own mind test so she can further adapt to change. Her mother will be proud of her as she continues to grow and evolve."
1204	10069	4	3	I think that she was that way to say, hey I didnít over come something and Iíll be back next year to take the test again like the hibiscus budding when she snow melts and the geese return next year. She seemed determined to not give up, much like nature's cycle of renewal and growth. Just as the hibiscus blooms again after the snow melts and the geese return year after year, she is ready to come back stronger and try again. This resilience and persistence show her commitment to success and overcoming challenges. Like the changing seasons, she is prepared to face whatever obstacles come her way and continue striving towards her goals.
1205	10070	4	3	Saeng took a deep breath and squared his shoulders, determination shining in his eyes. He knew that he had to prepare better this time, to study harder and focus more intently. This setback was not going to deter him; it was only going to make him stronger. With renewed resolve, Saeng vowed to retake the test and prove to himself and everyone else that he was capable of succeeding. And as he walked out of the testing center, he knew that this was just the beginning of his journey towards achieving his goals.
1206	10071	4	3	"When Saeng said that she will go and take the test over next year, she means she will try to plant the plants all over again. Saeng's willingness to help with the plants is evident when she says, ""Here, let me help, mother."" This shows that Saeng does want to assist with the gardening task."
1207	10072	4	3	"Seang's hope for the future shines through in the last paragraph of the short story, ""Winter Hibiscus."" Despite feeling out of place and disheartened by not receiving her driver's license, she finds solace in the promise of spring. The winter and cold symbolize her current struggles, but the upcoming season represents renewal and warmth. With a piece of her homeland blooming in her new surroundings, Seang feels ready to face her challenges, including retaking her driver's test. This final paragraph highlights her strength and resilience in adapting to her new life and moving forward from her past hardships. Ultimately, Seang emerges as a character who is capable of overcoming obstacles and embracing the future with hope and determination."
1208	10073	4	3	The geese returning and the hibiscus budding in the month of May gave her a sense of reassurance and hope. Their presence reminded her of the cyclical nature of life and the promise of new beginnings. As she prepared for the upcoming test, the sight of these familiar signs of renewal boosted her confidence. With a newfound sense of determination, she took a deep breath and stepped forward, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. The natural world had a way of instilling a sense of resilience within her, and she knew that she could overcome any obstacles that came her way. The geese and hibiscus had become her silent cheerleaders, encouraging her to believe in herself and her abilities. And as she embarked on this new journey, she carried their spirit of strength and perseverance within her, guiding her towards success.
1209	10074	4	3	When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She realizes she has another chance to pass the test when the spring blossoms again. Saeng begins to garden when the spring returns, nurturing the hibiscus plant with care and dedication, knowing that it symbolizes her determination and resilience. As the days grow longer and the flowers start to bloom, she feels a renewed sense of hope and confidence. With each passing day, Saeng tends to the hibiscus, pouring her heart and soul into its growth. And when the time comes to take the test again, she is ready, knowing that just like the hibiscus, she too has the strength to blossom and flourish, no matter the challenges that come her way.
1210	10075	4	3	"Saeng finds comfort in memories of her homeland. When she took that test, everything was unfamiliar to her, so she failed, but on her way back something familiar found her. Native plants of her home. ìThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single bloodred blossom, "" "" "" ìfloating in the bucket.î Saeng needs familiar things to comfort herself. So when she sees the geese, and this symbolizes change. ìLike the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched.î Spring is a time for new beginnings, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.î When the familiar object is at it's best, she will be her best and be able to face anything. Winter is the ìgetting-readyî stage. The geese flying in their V formation signify the change that is coming, just like the blooming hibiscus heralds the arrival of spring. Saeng finds solace in these familiar signs of her homeland, knowing that they will guide her through whatever challenges lie ahead."
1211	10076	4	3	When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melted and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again. As she watched the snow slowly melt away and listened to the honking of geese flying overhead, Saeng felt a renewed sense of determination. She knew that when the hibiscus finally bloomed, it would be a symbol of her perseverance and growth. And when that day arrived, she would be ready to face the test once more, armed with a newfound sense of confidence and resilience. The winter may have been harsh, but Saeng was determined to let the beauty of spring bloom in her life once again.
1212	10077	4	3	Iíll think the author tried two say wean it coming two snow melt like @MONTH1 they she will be come back. Author will because in the spring sometime to written a new book. It's like a cycle, just as the snow melts and gives way to the vibrant life of spring, the author will return with a new book filled with fresh ideas and stories. Just like nature, creativity also has its seasons, and we can eagerly anticipate the blossoming of new literary works in the coming spring.
1213	10078	4	3	The author of Winter Hibiscus uses this paragraph to conclude her story because it is a symbol of Saeng's future. Winter Hibiscus is a symbol of Saeng for many reasons. For one, both Saeng and the plant are from Vietnam and both struggle to survive and thrive in the new world of the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng promises herself that when the plant thrives in the spring, so shall she by retaking her driver's test. This symbol of future is extremely important to the story live and this is why Ming Fon Ho, the author of Winter Hibiscus, chose to end with this vital symbol.
1214	10079	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author most likely chose this as the last paragraph to help the reader understand the message. The message of this story is no matter what happens or what challenges you face, never give up and always keep trying. The author makes that the last paragraph to make the reader think and ponder upon what it means."
1215	10080	4	3	"The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one reason. That reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought it home. For example, she said ""I failed,"" talking about the plant. She also compares where she is now to where she used to live. For example, she said ""it's not like the one at home."" That's why the author concludes this paragraph. Saeng's disappointment with the fake plant symbolizes her feelings of inadequacy and longing for the familiarity of her previous home. It highlights her struggle to adapt to her new environment and the challenges she faces in feeling truly at ease in her new surroundings."
1216	10081	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Saeng loves being in the garden, but when it snows, she is not allowed to be outside. Her passion for plants and similar things drives her to conclude the paragraph with the thought of purchasing plants and flowers in the spring. As Saeng encounters a familiar plant, she rushes to a florist shop to see if it can be purchased. However, she becomes highly upset when something goes wrong with them. In the end, Saeng's determination to retake the test in the spring reflects her love for nature and the joy she finds in nurturing plants, even in the face of setbacks.
1217	10082	4	3	"In the text, when the mother said ""It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters."" This sentence shows that Saeng is just like the flowers. They're strong to live through the winter, that shows they are very pretty and strong in the spring. This emphasizes that Saeng will be strong and more confident in the spring. That's why the author put it in at the end. It's also reflected to the flower, how they're pretty and strong in spring. Saeng's resilience and strength, like the winter hibiscus, will bloom beautifully in due time."
1218	10083	4	3	"In the short story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, the author includes a paragraph at the end, stating that the main character, Saeng, will take her driving test again. Ho includes this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is new to the United States, her and her mother had moved here from Vietnam. Throughout the story she is reminiscing about her home life in Vietnam. About her grandmother, and the flowers there. ""Where was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?"" When at the flower shop, Saeng finds a hibiscus flower they also had in Vietnam. She sees how it has adapted to survive in the winter here. As she is planting the flower in her backyard, she makes a promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She too, wants to become adapted to the location and be able to live here without missing home too much. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to show Saeng too, wants to adapt to her surrounding and pass the driving test."
1219	10084	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the true meaning of the hibiscus. The hibiscus is symbolic to Saeng in several ways, but the most important is that it represents change and growth and the ability to overcome obstacles. Upon seeing it, she is overcome with childhood memories and sentimentality. However, she must adjust to her new home if she wants to grow as a person. She will survive here, just as the hibiscus will survive through the winter. Also, Saeng vows that ìin the springî when ìthis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î She is determined to succeed, and the hibiscus itself represents triumph over obstacles. It stands for survival and endurance through lifeís disappointments and challenges, from failing a driverís test to starting a new life in a strange and foreign country. The authorís choice to end the story with this paragraph exhibits Saengís ultimate understanding of her strength through the symbol of the hibiscus.
1220	10085	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didnít pass the test she was going to try again. An example of this is an exact quote ìin the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test againî. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that.
1221	10086	4	3	The author includes the story with this paragraph because since Saeng failed her drivers test for the first time when the hibiscus starts to bud it will represent a change in her life. Also, Saeng use to have hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam so when the flower buds it could show that she has a new home. The blooming of the hibiscus could symbolize a fresh start for Saeng, a new beginning in her current location. It serves as a reminder of her past while also signifying growth and adaptation to her new surroundings. The hibiscus, with its vibrant colors and delicate petals, mirrors Saeng's resilience and ability to flourish even after setbacks. As the flower blossoms, it reflects Saeng's own journey of overcoming challenges and embracing the opportunities that come her way. In this way, the hibiscus becomes more than just a plant in her garden; it becomes a symbol of hope, perseverance, and the beauty that can emerge from change.
1222	10087	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus buds, then I will take that test again. The hibiscus budding will remind her of home, bringing her comfort and a sense of peace. Feeling at home is essential for Saeng to perform well on the test. As the hibiscus blooms, it will serve as a symbol of familiarity and belonging, allowing Saeng to approach the test with a clear mind and a confident heart.
1223	10088	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one. She shows she isnít giving up when she brings home the flower to plant. That also shows she will not forget her old home. Also when she says, ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.î That shows she is giving her new home another shot and isnít giving up. Another example is when it says, ìAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.î Here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance. She is not giving up on it.
1224	10089	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is looking forward to continuing the special tradition of gardening with her mom next year. Spending time together, nurturing plants, and enjoying each other's company are all reasons why she is excited to do it all over again. The bond between mother and daughter grows stronger with each gardening season, creating cherished memories that will last a lifetime. With a heart full of joy and anticipation, the author eagerly awaits the next opportunity to sow seeds of love and laughter alongside her beloved mom.
1225	10090	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. Saeng failed her driving test and was new to the town, feeling frustrated and homesick for Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother, bringing back memories of combing her grandmother's long grey hair. As Saeng closed her eyes and breathed in the fragrance of the hibiscus, she found solace in its beauty. Despite missing her grandmother, the flower brought her a sense of peace. The word ""dokor malik,"" meaning hibiscus, rolled off her tongue, further connecting her to her roots. The hibiscus symbolized joy and comfort for Saeng, giving her hope as she looked forward to retaking her driving test in the spring when the hibiscus would be blooming again. The reader is left with a sense of warmth and comfort, mirroring Saeng's feelings."
1226	10091	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it relates the idea of the hibiscus to Saeng and her situation in a new country. It shows that Saeng is using the hibiscus and its ability to adapt for inspiration. During the story, Saeng describes how she had always seen the hibiscus at home in her old country. Her mom describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home. But she says itís because itís strong and was able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the United States. This is what Saeng was able to use as inspiration. She might have failed her license test, but she used the hibiscus actions to set a goal for herself. The plant will go through a cold, and snowy winter but it will grow and blossom in the spring. Saeng would use that time to study and get ready, and sheíll be confident for the test. The paragraph that the author finishes on shows the connection Saeng made with her situation and the plantís situation. Saeng will keep pushing forward, just like the hibiscus, and eventually, she will achieve her goals.
1227	10092	4	3	"""If at first you donít succeed, try, try again."" This quote is often used to motivate individuals to keep trying despite initial setbacks. In the short story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng experiences a setback when she fails her driver's test. Feeling disheartened, she finds solace in a hibiscus flower that reminds her of her homeland. Bringing the plant home, she faces initial disapproval from her mother but is later appreciated for her gesture. As she plants the hibiscus, the honking of Canada geese, a familiar sound to her now, reminds her of the changes she has undergone since coming to @LOCATION1. The quiet repetition of seasons has made many once-strange things familiar to her. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of resilience and adaptation, inspiring Saeng to persevere and try again for her driver's license, just as the plant pushes through the challenges of winter. Like the hibiscus, Saeng will continue to adapt and thrive in her new surroundings, embracing the changes and growth that come with perseverance."
1228	10093	4	3	"The author ends the story this way because Saeng feels a sense of comfort with the hibiscus flower. The flower reminds her of her homeland with her grandmother. According to the story, ""the familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair."" She seems to be very close with nature and all of its desirable traits. When she failed the test she bought her ""Malik"" flower, as a sense of comfort. They both decided to plant it in their garden and while doing so, Saeng received a huge boost of confidence to retake the test."
1229	10094	4	3	"She compares the paragraph to the story to draw parallels with school. In this scenario, the test symbolizes making new friends and excelling academically in various classes. The line ""Then I will take that test again"" reflects the determination to improve and succeed in the school environment. Just like in the story, students face challenges and setbacks but must persevere and strive for better outcomes. School, like the test in the paragraph, offers opportunities for growth and learning, shaping individuals for future success."
1230	10095	4	3	Saeng's determination to overcome her past experiences was evident as she faced the challenges before her. Despite the wave of emotions that threatened to overwhelm her, she found the strength to continue moving forward. With the support of her mother, Saeng made a vow to retake the test, showing her resilience and perseverance. By confronting her fears and seeking help when needed, Saeng demonstrated her unwavering resolve to overcome any obstacles in her path. The plant she brought home symbolized her commitment to growth and renewal, as she embraced the opportunity to create a brighter future for herself. Through her actions, Saeng proved that with determination and support, she could overcome the struggles of her past and pave the way for a better tomorrow.
1231	10096	4	3	Because her school work was the whole reason as to why she was studying flowers in a green garden, she failed the test. When spring starts to show, she will retake the test because the flowers will bloom, allowing her to study more to pass the test and avoid having to take it again. She seems to be looking forward to the return of spring, not only for academic reasons but also to enjoy the beauty of the flowers and the experience of learning and growing.
1232	10097	4	3	"I think that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because she wanted us to see that Saeng was not giving up. Saeng was originally from Vietnam but she moved to the United States. She missed being home so much because nothing was the same. ""It's not a real one,"" Saeng mumbled. ""I mean, not like the kind we had at-at'. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. But once Saeng finally realized that she was beginning to adapt to the life in the United States, she decided that she was going to give the drive's test one more try. ""When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""
1233	10098	4	3	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she seems to led comfortable when she saw the geese and plants the hibiscus in the winter and keeps it from dying. In the story it said,""... their faint banks clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now"". I think this is explaining how she feels after seeing the geese fly over head because she uses to see that in Vietnam. Also, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddingî, she gains more confidence because she leds like sheís back in Vietnam. All in all, that's why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."
1234	10099	4	3	I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to allow the reader to imagine what happens next once spring rolls around for Saeng. This allows the reader to use their imagination to connect to the story. Another reason why the author chose to conclude the story like that with that paragraph was to give hope to the reader that maybe she will pass the test next time. It was also a way to end the story on a good note.
1235	10100	4	3	The author ended the story with that particular paragraph because like the geese, she will be back to try again. Just in case she didn't get to finish just about everything she wanted to do. The author wanted the reader to know the determination and ambition of the character in the story. Also, to show the readers that the character's characteristics couldn't be beat by one winter and that she is going to keep going at it until she does what she has to do. Just like the geese who return year after year, she will persist and strive towards her goals with unwavering determination.
1236	10101	4	3	"The author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone. In the story, glimpses of Saeng's home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is experiencing. Saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother, which saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up Saeng's despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, ""then I will take that test again,"" you can feel her hope. The author wants to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world, and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng mentions, ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" showing how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope, and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security."
1237	10102	4	3	The author concludes the story of the paragraph because, the author would like to finish the last sentence of the story. Also at the last of the paragraph is when she is visualizing and putting her effort to the hibiscus. Therefore, her thoughts are appreciated to the plant. The author wanted more evidence to the story. For example, when it said, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese ruturn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It includes the winter time for the plant. Also, the @DATE2 and spring the plant comes back, which the character saeng will get it back, and visit it. In the end, the hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope and renewal, marking the passage of time and the cyclical nature of life.
1238	10103	4	3	The author may have initially expressed some reservations, but deep down, he had a genuine love for flowers and enjoyed working in the serene environment with the people. His mother, who may have appeared strict, actually supported his passion for gardening. He found solace in tending to the flowers and witnessing the beauty of life flourishing in that place. Ultimately, the author's connection with nature and the positive impact of his work brought him back to the place he truly cherished.
1239	10104	4	3	"The author includes this at the end to show how much she cares about the plant and that it brings back memories of her childhood. An example of her love for the plant is the rich scent it emits. ""It felt smooth and cool,"" further illustrating her connection to the plant. The plant serves as a reminder of her childhood, bringing back memories she had forgotten but now realizes she had known all along. This reconnection to her past is a significant reason for the author's fondness for the plant."
1240	10105	4	3	With her plant as a symbol of new beginnings, the girl vowed to herself to not give up in her new environment and to keep moving forward. Just like her plant, she too would start over and embrace the opportunities and experiences that awaited her. This simple vow carried a powerful message of resilience and determination, showing that even in unfamiliar surroundings, one can find strength and growth. By opening herself up to new possibilities, the girl embarked on a journey of self-discovery and transformation, ready to bloom in her new life.
1241	10106	4	3	I think the author wrote that because maybe that's how she feels in the winter - like she can really show people who she is. But when spring comes, she's like a flower that has been dead all winter. The transformation from winter to spring symbolizes a rebirth or renewal of her true self. In the cold and dark winter months, she may feel hidden or suppressed, but with the arrival of spring, she can blossom and reveal her inner beauty to the world. Just like a flower that blooms after a long winter, she too can emerge from her metaphorical hibernation and shine brightly for all to see.
1242	10107	4	3	With a smile on their faces, they continued their walk through the garden, admiring the beauty of the winter hibiscus and the graceful geese. The crisp air filled their lungs as they took in the peaceful surroundings. As they strolled along the winding path, they felt a sense of tranquility and contentment wash over them. It was moments like these that reminded them of the simple joys in life and the beauty of nature all around them. And as they headed back home, they carried with them a renewed appreciation for the little things that brought them so much happiness.
1243	10108	4	3	"In the story ""The Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, Saeng faces obstacles as she adjusts to a new country. After failing her driving test, she is reminded of her homeland by tropical flowers. At the end of the story, Saeng silently vows to herself that she will try the test again in the spring when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus blooms. This moment symbolizes Saeng's growth and determination to adapt to her new environment, mirroring the changing seasons and the resilience of nature. It shows her commitment to not giving up and her willingness to embrace change, just like the geese returning to a transformed landscape and the hibiscus blossoming into a beautiful flower. Saeng's resolution reflects her optimism and hope for the future as she navigates the challenges of her new life."
1244	10109	4	3	The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reasons. I think the author wanted to give an interesting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows. For example, the author explained how hibiscus grow and the things that are needed for them to thrive, such as sunlight, water, soil, and nutrient recycling. Perhaps the author wanted to highlight the cycle of growth and renewal that occurs when the snow melts and the hibiscus begin to bloom again. In this way, the author ties together the themes of growth and change, emphasizing the resilience and beauty of nature. So, when the snow falls and covers the ground, it serves as a temporary pause in the hibiscus's growth, but also a necessary step in the cycle of renewal and rebirth.
1245	10110	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. Saeng felt a sense of determination fill her as she thought about the opportunity to try once more. She knew that with hard work and perseverance, she would be able to succeed in the test that had challenged her before. As the seasons changed and nature began to bloom again, Saeng prepared herself for the task ahead, ready to face it with a renewed sense of purpose and a belief in her ability to overcome any obstacles that came her way.
1246	10111	4	3	The reason she said she will wait until spring to take the test again is to see if she's still like the bitter melon over the Big Mac. This decision indicates a desire to reassess her preferences over time and potentially make a more informed choice in the future. By waiting until spring, she gives herself the opportunity to see if her taste has changed or if she still holds the same preferences. This delay in retaking the test reflects a thoughtful approach to decision-making and a willingness to wait for more clarity before making a final decision. Ultimately, her choice to wait until spring demonstrates a patient and strategic mindset in evaluating her options.
1247	10112	4	3	The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph because this saying to take the test again. What she means by this is that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to adapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her best because everything in the world is by living to your fullest. So, it's a good conclusion for the story.
1248	10113	4	3	I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that is to leave readers with a sense of wonder and possibility. By ending the story in an open-ended way, the author allows for the imagination to take over and for readers to consider what might happen next. This type of ending can be exciting and engaging, as it leaves room for interpretation and speculation. It also suggests that the characters and their story are not static, but continue to evolve beyond the pages of the book. In this way, the conclusion of the story serves as a reminder that life is full of surprises and that there are always new adventures waiting to unfold.
1249	10114	4	3	The author finds comfort and relaxation in the arrival of spring, as the melting snow and blooming flowers at home remind her of blessings. Springtime brings a sense of peace and beauty with the colorful array of flowers in full bloom, evoking a feeling of home and tranquility. It is a time of renewal and rejuvenation, where nature's beauty mirrors the comforts of home. As the flowers bloom and the snow melts, the author feels a sense of serenity and connection to her surroundings, making spring a special and cherished time of year.
1250	10115	4	3	Saeng's determination to wait for the right time to retake her driving test shows her patience and commitment to achieving her goal of getting her license. By choosing to wait until the spring when the snow melts and nature is in bloom, she is setting herself up for success. Once she passes the test and obtains her license, she will have the freedom to drive herself wherever she pleases, no longer relying on others for transportation. With her eyes set on the coming season, Saeng is ready to take the necessary steps towards gaining her independence on the road.
1251	10116	4	3	Saeng has a deep connection with her plants, finding joy in caring for them and watching them thrive. As she eagerly anticipates the end of winter, she looks forward to the new growth and blossoms that will soon adorn her beloved plants. Her enthusiasm for the changing seasons reflects her passion for nature and her nurturing spirit towards her green companions. Winter may be lingering, but Saeng's excitement for the future blooms with the promise of spring.
1252	10117	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it ties it all together. I think that the author uses it also to say that in the spring she will pass the test. I really like the part when she says ""in the spring, when the snows melt."" I like that because it explains what she wants and how she puts her mind to it. This shows her determination and optimism for the future, hinting at a positive outcome once the difficult circumstances have passed."
1253	10118	4	3	"The author uses this paragraph to set a goal for the cycle to start over. Geese are symbolized as the arrival of spring, signaling the beginning of preparing for the upcoming ""test"" once again. The budding hibiscus in the paragraph represents hope and a fresh start, just like the cycle of the seasons and the memories intertwined in the story. Overall, the conclusion conveys a message of hope, the revival of fond memories, and the prospect of new beginnings."
1254	10119	4	3	The woman would grow some flowers and water the geese come back to her pond. She carefully tended to the colorful blooms, ensuring they received just the right amount of sunlight and water to flourish. As the flowers bloomed, their vibrant petals added a touch of beauty to the serene pond area.  The geese, attracted by the beauty and tranquility of the pond, returned regularly to swim and bask in the sun. The woman watched with a smile as the graceful creatures glided across the water, their presence bringing a sense of peace and joy to her heart.  With each visit from the geese, the woman felt a deep connection to nature and the world around her. The simple act of tending to her flowers and welcoming the geese back to her pond filled her days with a sense of fulfillment and contentment. In this harmonious cycle of growth and interaction, she found solace and happiness.
1255	10120	4	3	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason being that the author wanted to really show the meaning of the flower. Another reason is to express the theme. For example at the end of that paragraph it says ""then I will take that test again,"" it's relating that small topic of the driving test to the larger topic of the flower. Which then relates it to the theme of adjusting and keep trying till you adjust. That last paragraph was quite vital to the theme and meaning of the story."
1256	10121	4	3	"I believe the author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", because she is trying to show how past memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test Saeng finds the Hibiscus, the memories of her home land and her grandmother consume her. She buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden. After she is done planting, Saeng sees a flock of Canada geese fly overhead. Using her memory of her old home and her family, applied to her new surroundings, Saeng vows to re-take the test, to try again. The author ends the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up. Saeng's determination to try again and not give up, even after failing the test, shows her resilience and strength in the face of challenges. This resolution leaves the reader with a sense of hope and optimism for Saeng's future endeavors."
1257	10122	4	3	"The author concludes with this story to show how Saeng is ready to accept her new life. Once the geese and the hibiscus are back she feels like she's at home. When she feels more at home is when she will be ready to take the test again. The text states ""run and the geese return, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". Clearly the geese and hibiscus remind her of home. Once she feels at home, she will feel at ease. That's why the author concluded with this passage."
1258	10123	4	3	The author concluded with this paragraph to reiterate the main theme of the story and ensure that readers grasped the central message. This helped to tie together all the elements of the narrative and leave a lasting impression on the audience. By summarizing the key points in a concise manner, the author reinforced the significance of the story and its underlying lessons, providing a sense of closure for the readers.
1259	10124	4	3	The author explains that she has failed the test. While it is still winter and the hibiscus is still trying to grow its lovely petals back. As she tells her mother that she will not take the test again until the hibiscus starts budding and spring is back. She feels that rushing into retaking the test without proper preparation will not lead to success. Waiting for the hibiscus to bloom symbolizes patience and taking the time to fully understand the material before attempting the test again. By aligning her actions with the natural cycle of the hibiscus, she hopes to approach the test with a renewed sense of readiness and confidence when spring arrives.
1260	10125	4	3	Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding. And what she means by this ending sentence is that when the spring time comes, then she is going to take that test again. the test will determine whether or not she has learned enough about gardening from her mother over the past time.
1261	10126	4	3	The geese flew overhead, their honking filling the air as they made their journey south. It was a bittersweet sight for Sarah, as she remembered how her grandma used to love watching them fly by. She could almost hear her grandma's laughter and feel her warm presence beside her. As the geese disappeared into the distance, Sarah noticed the first signs of spring - delicate flowers blooming in the meadow. It was a beautiful reminder that life goes on, even in the face of loss. And as Sarah stood there, surrounded by nature's beauty, she found solace in the thought that her grandma's spirit was soaring with the geese, free and at peace.
1262	10127	4	3	"The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. ""Itís-itís not a real one, ëSaeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-atí she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again."" She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on.î One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmotherís long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb."" The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. ìGently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.î The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. ìAlmost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.î Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fail and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus. Saeng was on the verge of fully embracing her new life and leaving the past behind, with the winter hibiscus serving as a gentle reminder of where she came from, as she finally takes the next step forward in her journey."
1263	10128	4	3	"The story includes this paragraph because at the very beginning of the story, the girl failed the test. When she told her mother, she saw that her mother was upset with it. So after they planted the plant, she decided to take the test over, knowing that her mother would think the best of it. Also, it is in there because the story started out with her telling her mother that she failed the test. If you kept it out, people who read it would be like, ""Ok, so her mother just let her fail the test and didn’t do anything about it."" Plus, when the reader reads that the girl failed the test, they are going to be wanting to know if she took it again and why she took it again if she did. This paragraph adds depth to the story and sets up the narrative for the girl's journey to retake the test and prove herself."
1264	10129	4	3	The author chose to end the story in an unconcluded manner, leaving readers hanging and eager for more. This strategy is often used to maintain reader interest and potentially pave the way for a sequel. By not tying up all loose ends, the author keeps the door open for further development of the plot and characters in future works. This type of ending can be frustrating for some readers, but it also serves as a hook to draw them into the author's other books, where they may find the answers they seek. Ultimately, the unconcluded ending adds an element of mystery and anticipation, enticing readers to continue following the author's literary journey.
1265	10130	4	3	"Saeng fails the test because, though she buys a beautiful plant it is much too expensive. ""But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn't cost that much!"" Saeng becomes very upset and realizes that she has failed her mother. Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. ""Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter hibiscus' into it."" This shows that even though she had failed she wasn't going to give up on the hibiscus because it represented her home. It was very special to her."
1266	10131	4	3	The Author concludes the with paragraph because she wants to emphasize the importance of taking action in addressing climate change. Through her discussion of the various ways individuals, communities, and governments can contribute to mitigating the effects of climate change, she underscores the urgent need for collective efforts to protect the environment and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. By highlighting the role that each one of us can play in making a difference, she inspires readers to take responsibility and make positive changes in their own lives. Ultimately, the Author's conclusion serves as a call to action, urging everyone to join the fight against climate change and work towards a healthier planet for all.
1267	10132	4	3	"I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adapt to her new country. In the beginning of the story the character ""Saeng"" is feeling homesick and has not adapted to her new country. She is on her way home from her driver's test, which she just failed, and on the way she spots a hibiscus in a flower shop. The hibiscus is special to her because it reminds her of her home country of Vietnam. For Saeng, the hibiscus represents comfort in times of disappointment, a connection to her past experiences, and the ability to overcome obstacles. Saeng has not adjusted to this change in her life, and it has affected her badly. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obstacles in your life, but there will always be something or someone that will help you overcome them. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph and showing the reader that Saeng used the hibiscus as her way of overcoming, and when she is ready and she has adjusted, she will take her driving test again."
1268	10133	4	3	Saeng eagerly anticipated the end of winter and the arrival of spring, when the hibiscus flowers would begin to bloom once again. With the changing seasons, she saw the opportunity to start anew and try her hand at gardening once more. As she looked forward to planting her own little garden, filled with vibrant colors and new life, Saeng felt a sense of hope and renewal wash over her. The promise of the coming spring brought a sense of excitement and determination, inspiring her to begin afresh and embrace the beauty of nature that surrounded her.
1269	10134	4	3	This paragraph illustrates Saeng's determination to transform herself over the course of a year in preparation for retaking a test, akin to a rebirth. Despite her mother's critical eye, Saeng recognizes the cyclical nature of growth and change, drawing parallels between herself and the hibiscus flower that dies and is reborn each season. Through the flower's phases of death and renewal, Saeng sees the potential for her own personal growth and improvement. Just as the hibiscus opens up to reveal its beauty once again, Saeng aims to emerge from her own challenges as a better, more resilient individual.
1270	10135	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because when she comes back from taking the driver's test, she sees a beautiful winter hibiscus. Despite the high cost, she buys the flower and brings it home. Her mother, surprised by the expense, questions her about it. Despite her mother's disapproval, the protagonist decides to keep the flower, as it reminds her of Vietnam. The author leaves the story at this point, hinting that as the geese return and the flower grows, she will eventually retake the test. This ending suggests that patience and perseverance will eventually lead to success.
1271	10136	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself that she would try taking her driver's test again once she had settled into her new life in a new country. Finding comfort in the hibiscus plant and the familiar touch of its leaves, she knew that she would soon feel more at home in @LOCATION2. There was more waiting for her in this new place than just a plant and a couple of geese; she would find a sense of belonging and connection that would help her overcome the loneliness she had felt since leaving Vietnam. With time, Saeng was confident that she would adapt to her new surroundings and build a new life filled with warmth and familiarity.
1272	10137	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the snow does melt and the geese return, it will be time to plant and work in the garden even more. With snow on the ground, planting is not possible, but with the geese back, it is the time of year to plant the seeds and have a bountiful harvest. The test is to see if she can achieve a better grade than last year and the year before that. It is a time of renewal and growth, symbolizing the cycle of life on the farm.
1273	10138	4	3	The author concluded his story with that paragraph because it brought closure to the narrative and tied up all the loose ends. It was the perfect way to end the story, leaving readers satisfied with the resolution of the plot and the fate of the characters. The final paragraph encapsulated the overarching theme of the story and left a lasting impact on the reader, solidifying the message the author intended to convey. In essence, the conclusion was the culmination of all the events that had transpired throughout the story, providing a sense of fulfillment and completion to the reader.
1274	10139	4	3	The author concludes the story with ìin the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She does this to show now Saeng is adapting and making decisions in her new country just like she did in her homeland. In Vietnam Saeng used to brush her grandmothers hair and help put it into a bun and put a hibiscus in it. That was one of her traditions with it. Also when she used to get water from the well a hibiscus would sometimes come up with the bucket. Both these thus the hibiscus was seen as a comfort object, now as she is in the states, she is trying to put it to good use, while also taking into account what repeats in the states. She notices that the geese come back in the spring and leave in the winter, and plants start to grow in the spring. By her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start test just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom. The plant being potted in her garden and Saeng moving her both signify change, but a rembrance of old traditions, and a space for new. In the end, Saeng's decision to wait until spring to retake the test reflects her willingness to embrace change while holding onto the traditions and memories that are dear to her, just like the hibiscus that blooms anew each year.
1275	10140	4	3	The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right and cause she likes geese. She knows that taking her time and focusing on the task at hand will lead to better results, and her fondness for geese provides a sense of calm and inspiration during the test. By allowing herself the time she needs and surrounding herself with things that bring her joy, she believes she can achieve success in her endeavors. This combination of patience and positivity sets her up for a productive and fulfilling testing experience.
1276	10141	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the final determination and strength Saeng has been given. It's almost as though it's taken this plant to show her to get back up and pass the test. The plant becomes a comforting item that reminds her of her homeland. She returned with the plant to show her mother but found herself too shaky to even say the words ""at home."" This shows how much she misses home. But she is able to realize that this is her new home and everything is becoming more familiar to her. As she gazes at the plant, a sense of peace washes over her, and she knows that no matter where she is, she will always carry a piece of her homeland in her heart. With renewed determination, Saeng takes a deep breath and embraces her new life, knowing that she has the strength to overcome any challenges that come her way."
1277	10142	4	3	"She ends it with this sentence because it's a sign of new life. Just as the winter that killed the plants ending life, the spring will come and start anew. This is how Saeng feels because she left her country and all the memories left behind she feels out of place like the winter hibiscus but as the spring comes she'll feel as a new person ready and able to take challenges as she said here ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now"" she describes that with a new season comes new changes and upon those changes she will go on to take the drivers test again. The cycle of seasons mirrors the cycle of life, and just as the earth rejuvenates itself with each new season, Saeng will also find renewal and growth in the challenges that lie ahead."
1278	10143	4	3	The author ends with that paragraph for several reasons. One is to show that she has failed this time, more opportunities will come later. Also, it shows that even though bad times befall her now, good times are still to come. For several reasons, it was a powerful and efficient way to end the story. The message conveyed is one of hope and resilience, reminding the reader that setbacks are temporary and that there is always the possibility of better things on the horizon. By ending on this note, the author leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and the belief that brighter days are yet to come.
1279	10144	4	3	The author uses symbolism to convey a different message. Saeng said in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, and then I will take that test again. The author uses the hibiscus to symbolize Saeng gets older like the hibiscus, that then she will be ready to take that test again. The author uses symbolize to convey more of the story. The budding hibiscus represents growth and readiness for new challenges, just like Saeng's readiness to face the test again when the time is right. It signifies a period of preparation and transformation, mirroring Saeng's own journey towards success. The hibiscus serves as a reminder that with time and patience, one can overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. So, when the hibiscus blooms, Saeng will be fully prepared to tackle the test and showcase her growth and development.
1280	10146	4	3	She wrote that response to tell everyone that she will be ready but the time when spring comes. Then she takes it and pass. As the seasons change and the weather warms, she plans to be fully prepared for whatever challenges or opportunities may come her way. Spring symbolizes growth, renewal, and fresh beginnings, and she is determined to embrace this time with readiness and enthusiasm. With a positive outlook and a proactive mindset, she is confident in her ability to face the future with strength and resilience. When spring arrives, she will be ready to seize the moment and make the most of the opportunities that come her way.
1281	10147	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng wants to start planting again. Saeng's life revolves around planting and gardening, as she and her mother rely on the crops they grow for their food. Throughout the day, they dedicate their time to tending to the garden, growing crops to sell and save for the future. They work hard to save for the winter months and to purchase equipment needed to sustain their livelihood. Saeng eagerly anticipates the return of the geese that fly over their yard, a sight she loves on beautiful days. When the snow melts, she looks forward to getting back into the soil, feeling the earth on her hands and knees as she begins planting once again. The budding hibiscus signals the start of a new growing season for Saeng, who finds purpose and joy in the act of planting. This paragraph is included in the story to highlight Saeng's passion for gardening and her desire to continue cultivating the land that sustains her.
1282	10148	4	3	"In the conclusion of the ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng notes how she will retake her driving test in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return. The spring is when these events occur along with the annual budding of the winter hibiscus. Her family had moved from Vietnam to a new location, and she had bought a winter hibiscus plant to remind her of her childhood. When it blooms, she will retake her driving test because the budding flower will bring her the hope of a new beginning in her life, and as a citizen in her new home. The winter hibiscus serves as a symbol of resilience and growth, a reminder that despite the challenges she has faced, there is always the possibility of renewal and transformation. Saeng's decision to retake her driving test in the spring reflects her determination to move forward and embrace the opportunities that lie ahead."
1283	10149	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young girl named Saeng moves away from home and tries to adapt to her new lifestyle and changes. Saeng feels a mix of emotions as she navigates her unfamiliar surroundings, missing the familiarity of her old home while also feeling a sense of excitement and possibility in her new environment. She finds solace in the beauty of winter hibiscus flowers, which remind her of the resilience and adaptability required to thrive in new situations. Through the symbolic presence of the winter hibiscus, Saeng learns to embrace change and find strength in the face of challenges. As she continues to adjust to her new life, Saeng's experiences with the winter hibiscus serve as a reminder of her own ability to bloom and flourish in any circumstances."
1284	10150	4	3	Saeng was determined to pass her driver's test. Just like the geese flying south for the winter, she would not rest until she achieved her goal. The beauty of perseverance and determination was evident in her unwavering commitment to overcome any obstacles in her path. With grit and resilience, Saeng would continue to strive towards success, mirroring the relentless journey of the geese as they made their way to warmer climates. The parallel between Saeng's determination and the geese's migration highlighted the power of perseverance in reaching one's destination. Just as the geese would not stop until they reached their winter home, Saeng would not stop until she conquered her driver's test, demonstrating the beauty of resilience and unwavering dedication.
1285	10151	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by CAPS1 Ho, the author leaves the story off with a powerful ending. The ending was ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will try the test again."" Basically, the author concluded the story with that because it shows she's powerful, that she's willing to try and make herself stronger, that she's willing to try again, and that she wants to help herself. Text examples to prove this would be, ""then I will take the hibiscus test again,"" ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become..."", and ""There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply."" All those statements help backup why the author might leave such powerful paragraph for last."
1286	10152	4	3	Saeng knew that she would have to face her memories again in the future, as the hibiscus plant bloomed once more. The test of her emotions would come around again, challenging her to confront the past and accept the changes that time had brought. Despite the inevitable pain that revisiting her memories would bring, Saeng was determined to face the test head-on, knowing that it was a necessary step in her journey towards healing and growth. Just as the hibiscus would bloom again in the spring, Saeng would also have to blossom through her trials, emerging stronger and more resilient each time. The cycle of testing and growth would continue, but Saeng was ready to face whatever challenges came her way, armed with the knowledge that she had the strength and support to overcome them.
1287	10154	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, a girl named Saeng failed her driver's test that day but vowed to retake it in the spring. She sees this as a new beginning, symbolized by the transition from harsh winter to warm spring. This change in seasons represents a fresh start for Saeng and her mother, signaling that their troubles will improve. As winter's challenges fade away, they look forward to a peaceful and hopeful spring. Saeng is optimistic that she will pass the test and embark on a new chapter in her life."
1288	10155	4	3	The hibiscus flower has always been a symbol of hope and strength for Saeng. In times of disappointment and obstacles, the plant has provided her with the courage and determination to keep going. As she looks forward to the spring, when the hibiscus is budding and everything is beautiful again, Saeng knows that she will take her test once more. With the support of the hibiscus plant, with its waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers, she is confident that she will pass the test. The hibiscus will be her source of strength, guiding her towards success in the upcoming challenges.
1289	10156	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author ends with the statement, ""...then Iíll take the test again."" This shows that Saeng is willing to try to adapt to this new place she lives in. That is what refers to when she says ""test."" For example, in the story she said, ""I-I failed the test,"" when her mother asked her what was wrong. She spent so much money on that plant hoping to stay home in her mind. She just couldnít handle that. She ends with the positive statement because it just sends the message that she looks forward to a bright future in her new home."
1290	10157	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a paragraph that conveys several important messages. One of the reasons for this conclusion is to show that the protagonist is determined and will not give up easily, as evidenced by her decision to retake the test. Additionally, the mention of the budding hibiscus symbolizes hope and the possibility of growth and adaptation, mirroring the girl's own journey of adjusting to her new surroundings. Finally, the protagonist's realization that the once strange things are becoming familiar signifies her resilience and efforts to do her best in her current situation. Through these examples, the author effectively conveys themes of perseverance, resilience, and hope in the face of challenges."
1291	10158	4	3	"The author of ""winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding. This shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each. The winter represents an obstacle for the flower, but it will live through it to thrive in the spring. This gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive. Another hardship that she and the hibiscus both face is being ""root bound."" The author misses her home of Vietnam very much. However, both of them must and will adapt to their new environments. In the end, just like the hibiscus, the author will overcome her challenges and blossom beautifully in her new surroundings."
1292	10159	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she misses her home and that affected her driving test. At her home country it was warm and she had all her family memories. In the new country it is cold and snowy, something she isnít used to. It states she will take the test again when all them things happen because it will feel like her home country and she will be more focused on the test and not what she misses.
1293	10160	4	3	"The author Minfong Ho concluded the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a paragraph that shows Saeng's determination to pass the driving test and adjust to her new home. Saeng's resolve is evident as she mentions waiting for the snow to melt and the hibiscus to bloom before taking the test again. This symbolizes a fresh start and a positive outlook on the future. By choosing to begin anew in the spring, Saeng is embracing the idea of moving forward and finding happiness in her new life. The author's ending leaves readers with a sense of hope and resilience, highlighting Saeng's strength in facing challenges and starting over."
1294	10161	4	3	She ended it with that paragraph because she wanted to prove even though she misses the old century, she will adapt and survive. While nostalgia for the past is natural, she understands the importance of embracing change and moving forward. By acknowledging the challenges of the present and committing to overcome them, she demonstrates resilience and a willingness to evolve with the times. This mindset will undoubtedly serve her well as she navigates the complexities of the modern world, demonstrating that she is capable of thriving in any era.
1295	10162	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sounds hopeful. She wasnít adapting to her new home very well and that made her feel hopeless. Saeng failed her driving test which only made things worse for her. To make things better, she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of her old home. She found the plant to be very comforting and it helped her get past the tough times. In the last paragraph, Saeng is looking forward to the spring so she can retake the test and hopefully pass it this time. I think the paragraph provides a feeling of hopefulness which is why the author concluded the story the way they did. She is determined to succeed and face the challenges with a positive attitude, embracing the hope for a brighter future ahead.
1296	10163	4	3	Saeng failed the test of not giving into her sorrows and misery of missing her country. She says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” This shows that she is adjusting. So by ending it with this and comparing to the geese, its showing that she is getting stronger. She will take the test again because she wont give up.
1297	10164	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This passage from the story Winter @CAPS1 highlights Saeng's determination and resilience. Despite facing challenges and setbacks, she remains focused on her goal and is willing to try again in the future. The mention of spring symbolizes hope and renewal, suggesting that there is always an opportunity for a fresh start. Saeng's commitment to retesting reflects her perseverance and belief in her abilities. As the seasons change and new beginnings emerge, Saeng prepares herself for another chance to succeed.
1298	10165	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because, even though Saeng didnít do well on her last test, Saeng will go back and take it again so she can pass it. The author is showing Saengís determination to pass the test and do better next time. This determination and resilience displayed by Saeng in the face of failure exemplifies the importance of perseverance and hard work in achieving one's goals. It serves as a reminder that setbacks are just temporary obstacles that can be overcome with dedication and persistence. Saeng's commitment to improving her performance not only reflects her strong work ethic but also her belief in her ability to succeed. By highlighting Saeng's decision to try again, the author leaves readers with a message of hope and encouragement, emphasizing the power of resilience in the face of adversity.
1299	10166	4	3	I think the author ends the story with that paragraph because it is hinting at the plant that stands for many positive things to the character that failed the test that she really wanted to pass. Both the character and the plant show perseverance, and I think the author is trying to send a message to the reader to never give up on something you want to accomplish. The plant gives an emblem of perseverance because it survives through the harsh winter. The main character isn't giving up on the test she wants to pass. The author is giving a message not to give up.
1300	10167	4	3	At the end of the story the author says ìwhen they come back in the spring, whe the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again.î The author concludes this at the end because she felt like she didnít do her best because she failed so when the spring comes again She is going to retry to do it and hopefully this time she will past.
1301	10168	4	3	Because she wants to come back and do a smell test again when the snow melts and the geese return, the author looks forward to revisiting the marsh in the spring. The anticipation of experiencing the changing seasons and witnessing the return of the geese fills her with excitement. With each passing day, she imagines the transformation of the landscape and the revival of nature after the long winter. The promise of new beginnings and the familiar scents of the marsh waiting to be rediscovered draw her back, eager to immerse herself once more in the beauty of the natural world. As she plans her return visit, the author can already envision the vibrant colors, the sounds of wildlife, and the fresh, crisp air that will greet her when she steps foot in the marsh again. The cycle of life continues, and she eagerly awaits the next chapter in her sensory exploration of the marsh.
1302	10169	4	3	Saeng's mother taught her how to care for the Hibiscus plant, explaining that it needed sunlight and water to thrive. Saeng diligently followed her mother's instructions, tending to the plant with love and dedication. As the weeks passed, the Hibiscus plant began to bloom, its vibrant flowers adding a splash of color to their garden. Saeng would spend hours sitting beside the plant, admiring its beauty and feeling a sense of calm wash over her. With each passing day, Saeng felt more confident and determined to succeed in her next driving test. She knew that just like the Hibiscus plant, she too could flourish and bloom with perseverance and care. When the time came for her to take the test again, Saeng approached it with a newfound sense of optimism and assurance. And as she drove past the budding Hibiscus plants in the spring, she knew deep down that she was ready to overcome any obstacles that came her way.
1303	10170	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test. The hibiscus will have started sprouting and will give her the strength to take the test again and hopefully pass it, all because the winter hibiscus reminded her of home. The vibrant red flowers will serve as a reminder of her roots and give her the courage to persevere through challenges, just like the resilient plant blooming in the cold winter. This connection to her home and the symbol of growth and strength that the hibiscus represents will be her source of motivation and determination as she faces her academic hurdles with renewed optimism and resolve.
1304	10171	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The hibiscus, with its delicate yet resilient nature, symbolized for Saeng the strength and perseverance needed to face her challenges. Just as the hibiscus bloomed after enduring the harsh winter, she too would rise again and overcome the obstacles in her path. With renewed determination, Saeng looked forward to the coming spring, ready to prove herself once more.
1305	10172	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this to show that saeng wonít give up. It is possible to adapt and try to love what's around you. Saeng struggled to get out ""I-I failed the test"" and couldn't say ""at home."" This shows her insecurity and loneliness for the new world around her. By saying she will try again in the spring, it gives the reader hope that she will adapt and love her surroundings. She goes through an experience today that old life and comparing it to the one she is living in now they have some similarities. Because she will try again in the spring means she has decided to give a new place a chance."
1306	10173	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she says ""Then I will take that test again."" She believes in the Flowers. She and the Flowers both adapt to their circumstances. They are both determined to thrive in difficult places. They both overcome obstacles. Maybe she wants to see what lays ahead. She hopes she is right about the Flowers, maybe she likes the spring."
1307	10174	4	3	I actually like the way the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It basically sumarizises the story and sums it up into few words that would want you to wonder what happened next, and if there is a sequel. This is a very good story that I personally can relate to in many ways. The ending leaves room for imagination and speculation, making it a memorable read that sticks with you long after you've finished it. It's the kind of ending that lingers in your mind, sparking conversations and contemplation about what might have happened next. In a way, it invites the reader to become a part of the story, to continue it in their own minds and hearts. And that, to me, is the mark of a truly great piece of writing.
1308	10175	4	3	The reason why the author concludes this type of scenario is simply because the author has a pain to cross and a situation to overcome. If you look closely, you will realize that this is your moment to shine. Seize the opportunity before it slips away. You have only one chance to prove your worth to those around you.
1309	10176	4	3	The author concludes with this sentence because he is showing the girls confidence in herself. It also gives her enough time to get ready for the next test. Also she knows she will be ready when her flower starts to bud. This encouragement instills a sense of self-assurance in the girl, empowering her to face challenges with determination and poise. By believing in herself and allowing time for growth and preparation, she will be well-equipped to overcome obstacles and achieve success in her endeavors. With a positive mindset and readiness to blossom, the girl is poised to embrace her full potential and thrive in her pursuits.
1310	10177	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave a sense of anticipation and mystery for the readers. By hinting at a future story budding silently and being written in the spring when the characters come back, the author sets the stage for a potential sequel or continuation of the narrative. This conclusion keeps the readers engaged and curious about what will happen next, creating a sense of intrigue and eagerness for future developments in the story.
1311	10178	4	3	The author concludes the story by expressing her determination to overcome challenges and succeed, drawing inspiration from the natural world around her. She reflects on the resilience of nature, where even seemingly incompatible elements can coexist and thrive. Through this analogy, she finds the strength to face her own difficulties and strive for success. By comparing her struggles to the changing seasons and blooming flowers, she embraces the possibility of growth and transformation. With this newfound perspective, she is ready to tackle the test again, knowing that perseverance and effort can lead to achievement.
1312	10179	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when she told her mom she failed her test she was crying. But I think it was deeper than that. I think she missed home so much that she couldn't concentrate. She had to cry about something because she didn't want to let her mom know that she misses home.
1313	10180	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concludes the story because as if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. Her determination to prove herself and her resilience in facing challenges are evident in her decision to wait for the right moment to try again. The image of her mother working tirelessly in the garden serves as a reminder of the strength and perseverance that run in her family, motivating Saeng to continue pursuing her goals despite setbacks. As she watches her mother, she feels a renewed sense of purpose and readiness to tackle whatever obstacles come her way. And so, with the changing seasons and the support of her family, Saeng prepares herself for the next chapter in her journey towards success.
1314	10181	4	3	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is showing that the hibiscus inspires her and gives comfort that no person could try and do. For example, after Saeng failed her drivers test, she was disappointed. On her way home she saw a hibiscus and went to a florist shop to try and buy it. Saeng took a peddle from the plant and held it tightly while she closed her eyes. The plant reminded her of her real home in Vietnam which she loved. The hibiscus became a form of comfort for Saeng since she had just failed her drivers test, even though the plant was not the same as the one at home. By the author ending the story with Saeng saying she will wait until the hibiscus starts budding to take the test again, it shows that the hibiscus helps her to overcome obstacles in life and it helps her to get through hardships she faces.
1315	10182	4	3	Saeng will retake the test during the season when these plants are thriving, allowing her to appreciate the plot, characters, and historical context surrounding them more deeply.
1316	10183	4	3	She is determined not to retake the test unless the winter hibiscus plants return. Despite feeling disappointed about failing the test, she spent her day observing the hibiscus plants, longing for the real ones back home. Her mother reassured her that the plants were resilient enough to survive the winter. Saeng silently promised herself that in the spring, as the snow melts and the geese return, and the hibiscus blooms once more, she will be ready to retake the test.
1317	10184	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes the hope that things will get better. The author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year, so can she. This symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country but eventually she will. The girl considers the day to be horrible and misses her grandmother and friends. But this paragraph is the girl vowing a promise to herself that she will withstand the winter until spring and it will get better when she can take the test again. Saeng realizes that she will make it through this struggle just like this flower will make it through the winter. Saeng understands that it will take time for her to adapt to this new and strange country and the new lifestyle that she must adopt.
1318	10185	4	3	"The author concludes this story with this sentence, because it shows hope for the future. This sentence lets readers know that times are hard now, but in time things will get better. Saeng might have failed this test, but she's not giving up hope on passing it. She believes she will pass that test in the spring, when the time is right. Saeng might miss her home, but she won't let that interfere with her future. That is why the author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""
1319	10186	4	3	The snow had begun to melt, signaling the arrival of spring. As the winter frost receded, flowers, trees, and grass started to bloom once again, painting the landscape with vibrant colors. It was clear that winter was behind us, and the time had come to embrace the new season. The author mentioned planting in winter to ensure a beautiful growth in the spring, highlighting the importance of preparation for the changing seasons. With each passing day, nature transformed, displaying its beauty and resilience in the face of changing weather. Spring had officially arrived, bringing with it a sense of renewal and growth that could be seen all around.
1320	10187	4	3	"The author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story. For example, this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus, representing her new home, and the old, together in harmony. It also states that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which relates to the determination of the hibiscus flower, which struggles persistently through the winter. A lot of wisdom can be gathered from the symbolic messages hidden within that final sentence It implies that, though the past may be behind you, it is with you in your heart as you face new challenges, and if you are determined, those challenges can be conquered."
1321	10188	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows Saeng's determination and her overcoming her obstacles of being new in a country. With all of the doubts Saeng had right after her test, it is very big of her to come to this conclusion of retaking the test, ""Here, let me help you mother,"" she offered (HO). With her mom comforting her and telling her it is okay, Saeng gets the boost she needs to help her mother and think to herself that she can't let just one thing hold her back in life. With the support Saeng has, she will definitely pass the test the next time."
1322	10189	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng's determination to do well in her new country is evident as she vows to retake the test in the spring. Memories of her grandmother help her strive for the best, as seen when she plants a flower from her home country in the vegetable garden. The flower serves as a reminder of her roots and motivates her to succeed. Despite feeling disappointed about failing the test, Saeng's actions show her resilience and desire to honor her past while embracing her new life. Remembering her grandmother brings both sadness and joy, but ultimately fuels her determination to thrive in her new home."
1323	10190	4	3	The author concludes the story with a quote indicating that the character will have another chance at something. This type of ending leaves the reader curious and eager to know what will happen next. It allows for the imagination to run wild, wondering if the character will succeed or fail in their next attempt. This open-ended conclusion adds a twist to the story, making it memorable and engaging for the reader. It leaves room for the possibility of a sequel or allows the reader to create their own version of what happens next. Ultimately, this type of ending keeps the reader invested in the story and the character's journey, leaving them with a sense of anticipation and wonder.
1324	10191	4	3	"The author closes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is willing to try again. Even though it may not be right away, Saeng wants to try to see all of the flowers that remind her of home again without breaking down. She can tell that although her mother is understanding, Saeng has let her down a little bit. ""But how could you? You know how much weñwhat happened?"" When her mother says this, she feels that she has let her mother down. But then, Mrs. Panouvong expresses that she is glad Saeng got it, after hearing that she had failed. Sensing her motherís inkling of disappointment, Saeng wants to try again. She knows it won't be easy, but she is determined to make her mother proud and show that she can overcome her past struggles. With renewed determination, Saeng sets her sights on trying again, knowing that with perseverance and support, she can succeed in seeing the flowers that hold so much meaning for her."
1325	10192	4	3	Most likely the author concludes this story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng was a very determined person. The author wanted to show readers that Saeng was a strong character because throughout the story she seemed very determined to pass the test for the first time. But when she failed, the author wanted to show that Saeng was not going to give up hope and that she was going to take the test again.
1326	10193	4	3	In conclusion, the author's childhood was shaped by the challenges and hardships she faced, but she was able to overcome them through perseverance and determination. Despite the obstacles she encountered, she never gave up on her dreams and remained resilient in the face of adversity. Her experiences taught her valuable lessons about the importance of resilience, hard work, and never losing sight of what truly matters in life. As she looks back on her journey, she is grateful for the strength and courage she developed along the way, which have shaped her into the person she is today.
1327	10194	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because he is making a point about immigration. The point the author is making is that when immigrants came to @CAPS1 they were told to forget where they were from. The word test in the story means getting used to @LOCATION1 and forgetting her homeland. Saeng says those words because she failed the test and bought something that reminded her of her homeland. In conclusion, the Author is describing how immigrants were treated and told to forget who they were because they're in @LOCATION1 now. This signifies the struggle immigrants face in trying to assimilate into a new culture while holding onto their roots."
1328	10195	4	3	"In the story ""Winter @CAPS1,"" the author suggests that Saeng feels like he is from a different place than where he currently resides. When he enters this new world, it is as if no one knows him except for himself. This feeling of being in a foreign environment highlights Saeng's sense of displacement and isolation. This notion underscores the idea that Saeng is disconnected from his surroundings and longs for a sense of belonging that he cannot find in his current location."
1329	10196	4	3	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because it shows signs of hope and the reassurance that spring will come again for the family, bringing with it the promise that everything will be okay. The girl will have the opportunity to make new friends when spring arrives, bringing a sense of renewal and new beginnings to their lives.
1330	10197	4	3	In ìWinter Hibiscusî Saeng took her driverís test and failed it. She wants to try and take it again in the spring. I think she ends the story saying that because in the spring the hibiscus plant that she got and her and her mom planted, will be growing and blooming and the geese will be back which makes her feel more at home. That way she will feel comfort and be able to take the test and pass, because it will remind her of being home. In addition, the warmer weather and longer days of spring will bring a sense of renewal and hope, creating a positive atmosphere for Saeng as she prepares to retake her driverís test. The familiar sights and sounds of the season will provide a sense of stability and reassurance, boosting her confidence and helping her succeed. As the hibiscus blooms and the geese return, Saeng will feel a renewed sense of belonging and connection to her surroundings, giving her the strength and determination to overcome any challenges that come her way. With the support of her family and the beauty of spring surrounding her, Saeng is ready to face her driving test once again and emerge victorious.
1331	10198	4	3	In the end of the story, they mention that she will retake the test in the spring when the geese return from their winter migration. This signifies a fresh start for her, a new beginning to prepare for the test again. Her mother reassures her that everything will be fine and encourages her to try again in the new season. This new opportunity allows her to reset and focus on her studies, learning from her previous experience. By waiting for the geese to come back in the spring, she is given a chance to approach the test with renewed determination and a positive mindset. It is a time for growth, improvement, and the possibility of achieving success after a setback.
1332	10199	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is thinking about what it will be like when all of this happens. Saeng said, ""when they come back, she vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" She envisions a time of renewal and growth, a time when she can start afresh and overcome the challenges that have held her back. With the changing seasons symbolizing new beginnings, Saeng looks forward to the opportunity to prove herself once more and achieve her goals."
1333	10200	4	3	The author of the story concludes the text with that paragraph to end on a good note and show hope for the future. First, throughout the story Saeng felt lonely and depressed because she missed her home in Vietnam. With all this depression Saeng saw the winter hibiscus that reminded her of her childhood memories. She felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life. The flower represented the light and hope for the future. Next, it shows perserverance factor in the story Saeng fails her drivers test and came home feeling unacomplished. When she says she will retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms it shows perserverance and never giving up. Lastly, the author ended the passage with that paragraph to end on a good note and show a positive outlook on life. No matter where you come from with love and perserverance you can overcome any obstacle. Whether it be your school, tests or home with a little hardwork and faith you can achieve.
1334	10201	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,î to show that she will do this once she has gotten used to the change of her new country. When she says, ìWhen the geese returnî their faint honks and flying overhead are familiar to her now season upon season. Also, when the hibiscus is budding because this will remind her of her home in Vietnam seeing flowers and hearing these geese will give her the confidence and encouragement to retake the driver's test. As time passes, Saeng will feel more connected to her new surroundings and be ready to face the challenge of obtaining her driver's license with a renewed sense of determination and familiarity.
1335	10202	4	3	Saeng vowed silently to herself to make new friends, as she found it difficult to connect with others. Finding solace in plants, she spent her days surrounded by greenery, feeling a sense of companionship from the natural world. Taking up her shovel, Saeng lovingly planted new additions to her garden, a task that not only pleased her mother but also brought her a deep sense of fulfillment. Through her connection with nature, Saeng discovered a way to feel good about herself and find joy in the simple act of nurturing life.
1336	10203	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî decided to end the story with this paragraph because it signifies a new beginning for Saeng. Moving and failing the test, Saeng finds solace in the winter hibiscus, which offers comfort and hope as she leaves behind memories of her old home. The transition from winter to spring symbolizes renewal and fresh starts, much like how Saeng sees the upcoming test as an opportunity for a new beginning. Just as spring brings new life and inspiration, Saeng's decision to face the test in the spring reflects her desire for a fresh start and a chance to succeed.
1337	10204	4	3	"Authors sometimes conclude a story with a certain paragraph describing an action that will take place in the future. In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes the paragraph by saying ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" One reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to help show that things will change come spring. For example in the story the girl said, ""I-I failed the test."" By her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test come spring she can change. She can get better, so that this time she will pass. Also, ""The 'winter hibiscus' was in the ground now, and she tamped down the soil around it."" This quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now, but come spring it will have changed color and have bloomed. In conclusion authors end stories with a paragraph like this to help show the changes that could happen in the future."
1338	10205	4	3	"The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The ""budding hibiscus"" symbolizes comfort for her. When moving to a new country, she couldn't take all her friends and possessions with her, but she could bring memories. The flower reminds her of home, which is comforting after she failed her drivers test. In addition, the ""geese returning"" symbolizes a new beginning. After being away for so long, the geese returning ushers in spring, a time to start all over after a dreary winter. Finally, ""then I will take that test again,"" shows that one should never give up. Even though it was hard for her to adapt to a new country, she made friends and tried new foods, like a Big Mac. Therefore, Minfong Ho concludes the story with the paragraph to show comfort, new beginnings, and never give up."
1339	10206	4	3	The reason why the author wanted to put that last paragraph down because they want to keep the reader interested in the story. Another reason why she/he put that in the story; it is letting the reader know that plant will never give up. This ensures that the reader stays engaged and connected to the perseverance of the plant despite facing challenges. It emphasizes the theme of resilience and determination, leaving a lasting impact on the reader's mind. This small detail adds depth to the story and reinforces the plant's unwavering spirit.
1340	10207	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the quote, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to show that she is encouraged by the memories of her homeland. For example, in the story it stated that she realized that many things were similar to things in her homeland. As the seasons went by she discovered the similarities. The spring time reminded Saeng of her home, so when it comes she will be motivated to take the test again. In conclusion, the author included the quote to show how she is encouraged by memories of her homeland."
1341	10208	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the main character vowing to take the driver's test again to symbolize moving forward. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. Upon stumbling into a florist shop, the main character saw a flower that reminded her of her homeland, Vietnam. ""Here, let me help, mother,"" she said, relieving her mother in planting the seed she had bought, a simple task that marked her growth. Reflecting on her past and finding peace, she realized nothing was holding her back. ""When they come back, I will take that test again,"" she declared. Watching geese migrate south in a V formation, she set a goal for herself, using it as a tool to propel herself forward in the new country she was in. The main character's vow in ""Winter Hibiscus"" symbolizes moving forward."
1342	10209	4	3	It shows in this time of doubt that she will overcome. In the story the plant showed hope and in showing this gave her hope. All the memories that she recalled had made her sad at first but in the end gave her hope. As she continued to nurture the plant, she found solace in its resilience and growth, reflecting her own journey towards healing and renewal. The plant became a symbol of hope and possibility, a reminder that even in the face of adversity, there is always a chance for new beginnings. Through tending to the plant, she learned to embrace her past and look towards the future with optimism and strength. Just like the plant, she too would continue to grow and thrive, no matter what challenges may come her way.
1343	10210	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that statement simply because, maybe he is trying to send out some sort of message to people and get their attention. The author also could have concluded the story with that statement because maybe he just felt like he needed to do that, maybe he didn't have a particular reason for doing it. The statement could serve as a thought-provoking ending that leaves readers contemplating the deeper meaning behind the story. It may be a way for the author to prompt reflection on the events that unfolded and the characters' actions. Ultimately, the author's choice to end the story in this manner adds a sense of closure while also leaving room for interpretation and discussion among readers.
1344	10211	4	3	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again"" because its sympathizing Saeng's ability to overcome her sorrow and give the test another chance. This is symbolized by when she says ""when the geese return and the hibiscus."" After failing the test, she wasn't initially considering retaking it, but instead, just wished she could return to her old home and not have to think about it. But much like the geese returning in the spring, she says she will retake the test. She is like the geese because they overcome and adapt to the cold harsh weather by flying elsewhere and returning when it's warm, like her, she must wait until she is more ready and confident to take the test the second time around. The Hibiscus budding is symbolizing her strength and determination to pass the test the second time she takes it because just like her, the hibiscus survive the cold weather months, to bloom in the spring. So, she must last through the weather to pass in the spring. Saeng hasn't given up and will take the test again, assured that she will pass."
1345	10212	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator wants to retake the test and is waiting for a better time. It shows that she has perseverance and will not give up on passing this test. She realizes that life comes and goes very quickly, and that she needs to appreciate it.
1346	10213	4	3	"The author concluded the last paragraph in the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" to say that the narrator ""Saeng"" isnít given up on her driving test. Despite failing multiple times, Saeng remains determined to pass the test and earn her driver's license. With a mix of nerves and excitement, she knows that she must keep practicing and improving her skills behind the wheel. Saeng is not one to give up easily, and she is willing to put in the effort required to achieve her goal of passing the test. As she reflects on her journey so far, she is filled with a sense of determination and perseverance, ready to face the challenges that lie ahead."
1347	10214	4	3	At the end of the story, Saeng is determined to go back to the drivers test and is open to a new beginning. The author used these concluding words in the paragraph to express the hope in Saeng of a better beginning and to show her determination to pass the drivers test. The author ties the objects in-a story to represent this determination and new beginning. For example, the hibiscus is a reminder of her glorious home, spring is the time she picks because it is a new beginning, and the geese returning show the determination of her and her to resolve to become new and better.
1348	10215	4	3	The author concludes the story with a paragraph that invokes hope within the reader towards the characters. One of the most important lessons in life is to never lose hope because things will get better as long as you try. Saeng, although sad over failing her driving test and missing her homeland deeply, vows to never give up. This principle shows that people can overcome hard times in life, no matter the circumstances. In conclusion, hope is evoked within the reader through the ending paragraph, contributing to the overall theme of the story: never give up and always have hope, especially during tough times.
1349	10216	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it enhances the overall impact and engagement of the narrative. By providing a satisfying ending, the author ensures that readers are left with a sense of closure and fulfillment. This final paragraph ties up any loose ends and leaves a lasting impression on the audience. Additionally, it reinforces the central themes and messages of the story, leaving readers with a clear understanding of the story's significance. Overall, the inclusion of this paragraph at the end of the story elevates the overall quality and effectiveness of the narrative.
1350	10217	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to explain to us that this plant is going to bring good luck. The snow will melt, the geese will return and the hibiscus plant will start budding. Its starting over fresh, a new beginning. Since she had failed her driving test she will start over in the spring. In conclusion this is why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
1351	10218	4	3	In the spring, as the hibiscus plant starts over, Saeng too will begin anew. Just like the plant, she will have the opportunity to shed the hardships of winter and embrace a fresh start. The struggles she faced during the harsh season will soon be a thing of the past, replaced by the promise of growth and renewal. As the world around her blossoms with life, Saeng will also bloom, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead with a newfound sense of resilience and hope.
1352	10219	4	3	The Author includes this paragraph to this story in many reasons why. One reason why is because the story started off by saying and talking about Saeng failing her drivers test and being depressed over it. Then it gets into talking about the hibiscus and how it reminds her of homeland and all of the good memories that she has experienced. This all relates to this paragraph because Saeng will not return to the testing again until the thing that makes her happy and confident, the hibiscus starts to bud. That paragraph relates to every little bit of this story from the beginning to the end.
1353	10220	4	3	When they come back is when the character feels she would be prepared to take that test again. It was a moment of realization for her, a turning point where she understood that she had grown and learned enough to face the challenge once more. The journey she had taken, the experiences she had gained, all contributed to her newfound confidence. This return marked not only a physical comeback but also a mental and emotional readiness. The character had come full circle, ready to confront the test with a newfound strength and determination.
1354	10221	4	3	"Saeng has moved to @LOCATION1 and longs for home. The flowers in the greenhouse remind her of where she grew up and her grandmother. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" Saeng cannot look at the flowers without crying. She tells her mom that she did not pass the test but in the last paragraph she vowed to herself that by spring she will. The author is giving us insight into Saeng's character. We now know that even though it is difficult for Saeng to let go of what she knows and loves, she will have the strength to make it in a new world."
1355	10222	4	3	As the seasons changed and the cycle of nature continued, she knew that her days with nature were far from over. When the time came around again, she would eagerly return to her garden, tending to her plants with care and dedication. She would nurture them, watch them grow, and ultimately, enjoy the fruits of her labor on the dinner table. This cycle would continue, she realized, for as long as she was able to do so. And so, with a heart full of gratitude and a mind filled with determination, she looked forward to the days ahead, knowing that her connection with nature would always be a part of her life.
1356	10223	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort. So when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test. The author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng still doesnít like the change and would like to go back to her old home. The familiarity and comfort of the old home provide solace and stability, making it difficult for Saeng to fully embrace the new environment. This inner conflict between holding onto the past and adapting to the present creates a sense of unease and reluctance towards change. Ultimately, the winter hibiscus serves as a symbolic reminder of the longing for the familiar and the struggle to find a sense of belonging in a new place.
1357	10224	4	3	"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting anew in a new country. In this country she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of so. Saeng took a test and failed and in the winter, flowers fail but they bloom again in the spring. When the hibiscus blooms Saeng will ""bloom"" and try the test again. Moving can be a hardship especially when it is to place very unfamiliar. People find ways to make themselves promises & to remind them of their old home. Saeng finds solace in the hibiscus, a reminder of her roots and a symbol of resilience. Just as the hibiscus blooms again in the spring, Saeng is determined to persevere and try again. The flower's beauty and ability to overcome the harsh winter conditions inspire Saeng to keep moving forward, no matter the challenges she may face in her new environment."
1358	10225	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this spring she had made a mistake by buying plants that were over budget, disappointing her mother. She realizes that when spring comes again, she will have another opportunity to do her best and get it right this time. By doing so, she hopes to avoid being a disappointment to her mother in the future.
1359	10226	4	3	The flower helps me with the moving. It reminds me of my hometown. When the geese return and the flower begins to bloom, I will know that I am ready to take the test again. Failing this time is disappointing, but it is just a step in the process. With each attempt, I am getting closer to success. When spring arrives, I will be prepared to face the test once more, knowing that eventually, I will pass.
1360	10227	4	3	"I believe that the author concluded the story ""Winter @CAPS1"" with the paragraph that she did in order to imply that Saeng will not give up. By allowing the audience to know that Saeng was very sad about failing the test, but will take the test again infers that Saeng is a determined person. It is my belief that the concluding paragraph was added to convey the feeling that Saeng was determined despite hardships."
1361	10228	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt. and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The hibiscus represents hope and adapting to circumstances for Saeng, who is struggling to adjust to her new life. She finds solace in the hibiscus, as it reminds her of her homeland and gives her a sense of hope. Despite feeling overwhelmed and unsure of her place in @LOCATION1, planting the hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for Saeng. As the hibiscus grows and prepares to blossom in the spring, Saeng also begins to embrace the idea of accepting her new life and starting anew."
1362	10229	4	3	"Mingfong Ho closes the story with that paragraph because it shows how far Saeng has come and her determination to persevere. The narrator says, ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance"" (Ho). This is when Saeng is recovering from crying, and even though she misses her homeland, she wants to adapt and succeed where she is now. The narrator also said, ""she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again"" (Ho). Being away from her homeland makes Saeng very emotional, but she is determined to stay strong and make the best of her new life. Through her resilience and determination, Saeng is on the path to overcoming her struggles and finding her place in her new surroundings."
1363	10230	4	3	Saeng gazed at the small plant sitting on her windowsill, feeling a sense of peace wash over her. She couldn't explain it, but there was something about the plant that made her believe it would bring her luck. As she watered it gently, she whispered words of encouragement, feeling a connection to the green leaves and delicate stems. In that moment, she knew that this plant would be her source of comfort in times of need, a reminder that even in the darkest of days, there was still hope and beauty to be found. And so, with a smile on her face, Saeng closed her eyes and let the feeling of gratitude and positivity fill her heart, grateful for the simple joy that the plant had brought into her life.
1364	10231	4	3	"I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because in the story, the author says ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season"" which means that seasons will come and seasons will go but she'll always be there, ready to ""take the test."" This indicates that the protagonist's journey is ongoing and that she is prepared to face whatever challenges come her way, showing resilience and determination in the face of uncertainty. The closing paragraph leaves readers with a sense of hope and anticipation for what lies ahead, emphasizing the idea that life is a continuous cycle of growth and change."
1365	10232	4	3	In the spring, when the seasons change and the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, he will take the test again. The vibrant colors of the blooming flowers and the sound of the geese flying overhead will provide a sense of renewal and hope as he prepares for the test once more. The fresh energy of the season will invigorate his mind and spirit, giving him the motivation to approach the test with a positive attitude. With the beauty of spring surrounding him, he will feel inspired to do his best and achieve success in his endeavors.
1366	10233	4	3	The author concludes that failing the test is not the worst thing. She realizes that times change and you can always get another chance, which is explained in the last paragraph that once the hibiscus buds she will take the test again. This perspective shift allows her to see failure as a temporary setback rather than a permanent obstacle. By embracing the idea of second chances, she remains hopeful and motivated to continue pursuing her goals. In the grand scheme of things, one test does not define her capabilities or potential for success. Instead, it serves as a learning opportunity and a stepping stone towards growth and improvement. As the hibiscus buds, symbolizing new beginnings and opportunities, she is ready to face the test once more with a renewed sense of determination and resilience.
1367	10234	4	3	In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This time, I will not give up like that. I will approach it with a renewed determination, knowing that setbacks are just temporary obstacles on the path to success. Just like the changing seasons bring new beginnings, I will embrace the opportunity to try again and prove to myself that I am capable of overcoming challenges. The blooming hibiscus will serve as a reminder of resilience and growth, inspiring me to push forward and achieve my goals.
1368	10235	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 It mean so many things about her in just one little sentence. For example ""take that test again"" she willing to do it all over again @CAPS1 she love it and want to do it. Also when she said ""in spring; when the snows melts and the gesse return and this hibicous is' budding"" from that when you come back and don't forget about all the things she just list. That why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It shows the protagonist's determination and love for what she does, as well as her appreciation for the beauty of nature and the changing seasons. The concluding paragraph leaves a sense of hope and renewal, suggesting that despite any challenges faced, there is always the opportunity for a fresh start and new beginnings."
1369	10236	4	3	This story about believing in yourself and never giving up was a tale of perseverance. Saeng remained steadfast in her belief that she could pass her driver's test, even though she faced disappointment in the end. However, she found solace in the hibiscus flower, which held great significance to her as a connection to her homeland and a symbol of beauty in a challenging time. Adapting to a new country can be difficult, and even the smallest setback can feel overwhelming. Like the hibiscus growing by the highway, Saeng felt a sense of helplessness and isolation. Despite her initial setback, Saeng vowed to retake her driver's test when the hibiscus bloomed in the spring. The hibiscus truly represents Saeng as a person, resilient and determined to overcome obstacles. As she waits for the hibiscus to bloom once again, Saeng remains hopeful and determined to succeed in her future endeavors.
1370	10237	4	3	Saeng found solace in nature after failing her driving test. She sought comfort in purchasing a plant, symbolizing hope and renewal. As she observed the geese leaving and the hibiscus beginning to bud, she felt a sense of reassurance. The cycle of nature reminded her that there will always be another opportunity to try again. With the return of the geese and the blooming of the hibiscus, Saeng found peace in the knowledge that she could attempt the driving test again next year. Nature's constant presence and rhythm provided her with the strength to face challenges with resilience and optimism.
1371	10238	4	3	"As the sun set behind the mountains, Sarah knew that her journey was far from over. She had learned to embrace change and uncertainty, knowing that each season of life brings its own challenges and opportunities. With a heart full of hope and a spirit of resilience, she was ready to face whatever the future held, knowing that she would continue to bloom and grow, just like the flowers in her garden. And as she looked out at the twilight sky, she whispered to herself, ""This is just the beginning."""
1372	10239	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a paragraph that shows Saeng's determination. Saeng struggles to adjust and adapt to the changes in her new life, as seen when she comes home with a flower and is too emotional to speak about it. The flower brings her a sense of security and familiarity from home. The author includes this paragraph to highlight Saeng's growth and resilience. By facing challenges and finding comfort in the familiar, Saeng is preparing herself for future tests with a newfound sense of security. This experience will help her face difficulties with more confidence and strength in the future."

With a renewed sense of purpose, she was ready to tackle whatever obstacles came her way. Saeng's story serves as a reminder to never lose hope and to keep pushing forward, even when the journey seems difficult. Taking a break to regroup and strategize is not a sign of weakness, but rather a smart move to ensure future success. Saeng's perseverance and resilience are a testament to the power of never giving up.
1374	10241	4	3	When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself that in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again. Her determination to improve her grades was evident in her commitment to studying and preparing for the upcoming examination. Saeng understood the importance of perseverance and hard work, knowing that success would come with dedication and effort. As she waited for the right moment to retake the test, she focused on her academics, eagerly anticipating the opportunity to showcase her progress. With each passing day, Saeng grew more confident in her abilities and remained steadfast in her goal to achieve academic success. The changing seasons mirrored her own growth and transformation, symbolizing the renewal and hope that she carried within her as she prepared for the challenge ahead.
1375	10242	4	3	He ends the paragraph with this cause he is meaning to say he would rather take the test again when it is beautiful out. In conclusion, this is why I think the author ends it with this sentence.
1376	10243	4	3	"At the end of the short story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the writer Minfong Ho includes somewhat inspirational concluding sentence ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" I think this sentence was added in order to create a sense of hope for the future, which contrasts so greatly with the depressing nature of the story, creating a happy ending. Throughout the essay, Saeng is depressed she had to leave her homeland so hurriedly losing her childhood and beloved grandmother, ""A blink, a changed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone."" as Saeng narrates in deeper detail. Also contributing to the feelings of sorrow in the story is how much Saeng cries remembering her tragic past. In both the greenhouse, recalling the events of her grandmother such as when she says, ""Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's grey hair Saeng would help knot the hair the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it."" and in the garden, when she talks to her mother and plants the flower. After all this sorrow, by putting in a hopeful ending, the writer has successfully allowed a sense of hope for the future."
1377	10244	4	3	She decided to clone herself and retake the test, fully aware of the consequences of failing again. The thought of disappointing her mother weighed heavily on her mind, knowing that it could strain their relationship even further. She believed that her repeated failures were linked to her past experiences and her deep affection for her new country, which she found difficult to balance. Despite the challenges she faced, she found solace in memories of her homeland, which provided her with comfort and strength. In her quest to succeed, she was determined to overcome any obstacles that came her way and prove to herself and her loved ones that she was capable of achieving her goals.
1378	10245	4	3	The author concludes the story with that quote for one main reason. That reason is that it shows that the girl has hope. In a story one of the best qualities a character can have is hope because it makes the reader interested and helps provide a good morale for the Story. That is why the author concludes the story with that quote. The girl's hopeful attitude in the face of adversity leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and possibility for the future. Hope is a powerful tool that can drive a character to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals, making it a crucial element in storytelling. By ending the story with a message of hope, the author leaves a lasting impression on the reader and reinforces the idea that no matter how difficult the circumstances may be, there is always a glimmer of hope to hold on to.
1379	10246	4	3	"The author of this story created the last paragraph so that it finishes the story with a great ending. The fact of never giving up and try again and again. The author said, ""I will take the test again."" In the story Saeng said, ""I failed the test"" but now that she isn't giving up. This last paragraph makes a lot of sense and is needed to make this story complete. So just as others don't give up in @LOCATION1, Saeng is doing the same and is retaking the test."
1380	10247	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. With a steely determination in her eyes, she knew that this time she would not let fear or doubt hold her back. The failure of the past would serve as fuel for her future success. As she watched the world come back to life around her, Saeng felt a renewed sense of purpose and drive. This time, she was ready to face the challenge head-on and prove to herself that she was capable of achieving anything she set her mind to. The budding hibiscus symbolized not just the coming of spring, but also the blossoming of her own potential. Saeng was determined to bloom just like the flowers around her, stronger and more beautiful after enduring the harsh winter.
1381	10248	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending. It ties up loose ends and leaves the reader with a sense of closure. The paragraph may offer a final reflection on the events that have unfolded or provide a moral lesson to take away from the story. Ultimately, the conclusion serves to leave a lasting impression on the reader and ensure that the story is remembered.
1382	10249	4	3	The plant was important to Saeng because it was from her homeland. Saeng mentioned that she would retake her driver's test once her plant bloomed. The plant served as a reminder of her roots and where she came from, providing her with a sense of confidence. Saeng had faced difficult times, and the plant held special significance as it connected her to her native land.
1383	10250	4	3	"I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder. I think this because if you put into context the word ""test"", it could mean many things. For example it could mean the test to overcome the sadness of her situation. Also it could mean the test to adjust to her new home when the spring comes. That is why I think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph."
1384	10251	4	3	Saeng, after seeing the winter hibiscus, found solace in the strength and resilience of the flower. Just like the hibiscus, she realized that she could adapt and thrive despite the challenges she faced. With a newfound sense of determination, Saeng decided to face her struggles head-on and strive to do her best in school. She understood that just like the winter hibiscus, she may not have it easy, but she could be strong enough to overcome any obstacles that came her way. By drawing inspiration from the winter hibiscus, Saeng embarked on a journey of growth and resilience, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
1385	10252	4	3	She said that because she was more interested in flowers than a test. Her love for flowers surpassed any concern for the test at hand, showing where her true passion lay. This prioritization of beauty over academic performance indicated a deep connection to the natural world and a desire to engage with it on a personal level. By choosing to focus on flowers instead of the test, she demonstrated a commitment to her own interests and values, even in the face of external expectations. This decision highlighted the importance of following one's passions and pursuing what truly brings joy and fulfillment, regardless of societal pressures. Ultimately, her choice to prioritize flowers over the test reflected a strong sense of self-awareness and a willingness to stay true to herself.
1386	10253	4	3	I believe that the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows the ending of one thing and the beginning of another. After she is upset and thinks about home she realizes that something new is happening and she needs to accept it. So therefore in the spring she is going to start new like the flower blossom. This change symbolizes growth, renewal, and the opportunity for a fresh start. Just as the flower blooms anew each spring, she is ready to embrace the changes in her life and move forward with a positive outlook. It signifies a turning point and a sense of optimism for what lies ahead.
1387	10254	4	3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants to emphasize that the character is determined to take her time and make the right decisions rather than rushing into things. She understands the importance of being patient and thorough in order to achieve success. This approach reflects her commitment to doing things properly and not taking shortcuts. By choosing this path, she demonstrates her maturity and wisdom, showing that she is willing to put in the effort required to reach her goals.

1388	10255	4	3	It shows the importance of the Hibiscus to Saeng and her dedication to the flower. It is also stating that she will wait for next spring to admire the flower again. Saeng's love for the Hibiscus is evident in the way she eagerly anticipates its bloom each year. She finds solace and joy in the beauty of the flower, patiently waiting for its vibrant petals to grace her garden once more. Despite the passing seasons, Saeng's commitment to the Hibiscus remains unwavering, symbolizing her deep connection to nature and the simple pleasures it brings. Come springtime, she will once again bask in the presence of her beloved flower, appreciating its beauty with renewed admiration and gratitude.
1389	10256	4	3	I am taking this test because I want to find out if this place will feel like home to me next year. It's a big decision, but I believe that it's important to listen to my instincts and follow my heart. I am excited to see what the future holds and I am hopeful that this test will provide me with the clarity I need to make the right choice. Next year will bring new beginnings and opportunities, and I am ready to embrace whatever comes my way. I am eager to discover where I truly belong and where I can build a future filled with happiness and fulfillment.
1390	10257	4	3	When the author concluded the narrative by when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles, finding comfort in a time of disappointment, and her connection to her past experiences. First, it demostrates the ability to overcome obstacles because they are obstacles in everyone lives, and you donít have a choice to conquer them because there are unlimited. So the hibiscus flower represents the obsticles and the weather represent time because weather is stopping the flower to bloom and bloosom. Secondly, it also represent the finding of comfot in a time of disappointment because when you have going through an obstacle you would find disappointment there lingering. However she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back and she have the awareness of the obstacles coming back. Finally, it asserts her connection to her past experience because she is trapped in a world that she is not familiar with, which would make her an alien. She capture the sense of being out of place, because you can relate that the hiatcus flower would be her because she is eccentric and different from the rest of the people in her environment she is trying to adapt her way of living and trying to survive in the world, like when she was in her own country.
1391	10258	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because this paragraph represents Saeng's determination and the situation she is in now. She has just arrived in a new country and has yet to adjust to her new surroundings. Feeling disappointed, she compares her emotions to the aftermath of war under starlight. The mention of ""war"" conveys the depth of her sadness. However, upon encountering the flower, memories of her homeland flood back, filling her with hope once more. While she knows she must adapt to her new life, she is still fragile and unable to express her feelings fully. Overwhelmed, she breaks down in tears, longing for her homeland, depicted metaphorically as ""snows"". Yet, she believes in her ability to overcome adversity and finds solace in the symbol of ""spring"", signifying renewal and the promise of a better future. Saeng's resolve to succeed shines through, leading the author to use this paragraph as a conclusion, emphasizing hope and the potential for a brighter tomorrow."
1392	10259	4	3	"The author included this because she felt that since Saeng failed the test that maybe she should be given a second chance because she tried so hard before. When Saeng says ""Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it."" It made her mom upset because she used a lot of money for one plant just so she could feel at home again since she had one when she was at her old home. Eventually, her mom says, ""It's a beautiful plant"" to make her feel better because she feels bad for how she acted towards her daughter. After all the things Saeng had to go through is the reason the author added the last passage into the story."
1393	10260	4	3	Saeng's determination to pass the test burned brighter than ever before. Failure was not an option for her; she would keep trying until her last breath if necessary. The challenge ahead seemed daunting, but Saeng was not one to back down easily. She would continue to push herself beyond her limits, fueled by her unwavering resolve. The story of Saeng's perseverance would be one for the ages, a tale of resilience and tenacity that would inspire others to never give up on their dreams. Saeng's journey was far from over; she was ready to face whatever obstacles came her way with courage and an unshakeable spirit.
1394	10261	4	3	The authors purpose of this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return she will have to again take care of the plant. Thats clear because taking a test is a big responsibility therefore taking care of that plant is also a huge task refering  to taking the test again. this is what the purpose of the concluding sentence meant. Additionally, she knows that just like the plant requires consistent care and attention to flourish, her academic success also demands ongoing effort and dedication. Just as the changing seasons bring new challenges for the plant, each academic year will bring new tests and hurdles for her to overcome. The cyclical nature of caring for the plant mirrors the cyclical nature of academic growth and learning, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and resilience in both endeavors. In this way, the conclusion serves to underscore the parallel between nurturing a plant and nurturing one's academic potential, highlighting the continuous commitment required for success in both.
1395	10262	4	3	Because planting flowers and tending to the garden is a hobby that brings @CAPS1 joy and clarity of mind, it is important for her to wait until her family returns before working on it. Engaging in her hobby not only makes her happy but also allows her to be more productive in her creative pursuits. By waiting for her family to come back, she can fully enjoy her time in the garden and feel more inspired to focus on her work. This simple act of patience will ultimately lead to a more fulfilling and productive outcome for @CAPS1.
1396	10263	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she saying when everything gets back to normal thatís when she is going to take the test again. Second, because there would be nothing else to say if it is not back to the way she wanted it to be. For instance, if you were building an house and a blizzared came, you would stop, you said that you would not continue until there was nice weather again. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.
1397	10264	4	3	"The author of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho, ended the story in a way to show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to the theme by saying, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty but it's strong enough to make it through the winter. That's what matters."" Her words are a metaphor for the family starting their lives again in @LOCATION1. The budding hibiscus could be considered as a symbol of rebirth, dying and growing with the seasons. The family is transitioning from a @CAPS1 family to an @CAPS2 one, but they have not lost their heritage. Just like the flower that is both @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, they are resilient and will thrive in their new beginning."
1398	10265	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will persevere through the winter and try to adapt to her new lifestyle. Moving to a new country/culture is extremely tough, and Saeng is determined to not give up on creating a new life in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test,"" is one of determination and hope. The entire story shows Saeng struggling with adapting to her new environment, but her memories of her homeland give her a sense of security. The sentence wraps up her emotions and shows how strong she is. Saeng could easily give up on the driving test, but she won't. It is a happy ending for what was somewhat of a sad story. The sentence further shows Saeng's dedication to her plants. This hibiscus will survive, and so will Saeng. When the hibiscus blooms in the spring, so will Saeng. She will try as hard as she can to fit in and enjoy her new life. That plant will help her through it by reminding her of Vietnam as well as giving her a companion throughout the winter. The author could not have chosen a better conclusion for this story. The conclusion brings new hope for Saeng to persevere and succeed. As a result, the reader is left with a sense of pleasure and a positive feeling towards the story. This conclusion shows how Saeng is adapting to her new environment and hopes to enjoy her new life in @LOCATION1."
1399	10266	4	3	"The story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and breaking down about her ""home"" where she no longer lived. After she had broke down, bought the plant, and learned to actually accept the fact that she no longer lived in Vietnam and accepting that she had failed her driving test, she realized that she just has to learn to like it. She also learned that her time will come and she will one day be driving. The reason why the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because this is the conclusion of the story. This is where one realizes the important things. She understood that sometimes things don't go as planned, but eventually, with patience and perseverance, everything will fall into place. This realization brought her peace and a sense of hope for the future, knowing that better days are ahead. The girl walked with a newfound sense of acceptance and optimism, ready to face whatever challenges may come her way, confident that she will overcome them in due time."
1400	10267	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng vows silently to herself to take the driver's test again. The sight of the geese flying in a ""V"" and the presence of the hibiscus plant trigger memories of her homeland, making her miss Vietnam. However, the hibiscus also symbolizes reassurance to Saeng, telling her that it is okay to miss her past life while embracing her new one. As spring approaches, Saeng decides to retake the driver's test with a renewed sense of determination and acceptance, ready to move forward with her life in her new home."
1401	10268	4	3	The author used that paragraph to evoke vivid imagery and convey her emotions. As she described the colorful sunset painting the sky with hues of orange, pink, and purple, she wanted the readers to envision the beauty of nature unfolding before their eyes. The way she depicted the sun slowly dipping below the horizon and casting a warm glow over the landscape was meant to transport the audience to that serene moment. Through her words, the author aimed to create a sensory experience that would resonate with the readers and leave a lasting impression of the scene in their minds.
1402	10269	4	3	Saeng was determined to ace the test next time. She knew that with more preparation and focus, she could improve her score significantly. As she watered her beloved plant, she made a promise to herself to study harder and not give up. Saeng was looking forward to the day when she would reunite with her plant, knowing that she would have passed the test with flying colors. The thought of seeing her plant thrive and grow alongside her success fueled her determination to succeed. With renewed motivation, Saeng set her sights on the future, ready to face any challenges that came her way.
1403	10270	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least she could hold on to. And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar too.
1404	10271	4	3	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho ends the story with a sign of hope. Saeng, the protagonist, decides to start over when the world begins anew in spring. She purchases a hibiscus plant as a symbol of remembrance for her homeland and a reminder to try again when the time is right. The hibiscus blooms when it is ready, signaling a new beginning.

The story concludes with a sense of optimism for the future as Saeng embraces the idea of starting fresh in the spring."

Shows how she feel without them and how she will feel when they return and how she will carry on where they left off last time as shown when she says ì, Then I will take that test againî.
1406	10273	4	3	I think it was a good enough by Minfong Ho. Throughout the story, you feel somewhat happy, and somewhat sad, but always calm. You feel happy when they are talking about all the plants and when her mother accepts the plants when she bought. At first, when you think the mom is going to yell at her for buying that, after she failed her test. You feel bad for her but still calm mood and show the girl want give up, but just take her time.
1407	10274	4	3	In the conclusion of the story, the author states that she is determined to retake the test and pass this time around. She mentions that she will do so in the spring, when the snows have melted, the geese have returned, and the hibiscus is budding. This indicates a sense of renewal and growth, symbolizing her own journey towards success. The upcoming season aligns with her mindset of starting fresh and approaching the test with a newfound determination. The mention of the hibiscus blooming signifies the potential for her own abilities to flourish and thrive. Overall, the author's decision to retake the test in the spring reflects her optimism and resilience in the face of previous setbacks.
1408	10275	4	3	"Saeng's mother listened attentively as her daughter confessed about failing the test. Despite feeling disappointed, her mother comforted her and asked about the plant she had brought home. Saeng explained that she had purchased it with her own money, hoping it would bring her some comfort after the setback. The plant seemed to symbolize a sense of hope for Saeng, as she expressed her determination to retake the test. With newfound motivation, she declared, ""Then I will take that test again."" This decision marked a turning point for Saeng, indicating her resilience and willingness to overcome challenges. As she nurtured the plant and prepared for another attempt at the test, there was a sense of optimism in the air, hinting at a brighter future ahead."
1409	10276	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wants to show the readers that Saeng will want to pass her driver's license test. Saeng failed her driver's license test and was saddened by it. However, when she found a flower that made her feel better, she realized that she could try again. This demonstrates her determination to succeed after facing disappointment. The inclusion of this final paragraph suggests that Saeng will persevere and eventually pass her driver's license test in the future.
1410	10277	4	3	"In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with Saeng saying ""when they come back in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author chose to end the story this way to give it a positive ending. The rest of the story is sad because Saeng misses her home in Vietnam. ""Its ñ itís not a real one. I mean, itís not like the kind we had at ñ at ñ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Not like the ones we had before."" The end sends the message that even though things are different than before, she wonít give up trying to make a good life in the United States and not let this change affect her."
1411	10278	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to know that she will regain her confidence when the ""hibiscus is budding"" and take another slot at the driving test. He doesn't want to just leave us hanging with the girl watching the geese fly away into the distance. The girl felt very bad about failing the test which makes the reader feel sad. To cheer up the reader, he ended the story in this way. Saeng is reminded of home when ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" So, the author ends the story having Saeng have a sense of renewed confidence and the reader feeling happy."
1412	10279	4	3	The author concludes the story with that because she is determined to succeed in @LOCATION1. She misses her homeland and everything there: gardens, grandparents, etc. For example, she walked into the flowershop she smells the flowers like she used to back home. She then smelled a flower that reminded her of her grandmothers ìlong gray hair, freshly washed Öî But by saying that last sentence she said that when the hibiscus budded next winter she will take the test that she failed again. She is determined to keep trying and not give up on her dreams, no matter how challenging the journey may be.
1413	10280	4	3	"When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. The girl is upset because she doesn't have the real flower her mom had. ""It's not a real one,"" Saeng mumbled, ""I mean, not like the kind we had at- at."" She was upset and afraid that her mother was going to be angry with her that she started to shake. ""I know,"" her mother said quietly. ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake."" The author is just showing that the girl is going to try again next time."
1414	10281	4	3	"The author concludes the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with that paragraph because he wants to convey to the reader that Saeng will not give up. Saeng, who moved from Vietnam with her family, has struggled to adapt to the changes in her new home. She deeply longs for her homeland and the vibrant flowers that once filled her life. Describing how the winter hibiscus in her new surroundings pales in comparison to those in Vietnam, she decides to plant this different variety and postpone taking her driving test until spring. This decision reflects Saeng's determination to face her challenges head-on, but also her willingness to set them aside temporarily, choosing to confront them in a more favorable season. By ending the story in this manner, the author emphasizes Saeng's resilience and her commitment to overcoming adversity, one step at a time."
1415	10282	4	3	I thank he uses it because she wants to get another one next year to see what it's like to like something so much and get to look after it for a while. That is why I think the narrator uses that phrase as his last one. This suggests that the narrator values the experience of caring for something and wants to explore that feeling further by getting another one in the future. It shows a sense of attachment and curiosity towards the object, indicating a desire for continued growth and exploration in the future.
1416	10283	4	3	The author concludes this story with the paragraph she did because it shows how Saeng is adapting with the change she is going through in Vietnam. The winter hibiscus helped her when she was feeling down after failing her driving test, so Saeng believes it will bring her luck when she takes it again. As she tends to the hibiscus and works towards her goal, it will continue to grow and develop. When the flower finally blooms, it will symbolize strength and resilience, qualities that will help Saeng overcome this obstacle. Although her mother remarked that the flower may not be as visually striking as others, it will endure and flourish. This parallels Saeng's own journey - she may not be in a place as grand as Vietnam, but she will persevere and stay strong.
1417	10284	4	3	The purpose for ending the story with Saeng finding comfort in the hibiscus plant is to show her transformation from feeling lost and lacking confidence to feeling at home and secure. The hibiscus serves as a constant reminder of her old home and happier times, helping her create new memories in her new environment. It symbolizes her growth and adaptation, giving her a sense of familiarity and comfort in a place that initially felt strange. With the hibiscus by her side, Saeng is able to find solace and peace as she navigates through the seasons of life.
1418	10285	4	3	@PERSON1 go to the top of the hill and then over the hill. Enjoy the view from the peak before descending down the other side for a different perspective.
1419	10286	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. Ho states, ""Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits,"" This shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead it shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, Ho states, ""Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" she is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and become somehow like a new person."
1420	10287	4	3	Saeng could feel the warmth of the sun on her petals, giving her hope for the future. Despite the harsh winter that had stripped her of her beauty, she was determined to bloom once again. With each passing day, she would nourish her roots and stretch towards the light, knowing that her efforts would not be in vain. As the seasons changed, Saeng's vibrant colors began to return, a testament to her resilience and unwavering spirit. She would continue to push through adversity, knowing that with perseverance and determination, she could achieve anything she set her mind to. And so, with each new spring, Saeng would stand tall and proud, a symbol of strength and perseverance for all to admire.
1421	10288	4	3	This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people, so it is appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the entire reading, Saeng sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as flowers and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurting and disappointed, and those things were the only things that gave her peace. It was those things that gave her the courage she needed to retake her driverís test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country. She says, ìwhen they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...î At first, the sounds of geese were alien to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country, which is the perfect way to end the story.
1422	10289	4	3	The author concludes the story this way because in the winter time she won't be able to see the hibiscus. She is used to going outside in the garden and seeing her beautiful plant. It brings her joy and comfort, and without it, she will miss a piece of her daily routine. The hibiscus has become a significant part of her life, and its absence will leave a void in her heart. As the winter approaches, she knows that she will have to wait patiently for the return of spring, when she can once again enjoy the vibrant blooms of her beloved hibiscus. The changing seasons remind her of the cyclical nature of life and the importance of appreciating the beauty that surrounds us.
1423	10290	4	3	In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adjust but she misses her old home too much. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again. Saeng's determination to make her new home feel like home shows her resilience and strength in the face of change. Although it may be difficult, she is willing to give it another try, demonstrating her willingness to adapt and embrace new beginnings.
1424	10291	4	3	The author concludes the story with the idea that she is determined to live up to her past and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader wondering if she successfully navigated her challenges in the following year. The mention of the snow melting and geese returning symbolizes change, mirroring her own desire for growth and transformation. Just like a plant can evolve and flourish, she aims to do the same, embracing change and overcoming obstacles in her path. The author effectively conveys the message that with determination and resilience, one can adapt and thrive amidst life's inevitable changes.
1425	10292	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She sees herself reflected in the blooming hibiscus, waiting patiently for the right time to blossom just like the flower. The return of the geese symbolizes a sense of homecoming, a familiar presence that gives her the strength and determination to try again. With each passing season, she grows closer to achieving her goal, just like the hibiscus slowly unfurling its petals. Saeng's determination and resilience shine through as she waits for the perfect moment to prove herself once more.
1426	10293	4	3	In winter hibiscus the teenager girl Saeng fails her driverís test, and then runs into a winter hibiscus and comes in touch with her memories. The author concludes the story with re-trying the test when the geese return and hibiscus buds to show comfort & familiarity. When the speaker says ìalmost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had becomeî This example shows that she had lost touch with the realness of nature and that was what was going to get her to pass the test. The author sets an impatient mood for the reader because it took her for winter to discover this, and winter is when its too late, the geese have left and the flower has closed, so when spring comes theyíll be open to new opportunities and so will she with the familiarity around her.
1427	10294	4	3	I think she concluded with this statement because she doesnít know if she will pass but she isnít giving up on the test and will try to pass it again when her flower grows back. Right now she feels bad and the plant helped to cheer her up so when she sees the plant next year she wants to take the test. The plant is like a sign of good luck. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it leaves you with the idea not to give up when times are hard keep trying.
1428	10295	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. One of the reason is so the reader could imagein what rest of the story would be like if it continued. For example when the author said ìthen I will take that test again.î Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story. For example when the author said ìwhen the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddingî. Those were reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
1429	10296	4	3	The author concludes the story like this because when the snow is melting and the plant is budding and the geese come back then she will take the test again. This is a way for her to really think when she is going to do this again. When they come back, so will she, to take the test over again. This cycle of nature serves as a reminder for her to revisit her goals and aspirations, aligning her actions with the changing seasons as she continues on her journey of growth and self-discovery.
1430	10297	4	3	"In the story Saeng vowed silently to herself, ""When the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again."" For some reason I think that is a fine idea Saeng vowed, showing determination to try again when the conditions are more favorable. This decision reflects Saeng's resilience and willingness to keep striving for her goals, even in the face of initial setbacks. By setting a specific time frame based on nature's cycle, Saeng demonstrates patience and a strategic approach to achieving success. When the right moment comes, Saeng will be ready to tackle the test with renewed confidence and determination."
1431	10298	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî probably chose to end the story that way because then itís ending with a sense of hope. Also, it is showing how Saeng is adapting to her surroundings much like the winter hibiscus. In the second last paragraph, Saeng hears the hanks of the geese and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to her through the course of the time Saeng probably vowed to retake the test when the geese returned because the time would allow her to grow and adapt even more. The hibiscus will be budding then, a sign that it overcame its obstacles and was successful in adopting. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too. She could look to the plant for inspiration. This feeling of hope in Saeng and her future is left in the last paragraph, which is why the story ends there.
1432	10299	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph to the story because, seasons change, plant donít most likely grow during winter time. So you learn a lesson and take it as it is and a wait until the next time you learn basically the same lesson, when the right time comes. As the cycle of seasons continues, we must remember that growth and change take time. Just like plants need the right conditions to flourish, we too must be patient and wait for the right moment to learn and grow. Patience and perseverance are key as we navigate the seasons of life, always remembering that the right time will come for us to bloom.
1433	10300	4	3	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author emphasizes the importance of perseverance and hard work. The paragraph at the end of the story, where the protagonist declares, ""I will take the test again,"" reinforces the idea that one should not give up in the face of failure. Instead, it encourages the reader to keep trying and to never lose hope. This message of resilience and determination is a powerful reminder to keep pushing forward, no matter the challenges that may arise. Ultimately, the story serves as a motivational tale about the value of persistence and the rewards that come from never giving up."
1434	10301	4	3	In the end, the old man realized that true happiness comes from within. He had spent years searching for joy in material possessions and worldly pursuits, only to discover that it was the simple moments of connection with loved ones that brought him the most fulfillment. As he sat surrounded by his family, he understood that love and relationships were the true treasures in life. And so, he embraced this newfound wisdom, cherishing each moment and finding contentment in the present rather than constantly seeking it in the future.
1435	10302	4	3	The story is somewhat sad. The girl misses her homeland. She is also sad because she failed her driving test. The author I think ends the story with the girl saying she will take the test again, to show that even though she is sad about her country and failing she is not going to give up. Failing a test especially a driving test stinks. Your very excited to get it but then you donít. So the author is trying to show that despite the girls sadness she will not give up. The girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes. Also the author probably wanted to leave on a more positive note you usually donít want to leave a story sad with no solution. So she said she would try the test again. There were many reasons why the author ended the way she did but above are the more obvious.
1436	10303	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the phrase ""when they come back in the spring"" indicates Saeng's determination to adapt to her new life in the new land. Despite facing challenges, she expresses her intent to keep trying, such as retaking her driver's license test. Saeng's persistence and courage shine through as she plans to face the obstacles head-on and continue working towards her goals."
1437	10304	4	3	Saeng was eagerly awaiting the arrival of spring so that she could retake the test. She seemed concerned about the upcoming season as she spent her time watching the geese fly in a u-shape formation and eagerly observing the plants waiting to bloom, despite the snow not having melted yet. She started talking to herself, expressing her desire to retake the test during the spring and hoping that she would pass it this time. Saeng was determined not to have to retake the test repeatedly, as she disliked the idea of going through the process over and over again. She wondered what everyone else would be doing once the test was finally over, eagerly anticipating the different activities and experiences that awaited them post-exam.
1438	10305	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, Saeng, who recently moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, returns home feeling dejected after failing her driver's test. She believes her failure reflects her inability to adapt to her new life, disappointing both her mother and herself. Trying to console her mother, Saeng buys a flower from Vietnam, a winter Hibiscus, which her mother begins to plant. Witnessing her mother's forgiveness through the act of planting the flower, Saeng realizes her own capacity to adapt to her new environment, just like the winter Hibiscus. Encouraged by this realization, she resolves to retake the driver's test in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng's promise to persevere and not give up, the author highlights her courage and determination to embrace change and overcome challenges."
1439	10306	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is not giving up and she will take the test again. Despite facing setbacks, she remains determined to persevere and grow from the experience. This resilience and positive attitude will likely lead to future success and personal growth.
1440	10307	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng is saying she is learning to adapt to this country. Earlier in the story she says that she failed the test, because she did not impress her mom. Saeng and her mom are used to life in Vietnam, they trying to adapt. Saeng thought that the hibiscus she got Is just like the one she had at home. At the end she realizes if she just has faith everything will be okay and it will be just like home. She says in the spring because by then her hibiscus will be fully growned and she will take the test again to see if the hibiscus is like the one her mother thought she would get. Saeng is learning to adapt to her new country of the United States.
1441	10308	4	3	"The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perseverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the ""test"" again, which refers to Saeng's confrontation of memories of home without breaking down from loss. Saeng previously admitted to failing the test by crying when reminded of familiar plants from home. By ending with the statement that she will take the test again, it shows Saeng's determination to adapt to her new home and find peace, instead of dwelling on her past sorrow. This demonstrates the theme of perseverance as Saeng commits to overcoming her sadness and embracing her new surroundings."
1442	10309	4	3	The girl is determined to win. She went and took a test for a flower, but unfortunately, she did not pass. Feeling sad and emotional, she went back to her grandmother and expressed her disappointment. She told her grandmother that these flowers were not like the ones at home, but she couldn't articulate the reason why as it brought back painful memories. Her grandmother comforted her, explaining that the flowers she tested were not like the real ones.
1443	10310	4	3	"In this story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" In the beginning of the story, she was less confident and she failed the test. But this one flower gave her hope and so next time she takes the test sheíll be better prepared. The hibiscus symbolizes resilience and growth, reminding Saeng that with perseverance and determination, she can overcome challenges. It serves as a source of motivation for her to continue striving for success, even in the face of setbacks. Saeng's determination to try again reflects her newfound confidence and belief in her abilities. As the hibiscus blooms in the spring, so too does Saeng's determination and commitment to succeed in the future."
1444	10311	4	3	In conclusion, the author's decision to end the essay in such a way was strategic in tying all the scattered ideas together. The reader is left with a sense of resolution as they consider the protagonist's determination to retake the test in the spring. This final statement hints at a new beginning and sets the stage for potential growth and development in the character's journey. The author's choice of closing line effectively leaves the reader with a sense of anticipation and hope for what is to come.
1445	10312	4	3	I think the author ended the story with that sentence because every winter all or most plants die off, and during the spring they would have to start all over in growing this plant. This cyclical process of growth and decay is a natural part of the life cycle of plants, symbolizing the constant renewal and rebirth that occurs in the natural world. By ending the story with this sentence, the author highlights the resilience and perseverance of nature, reminding us of the endless cycle of life that continues to unfold season after season.
1446	10313	4	3	The author ends the story this way because they're trying to show that Saeng will be dedicated to the hibiscus gardening and once she proves herself she will have passed the test. It also shows that she wants her heritage to be a major part of her life by growing their nation's flower. Saeng's commitment to the hibiscus garden symbolizes her connection to her roots and her determination to uphold her cultural traditions. Through her hard work and perseverance, Saeng is not only embracing her heritage but also ensuring that it thrives for generations to come. This ending highlights the importance of staying true to one's identity and honoring the legacy of those who came before.
1447	10314	4	3	"The author ends the story with this quote, because it shows how determined Saeng is to passing her driving test. For example, in the story, ""Winter Hibiscus"", Saeng after she fails her driving test says something to forget about failing, and she said, ""Let’s plant, right now"", she said this because she was trying to forget about her failing, and focus on something positive. In conclusion, this is why the author ends with this quote, and an example of how determined and focused Saeng is to passing her driving test."
1448	10315	4	3	The author concluded the story the way they did because it left hope. Saeng had been hurt and disappointed, but in the end, she had shown hope. In the story, Saeng failed her driving test and was very disappointed. However, in the end, it showed she was not going to quit in this new country. She was going to move on and make the best of what she has. This ending provided a sense of resilience and determination in the face of adversity, giving readers a glimmer of hope for Saeng's future in her new surroundings.
1449	10316	4	3	I think that the author concludes with this paragraph because she is determined to complete and pass the test. One reason is that she failed this year and wants to pass next year. Additionally, she is comparing the hibiscus to her passing and succeeding on the test. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
1450	10317	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is determined to keep her next plant after selling the previous one. She expresses her intention to retake the test, indicating her strong attachment to the plant she had to let go of. Saeng's emotional connection to the plant, which she had seen as a child, motivates her to ensure she can care for her next plant more effectively. By ending the story with this resolution, the author highlights Saeng's commitment to nurturing and preserving her plants, hinting at a hopeful future for her botanical endeavors.
1451	10318	4	3	The author concludes the story by suggesting that Saeng may have a chance to succeed on her second attempt, much like how the hibiscus will bloom again when spring arrives. By waiting for the geese to return and the hibiscus to bud, Saeng shows her appreciation for nature and the cycle of life. This implies that she believes in the possibility of growth and renewal, even after facing initial challenges. Saeng's connection to the hibiscus symbolizes her resilience and hope for a better outcome in the future.
1452	10319	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng is trying to adjust to a new life in a new location after coming from Vietnam. She feels sad and homesick, especially after failing her drivers test. While walking past a store, she sees a plant that reminds her of home and decides to buy it. Bringing the plant home in a pot, Saeng reminisces about the memories she shared with similar plants back in Vietnam. Her mother joins her, sharing a moment of connection and comfort. Saeng feels a sense of solace. As she looks at the hibiscus plant, she silently vows to herself that when spring comes and the snow melts, she will take the drivers test again. The flower has given her the confidence to try again and move forward, holding onto her memories while overcoming her pain."
1453	10320	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, ""and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept."" Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But when the geese fly by the author brought the story to a conclusion to show how the experience has made Saeng grow. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again."" I think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story, she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home."
1454	10321	4	3	I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like itís going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when sheíll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus ìcomes back to lifeíí. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good sheíll feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying. So practically sheís stating once everything ìcome back to lifeî then sheíll feel like she will pass it next time. Now she can be prepared.
1455	10322	4	3	There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. One reason is she likes hibiscus flowers, as indicated by her gentle touch on a petal. Another reason is their beauty, which she describes as entering another world. Lastly, she appreciates the presence of the flowers in the environment, noting their various shades and shapes that grow in a seemingly random yet beautiful profusion. These reasons together contribute to why the author chose to end the story with a paragraph focused on the enchanting hibiscus flowers.
1456	10323	4	3	"The author of this story was smart to end it by saying she will take the test again in the spring when everything blooms. This girl just failed her driving test and she does not want to take it right away. The blooming of the hibiscus symbolizes her old life at her old home and also symbolizes a new start when it blooms. This will give her the confidence to pass her driving test and make her excited to get a new start on the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return."" This quote from this paragraph states that the snow will melt away and the geese will come back home, just like she wants to go home and feels comfortable. At home, you are comfortable. The author ended this story of this girl, Saeng, with hope and drive to do what she wants to do. That is why it was smart to end the story like they ended it. And as the hibiscus blooms in the spring, Saeng will also bloom with newfound confidence and determination to succeed."
1457	10324	4	3	The hibiscus, as the author reveals to the audience, is a beautiful flower that symbolizes encouragement and comfort in the story. It represents the memories of a young girl who is struggling with feelings of depression after failing a test. The girl, Saeng, is determined to overcome her sadness and prove that she can succeed. The flower serves as a reminder that with perseverance and determination, one can overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. Life may present challenges, but it is important not to give up and keep working hard towards success. In the end, overcoming failures and setbacks is a natural part of life, and it is essential to stay motivated and persistent in order to achieve success.
1458	10325	4	3	"In the Story the @CAPS1 concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think he ends it this way because she has accepted that she failed or lost but is willing to try again to accomplish her goal and ""take that test again."" Also she is making a promise, or a vow to herself and to not give up on her goal."
1459	10326	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because they both go together in the way they are both about things coming to an end and the season changing. It's like they don't want to let go, but they know they will be back soon. The bittersweet feeling of saying goodbye is mixed with the hope of a future reunion, creating a sense of longing and anticipation in the reader's mind. The changing seasons mirror the changing emotions of the characters, adding depth and complexity to the narrative. It's a poignant reminder that all good things must come to an end, but there is always the promise of new beginnings on the horizon.
1460	10327	4	3	"The author is expressing hope for the future in her concluding paragraph. Although just failing her driver's test and adjusting to a new atmosphere, Saeng finds comfort in a Hibiscus. ""It felt smooth and cool with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel."" This expresses that the remembrance of ""an old friend"" was able to lift her spirits after a previous disappointment. It was obvious Saeng was uncomfortable in her environment, which her mother noticed when she arrived at home. ""She paused as she noticed the tear stains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes."" Her daughter was not adjusting to her new atmosphere, and even though she had spent a lot of money on a single flower, she understood. With all the negative attitudes throughout the story, once Saeng saw the geese and planted her ""winter"" hibiscus, she realized what was strange to her before had now become familiar. Saeng finally realizes that with a memory of home, her goals can be accomplished, and life can be stable somewhere other than home. She illustrates that from failure comes success. Saeng's journey of adjusting to a new atmosphere and finding comfort in a Hibiscus shows that with determination and a touch of familiarity, one can overcome challenges and find success in unexpected places."
1461	10328	4	3	Saeng doesn't want the whole room to herself when she is taking the test because she prefers the quiet environment. She finds solace in the peacefulness of an empty room, allowing her to focus and concentrate without any distractions. The silence helps her think clearly and perform to the best of her abilities. With only the sound of her pencil scratching against the paper, Saeng feels in control and at ease. The empty room becomes her sanctuary, a place where she can fully immerse herself in the task at hand. As she completes the test in solitude, Saeng feels a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, knowing that she gave it her all.
1462	10329	4	3	She is saying that right now is not the right time to take the test. She plans to wait until spring when the flowers are blooming to do so. She is very passionate about exotic flowers and wants to wait for the perfect timing. The idea of taking the test now when the time isn't right is something she cannot bear. Therefore, she has decided to hold off until the timing aligns with the blooming of the flowers in spring.
1463	10330	4	3	Saeng is looking forward to taking the test in the spring when the weather is warmer. She especially enjoys the scent of budding hibiscus flowers, as it reminds her of her home country. Additionally, Saeng has a fondness for fried melon, which leaves a delightful golden aftertaste on her tongue. She even imagines pouring it over a Big Mac for an interesting twist in flavor. The anticipation of spring, the fragrance of hibiscus, and the unique taste of fried melon all bring a sense of comfort and nostalgia to Saeng as she prepares for her upcoming test.
1464	10331	4	3	After all that had happened, it was clear to me that forgiveness was the only way to move forward. Holding onto anger and resentment would only continue to poison my heart and soul. By choosing to forgive, I was not excusing the actions of others or saying that what they did was okay. Instead, I was releasing myself from the burden of carrying around that negativity. I was choosing to let go of the past and open myself up to a future filled with peace and possibility. In the end, forgiveness was not a sign of weakness, but rather a symbol of strength and resilience. And as I stood there, feeling the weight of the world lift off my shoulders, I knew that I had made the right choice.
1465	10332	4	3	The author included that concluding paragraph because the hibiscus shows Saeng comfort in her time of discomfort. She would possibly feel more comfortable when the hibiscus is budding because she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of that she fail test the first time because she was comfortable with being in a new place. But when spring comes, sheíll be more confident and comfortable because the hibiscus is budding. In this way, the budding hibiscus symbolizes hope and renewal for Saeng, providing her with a sense of comfort and familiarity in her new surroundings.
1466	10333	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because earlier in the story, Saeng was talking about how she failed the test, in which she wanted to retake. So, Saeng declared that next year, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, she shall take the test again. The determination in her eyes reflected a newfound sense of purpose, as she knew that with hard work and perseverance, she could overcome any obstacle in her path. With the changing seasons as her witness, Saeng was ready to face the challenge head-on and prove to herself and others that success was indeed within her reach.
1467	10334	4	3	"The reason why the author concludes this paragraph is to show saeng that she will be waiting for them to grow back and she will try again for her test. Hibiscus means a lot to her, and will keep trying because she doesnt want her mother disappointed in her again. Example of where saeng felt shame ""her mother stared at her incredulously. But how could you?"" saeng wants to not down herself or her mother. ""saeng vowed silently to herself"" saying a promise that she will pass and respect nature as well as elders. Saeng's determination to succeed and make amends is evident in her unwavering commitment to trying again and her promise to herself. Her dedication to passing the test and honoring both nature and her elders reflects her strong sense of responsibility and respect."
1468	10335	4	3	In ìWinter Hibiscus,î by minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph: ìWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,î author concludes the story in this way because it is somewhat of a cliffhanger. In the story, she is upset about failing her driving test and she has just moved from Vietnam to the United States and so she is a little homesick. She sees a familiar plant, and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up - reminding her of the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng hasnít given up and that she is going to try and pass the driver's license test again. But what you donít know is the end result of whether she passes or not, so it is a cliffhanger. That is why the author ended the story in this way.
1469	10336	4	3	"Saeng has been the victim of a tragic loss in her family and a move to a totally different world. The paragraph is symbolic of turning over a new leaf and starting over. The ""snow melting"" and ""hibiscus budding"" both symbolize new life. Saeng is going to have a new outlook on life and accept her situation to make the best of it. Also, the author says ""the winter hibiscus was in the ground now"" as it does compare to Saeng's new found outlook planted on life. Like the flower, a seed of hope was planted into Saeng, and now she is ready to blossom. Saeng will embrace this new beginning and let the seed of hope grow within her, leading her towards a brighter future filled with possibilities."
1470	10337	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the author is very sentimental over the Hibiscus plant because it reminds her so much of her home. The reason why the author concludes the story with that saying is that it gave her a goal. She failed once at getting a job, but she believes that the Hibiscus is good luck, so she sets a goal on when to try for the job again. When she saw the plant, she remembered happy memories. In conclusion, certain things can trigger your memories, but it's the good memories that make things in life something to wait and hope for. The Hibiscus plant serves as a symbol of hope and motivation for the author, reminding her of the happy times and giving her the strength to pursue her goals with renewed determination."
1471	10338	4	3	The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First, it shows that she is starting to like this new life. She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become almost familiar now, indicating a shift in her perception. Additionally, her decision to take the test and the importance she places on the hibiscus she just planted suggest a growing sense of belonging and purpose in her new environment. Furthermore, the open-ended conclusion allows for the possibility of future developments, leaving the reader to wonder about what the future holds for her. By ending the story in this manner, the author effectively conveys the protagonist's evolving feelings and leaves room for imagination and interpretation.
1472	10339	4	3	The author concludes the story by mentioning that the protagonist fails her driving test, but she plans to retake it. The plant she discovers could symbolize good luck for her as she looks forward to a fresh start when the snow melts and the geese return. It brings a sense of hope and renewal after her setback, hinting at new beginnings and possibilities in the future.
1473	10340	4	3	The author concludes the paragraph with this paragraph because she wants to try again. The author is saying that the hibiscus she planted last year did not work and she is trying again this year to grow a hibiscus plant. She will pass the test if she succeeds in the spring. That is why the author concludes with this paragraph.
1474	10341	4	3	He concludes that when it is spring he will take the test again. That will give her another chance to pass it. This will give her another chance to do what is right. With the upcoming opportunity in the spring, she can prepare thoroughly and approach the test with a fresh perspective. This decision offers a sense of hope and determination to achieve success in the future attempt. By waiting for the right timing, she sets herself up for a better chance at passing the test and fulfilling her goals. Patience and perseverance will be key in her journey to overcome this challenge and demonstrate her capabilities.
1475	10342	4	3	She going to take the test again because she feels like she needs to. When the snow melts and the geese come back, that means she wants to take the test in the Spring. This decision shows her determination to improve and succeed, as she is willing to put in the effort and commitment to achieve her goals. Taking the test in the Spring symbolizes a fresh start and a renewed sense of motivation. By recognizing the importance of self-improvement and seizing the opportunity to try again, she is demonstrating resilience and perseverance in the face of challenges. This decision reflects her positive attitude and growth mindset, which will undoubtedly help her in her future endeavors.
1476	10343	4	3	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author's sentence highlights Saeng's determination to retake a test in the spring, surrounded by familiar sights of home. The mention of the snow melting, geese returning, and hibiscus budding evokes a sense of comfort and familiarity for Saeng. These reminders of home serve as a source of strength and motivation for her to face the test again. The connection to her roots and the natural cycle of the seasons instill her with confidence and a sense of belonging, ultimately helping her prepare for the challenge ahead."
1477	10344	4	3	"In the same way the hibiscus flower prevails in the winter, Saeng wants to be the same way. Saeng failed a test which makes her feel unsuccessful. Saeng wants to prevail she wants to stick it out and the rough times sheís going through make it very difficult for her. When Saeng says ìI ñ I failed the testî this shows that saeng feels disappointed that she didnít expect that because she is a fighter. So the author ends the passage with Saeng saying, ""When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" To show how much of a fighter Saeng is because sheís determined to strive under difficult conditions. Saeng's determination to face her challenges head-on, just like the resilient hibiscus flower, highlights her strength and unwavering spirit in the face of adversity."
1478	10345	4	3	The author puts this paragraph last because it shows that saeng is looking to a new lease almost on life. She now has something to take her through the year that is ahead of her she now wait till it is winter once again to see the hibiscus flower bloom once again and as wel as many more to come. This newfound hope and anticipation for the future signify a shift in Saeng's perspective, indicating a sense of renewal and optimism as she looks forward to witnessing the beauty of the hibiscus flowers in the seasons to come.
1479	10346	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the narrative by showing that although Saeng did not pass the test, she will have another opportunity in the future, symbolized by the return of the geese. Saeng's purchase of a winter hibiscus signifies her longing for her homeland and serves as a source of comfort and reminiscence. This suggests that despite the setback, Saeng remains hopeful and determined to succeed when the time is right."
1480	10347	4	3	The Author concludes this story with a paragraph because she loves her garden. The story revolves around them and their garden, which eventually becomes dormant in the cold winter months, leaving them with nothing to do until Spring. This highlights their strong emotional attachment to their gardening activities. In Spring, as the snow melts and the geese return, they eagerly anticipate the hibiscus blooming once again. This desire to nurture and care for their garden signifies a sense of determination and pride in their gardening skills. The changing seasons bring a sense of renewal and hope, allowing them to overcome challenges and demonstrate their ability to tend to their beloved garden.
1481	10348	4	3	At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work. Instead she rather garden then do school work. However, as the school year progressed, she realized the importance of her academic performance and the impact it would have on her future. She understood that while flowers may bloom and wither, her education would provide a solid foundation for her life ahead. With this realization, she made the decision to prioritize her studies and dedicate the necessary time and effort to excel in her academics. Through hard work and determination, she was able to improve her grades and achieve success in her school work, understanding that education is a valuable asset that would stay with her long after the flowers had faded.
1482	10349	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus gave her some hope. Also, because her mother was understanding about her failing the test. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph. The vibrant red flower symbolized resilience and the ability to endure harsh conditions, providing a sense of optimism for the future. Additionally, the mother's supportive and understanding reaction to her daughter's academic setback helped ease the author's worries and fears. Together, these elements brought a glimmer of hope and comfort in a challenging moment, making it a fitting conclusion to the narrative.
1483	10350	4	3	"The author concludes the story with optimism and hope for the future. She finishes her story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" By concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test. The hibiscus helped give Saeng one step closer to adapting to her new home. It says in the story ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" In the way the author ends the story it helps give inspiration for a new beginning and new season."
1484	10351	4	3	In the story, @ORGANIZATION1, by Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng tries to adjust to a new country, but it is nearly impossible. She is stressed about failing the driverís test, and she realizes that nothing is the same. Except for one thing that she quickly recognized. A plant called the ìWinter Hibiscus.î It made her think of her old life in Vietnam. It helped her set through hard times and she didnít want to give up on anything. This is exactly why Minfong Ho ends the last paragraph by stating that Saeng will retry the driving test when the hibiscus is budding. The flower gives her a thought of home in Vietnam, making her try and try again. Also, the author ends the story like this to state a theme. This particular theme is, ìNo matter how hard something might be, you can get through it. You just have to find a way that benefits you most.î The Winter Hibiscus serves as a symbol of resilience and the importance of holding onto one's roots in times of difficulty, guiding Saeng to persevere and eventually succeed in her new environment.
1485	10352	4	3	The author comes back to that paragraph because in the story Saeng is so sorry she did not pass the test. Now Saeng wants to make up for it. She vowed to herself she will pass that test. For example, when I say to herself I am going to get something done I do what it takes to get it done and I don't give up when things get rough. This last sentence is what the main idea of the story is: to make up that test and pass it, to get done what needs to be done. Saeng is determined to overcome her mistake and succeed in the test, showing resilience and determination in the face of challenges.
1486	10353	4	3	The reason why this author includes this story with this paragraph is because it is still talking about Saeng and that is more like her and that she has a mind like a butterfly that was trapped and burst out with this open the Saeng and her mom had. As a teenage girl, I can relate to the same thing.
1487	10354	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the ending paragraph suggests that Saeng is determined not to give up. She expresses her intention to retake the test when the hibiscus and geese, symbols of her home and inner strength, return. This determination highlights Saeng's resilience and her willingness to try again despite initial setbacks. It shows that she is not easily discouraged and remains hopeful for the future. The paragraph underscores Saeng's perseverance and belief in herself, indicating that she is ready to face challenges head-on and continue striving towards her goals."
1488	10355	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he is telling the reader that after the snow leaves the author will begin to plant more plants. The test is to make sure his plants donít die during next @DATE1.

1517	10384	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring itís warmer and more fun plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the spring time. Also because like she says in the story it goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going out so she connected it to the way the geese are.

When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. ìPlants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.î This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, ìHow strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. ìThis symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold monthsî. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal.
1520	10387	4	3	Saeng's determination to try again and not give up despite failing her driver's test shows her resilience and belief in her ability to overcome challenges. Just like the hibiscus that survives through hard times and adapts to changes, Saeng is confident that she too can thrive in a new environment.

As the geese return and the hibiscus begins to bud in the spring, Saeng is ready to take the test again, starting fresh like the hibiscus and believing in her own capabilities. She understands that failure does not define her, but rather, it is an opportunity to learn and grow. Saeng's story is a testament to the power of resilience and determination in overcoming challenges and achieving success.

1522	10389	4	3	The last paragraph was added in order to represent the determinedness and adapting to new things in Saeng and her family. In the beginning, Saeng held bitterness at failing the test. But after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it. Just as the flower will bud, she will be a new person and thus pass the test. An example of her being determined to deal with it is that she does make friends, and, though the food she offered was rejected she didnít give in. The moment of breakdown was as she got the flower. After she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change.
1523	10390	4	3	The author includes the last paragraph because Saeng is not going to give up. and she will try again. I think Saeng bought the flower because she had them at her homeland and it will help her. For example Saeng started to cry because she misses her homeland.

Despite the challenges she faces, Saeng's determination to persevere is evident in her actions. The flower serves as a poignant reminder of her roots and gives her the strength to carry on with resilience and courage.

1525	10392	4	3	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the paragraph because it continues the theme of adjusting to changes in life. In the story, Saeng has come to the United States from Vietnam and it is quite a change. Also changed are the plants. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of Vietnam, but it is different. The mother in the story says, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus.""

With determination and hard work, she finally takes the test again. This time, she passes with flying colors, achieving her goal and proving that perseverance pays off in the end.
1527	10394	4	3	I think he means that seasons change and that winter will come again. I think that is the test. As time progresses, the cyclical nature of the seasons dictates that winter will inevitably return. This natural phenomenon serves as a test of resilience, adaptability, and preparation. Just as the world transitions from one season to the next, individuals must also be ready for changes and challenges that come their way. Embracing the shifting seasons with a sense of readiness and acceptance can help navigate through life's uncertainties. So, just as winter follows autumn, be prepared for the tests that come your way, knowing that change is inevitable, but growth is optional.
1528	10395	4	3	Saeng is like the hibiscus and geese in the story, facing challenges and needing strength to survive. Just as the geese migrate to warmer climates for winter, Saeng has moved to a new environment and must adapt. The hibiscus, too, must be resilient to withstand the harsh winter, much like Saeng facing her own tests. By concluding the story with this paragraph, the author highlights the parallel between Saeng and nature, emphasizing the need for strength and perseverance in overcoming obstacles.
1529	10396	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî includes ìwhen they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again because it shows that she can adapt to change and still can think about her old country too. An example of how she can keep her old country alive in her life isî But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac.î This shows that she can still eat the foods she ate back at her old home and try new things at her new home. In conclusion, the excerpt shows that the author can put both cultures together and be happy. She embraces her heritage while also appreciating the new experiences and opportunities in her current environment, ultimately finding a balance that brings her joy and fulfillment.
1530	10397	4	3	There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have importance to the story. I think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes, she will have many more reasons to take the driving test. You can break this paragraph down to mean many different things. I interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back, she will have a new beginning. The snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year. They are too coming back, getting ready to start their new life. It is included at the end to show how Saeng is trying to forget about how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year. She had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say. I think that it is showing a new beginning that she will have to go through the next year.
1531	10398	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. With determination in her heart, she knew that she would be prepared for whatever challenges awaited her. The changing of the seasons symbolized a new beginning, a fresh start to tackle any obstacles that may come her way.

She was ready to face the test again, armed with a renewed sense of confidence and inner strength. The cycle of nature mirrored her own journey of growth and development, giving her the courage to confront the future with unwavering determination.
1532	10399	4	3	"The author ended the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes. Saeng's determination to retake the test reflects the resilience of the winter Hibiscus, showing that with perseverance and courage, one can overcome challenges and achieve their goals."
1533	10400	4	3	The author concludes this part, because it made the story stand out a little. For example when Saeng said that she meant when the plants came back. It also gave the ending a little something to hang on to, rather than straying off topic by talking about the v or geese. Lastly, she also meant when the geese came back. This added depth to the story and tied up loose ends, leaving the reader with a sense of closure and completion.
1534	10401	4	3	I think the author finishes the story with the girls seeing the plant as a symbol of strength and faith. She decides to take the test next year when it comes back because she truly likes the plant and hopes it will bring her luck.
1535	10402	4	3	I think the author ended the story with that phrase to show that she wont give up; no matter how hard it is she keeps trying. The girl says in the story ìI failed the test,î and then at the end of the story says I will take that test again so she is not willing to fail forever. I also think the author ended the story with that paragraph to make you wonder if she will ever pass the test.
1536	10403	4	3	I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take she wasnít ready for before but now whenever the geese return and the hibiscus return the she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasnít mentally prepared. So in conclusion I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return the she will take the test and maybe she wasnít physically and mentally prepared for it.
1537	10404	4	3	Authors carefully select their closing paragraphs to convey specific meanings and themes. In this story, the character's mention of a budding hibiscus symbolizes overcoming obstacles, like retaking a failed test. The reference to melting snow and returning geese represents new beginnings and opportunities. By ending the story with these images, the author reinforces the message of resilience and the chance for redemption. The choice of the closing paragraph is crucial in delivering these powerful themes and leaving a lasting impact on the reader.
1538	10405	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when it's cold and silent she's hot to herself but when the snow melts and spring is here, she's lively and vibrant.

Looking up at the geese, she felt a sense of connection to the cycle of nature, reminding her of past experiences and the passage of time.

Like the hibiscus in bloom and the geese in flight, Saeng embraces the promise of renewal and the certainty of a brighter tomorrow.
1543	10410	4	3	Saeng brought home a plant that she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States. The plant seemed limited in its growth, just like Saeng felt in her new country. She felt out of place, struggling to adjust to her new surroundings. However, despite feeling constrained by her circumstances, Saeng's determination remained unwavering. Just like the plant, she was determined to thrive and flourish in her new environment. With resilience and perseverance, Saeng was ready to overcome any obstacles that came her way, determined to succeed no matter what challenges she faced.
1544	10411	4	3	Saeng tells herself sheíll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that ìmany of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.î And when sheís in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re-taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and foreshadows her future success and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle. Saeng's determination to face challenges head-on and find beauty in her surroundings showcases her resilience and ability to thrive in any environment.
1545	10412	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph that she did because it was the end and the start of a new beginning. The author uses the senses in her story. The winter is the current season and spring is on its way. Although Saeng failed her test in the winter when most things die, she is looking forward to spring to start again on her test. The geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show spring is here with new life. Saeng will also have new life in her test to pass it this time and drive. The spring season will come and new life will be provided to all. As the snow melts away and the flowers begin to bloom, Saeng will have another chance to succeed and embrace the fresh start that spring brings. Just like nature, she will flourish and grow, leaving the struggles of winter behind her. Spring symbolizes hope, renewal, and opportunity, and Saeng is ready to embrace all that it has to offer.
1546	10413	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it encapsulates the essence of the journey the characters have been on.

As they stood at the edge of the cliff, looking out at the vast expanse before them, they knew that they were ready to face whatever the future held. With a sense of determination and unity, they took a deep breath and stepped forward into the unknown, ready to embrace whatever lay ahead.
1547	10414	4	3	I sighed as I looked at my failed test results. Despite studying hard, I hadn't quite made the grade this time. However, I wasn't going to let this setback deter me. I knew that I would try again in the spring, with renewed determination and focus. I was determined to succeed and was willing to put in the effort needed to achieve my goals. The prospect of a fresh start in a new season motivated me to keep pushing forward, knowing that with persistence and hard work, I could overcome any challenges that came my way. So, as I closed the book on this chapter, I looked ahead to the next opportunity to prove myself and show what I was truly capable of.
1548	10415	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it's what the story is all about it just explains what happened in the end as if what happened throughout the story was the growth and living of a flower. The blooming of the flower symbolizes the journey of the protagonist, from a small seedling facing challenges to blossoming into a beautiful creation. Just like a flower, the protagonist faced obstacles, weathered storms, and finally emerged victorious, showcasing resilience and growth. The ending paragraph serves as a reflection of the protagonist's transformation, highlighting the beauty and strength that can come from overcoming struggles and embracing change.
1549	10416	4	3	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho concludes with Saeng vowing to retake her driver's test in the spring. As she holds the potted plant, she feels a sense of connection to it, understanding its struggle in the cold. Saeng's mother's acceptance of her choice symbolizes her growth as a person, just like the plant's potential to thrive once repotted. When spring arrives, both Saeng and the plant will be stronger, ready to face new challenges with resilience and determination."
1550	10417	4	3	The author concludes the story by showing the girlís connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese, the ìWinter hibiscusî is her connection to her homeland. She said sheíll retake her driving test when her plant buds and is brave, so she will do the same. The geese flying south show her journey as a person because she will take the test when the geese come back from their journey, as she comes back from hers. The girl's determination and resilience are reflected in her commitment to wait for the geese to return before retaking her driving test, mirroring her own journey of growth and self-discovery.
1551	10418	4	3	The author wrote the ending paragraph the way she did for many reasons. The main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note. All throughout the story there was a nostalgic tone that made the reader yearn for the past. The author wanted to put an emphasis on being strong even though you may not enjoy where you are at. Also, the author wanted to show the strength of the main character Saeng. Even though she has just failed a test in a new, strange world, she still wishes to continue pushing forward. This adds more dimension to the character and makes her less static and more dynamic. This is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward.
1552	10420	4	3	The author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home like the hibiscus to get some roots in the new soil she is on. When she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time. This time allows her to reflect on her past while embracing her present, ultimately leading to a sense of emotional healing and growth.
1553	10421	4	3	I believe the author concludes the passage by showing Saeng's patience as she waits for spring to arrive. Perhaps, in the warmth of spring, her new home will start to feel more like her hometown. Saeng prefers spring over winter, as she enjoys the return of the geese and the chirping of the birds that signify the changing season. This conclusion highlights Saeng's hope for a brighter and more familiar future in her new surroundings.
1554	10422	4	3	"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author has left her home and moved to another country. She is now in an unfamiliar place. Everything that now surrounds her is new and mostly unknown. By ending the story with this quote, it suggests that the author still has hope of adapting to her new home. When she left her home, she did not just leave a building behind. She left her home, people she loved, and an endless list of memories. At times, she may have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone. She is now ""out of the box,"" and in a whole new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant took her back to her memories and to the love of her old home. Then she came back to reality and broke apart with sadness and ""failed her test."" The ending sentence shows that the author is willing to try to survive in this new place and that she is still determined to pass her own test of adapting. Saeng's journey is one of resilience and hope, as she navigates the challenges of starting anew in a foreign land, clinging to the familiar while bravely facing the unknown."
1555	10423	4	3	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself., in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to signify Saeng's determination to retake the test in the spring.

She is motivated by her desire to make her mother proud and provide support for her family. This decision reflects Saeng's resilience and commitment to achieving her goals, setting the stage for a hopeful future as she works towards success in her endeavors."
1556	10424	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldnít help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, ìI-I failed the test.î When she says ìthe testî she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, ìWhen the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces.
1557	10425	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has moved to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worse, she failed the driverís test. ìShe found she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. ìThis quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, sheíll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2. When spring arrives, the girl will have the opportunity to embrace new beginnings and leave the challenges of the past behind. This sense of renewal and optimism signifies a turning point in her journey, offering a glimmer of hope for the future. With the changing seasons, she can look forward to a brighter tomorrow and the chance to rediscover herself in a new light.

1559	10427	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by CAPS1 Ho, the narrator is drawn to a ""winter"" Hibiscus plant in a greenhouse, reminiscent of her homeland and memories of her grandmother.

Despite feeling like she failed a test, the sight of the Hibiscus plant gives her a sense of hope and determination. As the story concludes, the narrator expresses her resolve to try again, suggesting a willingness to persevere and overcome challenges.

Saeng decides to retake the test when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus starts to bloom. This decision reflects her need for time to reflect, remember home, and create a hibiscus garden. Both Saeng and the hibiscus symbolize redemption and transformation from their initial setbacks."
1561	10429	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in that way to convey the determination and new found motivation Saeng found by buying the familiar plant. Although she failed her test, finding a plant that reminded her of her home and her grandmother instilled motivation in her to try the test again, she wanted to make her new home in a new country workout for the better, no matter what. ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky ..."" the author included details about the geese to represent moving on. The geese will go, and come back, just like Saeng. She failed the test the first time, but getting the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again. ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her."" The geese were one of the things mentioned that has become very familiar to her, in her new home. Concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home. Finding the plant helped her, because it was already familiar to her. ""Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. '@CAPS1, Saeng said.'"" After failing her driver's test, walking into the florist's shop and finding that plant comforted her. It made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first. The geese had become familiar over time, and finding the plant was simply comforting. Concluding the story that way showed the reader that she was adapting and learning to deal with a tough situation in a comforting way."
1562	10430	4	3	"In the story ""WiNter Hibiscus"" by MiNFOnG HO, the author concludes the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the sprinG, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddiNG, then I will take that test again"".

So when she Goes to take the test it will be a new year."
1563	10431	4	3	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended her story with words regarding to the story @CAPS1 failed her driving test. Saeng cried when noticing her past through flower. As well as bought dok malik seeds show that the story ended the way it did, because next season, she would have the opportunity to try again and hopefully succeed in obtaining her driver's license. The dok malik seeds symbolize growth, resilience, and the possibility of new beginnings, hinting at a hopeful future for Saeng despite her initial setback. The tears shed by Saeng as she looked back on her past experiences through the flower highlight the emotional journey she has been on and the lessons she has learned along the way. Overall, the conclusion of the story suggests that while failure may be a part of life, it is not the end, and there is always the chance for redemption and success in the future.

Her determination to succeed was unwavering, proving that she was not one to back down easily. Saeng's decision to try again exemplified her strong will and perseverance, setting her on a path to achieve her goal of obtaining her driver's license.
1565	10433	4	3	The author used that sentence because the snow is melting and the geese are coming back. The flowers were budding up and that is why I think the author used that sentence. Additionally, the warm breeze carried the scent of fresh blooms, signaling the arrival of spring. This change in the environment was evident in the increased chirping of birds and the longer daylight hours. The transition from winter to spring was finally in full swing, creating a sense of renewal and rejuvenation in the air.
1566	10434	4	3	"I believe that this was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says ""When they come back"" she is talking about the flowers. When they come back alive. ""In the spring"" shows when the flower will come back. ""When the snows melt and the geese return"" she is saying that after winter (when the snows melt) and when the geese return (in spring). ""And this Hibiscus is budding"" She is saying when the flowers bloom again in the spring. ""Then I will take the test again,"" she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. She is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower shop. This will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!"
1567	10435	4	3	The author concluded the story with that ending because in the spring when everything blossoms. And she wouldn't be focused while there is snow. So when the hibiscus is budding, that's when she will be able to take her test again. I think he wrote that because it means something to her. When the hibiscus finally blooms, it symbolizes a new beginning and a fresh start for her. The vibrant colors and fragrant scent of the flowers will help her relax and concentrate, creating the perfect environment for her to succeed in her test. By choosing this moment as the time for her to retake the test, the author is showing that he understands the importance of timing and setting in achieving one's goals.
1568	10436	4	3	"This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, ""She lifted her head."" This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, ""when the snow melts and the geese return,"" this shows us that she is like the geese because they're both going back for a hand-fought journey. Also, when she says, ""and this hibiscus budding,"" she is saying when everything comes to life and is at its highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up.

1570	10438	4	3	Saeng is so overwhelmed by her current situation that the author believes it will be a long time before she is able to focus on school work again. This conclusion is drawn from the challenges and hardships Saeng is facing, which are consuming her thoughts and emotions. The author ends the story with this observation, indicating that Saeng's immediate priorities lie elsewhere, and academic concerns will have to wait until she can address the pressing issues in her life. It is clear that Saeng's journey is far from over, and her path to healing and recovery will take precedence over her academic responsibilities for the time being.
1571	10439	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because he wants to emphasize that the girl is not completely dissatisfied with leaving her home.

Taking a moment to rest and recharge can make a significant difference in one's performance, just as allowing a flower to grow and develop can lead to a beautiful outcome.

The author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the will bloom the same time the hibiscus will and will pass the test.
1574	10442	4	3	Well, I think the author concludes the story with that sentence because maybe Saeng likes the spring and can concentrate better with her favorite flower that she thinks relates to her life. Additionally, the mention of her favorite flower blooming in the spring symbolizes new beginnings and growth, mirroring Saeng's own personal development and resilience throughout the story. This connection to nature and the changing seasons highlights the cyclical nature of life and the possibility of hope and renewal, providing a sense of optimism and closure to Saeng's journey.
1575	10443	4	3	"The author ends the story like that to show the theme of working hard. Some other examples of working hard are seen in the ""winter hibiscus"" and her determination to pass the test.

And so, with renewed confidence, she set her sights on passing her driver's test and embracing her new home with a sense of belonging and familiarity.
1577	10445	4	3	Authors use various techniques to enhance their stories, making them more engaging and impactful.

The hibiscus are a symbol of hope and saeng thinks of them as her hope. Throughout the story, the hibiscus are comforting to saeng because they remind her of home. The author includes this because many people can relate to this and find hope in things. For saeng, knowing that each year the hibiscus will come back in those conditions, reassures her that sheíll be okay there as well.

1581	10449	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese.

She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy.

By saying she would try to pass the test again in the spring is showing she is confident and is looking for a new beginning to come then. Also he concludes it this way because after she failed the test she didnít have much self-confidence. And once she spoke to her mother and knew she was understanding, Saeng knew she had to try again and persevere until she passed the test.

The spring would bring a fresh start, and she was prepared to seize the opportunity and prove her capabilities.

The reason I say this is because she is doing the test when she wants to, when she feels comfortable. Those are the reasons I belive that the author ended the story with that paragraph.
1597	10465	4	3	"I believe the author concludes the story like this to show an example of perserverance. Saeng states, ìthrough the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This statement represents adjusting to change. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps perservering. she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, ìwhen the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the season's bring things back, she will come back. I believe this last paragraph was put in to show everyone should perservere because things just take time."
1598	10466	4	3	"This statement shows what the author concludes about the story. It shows the theme of the story really. It you fail, then try again. This is what the statement is saying, she failed her tasks so in the spring once the hibiscus blooms again, she will attempt to complete her task. The statement also concludes how you should never gave up. Saeng had failed the test. She said,""I-I failed the test"". This shows how sad and depressed she was because, the tone the statement was said in was a sadder more depressed tone. Even though sad depressed Saeng knows that next year she will attempt to complete the test. Overall, the sentence shows what the author concludes and think about the story ""Winter Hibiscus""."
1599	10467	4	3	"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Saeng decides that she is determined to pass her driving test just like the hibiscus.

The geese are mentioned in the final paragraph to tie in the fact that she is getting used to her new home because the geese ""sound familiar."" As much as she misses her old home, she is adapting. By mentioning the plant, which symbolizes her homeland, and the geese, which symbolize her new home, Saeng shows that she is starting to get used to her new country and recognizes that she is a part of it. She knows that letting her past get in the way of her will not help her pass the test, and like the plant and the geese, she will return again."

The sights and sounds of nature, along with her determination to succeed, provide her with a sense of hope and inspiration as she looks towards the future.
1602	10470	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do. With the hibiscus in her possession, she felt a sense of comfort and familiarity, giving her the strength and confidence to face the challenges ahead. It was a reminder of her roots and the journey she had undertaken to reach this point. As she held onto the hibiscus, she knew that no matter what obstacles came her way, she would overcome them with resilience and determination.
1603	10471	4	3	The author is very creative. He concludes the story saying how the hibiscus is building and that she will take the test again. She believes that she will do better when the snow is gone. The author ended the story with that because Saeng was very upset failing a test but with the comfort of the hibiscus sheíll be able to do better. He also concludes the story with that paragraph because the climax was when she failed her test and somehow the author had to conclude what was going to happen to Saeng with the test. Saeng's determination to improve and the support of the hibiscus plant create a sense of hope and possibility for her future success. By highlighting this resilience and positivity, the author leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and anticipation for Saeng's next attempt at the test.

Most of the story is about the sadness that the narrator experiences because of longing for her homeland, Saeng misses her grandmother and the plants of Vietnam, and she even buys a hibiscus plant to remind her of her homeland.

1606	10474	4	3	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown. She has learned that if a delicate flower like the hibiscus can make it through rough times she can too. Nature's fight for survival is like Saeng's struggle in a new place. She discovers that you will adapt to your surroundings over time. Then after that time it will feel just like home. The adaption principle is shown throughout this story demonstrate by nature or a child's life it's there. Therefore the author would agree that the conclusion of the story illustrates the biological and physical growth of Saeng.
1607	10475	4	3	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus"", Saeng is new to @LOCATION1. She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she'll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time.

With a spirit as resilient as the flowers, she would embrace the challenges ahead and grow stronger with each passing day. The journey may have been difficult, but the future held promise and hope for the girl as she embarked on a new chapter in her life.
1610	10478	4	3	I think the author puts that paragraph in the story because maybe because its a good luck thing or its a tradition so its very important that its in the story. Also it could be trying to tell us something like she only take test in the spring when the hibiscus starts budding. The mention of the hibiscus blooming in the spring could symbolize new beginnings, growth, and the potential for success. This detail adds depth to the character's actions and decisions, showing a connection between nature and personal beliefs. The hibiscus becomes a significant symbol that represents hope, renewal, and the start of a promising journey for the character. Its presence in the story emphasizes the importance of timing and aligning oneself with the natural world to achieve desired outcomes. The hibiscus serves as a reminder of the cyclical nature of life and the opportunities for fresh starts that come with each new season.
1611	10479	4	3	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story by highlighting Saeng's desire to return home and her determination to overcome challenges.

This growth signifies a sense of completion and readiness to move forward. It suggests that the challenges faced and overcome during the test will contribute to her personal development and resilience. By facing the test head-on and persevering until the end, she will emerge stronger and more capable. This growth is a natural outcome of confronting obstacles and pushing through them with determination. In the end, she will not only have accomplished the task at hand but also evolved into a more mature and experienced individual.
1613	10481	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph she did because the girl did not pass the driving test. And she adds all of them details of nature in there because she takes time to care about nature. That is what it is mainly about in the story. The girl watched the sunset, feeling a sense of calm wash over her as she admired the vibrant hues painting the sky. The gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze provided a soothing soundtrack to her thoughts. Despite the disappointment of failing her driving test, she found solace in the beauty of the natural world around her. The chirping of birds and the distant sound of a flowing stream reminded her to appreciate the simple joys in life. As she walked back home, she made a silent vow to continue caring for the environment, knowing that nature would always be there to offer comfort and peace in times of need.
1614	10482	4	3	When all the beauty returns, I will try to get used to new things again. It may take time to readjust to the hustle and bustle of life, to the sights and sounds that once seemed so ordinary. But I will embrace the change, knowing that with each passing day, I am growing stronger and more resilient. The world may look different now, but my spirit remains the same - ready to face whatever challenges come my way. And as the days turn into weeks, and the weeks into months, I will find my place in this new reality, grateful for the beauty that surrounds me once again.
1615	10483	4	3	The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of starting over and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus is a reminder of her home country and it keeps her going and strong and she compares herself to the geese saying that things she thought were strange became familiar through a quiet repetition from season to season. In the winter the hibiscus doesnít bloom and Saeng fails her driverís test. That paragraph tells that in the spring when the Hibiscus thrives and the geese return it will be a fresh start for them and Saeng as well.
1616	10484	4	3	The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng's determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn't a good idea. Saeng is kind of comparing herself to the plant. She may have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, then she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did. Saeng's resilience and willingness to try again despite failure are admirable qualities that the author wants to highlight. This determination to overcome challenges and keep moving forward is a valuable lesson that the readers can learn from Saeng's story.
1617	10485	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for example, ""But it's strong enough to make it through winter,"" says her mother.

This final paragraph serves as the culmination of the story's themes and conflicts, leaving the reader with a lasting impression of the journey the characters have been on.

1619	10487	4	3	Saeng held the winter hibiscus in her hands, feeling a sense of hope and determination wash over her. Just like this resilient flower, she too would adapt to her new life in the United States. As she looked out the window and saw the geese returning for another season, she knew that this place was giving her another chance to make it her home. With the driving test looming ahead, Saeng felt a newfound sense of courage and readiness to face whatever challenges came her way. Like the winter hibiscus blooming in the cold, she was ready to thrive in her new environment and embrace the changes that lay ahead.
1620	10488	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth.

The changing seasons reflect the author's own cycle of growth and renewal, mirroring the natural world around him. Just as the snow eventually gives way to vibrant greenery, the author's determination is rejuvenated, ready to tackle the challenges ahead with a fresh perspective. Nature serves as a powerful reminder of resilience and the endless possibilities for new beginnings, inspiring the author to continue his journey with hope and perseverance.
1621	10489	4	3	"I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Now tell that wasn't beautiful."
1622	10490	4	3	Then author put the last sentence the way it did. It meant that by next spring, they wanted to see how they would react differently to the same situation. They were familiar with the season, but they were curious to observe any changes in their reactions.
1623	10491	4	3	He uses this line at the end of the story because it shows she has another chance to pass the test. They use the plant because a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants can be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she communicates with her mother through the plants. Through the enduring nature of plants, the protagonist finds hope and a connection to her past, symbolizing resilience and the potential for growth and renewal in her life.
1624	10492	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the ending paragraph suggests that the protagonist is gradually adapting to her new surroundings in the foreign country. She acknowledges the need to embrace the changes and challenges that come with living in a different place. By mentioning the ""paved to new surreal winds,"" she emphasizes the importance of being open to new experiences and opportunities. This conclusion highlights the character's growth and resilience as she navigates the complexities of her new life."
1625	10493	4	3	The flowers on this bush are very comforting to Saeng. In the story she explains that they remind her of her home in Vietnam. The budding of plant and spring represent new life. Saeng thinks that spring could also have a new beginning for her. That in spring, she will do better and pass the test. But, if she falls again, the flowers will have bloomed to comfort her. The vibrant colors of the flowers bring her a sense of peace and remind her of the beauty of nature in her homeland. As she gazes at the blossoms, she feels a renewed sense of hope and determination to succeed in her endeavors. The delicate petals sway in the gentle breeze, whispering words of encouragement to her troubled heart. With the support of these flowers, Saeng believes that she can overcome any obstacles that come her way and emerge victorious in the end.
1626	10494	4	3	The author concludes with that because she kind of relates herself to the flowers. She has grown to her environment like a flower. Also she had failed her test, so just like when a flower dies and then comes back, she is going to come back and try the test again. This connection to the resilience and renewal of flowers gives her hope and determination to overcome her challenges and keep striving towards her goals. Just as flowers bloom again after withering, she is ready to face her test once more with a renewed spirit and a belief in her ability to succeed.
1627	10495	4	3	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she failed the test so over the winter they donít get hibiscus but over the spring when they get again the hibiscus she will try to take the taste again so she can pass it. Despite the setback of failing the test, the protagonist remains determined to try again in the spring when the hibiscus blooms once more.

Together, they will take care of the flower and nurture it, just like she will nurture her own growth and development. In the end, the flower represents hope, resilience, and the opportunity for a fresh start.
1629	10497	4	3	Saeng vowed to herself that she will retake and pass her driver's test in the spring when the geese fly back and plant rebuds. The hibiscus plant she bought symbolizes her memories of Vietnam and her willingness to start over. Just like the geese flying south for the winter and returning in the spring to rebuild their home, Saeng is ready to overcome her sadness and homesickness, grow stronger, and create new, positive memories in @LOCATION2. The cycle of the seasons and the birds' migration reflect Saeng's own journey of rebuilding and starting anew. In the end, she is determined to pass the test and feel more accepted in her new home.
1630	10498	4	3	"The last paragraph in, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" was added because the author wants to show that she feels bad because she did not pass the test. She feels disappointed because her mom is disappointed in her and knows she can pass it.

1646	10514	4	3	I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says ìin the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test againî.  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time.
1647	10515	4	3	"The author used the paragraph telling about how Saeng would test in the spring at the end of the story because the words used and the way it is read can tell the reader that Saeng is at peace and accepts the fact that she lives in the U.S. When Saeng says, ""and this hibiscus plant is budding,"" she is thinking about how the plant reminds her of her native country. Also when she says, ""Then I will take this test again,"" she is promising herself that she will take the test when she feels at home in her new country. Saeng also is in a way telling herself that she should accept the fact that she has moved and that she can still be reminded of her native country with the new hibiscus plant and many other things. This shows Saeng's acceptance of her new life in the U.S. and her determination to find moments of connection to her past while embracing her present circumstances."
1648	10517	4	3	The author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason. The author could write a sequel to this one. She could want the people to keep coming back for more, or wants people to know when things start up again so will Saeng. Ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do. The author wants you to know when the plant and geese restarts their lives Saeng will do the same. She will not give up but instead re-take the test. The author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves you thinking so then the sequel will be about the start of Saengís new life and what she plans to do to keep her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring so will Saeng. The author @MONTH1 love having people wonder about whats coming next. The people will go home and wonder what will the author do next with Saeng. The author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer. This sets the stage for a continuation of Saeng's journey and the challenges she will face in the future.
1649	10518	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the willingness of Saeng to overcome the obstacles and adapt to her new life. The hibiscus discussed in the ending quote describes Saengís new hope and determination to succeed in the United States. For example in the text it states,""Ö its fine petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.î When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to the together her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents newhope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has blossomed, her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin. With this thought realized at the end of the story, the reader understands that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually succeed. In addition, in the text it says, ìit felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel.î Saengís past memones could be reached when this hibiscus was in new and that served as immense inspiration to her. The author ended the story with Saengís new recollection and hope to prove that she had indeed found something helpful and stable in a new world."
1650	10519	4	3	"The author concluded the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to portray to her reader that even though Saeng was experiencing a hardship leaving her old home behind, she could still find a good life with new beginning here. In the final paragraph the winter shows represent hard times in the past, while the spring represents a more optimistic future, and a new beginning. Although Saeng was grieving at the loss of her past, she could still find happiness here. In the story she once knew hibiscus can her old home. She finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home. Also, the story says, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This quote leads into the final paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can appreciate happy live in this new home. The final paragraph says, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again."" When things familiar to her and things that remind her of her old home come back, Saeng will have the strength to try to accomplish good things for this new life in a new home again."
1651	10520	4	3	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can always start clean and never give up when you really want something. The janitor really wanted to pass the test, so she worked hard, but she failed it. She knows, like the plant in spring, life offers a new beginning, and you can always change something you don't like about yourself. I strongly agree with this statement because if you didn't have a second chance, most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes in their life and everyone has the opportunity to fix them. This is why I believe the author concludes this statement at the end of the story.
1652	10521	4	3	The story ends with Saeng believing that next spring when her new hibiscus blooms, she will have the good luck she needs to pass her driving test. This optimistic belief stems from the newfound connection she feels towards the hibiscus, which was not a part of her life before her driving test. Saeng sees this connection as a symbol of her past experiences, her ability to overcome obstacles, and a source of comfort during times of disappointment. With this newfound confidence and belief in luck, Saeng is hopeful that she will succeed in her next driving test.
1653	10522	4	3	The author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason may be to explain how she has changed in the story. Toward the beginning of the story the author sounds discouraged and upset that she failed her test. In her final paragraph it shows she overcame her fear. Also, the geese move like she did. Saeng and her family have moved to the United States, but the geese feel odd moving too but they come back every year. Along with the flower Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt as the geese and flower do. She knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do. She won't give up but try again later on in the year. This shows how she is adapting and changing to work with her new surroundings.
1654	10523	4	3	Saeng's determination to pass her driving test and adapt to her new home was evident as she vowed to conquer the challenges she faced. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things she once found strange had now become familiar. While she needed a little more time to fully adjust, Saeng's perseverance and positive attitude would surely help her thrive in her new environment.
1655	10524	4	3	"In the story, Winter Hibiscus Saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again. Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland, which is why she bought the flowers. At the end of the story, she vows, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home. This decision shows her determination to overcome her challenges and embrace her new life while still holding onto the memories of her past."
1656	10525	4	3	The author had the story end with the paragraph because all the ideas are brought together and to show that Saeng is ready for what's ahead. When they put in the flower they are concluding the flower's importance and how it relates to how the girl feels being happy or sad. Yet when she says that she vowed... and she'd take the test again she is saying that she is ready for what's ahead but will be open-minded to what's new so that she can see where she's gone from. Therefore the author ends with that paragraph to leave mystery for what happened and to conclude.
1657	10526	4	3	As winter settles in and the flowers fade away, the young girl reflects on her growth throughout the planting season. She realizes that what once seemed unfamiliar to her is now becoming familiar, and she is gaining confidence in her abilities. With each day spent tending to the garden, she is learning more and more, preparing herself for the challenges that lie ahead. As she looks forward to the test in the coming spring, she knows that she will be ready, thanks to the experiences and lessons she has gained from her time spent cultivating the garden.
1658	10527	4	3	As she closed her eyes and took a deep breath, she knew that the journey ahead would not be easy. But she was determined to face whatever challenges came her way. The next year, at the same time, she would once again take the test of life. And with newfound strength and courage, she would navigate through the uncertainties and obstacles, ready to emerge stronger and wiser than before. The road ahead may be daunting, but she was prepared to embrace it with an open heart and a resilient spirit.
1659	10528	4	3	The ending of a story helps determine the meaning of the story. It is the final closure and will most likely be remembered by the reader. In the end of the story Winter Hibiscus the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement. The conclusion encourages you to keep trying, because it states that next year when the flower blooms Saeng will re-take the test. This shows encouragement because has the drive to try again and to pass. The author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired. Her conclusion is strong and also seems to recap the stories meaning because all along Saeng keeps getting disapointed about the flower, her mother, and homeland encourage her to move on and try again. The ending used was meaningful and showed what the author was truly trying to convey.
1660	10529	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the main character struggles with adapting to a new environment after moving away from home. Everything from the culture to the food is different, making it challenging for her to feel at ease in her new surroundings. Despite the difficulties she faces, the main character is determined not to give up. The story ends with the main character expressing a desire to try again and see if things have changed over time. Through the emotional journey depicted in the story, the main character learns to overcome her sorrow and continue striving towards her goals."
1661	10530	4	3	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph about geese to show that Saeng is going to try to overcome her obstacles. She was disappointed in failing the test so she took comfort in memories of her homeland. She bought a hibiscus that she saw in her homeland a lot, and that flower brought comfort and affection. But it also symbolized her ability to come over obstacles, and while she was planting her hibiscus, and saw the geese flying above, she knew she had to try again. As the geese soared high in the sky, their determination and perseverance inspired Saeng to keep pushing forward despite the setbacks she faced. Just like the geese, she too would rise above her challenges and soar to new heights of success.
1662	10531	4	3	The author decides to start her own garden because her previous attempt did not go well and she needed her mom's help. Now, she is determined to try again and put in the effort to make it successful this time. With her newfound knowledge and experience, she is ready to take on the challenge and create a beautiful garden that she can be proud of.
1663	10532	4	3	"The author concludes the paragraph when Saeng realizes she can miss her old home, but she needs to adapt to the new place that she is in. Saeng misses the old memories of her homeland ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But, she begins to realize that not everything has changed, same things are still familiar. ""Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, the faint honks clear and - yes - familiar to Saeng now."" When Saeng realizes that not everything has changed she gained the strength to continue her new life in her new country."
1664	10533	4	3	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it was a good way to end the story off. At the end of this, they were talking about how Saeng would come back when the snow melts and then she will take the test again. This creates a sense of anticipation and hope for the future, leaving readers with a sense of closure and the possibility of a happy ending for Saeng.
1665	10534	4	3	"The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng still has hope to succeed and adapt in this new country. She previously had a lot of home sickness, missing her grandmother and keepsakes from her childhood. The height of her homesickness is seen when Saeng comes back to her house and is explaining to her mother the nature of the hibiscus. “She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.” Saeng is uncomfortable living in @LOCATION1 and wishes to go back to Vietnam. But by the end, Saeng’s attitude changes from despair to hope. Even though she has failed her driver’s test, Saeng is determined and hopeful to do at least something in this new country by saying ""…then I will take the test again.” Saeng has changed a good deal within this story and that change in attitude is seen with the excerpt on geese in the last paragraph."
1666	10537	4	3	I think he put this in here because he's trying to convey the idea that when the snow melts, it's best to forget about past failures and start anew. As the geese return, it signifies a fresh opportunity, a chance to make things right. The budding of hibiscus represents moving beyond obstacles and achieving success in your endeavors. It's a reminder to keep pushing forward and not dwell on past setbacks. Embrace the new beginnings and opportunities that come your way, and strive to overcome challenges to reach your goals.
1667	10538	4	3	As they continued their conversation about the cold weather and the snow, they both agreed that it was a sign of the changing seasons. The snow would eventually melt, giving way to warmer temperatures and the arrival of spring. Their discussion about the weather was a reminder of the cyclical nature of the seasons, and how each change brought its own beauty and challenges. Just as the snow would eventually melt, so too would the cold give way to the warmth of spring, bringing with it new life and growth. And so, they both looked forward to the coming days, knowing that with the changing weather, new opportunities and experiences would also come their way.
1668	10539	4	3	The author concludes the story by showing how the main character has been influenced by the events that have unfolded. Despite failing her driver's test and spending a large sum of money on a single plant, the main character remains optimistic, thanks to her grandmother and her connection to her homeland. This optimism is reflected in her determination to retake the test when the plant blooms again, highlighting the bond between her and the plant. This unexpected positive outlook showcases the resilience and strength of the main character, leaving a lasting impression on the reader.
1669	10540	4	3	"I believe that the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to illustrate the overall message of the story. That paragraph sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles. Saeng is coming from another country and is facing challenges not only in the garden, but in her life as well. She had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish. So, by saying ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" she truly shows her determination and how she's not afraid to overcome obstacles that will face her."
1670	10541	4	3	The author of this story is concluding in this way because instead of absorbing all the pain, she can choose to look into the future. By focusing on what lies ahead, she can let go of the past and strive for a better tomorrow. This shift in perspective allows her to move forward with hope and optimism, leaving behind the burdens of yesterday. By embracing the possibilities of what the future may hold, she can find the strength to overcome the challenges of the past and create a brighter future for herself. It is through this forward-looking mindset that she can truly begin to heal and grow from her experiences, building a new path towards happiness and fulfillment.
1671	10542	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this piece because she said ""a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear."" I think she means that even though the geese flew over with their heads up high even though Saeng's wasn't. ""Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time. She looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but not be sad. This moment symbolizes a new beginning and a sense of hope for the future, where she can look forward to brighter days ahead."
1672	10543	4	3	There are two reasons why the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Firstly, Saeng had silently picked up a Winter Hibiscus to help her pass the driving test. Secondly, she is determined to try her driving test again so she can successfully pass and be able to drive on her own. These two reasons highlight Saeng's persistence and determination to overcome challenges and achieve her goals.
1673	10544	4	3	The author concludes this paragraph by highlighting the deep sense of care and concern Saeng holds for the geese, emphasizing the strong bond between them. This connection between Saeng and the geese serves as a central theme in the story, underscoring the importance of compassion and empathy in the face of hardship. Saeng's dedication to the well-being of the geese reveals his intrinsic kindness and nurturing nature, ultimately showcasing the power of love and companionship even in the most desolate of circumstances.
1674	10545	4	3	"When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time. The ending of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" reflects Saeng's inner strength and resilience as she faces the challenges of adjusting to a new home and culture. Just like the winter hibiscus, she may not feel as pretty or comfortable in her new surroundings, but she is strong enough to endure and thrive. Through her determination and willingness to adapt, Saeng will eventually find her place and bloom in her new environment."
1675	10546	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng expresses her determination to retake the driving test in the spring so she can walk home and admire the flower she found. She recalls seeing the same flower in her homeland during her childhood, adding a sentimental value to her desire to pass the test. Despite the disappointment of failing the test, which cost her over nineteen dollars, Saeng's mother's initial reaction of astonishment and scolding quickly turns into sympathy as she sees her daughter in tears. This show of understanding from her mother strengthens Saeng's resolve to succeed when she attempts the test again in the future."
1676	10547	4	3	"Minfong Ho, the author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" ended her story with Saeng thinking about the spring because she wanted to make Saeng's future more hopeful. Saeng seemed depressed and always reminiscent of her past in Vietnam. When she sees the Hibiscus and Jasmine flowers she ""broke down and wept"", and she remembers her grandmother fixing her hair when she smells the Jasmine. To make matters worse for Saeng, she failed her driving test, which is something that most teens find as a big disappointment. By this point in the story, I felt sorry for Saeng and I wondered if things would get better for her because she was away from everything she knew and loved with just some memories and a winter hibiscus unlike the kind she had back at her name in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, Saeng suddenly becomes hopeful for her future and ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."""
1677	10548	4	3	Then I will take that test again. This final sentence shows Saeng's determination. She was upset about leaving her home and she was upset about failing her test, but thanks to a flower, she got her confidence back. Whenever someone is upset, it is easy to give up. Until the final paragraph, the tone in the story is depressing. When the author put in the conclusion, it was like a light at the end of a dark tunnel. The author is saying that even when things are hard and seem impossible, something will be there to lift your spirits. There is always a positive in a negative situation; you just have to look for it.
1678	10549	4	3	In guessing that it means that when winter or spring or whatever its harder to grow that garden. Also maybe it's a challenge of some sort to make the garden grow by that time of year. So I would assume that's what it's talking about with it. Additionally, factors such as temperature, sunlight, and precipitation can significantly impact the growth of a garden during different seasons. This can pose a challenge for gardeners who aim to cultivate their plants to maturity within a specific time frame. By understanding the unique requirements of each season and implementing appropriate strategies, gardeners can overcome these challenges and successfully grow their gardens year-round.
1679	10550	4	3	The author includes that sentence at the end of the story because throughout the story, the protagonist demonstrated courage in facing challenges. This final sentence suggests that she has learned from her past failures and is now determined to overcome them. It signifies her resilience and willingness to try again, reflecting her growth and development as a character. By choosing to go back and attempt the test once more, she showcases her determination and perseverance, ultimately embodying the theme of courage that runs throughout the narrative.
1680	10551	4	3	To me, the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph could be to symbolize a new beginning or a fresh start. When the geese fly away and return, it signifies a change or transformation taking place. This change could represent the protagonist's opportunity to start over, giving him another chance to succeed.
1681	10552	4	3	I think they think it will bring them luck. Perhaps by carrying the object with them, they believe that good fortune will follow. This belief in the power of luck is a common phenomenon across cultures, where people seek ways to attract positive outcomes in their lives. Whether it be a lucky charm, a ritual, or a superstition, the idea of luck can provide comfort and hope in uncertain times. So, by holding onto this object, they may feel a sense of security and optimism as they navigate through life's challenges.
1682	10553	4	3	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows you can overcome something if you have the willpower. Saeng failed the first test, but instead of giving up, she bought a plant that reminded her of home and planted it in the cold, hard ground. She realized that the once strange things in her new environment were becoming a part of her everyday life. With determination, she decided to retake the test, understanding that failure is not the end but a chance to try again. Saeng acknowledged that while she would never forget her home, she could still move forward and create new memories. She learned that positivity and perseverance can triumph over setbacks. The author chose this conclusion to emphasize the theme of resilience and growth, highlighting the importance of never giving up on your beliefs and dreams.
1683	10554	4	3	The author includes the except at the end for a meaningful reason to Saeng. The hibiscus symbolizes everything to her - her home, her past, and her comfort. Saeng believes that if the flower can bloom, so can she. This belief will help her adjust to her new home and retake the test with confidence. The hibiscus also represents hope, as it survives the winter to bloom in the spring, just like Saeng hopes to overcome her challenges and thrive in her new environment. The author cleverly connects Saeng's emotions and struggles with the resilience and beauty of the hibiscus, highlighting the possibility of growth and renewal in the face of adversity.
1684	10555	4	3	The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng. This similarity suggests that just as the geese return north in the spring, Saeng will also return to retake her test and hopefully succeed. The cycle of migration for the geese mirrors Saeng's journey back to the testing center, emphasizing the idea of returning and trying again.
1685	10556	4	3	"The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how Saeng was not going to give up. Throughout the story, she had been feeling down. From when she failed the test and she misses Vietnam. So many things throughout where she and her mother lives reminds her of Vietnam. ""She closed her eyes and breathed in deeply, Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair."" This made her very emotional, to see how many things reminded her of Vietnam. The author ended like this to show how the experience of all this affected her. The memories of her grandmother and Vietnam were deeply ingrained in her, giving her strength to persevere despite the challenges she faced."
1686	10557	4	3	The author chose to end the story like this to inspire a sense of determination. Saeng got the plant to remind her of her homeland and cheer her up. Once the plant is bloomed she feels like she would as well and be ready for the test. As the flower petals slowly unfurled, Saeng felt a surge of hope and strength filling her heart. The vibrant colors and delicate scent of the bloom gave her the courage she needed to face the challenges ahead. With renewed determination, she sat down to study, knowing that just like the plant, she too would bloom and thrive in the face of adversity. The plant served as a reminder of her resilience and the power of perseverance, instilling in her a belief that she could overcome any obstacle that came her way. Saeng was ready to tackle the test with a newfound sense of confidence and optimism, knowing that just like the plant, she would continue to grow and flourish, no matter what challenges lay ahead.
1687	10558	4	3	The author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement. ìWhen the geese come back Ö in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.î This statement shows renewal and persistance. I think she added this because after realizing the plant can come back time and time again, even after the harsh weather, she knew she could do it too. She vowed to herself that when the day comes again she will be ready to renew  herself and get back on track. It conveys persistance also. The plant doesnít die each season. Itís hardy and comes back. If the girl can be persistant and come back next year to retake the test, she will be considered persistant. I think the girl wants to be just like flower. She sees it as being indomitable, renewing and beautiful. No matter where the plant is being grown, it will always keep those traits. When faced with challenges, the girl will remember the resilience of the hibiscus and strive to embody its enduring qualities in her own life.
1688	10559	4	3	The reason for the author concluding the following is because she wants it to be known to the readers that saeng is not going to just give up because she fails it the first time. That she is going to achieve so that her mother can be proud of her and to show herself she is trying to make a effort. It states that saeng will retake the test again in the spring when the snow has done melted and geese returns and this hibiscus is budding. Not only was the hibiscus an important part to the story, it was a very important part to her life it help her move on a see how things change cause over time it will chage and develop and adapt to the changes around it. Yes it was a disappointment to her mother but she sort of understood why she brought the plant home. It might comforted her in a way. There was many different things probably going on where she was she missed the test it wasnít home. She has to adjust and adapt to the situation that she is in.
1689	10560	4	3	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and next time that time of year comes back around she will have another chance to pass the test. I say that because in the text it states that she paid over @MONEY1 for it all of the vegetable seeds in the garden didn’t even cost that much. That is why I say she concluded with that paragraph. Additionally, it is clear that Saeng is determined and hardworking, so it is likely that she will study harder and be better prepared for the test next time. This setback will only make her more motivated to succeed in the future. The upcoming opportunity to retake the test presents a new beginning for Saeng, and she will most likely make the most of it to achieve her goals.
1690	10561	4	3	Next year, when winter comes around again, she will be fully prepared to plant her crops once more. After learning from her previous experience, she is determined to do a much better job this time. With a newfound understanding of what works and what doesn't, she is ready to tackle the task with more knowledge and skill. Armed with this valuable experience, she is confident that her next planting season will yield even better results. By applying the lessons she has learned, she is looking forward to a successful and bountiful harvest in the future.
1691	10562	4	3	"The author included this because she was showing that it was winter and the flower was going to bloom and the geese were flying here because it is cold. Also, the author said that because the story title is called the ""Winter Hibiscus"" which obviously blooms in the winter, so that is why I think the author said what she did. The winter setting is crucial to the story's atmosphere and the blooming of the hibiscus in this cold season adds a sense of beauty and resilience to the narrative. The migration of the geese further emphasizes the chilly winter setting, creating a vivid picture of the season in which the story takes place."
1692	10563	4	3	"The author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with a sentence stating that when Saeng's Hibiscus first bud appears in the spring she will be back to take the driver's test. The author might have decided to conclude the story like that because what if the plant died, would she go back and take the test? The author was probably just wanting the reader to think hard about it. In conclusion, the author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" might have concluded his story to make it somewhat suspenseful."
1693	10564	4	3	The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test. The story says, ìPlants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood worldî (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she got love and support. By seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, ìA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saengís eyes now swept over her ì(Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger. Along with just the sight of the hibiscus other things will make her ready for the test also. The story says, ìIt felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center ñ just as she had known it would feelî (Ho).The feel of the hibiscus @MONTH1 remind Saeng of distsnt memories, like helping her grandmother with her hair. All of these things will only make Saeng stronger so that the next time she takes the test she will not fail.
1694	10565	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring when the snows gone she will take the test again. She knows that with more practice and determination, she will be better prepared next time. The melting snow symbolizes a fresh start and a new opportunity to succeed. She is determined to study harder and overcome her previous obstacles. The coming of spring represents hope and renewal, giving her the motivation to try again and achieve her goals. As the snow disappears, she is filled with optimism and ready to face the challenge once more. This time, she is confident that she will be successful and pass the test with flying colors.
1695	10566	4	3	In the quote above it is telling that saeng is glad to be back. Saeng also states that she would be ready to do it again if she had to. This demonstrates saeng's resilience and positive attitude towards challenges. It is evident that saeng approaches difficult situations with a sense of determination and adaptability. This mindset not only helps saeng navigate through tough times but also allows her to grow and learn from the experiences. Overall, saeng's willingness to face challenges head-on and her readiness to confront them again if needed showcase her strength of character and optimistic outlook on life.
1696	10567	4	3	I think the author concluded the story like that because it was cold outside. When she wrote the letter, she expressed her reluctance to take the test until the weather warmed up. She mentioned waiting for spring, when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding, as the time when she would consider retaking the test. It seems that the author associates the cold weather with a sense of delay or hesitation, hinting at a desire for warmer and more inviting conditions before facing challenges.
1697	10568	4	3	There are many reasons the author says ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î @CAPS1 the author said this because the girl left everything just to come to this country and she can not fail. The girl said ìThat at last, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-footed come? the hibiscus hedge? She also said this because the hedge was all she had from her old home besides her mother and when the ìhibiscus is buddingî means its starting a new life and is starting to grow leafs and the girl is starting grow and move on with her life.
1698	10569	4	3	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because they have learned from their mistakes and are now better equipped to succeed. By trying again, they have the opportunity to improve their product and potentially make a profit. This gives them motivation to continue pursuing their passion and turning it into a successful venture in the years to come.
1699	10570	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî concludes the story with a resolution of Saeng in order to show how Saeng will not give up and how she is determined. The reference to the spring blossoms shows how Saeng will fight to survive through the hardships, which are represented by winter. Just like the hibiscus that struggles to adapt to a new home, Saeng is struggling to adapt to a new country. The final paragraph provides a resolution to the internal conflict of Saeng throughout the story by suggesting that Saeng will succeed in taking the test. In conclusion, the final paragraph in the story ìWinter Hibiscusî provides a resolution to the conflict in the story and shows the reader Saengís determination to overcome challenges and succeed.
1700	10571	4	3	Saeng didn't want to go to school; she preferred to wait for the snow to melt and the geese to return. Her hibiscus plant was flourishing, and she enjoyed gardening more than anything else. The garden reminded her of her homeland, and as she carefully planted her winter hibiscus, she felt a connection to her roots. The sounds and smells of cooking also brought back memories of home, and as she tended to her vegetable patch, she knew that her heart was truly in the garden. Despite the lure of school, Saeng's passion for gardening would always be her priority.
1701	10572	4	3	"The author concludes her story with the quote, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because the author is showing that nature and the plant are valuable to her. Saeng (who says the quote) believes that the hibiscus will help her pass the test. Earlier on in the story it shows that when she gets in trouble, she rubs the plant leaves in her hands to help her overcome the problem. The author is making the idea clear and portraying the idea that the plant helps Saeng with obstacles."
1702	10573	4	3	In the end of the story, Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driver's test next year. One reason she has vowed to herself to do that is to prove that she can pass the test. Also, the flower she bought and planted, along with the memories of the good times she had in Vietnam, gave her the confidence to go out and get what she wanted. The flower symbolized growth and new beginnings, inspiring Saeng to step out of her comfort zone and face the challenge of obtaining her driver's license. With determination and courage, she is ready to conquer the test and prove to herself that she is capable of achieving her goals.
1703	10574	4	3	The author includes this in the paragraph to simply be sarcastic for you to know that it is almost impossible for Saeng to take the test afresh. I say this because she was being very sarcastic meaning sheís not going to take the test. For example, if someone were to tell me take a test and I said whenever @LOCATION1 is president again, then Iíll take the test. That would be very sarcastic meaning that it wont happen and Iím not taking the test, instead of just saying No. The author included that just to let you know that the chances of her taking the test is very low.
1704	10575	4	3	The geese will return and the Winter Hibiscus will bloom once again, symbolizing the continuation of Saeng's journey in the United States. Despite the challenges she has faced, Saeng remains determined to overcome them, as she prepares to retake her diving test with renewed hope and perseverance. Just as the geese and the plant endure the changing seasons, Saeng too will persist in her efforts, embracing a new beginning filled with possibilities and opportunities for growth.
1705	10576	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's strength and encouragement. When she's willing and able she will take the test again with more confidence. Saeng says this to herself to help her get through until she can drive. She's saying by next spring she'll take her test. By next spring she'll be able to drive. By next spring she'll be used to her new home. This paragraph tells that it takes time to do things you don't always get it right away so keep trying. Saeng will persist and eventually achieve her goals, demonstrating that perseverance and determination are key to success in overcoming challenges.
1706	10577	4	3	In my opinion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was feeling down about not passing her driving test but when she saw those flowers, she realized that when she came to @CAPS1, she forgot all about her hometown. So, she decided to get back in touch with a nature side and hold off taking her test until the spring instead of rushing things. Saeng's decision to reconnect with nature and take things at a slower pace shows growth and a newfound appreciation for her surroundings, suggesting that she is on the path to finding peace and contentment within herself.
1707	10578	4	3	I believe that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to show that Saeng still has hope of finding home and being happy. The hibiscus plant symbolizes home and happy memories with her grandmother. When the plant buds, she will feel at home again and be happy, which is when she will take the driving test. The paragraph also indicates that Saeng is slowly getting accustomed to her new home and lifestyle. The familiar honks of the Canada geese and the now familiar surroundings show her assimilation into her new life. Through these examples, the narrator highlights Saeng's acceptance of her situation and her journey towards finding happiness in her new home.
1708	10579	4	3	"Saeng did not give up on the test. She declared, ""I will take the test again."" She was determined to pass it. Saeng planned to wait until spring arrived and the snow melted before attempting the test once more. From the beginning of the story where she first mentioned the test, it was evident that she had set her mind on succeeding. Now, as she prepared to face the challenge again, her resolve remained unshaken."
1709	10580	4	3	"At the end of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story through stating, ìwhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author ends the story in such a way in order to reveal the hope that lies in Saeng's future. After failing her drivers's test, Saeng returns home with disappointment and sadness. This last paragraph, however, shows that soon enough Saeng's luck will change. The reader is left with a hint that Saeng will retake her test and pass. Also, this ending paragraph reflects upon Saeng's determined personality to overcome many obstacles she is faced with. This paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the United states instead of her home. Her success in fitting in with her new life is shown when through the quote, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become... almost familiar"". Truly Saeng is a determined character."
1710	10581	4	3	The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph is to show the girl's resilience and ability to adapt to her new surroundings. Despite missing her home country, the girl is determined to make the most of her new life. By stating that she will have adapted by the next year, the author highlights the girl's strength and determination to overcome challenges. This final paragraph serves as a message of hope and perseverance, emphasizing that with time, the girl will find her place in her new home.
1711	10582	4	3	The author plans to do the same thing again next year when the snow is all gone, when the geese come back, and when it's warm enough for the hibiscus flower to bud and bloom again. This is the life the little girl chose, and she will keep up with her new gardening skills until next spring comes around.
1712	10584	4	3	Saeng concluded the story with that paragraph because it shows what she has just been through and feels she could go through it again. If she fails the driving test again, then she use the plants to overcome her problems. She may actually pass the test this time. The unique plants show that she is stronger than she thinks and believes now that she feels comfortable with the plants that bring back memories of her childhood. Saeng has discovered a source of inner strength and resilience that she can draw upon in times of challenge, allowing her to face her fears and doubts with newfound confidence.
1713	10585	4	3	She shows that she loves her grandmother by spending quality time with her, engaging in activities like gardening together. Her affection for her grandmother is evident in their shared interests and the bond they have formed. Despite her mother's strictness, she still cares for her daughter, albeit in a more disciplined manner. The grandmother's influence on the girl's life is significant, providing a source of love and connection that complements the more stringent upbringing from her mother. The balance between the two relationships shapes the girl's character and experiences, illustrating the importance of love and discipline in her upbringing.
1714	10586	4	3	Saeng's resilience and determination in the face of adversity serve as a powerful reminder that no matter how challenging life may be, there is always hope for a brighter future. Just as the waves persistently return to shore, she too is willing to try again and overcome her obstacles. This unwavering perseverance is an inspiration for us all to keep pushing forward, no matter what difficulties we may encounter.
1715	10587	4	3	As the final whistle blew, marking the end of the championship game, the players on the field could feel the weight of the season lifting off their shoulders. It had been a tough journey filled with highs and lows, but now it was time to close this chapter and look ahead to the next. With the trophy held high, the team celebrated their hard-earned victory, knowing that they would soon be starting fresh in a new season. The cheers from the fans echoed through the stadium, carrying with them the promise of new beginnings and endless possibilities. As the sun set on this season, a new dawn was breaking on the horizon, bringing with it the excitement of what was to come.
1716	10588	4	3	When they comes back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The flower represents something to her that gives her motivation and determination. Everyone has something that motivates them in life to keep them going, and Saeng has her plant. The author kind of gives you direction and idea where the story is going to go also when the flower buds.
1717	10589	4	3	"Saeng is not only disappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the United States. She buys the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different countries, cultures, and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, ""when they come back,"" she is referring to the geese. To her, the geese symbolize her life in @LOCATION2 and how she has become accustomed to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam. It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When the hibiscus is budding, then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger, then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, yet still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready."
1718	10590	4	3	I believe that the Author ended the story with this paragraph, because I think it is showing that Saeng isnít a quiter. Saeng canít wait until the Hibiscus comes back. When the Hibiscus comes back sheíll retake the test and show her mother that she can do it. This demonstrates Saengís determination and perseverance, as she is not willing to give up despite facing challenges. It also highlights the importance of second chances and the belief in oneself to overcome obstacles. Saeng's resilience and optimism shine through in this final paragraph, leaving readers with a sense of hope and inspiration for the future.
1719	10591	4	3	"The reason why the author concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flowers grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses a lot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the ""Madagascar periwinkle"" growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the author says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland. She is eager to reconnect with her roots through the beauty of nature that she fondly remembers."
1720	10592	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driverís test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (ìÖand this hibiscus is buddingÖî), the author depicts Saengís change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driverís test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saengís new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saengís mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (ìÖwhen the snow melts and the geese returnÖî). This shows Saengís development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes.
1721	10593	4	3	They conclude the story with that because the winter is over and spring is here and it will be beautiful again. The trees are beginning to bud, flowers are starting to bloom, and the birds are chirping happily. The sun is shining brightly, bringing warmth and light to the world once more. It is a time of renewal and new beginnings, a time to leave the cold and darkness of winter behind. Spring is a season of hope and joy, a time to celebrate life and all its wonders. And so, as the characters in the story look out at the world around them, they are filled with a sense of optimism and excitement for the future.
1722	10594	4	3	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. This tells me that she feels that over time, she will become more familiar with driving, and then she will take the test again. Then she will pass it.
1723	10595	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to @LOCATION1 and has had a rough time fitting in. She misses everything about her old home, from her grandmother to the old plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, so she feels that all is lost. But the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance. The hibiscus can survive the winter and bloom in the spring and that is what Saeng realizes she must do. The last paragraph said ìIn the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.î Spring is the time for new beginnings: the geese return from the south, the flowers start to bloom, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes she wants a new beginning as well to be brought I the spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph ties the theme of new beginnings into the story. It shows @CAPS1 new realization and how the hibiscus inspired it.
1724	10596	4	3	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng really wants to pass the test. You knows this when it says ""And in the warm moist shelter of the green house, Saeng broke down and wept."" This passage shows that she didn't want to fail. When Saeng got home, she had the white bud in the pot, and her mother saw that she was crying. Then her mother was going to put the plant in the ground, then Saeng took the shovel and did it herself. Having her realize she can take it again, Saeng's determination and emotional investment in the outcome are evident."
1725	10597	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. First, when the hibiscus buds in the spring that means that the plant is about to bloom. That also means that Saeng will be ready in the spring to take the test again. Also the last paragraph is at the end because if the plant can make it, then the girl can pass her drivers test and be happy both ways.
1726	10598	4	3	It's gonna be a year or some change, and I feel like I could have done better. I'm going to retake that test and make sure I give it my all next time.
1727	10599	4	3	Saeng was determined to turn her disappointment into a fresh start. Failing her driver's test was a setback, but the hibiscus brought a glimmer of joy to her heart. It symbolized the new beginning she longed for in a foreign land. The challenges she faced - the geese, the snow, and the test - all signified opportunities for growth and change. The geese flying south marked a shift in seasons, while the snow hinted at a clean slate. The budding hibiscus represented the promise of new life, and passing the test would be a significant milestone for Saeng. As the story concluded with this paragraph, readers were left eager to see what exciting adventures awaited Saeng on her journey towards a brighter future.
1728	10600	4	3	I realized that my love for gardening is far from over. As I stood there admiring my garden in full bloom, I knew that I would be back when it blooms again. The thought of going back to school paled in comparison to the joy I felt while tending to my garden. Gardening is where my heart truly lies, and I am not ready to give it up just yet. So, until next season, I will continue to nurture my garden and watch it flourish with love and care.
1729	10601	4	3	The author concludes this story with the few words “then I will take that test again” because she wanted us to know that she is not going to give up on something she failed once. She is going to keep going until she succeeds with passing “the test.” This determination and perseverance will guide her to overcome challenges and achieve her goals. By deciding to try again, she is demonstrating resilience and a strong will to succeed. This mindset will undoubtedly lead her to triumph in the face of adversity.
1730	10602	4	3	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, ìItís flowers arenít pretty, but itís strong enough to make it through the cold months. here, this winter hibiscus. ìIt shows that the mother want Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, ìshe realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repetition of season upon seasonÖî It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that sheís leaving right now is almost the same as their old home- In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be strong and follow the flow of life. Saeng must embrace change with courage and determination, just like the winter hibiscus persevering through the cold months, adapting and thriving in its new environment. Through acceptance and resilience, she can navigate the unfamiliar territory ahead, finding familiarity and beauty in the unknown.
1731	10603	4	3	Saeng's memories flooded back as she gazed at the blooming hibiscus. The vibrant petals reminded her of happier times, of a past filled with laughter and joy. With the arrival of spring, a sense of renewal filled the air, sparking a glimmer of hope within Saeng's heart. Just like the hibiscus that was budding before her eyes, she felt a surge of inspiration and strength. The upcoming test no longer seemed like an insurmountable challenge, but rather an opportunity for growth and redemption. As the hibiscus continued to bloom, Saeng knew that she too would blossom once again, ready to face whatever lay ahead with courage and determination.
1732	10604	4	3	The author of ìWinter Hibiscusî concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1.
1733	10605	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the protagonist's failure in the test and highlight the lesson learned from the experience. Through this failure, the protagonist is able to gain a deeper appreciation for nature. This ending serves as a reminder that setbacks and challenges can lead to personal growth and a new perspective on the world around us. In the end, it is not just about passing or failing a test, but about the journey of self-discovery and finding value in the lessons learned along the way.
1734	10606	4	3	Saeng walked away from the flowers, knowing that he would return to them again in the spring. The vibrant colors and delicate petals had captivated him, drawing him back to their beauty time and time again. As he looked back over his shoulder, he made a silent promise to himself to visit the flowers once more when the season changed. The memory of their splendor would stay with him until he could bask in their loveliness once more. And so, with a sense of anticipation, Saeng looked forward to the coming of spring, when he would once again be reunited with the enchanting flowers that had captured his heart.
1735	10607	4	3	The author suggests that if you can't succeed at something on the first try, you should try again. This is exemplified by the idea of retaking a failed test to eventually pass it. Additionally, seeking help or studying diligently can greatly improve your chances of success. By persevering and making use of resources available to you, you can overcome obstacles and achieve your goals.
1736	10608	4	3	As the snow starts to fall and the holiday season approaches, it's a time for reflection and gratitude. Looking back on the year that has passed, we remember the challenges we've overcome, the joys we've experienced, and the memories we've created. And as we look ahead to the new year, we can't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation for what's to come. Each year brings with it new possibilities, new adventures, and new opportunities for growth. And so, as we say goodbye to the old year and welcome in the new, let's remember to cherish each moment, embrace each experience, and make the most of every day. For it is in these small moments that life truly comes alive, and it is in these moments that we find the magic that makes each year so special.
1737	10609	4	3	"I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because the author wants to express to the reader that Saeng has been comforted by the hibiscus and is willing to give the test another try. She is now more open-minded about the situation. In the beginning of the story, Saeng was upset and annoyed about failing her driver's test. For example, ""the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes. I-I failed the test,"" Saeng said to her mother. Obviously she was upset and disappointed in herself. The author didn't want to end the story with a sad, unsatisfying ending. Saeng changes her attitude about the test by the end of the story. For example, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" I believe that this attitude was because of the memories of her mother country that soothes her and also her mother. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does heal."
1738	10610	4	3	"The author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the motivational paragraph because he/she wants to show the reader that Saeng is determined to adapt to her new life and home and overcome common obstacles like a driver's test. Saeng had a hard time coping with her problem so she bought a hibiscus because it reminded her of home. I think that the line ""and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" from the last paragraph is a symbol for growing up and overcoming obstacles. The conclusion for the story is a nice ending."
1739	10611	4	3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, as the return of the geese and the blooming of the hibiscus flower symbolize a sense of renewal and hope. The geese, flying back when the snow melts, serve as a reminder of resilience and the ability to overcome challenges. The hibiscus flower, blooming once again in the spring, represents growth and new beginnings. With these natural signs of rejuvenation, the protagonist finds the strength and confidence to face the upcoming test, knowing that just like the geese and the hibiscus flower, she too can overcome obstacles and thrive.
1740	10612	4	3	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the arrival of spring symbolizes new hopes, comfort, and belief for the protagonist. The hibiscus represents hope, as she plans to take a test again once it blooms. The return of the geese brings comfort, especially with the support of her mother. As the seasons repeat, the familiar sights and sounds help her regain confidence and strength. The hibiscus holds significance in bringing renewal and positivity to her life."
1741	10613	4	3	"Coming back from failing her driving test, Saeng is comforted by finding the hibiscus flower. It brings back cherished memories about Saeng's homeland, because it is very similar to flowers that grew by her old home. The author concluded the story by saying ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to compare Saeng to the hibiscus. Like Saeng, the hibiscus must try to adapt to new surroundings. The author shows that Saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it. In Saeng's mind, if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then so can she."
1742	10614	4	3	"The story of ""Winter Hibiscus"" is a prolonged metaphor for both connections to a comforting past as well as expectance and the future. Saeng misses her homeland but she must learn to adapt to her circumstances, and pass her drivers test. The story is nicely concluded with Saeng's promise to herself that come spring, she will take the test again. The hibiscus flower itself generates this promise as it gives her some closure and alleviates some home-sickness. Saeng's promise indicates that she is coming to terms with her situation. When she sees the Canada geese flying, she has somewhat of an epiphany about the seasons. ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now."" I feel that was a landmark for Saeng and the conclusion illustrates that by allowing her to change."
1743	10615	4	3	"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, Saeng has a deep emotional connection to the memories and flashbacks that the hibiscus plants bring back to her. She cries out of mourning for her grandmother as the hibiscus reminds her of precious moments spent with her. Later on, she takes the plant to her mother, who initially reacts with upset but eventually understands her daughter's actions and feelings. Saeng is upset about not passing her test, and her mother sympathizes with her. The author ends the story in this way to show that the hibiscus holds great significance for Saeng, serving as a reminder of her past and motivating her to continue striving towards her goal of passing the test. This connection to the hibiscus will drive Saeng forward, giving her the strength to overcome challenges and succeed in the future."
1744	10616	4	3	Since it is getting close to winter, the geese are beginning their journey southward, and the plants are shedding their leaves in preparation for the cold season. Saeng has made the decision to retake the test, determined to improve her performance. She finds solace and inspiration in the cycle of nature, eagerly awaiting the return of the geese and the blooming of the hibiscus flowers. The sight of the hibiscus holds a special significance for Saeng, as it brings back memories of her homeland and her beloved grandmother. The first time she saw the hibiscus and felt its delicate leaves, it stirred deep emotions within her, even bringing a tear to her eye. The promise of the hibiscus's return next year fills Saeng with renewed hope and strength, serving as a symbol of resilience and continuity in her life.
1745	10617	4	3	In the end, Saeng was found safe and sound by the search party, who had followed the trail of footprints leading into the dense forest. She was found sitting by a tranquil stream, humming a tune to herself while picking wildflowers. Saeng explained that she had gotten lost while exploring the woods but had managed to find her way back by following the sun and the sounds of the stream. Relieved and grateful, her family embraced her tightly, thankful that she was unharmed. Saeng's adventurous spirit had led her on an unexpected journey, but in the end, she had found her way back home.
