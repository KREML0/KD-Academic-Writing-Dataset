Firstly, the prevalence of computers has led to a decrease in physical activity, as individuals are more likely to stay indoors and engage in screen-based activities rather than going outside for walks or other forms of exercise. Additionally, the convenience of online shopping and the ability to work remotely from home has further reduced the need for people to leave their houses. This sedentary lifestyle can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health.  Moreover, the reliance on computers has led to a decline in penmanship skills among students.

The anonymity of the internet allows individuals to engage in hurtful behavior, such as name-calling and teasing, which can have lasting effects on the victims. Unlike traditional bullying, the words used online cannot be taken back, making the impact even more damaging.  Secondly, the internet is rife with scams and cons. Purchasing items online can be risky, as there is no guarantee of the quality or authenticity of the products being sold. My own father fell victim to a scam when he bought a boat online, only to discover that it was in poor condition when he received it.  Lastly, the internet is filled with misinformation. Researching topics online can be unreliable, as anyone can post information, regardless of its accuracy. This is especially dangerous in chatrooms and instant messaging, where individuals can easily misrepresent themselves.

959	961	1	2	In today's society, the impact of computers on individuals and communities is a topic of great interest. Many argue that the effects of computers are predominantly negative due to various reasons. One major concern is the decrease in physical activity and time spent with family and friends. With the rise of computer usage, individuals are more likely to spend their free time on social media platforms rather than engaging in physical exercise or spending quality time with loved ones. The maintenance of computers also demands time and attention, taking away from opportunities for physical activity. This sedentary lifestyle can contribute to health issues such as obesity.  Furthermore, the addictive nature of computers is a serious issue that should not be taken lightly. Dependence on technology can lead to social isolation and a lack of essential life skills. For instance, individuals may rely on GPS systems for navigation, neglecting the ability to read a map. In the event of a computer malfunction, individuals may struggle to perform tasks that require basic skills, such as writing by hand. The long-term consequences of computer addiction can be detrimental to personal development and social interactions.
