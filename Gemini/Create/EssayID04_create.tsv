The florist shop scene highlights this conflict, as Saeng is overwhelmed by the familiar plants that trigger intense memories of her childhood and the loss of her grandmother and homeland. The hibiscus, in particular, symbolizes this connection to her past; seeing it prompts a wave of grief and a sense of irretrievable loss.

The image of the Canada geese is also significant. Initially, Saeng found many things in America strange, but through the ""quiet repetition of season upon season,"" these things, including the geese, have become ""almost familiar.""

These plants are more than just flora; they are tangible links to her grandmother, her home, and her identity.

However, these memories are bittersweet, reminding her of what she has lost: her grandmother, her home, and a sense of belonging.

Her mother's observation highlights the need to adapt and find strength in a new environment. The act of planting the hibiscus together symbolizes their joint effort to take root in America. It also signifies Saeng beginning to recognize the beauty and potential in her new home, even if it differs from what she once knew. The mention of the Canada geese further reinforces this theme of adaptation. Initially, Saeng perceived everything in America as strange and unfamiliar.

The sight of familiar plants like the hibiscus, jasmine, and periwinkle triggers potent memories of her grandmother, the garden, and a life irrevocably left behind. This wave of nostalgia underscores her initial alienation and inability to connect with her present reality. However, the concluding scene in the garden signifies a turning point.

The geese, initially perceived as foreign, have become familiar to Saeng over time. The return of the geese in the spring parallels Saeng's own return to the driver's test. The author uses the geese’s return to represent that Saeng's integration into the American environment, though challenging, will be cyclical and natural, just as nature renews itself each year. Therefore, Saeng's vow to retake the test when the geese return and the hibiscus buds signifies her acceptance of her new reality, her budding hope, and her determination to integrate without completely abandoning her past.

The phrase ""A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone,"" encapsulates the abruptness and totality of her displacement. However, the story also subtly reveals Saeng's gradual integration into American life.

The ending contrasts sharply with Saeng's initial despair and feeling of loss in the florist shop, highlighting her journey towards adaptation and hope.

This type of hibiscus, as her mother points out, is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here,"" symbolizing Saeng's own need to adapt and persevere in her new environment. The plant’s survival through winter becomes a metaphor for Saeng's ability to withstand hardship and emerge stronger. The image of the Canada geese returning in the spring further reinforces this theme of cyclical renewal and adaptation. Initially, Saeng perceived many things in America as ""strange,"" but through ""the quiet repetition of season upon season,"" they have become ""almost familiar to her now."" The geese, once foreign, now evoke a sense of comfort and belonging. Their return symbolizes hope and the promise of new beginnings.

The geese, therefore, represent the integration of new experiences into her life, much like the winter hibiscus, which is not the same as the one from her childhood, but is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" The image of the winter hibiscus budding serves as a powerful metaphor for Saeng's own resilience and growth.

378	-1	4	4	"Minfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the paragraph about the geese and Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test to emphasize the themes of hope, adaptation, and the enduring connection to one's heritage within a new environment. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with the loss of her familiar world in Vietnam, symbolized by the plants she recognizes in the florist shop and the memories they evoke. The hibiscus, in particular, represents a tangible link to her past, a ""saebba hedge, tall and lush"" from her childhood garden. However, the ""winter hibiscus"" is different, a symbol of the resilience needed to survive in her new home, strong enough to ""make it through the cold months here."" Saeng's initial breakdown in the greenhouse signifies her overwhelming sense of displacement. She feels that a ""blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone."" The loss of the physical objects of her past—the comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well—represents the loss of her entire way of life. However, the ending shifts the focus from loss to possibility. Her mother's acceptance of the ""winter hibiscus"" and her practical approach to planting it in the cold, hard soil show Saeng the importance of adapting to her new surroundings. The shared task of gardening and the preparation of a meal familiar from her past (""an omelet with slices of the bitter melon"") solidify their bond and offer a sense of continuity. The bitter melon, though disliked by her American peers, represents her unique cultural identity, something she cherishes and prefers to the more common ""Big Mac."" The return of the Canada geese becomes a symbol of hope and cyclical renewal. Just as the geese migrate and return with the changing seasons, Saeng realizes that she too can adapt and find her place in this new land. The honking of the geese, once ""strange,"" is now ""familiar,"" reflecting her growing sense of belonging. The vow to retake the test in the spring, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" signifies her determination to embrace the future while holding onto the values and memories of her past, ultimately conveying a powerful message about the potential for growth and resilience in the face of change."

The florist shop, a ""hot, moist world exploding with greenery,"" initially evokes a ""shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral,"" reminding her of her childhood garden. However, this recognition is quickly followed by the painful realization that her past is ""irretrievably, irrevocably gone,"" leading to her breakdown. The ending paragraph marks a turning point.

The shared meal of bitter melon, a food Saeng initially found strange but has now grown to prefer, further illustrates her evolving sense of belonging. Finally, the sight of the Canada geese, once unfamiliar but now recognizable, solidifies this sense of integration. Therefore, Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring is not merely about obtaining a driver's license, but about embracing her new life and facing future challenges with newfound strength and a growing connection to her new home, suggesting a future where she successfully navigates her dual identity."

Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with the loss of her home and the familiar comforts of her childhood in Vietnam. The hibiscus in the florist shop triggers a wave of nostalgia and grief, as it reminds her of the ""saebba hedge"" and her grandmother.

Saeng's mother's words, ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters,"" highlight the importance of adapting to the present circumstances. The image of the Canada geese reinforces this theme of adaptation. Initially, Saeng perceives the geese as ""strange,"" but over time, they become ""almost familiar,"" mirroring her own gradual assimilation into American culture. The geese's migratory pattern, their departure in the winter and return in the spring, symbolizes the cyclical nature of life and the promise of renewal. Saeng's vow to retake the driving test in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus buds, demonstrates her newfound resolve and her willingness to embrace the future. The failed driving test earlier in the story represents a setback, but Saeng's decision to try again signifies her growing confidence and her commitment to building a life for herself in America. In essence, the concluding paragraph provides a sense of closure and hope. It shows Saeng moving beyond her grief and beginning to find her place in her new home, suggesting that while the past cannot be recovered, the future holds the possibility of growth and belonging. Through the symbolic imagery of the winter hibiscus and the returning geese, Ho leaves the reader with a sense of optimism about Saeng's ability to adapt, persevere, and ultimately thrive in her new environment."
