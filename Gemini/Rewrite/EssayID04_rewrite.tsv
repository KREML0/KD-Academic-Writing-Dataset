However, this resolution feels somewhat lackluster. Instead of merely trying again, a sense of renewed enthusiasm and passion for gardening would have provided a more satisfying and hopeful ending.

The melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding of the hibiscus itself would signal the opportune moment for her to try again, a promise whispered to herself as a new season approached.

This experience marks a turning point; America begins to feel less foreign.

With renewed optimism, she resolves to retake the test, confident in her future success, suggesting a growing sense of belonging and integration into American life."
11	8873	4	2	The concluding paragraph effectively ties back to the story's initial events. Saeng's failure on the test triggered a wave of homesickness and disappointment, leading her to purchase a plant as a source of comfort. This act mirrored her longing for her homeland and its familiar flora. The confession to her mother, while emotionally taxing, was followed by her mother's supportive actions, including preparing a comforting meal and assisting with the planting. While the new plant wasn't a perfect replacement for the memories of home, it represented a renewed sense of hope and determination. The ending emphasizes Saeng's resilience and her decision to persevere, rather than give up on her goals. It provides closure by highlighting the importance of family support and the power of personal memories in overcoming adversity, suggesting a more prepared and optimistic approach to the upcoming test. This reinforces the central theme of perseverance in the face of challenges.
12	8874	4	2	"My interpretation is that the story concludes with the final paragraph. This is because the events within the narrative are subsequently recounted, creating a cyclical pattern. The departure and eventual return of the geese, followed by another departure, seems to signify a recurring cycle. ""Take the test again,"" in my view, suggests this continuous loop of events, emphasizing the repetitive nature of the narrative."

14	8876	4	2	"The story concludes by highlighting Saeng's burgeoning determination. Despite her mother's initial disappointment and tears upon seeing the hibiscus, born from Saeng's own distress, her offer to help plant it provides a small measure of comfort. This shared act fosters Saeng's resolve to recover. The line, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" is crucial. ""Familiar"" signifies Saeng's growing acceptance that while life at home differs from her new country, she can adapt, cultivating a more optimistic outlook. Ultimately, this acceptance underscores Saeng's resilient spirit and her capacity to find comfort and familiarity in her new surroundings."
15	8877	4	2	"The concluding paragraph likely encapsulates the story's essence by weaving together key elements such as character names, seasonal symbolism, and botanical growth stages.

By framing hibiscus as a novel iteration of something valuable, the author underscores themes of innovation and the enduring appeal of fundamental qualities, ultimately synthesizing the story's core message in this final, resonant passage."
16	8878	4	2	This statement serves as the conclusion, highlighting the protagonist's profound belief in the flower's ability to bring her good fortune during her approaching examination. The flower, a symbol of familiarity, appears incongruous within its current setting, mirroring her own feelings of displacement, leading to a sense of shared experience and connection between them. This perceived kinship and her trust in the flower's symbolic power is what solidifies the belief that it will ensure a positive outcome.
17	8879	4	2	"The story concludes with Saeng, a poignant reminder of her longing for home. Her confidence in passing the test seemingly surges with the flower's bloom, a symbol deeply connected to her past. The simple utterance, ""Not like the kind we had before,"" speaks volumes of her homesickness. As spring arrives, the flower's blossoming becomes a source of strength, fueling her determination. It is this potent connection to home, this renewed resolve born from familiar beauty, that likely motivated the author's choice to end the narrative with Saeng, suggesting that her connection to home will play a pivotal role in her future success."
18	8880	4	2	Following Saeng's transformative experience of cultivating hibiscus and navigating the events of that pivotal year, she regained her confidence.

The hibiscus, with its ""rich sweet scent,"" provides comfort and a sense of familiarity, bolstering her resolve to retake the exam. Furthermore, Saeng's reflection on ""the quiet repetition of season upon season...like the geese,"" highlights her connection to the natural world. This connection inspires her decision to try again ""when the snow melts and the geese return."" Thus, the author effectively concludes the narrative by emphasizing Saeng's failure, the comforting presence of the hibiscus, her kinship with the geese, and ultimately, her resilient spirit and resolve to persevere."
20	8882	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with that specific paragraph because it evokes a powerful sense of longing for her homeland.

The return of the geese, coupled with the blossoming hibiscus, creates a vivid parallel to the cyclical nature of life and the enduring connection to one's roots, leaving the author with a resolute anticipation of going home.
21	8883	4	2	The concluding paragraph likely aims to instill confidence in Saeng, encouraging silent determination.

23	8885	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Sing to the Dawn,"" Saeng faces numerous challenges adapting to a culture vastly different from her own. The author concludes the story with Saeng's silent vow: ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending, chosen by Ho, serves to assure the reader that Saeng has discovered a renewed sense of hope, symbolized by the budding hibiscus. The flower also represents a sentimental connection to her home. Saeng's experience in the greenhouse demonstrates that sometimes, embracing obstacles is the most effective way to overcome them, allowing for a fresh start.

Geese migrate to warmer climates to escape the harsh winter, and flowers, seemingly dead, return in the spring. This cyclical pattern mirrors Saeng's journey. Just as the geese and flowers adapt to changing environments, Saeng will face the recurring challenge of adapting and integrating into her new country. The author uses this parallel to suggest that Saeng's struggle to fit in is not a singular event but an ongoing process, a recurring ""test"" that she will face with each new season of her life, thus providing a resonant and hopeful closure."
26	8888	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus""—""When they came back...then I will take that test again""—is a deliberate narrative choice that invites reader engagement and speculation. This open-ended conclusion strategically omits critical details, prompting the reader to ponder unresolved plot threads. The explicit failure on the test, the significance of ""her gentle grandmother,"" the role of Mrs. Lambert, and the very definition of ""home"" remain ambiguous, fostering a sense of incomplete understanding. This ambiguity encourages readers to seek further insight, potentially drawing them to other works by the author. Furthermore, the final paragraph serves as a potent literary device, cultivating dramatic tension through implied, rather than explicit, resolution. The reader is left to contemplate future possibilities: success or failure on the retake, a return ""home"" or continued displacement, and the overall trajectory of the protagonist's journey. The symbolic weight of the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus creates a temporal marker, promising a future confrontation with the initial challenge. The author likely employed this technique to maximize the story's lasting impression and to leave the reader contemplating the protagonist's uncertain fate, solidifying the narrative's dramatic impact."

The budding of the hibiscus signifies the beginning of Saeng's successful integration, starting with passing her driver's test. This narrative highlights the universal experience of adjusting to new circumstances, and Saeng's comfort in her past serves as solace amidst the challenges of change.

The convergence of these events clearly brings her a sense of profound comfort, suggesting a connection to her past that anchors her and provides the necessary confidence to face the challenge ahead, completing her journey with a renewed spirit.
31	8893	4	2	Her immediate goal was clear: pass the upcoming test. Failure stung, especially after the setback. Seeking solace, she purchased a plant for nineteen dollars and some change. The small greenery, with its familiar scent and texture, evoked memories of her old home, a comforting anchor in her present uncertainty. As winter approached, she watched the plant adapt, slowly but surely rooting itself in its new pot, in its new home. She felt a stirring of hope. If this small piece of her past could flourish in unfamiliar soil, then so could she. The plant's resilience became a symbol. Come spring, she resolved, she would face her challenges with renewed confidence, trusting that, like her plant, she too would grow and thrive in her new home, learning from her past and embracing her future.
32	8894	4	2	"Saeng's final words, ""I-I failed the test,"" echoed with disappointment. However, the author concludes the story with a message of hope: failing one test isn't the end. Saeng's journey will continue; she'll face the test again in the spring. This time, armed with the experience of her previous attempt and a renewed determination to do her best, she will undoubtedly approach the challenge with greater confidence. The author leaves us knowing that Saeng's story is one of resilience, not defeat, and that her future success remains a distinct possibility."

The narrative structure thus adopts a cyclical pattern, commencing with the test, progressing through the shared floral experience with her mother, and culminating in Saeng's resolution to attempt the test again, demonstrating a journey of growth and resilience that completes the narrative arc."
34	8896	4	2	The concluding paragraph is significant because it highlights Saeng's resilience in the face of adversity. Throughout the story, Saeng experiences homesickness triggered by the sight of a hibiscus, a potent symbol of her native Vietnam. Compounding her emotional distress, she also faces academic challenges, feeling alienated and out of place. Yet, the hibiscus ultimately serves as a symbol of hope and solace. The author's choice to end with this image underscores Saeng's ability to find comfort and strength amidst her struggles, suggesting that she can navigate her difficulties and maintain a hopeful outlook for the future.
35	8897	4	2	Returning home, Saeng noticed the flowers thrived with a beauty absent from their new garden. Inspired, she resolved to cultivate flowers reminiscent of her homeland. Her mother’s earlier observation echoed in her mind: though lacking the vibrant beauty of their former home's flora, the winter hibiscus possessed a resilience crucial for survival in the harsh climate. This resonated deeply with Saeng, making her understand that endurance and strength mattered more than mere aesthetic appeal. Planting the flowers became an act of remembrance, symbolizing her heritage, and a testament to the enduring spirit needed to flourish in a new environment, showing that true beauty lay in the ability to withstand adversity.

The story closes with a strong sense of anticipation for her assured victory.
37	8899	4	2	The story concludes with the hibiscus, a symbol of hope, beginning to bud. This blossoming coincides with the narrator's newfound happiness. The implication is cyclical: the return of the geese and the melting snow signal not just an end, but a prelude to repetition. The budding hibiscus suggests a renewed cycle of life, mirroring the narrator's emotional journey. The happiness she feels now foreshadows a continuous process, a recurring pattern of hope, loss, and eventual renewal, tied to the changing seasons and the enduring presence of the hibiscus. Therefore, the story closes on a note of bittersweet optimism, acknowledging the inevitable return of hardship while celebrating the persistent possibility of joy.
38	8900	4	2	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes as it does to instill a vital lesson: perseverance. The protagonist's initial driving test failure resonates deeply with me, especially as I approach my own test. Her experience underscores that repeated setbacks should not lead to abandonment of our goals. Life inevitably presents challenges, and only through persistence can we achieve our aspirations. Surrendering guarantees stagnation. The protagonist's resolve to retake the test when the hibiscus blooms in spring symbolizes renewed hope and determination. While I aspire to pass on my first attempt, as I did with the learner's permit, the narrative emphasizes the importance of unwavering commitment in all endeavors, big or small, because maintaining effort is essential for success. Therefore, we must embrace the spirit of the story's ending and never give up, allowing us to learn to achieve what we want."
39	8901	4	2	The inclusion of that sentence illuminates Saeng's deep affection for both the snow and her plants. It underscores her preference for the tactile engagement of gardening over the structured environment of school. Her passion lies in the act of planting and nurturing new life, revealing a character intrinsically connected to the natural world, showing how much she cares.
40	8902	4	2	"The concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's nascent acclimation to her environment. Initially, the narrative emphasizes her feelings of displacement, drawing a parallel to the winter hibiscus. Progressively, Saeng acknowledges the gradual familiarization with her surroundings, stating that repeated seasonal cycles have rendered previously alien elements ""almost familiar."" This suggests an ongoing process of adaptation. Therefore, the concluding statement, referencing the return of geese and the budding hibiscus in spring, coupled with her intention to retake the test, signifies a parallel between Saeng's adaptive journey and the resilience of the hibiscus itself. The author strategically positions this conclusion to underscore Saeng's evolving capacity to adapt, mirroring the natural cycles of renewal and resilience."
41	8903	4	2	"The conclusion offers the reader a sense of optimism. Despite purchasing the plant during a period of sadness, following a failed driving test and feelings of homesickness, the narrator’s hibiscus symbolizes hope. The blooming flower represents a parallel blooming of her own hope, spurring her to try again, potentially succeeding this time. While @MONTH1 may be a period of sadness and fear, she maintains faith in a positive resolution. She is gradually adjusting to her new life, noting that ""many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” This suggests that despite missing her homeland, she is slowly acclimatizing to her new environment. By spring, she anticipates feeling content and settled, confident enough to retake the driving test. Ultimately, the hibiscus embodies both the yearning for the past and the hopeful anticipation of the future, showing her growing acceptance."

Furthermore, the narrator's observation of geese with ""familiar"" looks to Saeng solidifies the geese as a potent symbol of home, ultimately illustrating that Saeng finds solace and readiness in the tangible reminders of her origins."
43	8905	4	2	"The author likely concludes with the hibiscus quote for several intertwined reasons. It serves as a potent symbol of resilience; the character's academic setback isn't a full stop, but a comma. This flower represents her unwavering spirit, a morale boost signaling perseverance. The personification of the hibiscus—""The hibiscus will be budding""—suggests her own forthcoming growth and blossoming. She envisions a period of learning and experience, positioning her for a renewed attempt at the test come springtime. Furthermore, the hibiscus likely evokes a sense of home, a source of comfort and courage. Gazing upon it, she'll find the strength to confront her challenges, including the looming test. The quote also neatly concludes the narrative arc, reinforcing the central theme: a testament to the character's resolve to never surrender, but to persist, learn, and ultimately, try again. Thus, the hibiscus embodies hope, memory, and the cyclical nature of growth following perceived failure."
44	8906	4	2	"In the concluding paragraph, the author skillfully weaves together the story's key elements: the driving test, the geese, and the hibiscus. The image of melting snow and returning geese—echoing Saeng's earlier observation of their ""distinctive V etched against the evening sky""—serves as a potent metaphor for her personal transformation. Like the geese that migrate with the seasons, Saeng has undergone a significant change. She recognizes that what once seemed foreign has now become familiar, highlighting the universal human experience of adapting to new environments. Saeng's journey, symbolized by these recurring motifs, underscores the profound adjustments we all face, though hers was perhaps more pronounced."
45	8907	4	2	The story concludes as it began, but the echo is richer, deeper. The author, in essence, revisits the initial paragraph, a seed of an idea now fully bloomed. He takes what was a simple statement and weaves it into the narrative's fabric, adding layers of complexity. Where there was once only declaration, now there is experience. The core idea remains, but it is viewed through the lens of the protagonist's journey, burdened by the weight of their choices, and complicated by the introduction of conflict. It is the same song, but sung with a different voice, reflecting the trials and tribulations encountered along the way.

Its scent evoked powerful memories of her grandmother in Vietnam. Driven by nostalgia, Saeng sought to purchase the plant, eventually acquiring it from a flower shop despite its high price, a reflection of its rarity. Bringing it home, she shared her feelings with her mother, who also connected the plant to their homeland. Her mother, while understanding, expressed concern over the expense. They planted the hibiscus in their garden, and as it was placed in the earth, a flock of geese flew overhead. Saeng pinned her hopes on the spring; the return of the hibiscus would coincide with a renewed opportunity to pass her driver's test, mirroring the season's theme of rebirth and new beginnings, giving her a second chance. The blooming flowers and budding life of the season served as a reminder of the possibility of growth and success, allowing her to approach the future with optimism.
53	8915	4	2	"I believe the author uses the flower metaphor to represent personal resilience and the cyclical nature of growth. The idea is that even after setbacks, like a flower in winter, one can bloom again. This suggests a powerful message about second chances, emphasizing that failures aren't final. The line, ""they said there were many of things that she had thought of strangely, season up season,"" highlights how external criticism shouldn't deter one's unique path. It’s a reminder that perceived oddities or mistakes don't define us, and that renewed growth is always possible.

56	8918	4	2	"The story concludes with the return of normalcy and beauty, suggesting Saeng will finally take her test then.

The peaceful return of beauty and order seems to signal a time when Saeng feels most capable and ready to face academic challenges."
57	8919	4	2	"Change and disappointment can be overwhelming. For some, the mere thought of change is terrifying. Saeng, the protagonist of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" experiences a major upheaval when she relocates to @LOCATION1. Everything is unfamiliar, a stark contrast to her previous life. This, combined with the sting of failing her driver's exam, leaves her feeling utterly helpless. Seeking solace, she purchases a winter hibiscus plant. Inspired by the plant's resilience, and the memories it evokes, Saeng makes a promise: she will retake the test when the flower blooms again in the spring. The winter hibiscus, therefore, becomes a symbol of hope, fueling Saeng's determination to overcome her setbacks and embrace her new surroundings."
58	8920	4	2	The author likely aimed to convey Saeng's emotions upon taking her vow, alongside their own feelings regarding the event. Furthermore, the statement in question likely served a dual purpose: to pique the reader's interest and to facilitate a deeper understanding of Saeng's experience and the author's perspective, ultimately drawing the reader into the emotional core of the narrative.
59	8921	4	2	"The final paragraph is significant due to its use of foreshadowing, future reference, and depiction of continuous behavior. The vow Saeng makes—to retake the test when spring returns with melting snow, migrating geese, and budding hibiscus—acts as foreshadowing, hinting at a future event. This statement is explicitly a future reference, outlining her intentions for the coming year. Furthermore, the commitment to repeat the action (""I will take that test again"") demonstrates a continuation of her past efforts and aspirations, highlighting consistent behavior. Therefore, foreshadowing, future reference, and continuous behavior effectively explain why Saeng's statement is impactful, revealing her planned actions and reinforcing her persistent dedication towards achieving her goal."
60	8922	4	2	"The story's conclusion suggests life's ongoing nature. Saeng's failed test leads her to an overpriced hibiscus, a symbol of her lost ""home,"" a place she now only remembers with tears. The plant embodies those memories and the life she yearns to reclaim. Her personal challenge is to overcome the pain associated with that past. She vows that upon the return of the geese, a potent symbol of cyclical return, she will revisit the greenhouse, a place reminiscent of her former home. There, she will attempt to utter the word ""home"" without succumbing to grief and without the need for an expensive memento to ground her, indicating a journey toward emotional healing and acceptance. This cycle of failure, remembrance, and renewed determination implies a hopeful outlook, where Saeng commits to confronting her past and attempting to rebuild her sense of ""home,"" suggesting that life persists, even after loss."
61	8923	4	2	"In Ho's 'Winter Hibiscus,' the precise nature of Saeng's failed test remains ambiguous, yet its significance to both Saeng and her mother, and to her integration into @LOCATION1, is evident. The narrative underscores Saeng's profound longing for her homeland, Vietnam. The hibiscus purchase triggers a flood of poignant memories, revealing their persistent presence in her daily life. Saeng grapples with preserving her Vietnamese heritage while simultaneously adapting to @CAPS2 customs. However, certain aspirations, like succeeding on the test, transcend cultural boundaries. Saeng understands that these memories can serve as a source of strength and motivation. The story's concluding line resonates with empowerment, reflecting her newfound ability to reconcile memory and adaptation: ""when this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again."" This final assertion suggests Saeng's integration of past and future, revealing that both memory and adaptation will help her succeed."
62	8924	4	2	The concluding paragraph highlights Saeng's adaptation to her new country. Despite missing her homeland, a place she struggled to name without tears, especially the wind she remembered, Saeng found solace. Her purchase of a plant, costing @MONEY1, served as a tangible reminder of her origins, offering comfort in unfamiliar surroundings. The implication is that Saeng's familiarity with the changing seasons played a crucial role in her adjustment. The cyclical return of the geese symbolizes hope and a renewed sense of purpose, as she plans to retake the test, signifying her commitment to building a future in her new home. Ultimately, Saeng's story demonstrates resilience and the gradual process of finding belonging in a foreign land.
63	8925	4	2	"The concluding paragraph serves to establish a sense of belonging for Saeng.

64	8926	4	2	Saeng's vow concludes the story because it underscores her unwavering commitment. Despite her initial failure, her resolve to succeed remains strong. She patiently awaits the thaw, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus, all signs that the time is right for her renewed attempt, highlighting her dedication to achieving her goal. The ending emphasizes that Saeng will return when the seasons align.
65	8927	4	2	I'm betting the author wrapped things up the way they did because the entire story, the whole shebang, unfolded during winter. Maybe they felt limited by that seasonal setting. I reckon they concluded the narrative with an eye towards potentially revisiting the core situation, but this time transplanting it to a different season. Perhaps the author thought they could achieve a more compelling or nuanced outcome by exploring how those same plot elements might play out against a different seasonal backdrop; ultimately, I think the author wanted to see if a different season could elevate the story even further.
66	8928	4	2	The concluding paragraph suggests Saeng intends to retake the examination in the spring. The phrase ""when the snow melts and the geese return"" implies a commitment to the next spring test date. Her conviction is strengthened by the addition of details, such as ""hibiscus is budding."" These additions point to Saeng's renewed determination to succeed. The author's choice to end the story here underscores Saeng's resolve and what she communicates through her final statement. The paragraph effectively emphasizes her dedication by highlighting a clear future intention to take the test again."
67	8929	4	2	The story concludes with a promise tied to the cyclical return of spring: melting snows, returning geese, and a budding hibiscus. This imagery signifies a fresh start, a new year, and renewed hope. The character's intention to retake the test at this time indicates a commitment to perseverance. Like someone who initially fails and patiently awaits another opportunity, or someone determined to keep trying for their driver's license, she's expressing a willingness to persist until she achieves her goal, understanding that setbacks are temporary and new opportunities will arise with time. The return of spring will be a symbol of a new beginning.
68	8930	4	2	"Saeng's passion for planting was evident to her mother, a devotion the author highlights through a specific paragraph. This passage effectively reveals Saeng's deep connection to plants.

The hibiscus flower, a vibrant splash of color, served as a potent reminder of her grandmother and the cherished memories of home. It symbolized the possibility of flourishing even in unfamiliar surroundings. The speaker envisioned spring as a period of renewal, a chance to acclimate to her new environment, forge friendships, and create lasting memories. By then, the initial sting of past failures would fade, softened by the hibiscus's comforting presence and the hope it instilled. The blooming flower, therefore, represented not just a return to normalcy, but a fresh start, empowering her to face the test with renewed confidence and a hopeful spirit."
72	8934	4	2	Basically, I'm waiting for a nice day to do anything. It needs to be warm enough, but not too hot, so I can finally play outside with the kids. Then, when it's perfect weather, I'll retake my test; a beautiful day is what I'm waiting for. So, I'm postponing everything until Mother Nature cooperates.

74	8936	4	2	The story likely concluded with a sense of profound setback for the protagonist. It felt like a descent to the lowest point, a nadir from which the only direction is upward. This setback, presumably a failure, serves as the catalyst for a renewed commitment. The narrative suggests an impending restart, a chance to retake the crucial test. This time, however, the protagonist is armed with the determination to succeed, vowing to overcome the previous obstacles and achieve a different, more positive outcome, thus completing the cycle.
75	8937	4	2	"The paragraph closes on a note of wistful emotion, revealing the author's resignation to winter's impact on her garden. The cold season brings death to her plants, halting her efforts. However, a sense of hope underscores this sentiment; the author anticipates the return of ""saeng""—life, growth—after the harsh winter yields to spring. Like the promise of renewed growth, the phrase ""I will take the test again"" suggests a cyclical return to her gardening endeavors. ""Saeng"" embodies the perseverance to face the challenge of gardening alongside her mother, a test of effort to be undertaken again in the next growing season, reinforcing the cyclical nature of gardening and life itself."
76	8938	4	2	The author likely concludes with that specific paragraph because it encapsulates the protagonist's anticipated activities for the coming year. This period will be defined by her continued presence alongside her mother, assisting in the garden. The implication is that she will remain primarily in her mother's company, seemingly without external friendships, dedicating her time and attention to their shared space. This paints a picture of her immediate future and serves as a conclusive note.The author ends there, and you see why. That last paragraph, it’s not just words; it’s a year stretching out. A year of dirt under her nails, not from some playground, but from her mom's garden. You can almost smell the tomatoes ripening. A whole year of sun and soil, and just her mom. No giggling with friends, no whispered secrets under the bleachers. Just the two of them, side by side, in the quiet green. It’s her year, defined. A year lived close to the earth, and closer still to her mother. And in that quiet, contained world, you understand why the story stops: because for her, right then, that's everything.
77	8939	4	2	"The author concludes the story by drawing a parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus plant, highlighting Saeng's newfound resilience. Just as the hibiscus will endure the harsh winter, Saeng is poised to overcome her personal challenges. Her failure on the driving test and the pangs of homesickness represent a metaphorical winter, but she, like the plant, will bloom in the spring. This blooming signifies her triumph over adversity, her decision to retake the test, and her commitment to building a happy life despite missing her homeland. The hibiscus serves as a potent symbol, reminding her of the strength required to persevere. Ultimately, the story's conclusion emphasizes the lesson Saeng learns from the ""Winter Hibiscus"": the ability to overcome obstacles and find renewed strength even in the face of hardship, demonstrating the enduring power of hope and determination."
78	8940	4	2	The author uses the final paragraph to illustrate Saeng's burgeoning acceptance of her new environment. The winter hibiscus, though less visually striking than flowers from her past, possesses a resilience vital for surviving the harsh winters of her new home. The symbolic connection drawn between the familiar beauty of her old home and the hardy strength of her new one underscores the idea that while change is inevitable, fundamental similarities persist. This realization is pivotal, suggesting Saeng will carry cherished memories of her past, using them as a source of strength to navigate the challenges she currently faces, finding solace and fortitude in the enduring power of memory and adaptation.
79	8941	4	2	"The author concludes the story by drawing a parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus plant, highlighting their shared journey of adaptation and resilience. Saeng's challenge lies in acclimating to her new life, symbolized by her need to pass the driver's test, which she reveals to her mother, stating she failed it the ""first"" time. Similarly, the hibiscus faces the challenge of surviving the winter in a new environment. Her mother’s reassurance, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months…that’s what matters,” underscores the plant’s tenacity. The hibiscus's survival through winter represents its successful adaptation. Saeng’s final declaration, ""in the spring...I will take that test again,"" mirrors the plant's anticipated blossoming. If Saeng overcomes her obstacle by passing the test in spring, coinciding with the hibiscus's resurgence, the symbolism deepens. Both Saeng and the hibiscus would demonstrate a determined spirit to adapt, simultaneously conquering their respective challenges, solidifying the author's message of resilience."
80	8942	4	2	Basically, the story circles back to the test because that's how it began. Saeng failed it the first time. The idea is, when the weather's better, she'll have a better shot at passing. So, she returns to retake the test. That's the core reason for her return.
81	8943	4	2	"The author's deliberate ambiguity in the story's conclusion serves to generate suspense and prolong reader engagement. The omission of explicit details regarding the nature of the ""test"" is a crucial element in achieving this effect. By withholding this information, the author compels the reader to actively participate in the narrative, prompting speculation and interpretation. The abrupt declaration of failure upon Saeng's encounter with her mother amplifies the intrigue, leaving the reader with lingering questions about the test's parameters and Saeng's shortcomings, effectively ensuring continued contemplation beyond the story's immediate conclusion. This strategic use of narrative closure ultimately transforms the reading experience into an exercise in active deduction."
82	8944	4	2	"The concluding paragraph suggests a sequel is likely. Several clues point to this possibility. The immediate return mentioned at the paragraph's outset, coupled with Saeng's intention to retake the test, signals incompletion. The absence of a conventional ""happily ever after"" ending, replaced by reflections on personal growth, reinforces the sense of an ongoing narrative. The author may plan to explore whether Saeng ultimately succeeds, leaving readers anticipating a future installment."
83	8945	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves as a potent metaphor for renewal, a central theme within the text. The return of geese after winter embodies this fresh start, signaling the commencement of new families and cycles. Similarly, the hibiscus, shedding its leaves in winter only to regenerate in spring, mirrors this process of rebirth. By positioning this imagery at the end, the author underscores the cyclical nature of life and hope. Specifically, it foreshadows Saeng's opportunity to retake her driving test, aligning her journey with the natural world's rhythm of renewal and offering a symbolic promise of a new beginning, much like the geese and hibiscus. Thus, the author uses the paragraph as a tool that demonstrates that everything has the potential to be reborn and everything will get a new chance at life.
84	8946	4	2	The story concludes with the return of the geese, a powerful symbol of Saeng's unwavering determination to pass her driving test. Just as winter gives way to spring, so too will Saeng's challenges fade, allowing her to retake the test. The arrival of spring further underscores this theme of renewal and rebirth, signifying a fresh opportunity for Saeng, imbued with renewed faith and encouragement. This ending is profoundly effective, prompting reflection on the symbolic weight of the geese, the hibiscus, and the season itself, and how they collectively contribute to the story's hopeful resolution, reinforcing Saeng's resilient spirit.
85	8947	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph to suggest a revival or return in springtime, coinciding with the melting snow and the return of geese. Furthermore, the author seems to favor the spring setting, perhaps drawn to the sunny skies and the sight of geese on a body of water. I, too, find the spring setting appealing, as it fosters creativity and provides a beautiful environment. Therefore, it seems plausible that the author chose that particular paragraph to conclude the story precisely because of the evocative power and hopeful imagery associated with springtime, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism.
86	8948	4	2	"""Winter Hibiscus"" chronicles a young girl's relocation with her mother to @LOCATION1, detailing her struggles to adapt to a new cultural landscape. The narrative subtly introduces the concept of a recurring ""test"" the daughter faces. Her closing remark, ""In the spring…then I will take that test again,"" hints at its cyclical nature. The girl's dismissive comment about the winter hibiscus, stating ""it’s-it’s not a real one,"" suggests a longing for authentic memories of her former home, memories that are fading or somehow incomplete. Furthermore, her preference for something other ""than the Big Mac"" symbolizes her resistance to fully embracing the @CAPS1 culture. This preference highlights her lingering attachment to her own cultural identity. Ultimately, the girl's test in @MONTH1 seems to be about mastering the art of navigating cultural transitions and finding a way to remember her past with fondness rather than sorrow, suggesting a journey toward a more balanced and accepting perspective."
87	8949	4	2	The story concludes with the girl's promise to return the following spring, after the snow melts, to retake the test. This ending, as the author intended, underscores the theme of perseverance and the potential for unexpected enjoyment. The author uses the girl's willingness to try again to convey the message that even in the face of initial failure, a renewed attempt can lead to a positive outcome and a change in perspective, ultimately illustrating that trying new things can be surprisingly rewarding.
88	8950	4	2	"The concluding paragraph effectively unifies the narrative's various threads. Specifically, it links Saeng's initial flower purchase to its underlying purpose, and further connects her past experiences in Vietnam with her present life in the United States. The passage, ""carefully Saeng dicked it up and smilled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. the familiar programe filled her lungs,"" illustrates this unification, revealing that the flower procured from the shop triggers memories of her homeland. Ultimately, this connection between past and present, facilitated by the flower, justifies the author's choice to conclude the story with this poignant scene, providing a sense of closure and understanding."
89	8951	4	2	"The concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's renewed determination to pass her test in the spring. The hibiscus flower serves as a powerful symbol, evoking cherished memories of her homeland and instilling a sense of hope and self-belief.

This imagery reinforces the theme of rebirth and new beginnings, signifying Saeng's optimistic outlook as she prepares to face the challenge ahead, her spirit rekindled by the poignant reminder of her roots."
90	8952	4	2	The author chose to conclude the story with that particular paragraph for a reason.

It was important for the author to leave the audience with a feeling that the character would not be deterred by failure, and would continue striving to achieve her ambitions.
91	8953	4	2	The story concludes in a way that suggests the girl’s resilience; she won't surrender to the challenges of the test or her new environment. Like a seed carried by the wind, she'll adapt, transforming this foreign land into a semblance of her beloved Vietnam. Her heart aches for the familiar rhythms of her past, a life she longs to reclaim, but the ending implies a future where she perseveres, weaving the threads of her old home into the fabric of her new one, creating a space where she can finally belong, her memories fueling her journey forward.
92	8954	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph provides resolution to the preceding narrative. Saeng's stress regarding the @CAPS1 test and her longing for the Vietnamese hibiscus are central themes. The final lines, ""when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again,"" employ symbolism. The melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus represent transformation and assimilation. Ho suggests Saeng's success on the test and overall well-being are contingent upon her ability to adapt to her new environment. Therefore, Ho, the author of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" utilizes a powerful, symbolic conclusion to resolve the story's core conflicts."
93	8955	4	2	"Saeng’s failed driver’s test crushed her spirits, dimming her outlook on the future. But then, the sight of the hibiscus plant sparked a renewed sense of hope. Her mother's words echoed in her mind: ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters."" The hibiscus, though not conventionally beautiful, possessed a resilience that allowed it to endure hardship. Saeng identified with the plant, recognizing in herself a similar capacity for survival in a new and unfamiliar environment. Despite the challenges of adapting to a new country, Saeng drew strength from her family and her own inner resolve, proving that any obstacle can be overcome with self-belief and familial support. Ultimately, Saeng's experience with the hibiscus helped her realize that inner strength and perseverance are more valuable than outward appearances, enabling her to face the future with renewed optimism."
94	8956	4	2	As the geese prepared for their winter departure and the hibiscus bloomed, an unusual combination signaling the season's shift, the author likely concluded with that final paragraph to reveal her intention to retake the test next year. This detail strongly suggests she didn't pass the exam during that particular autumn, marked by these specific natural events. The author's description paints a picture of a specific time, tying her failure to the imagery of migrating geese and blooming hibiscus, thus subtly implying she's gearing up for another attempt once the seasons circle back. This sets the stage for a future endeavor, highlighting her resolve despite the setback, as she will face the challenge again.
95	8957	4	2	The story concludes fittingly, emphasizing the profound significance of the hibiscus for S'aeng.

108	8970	4	2	For Saeng, the hibiscus wasn't just a flower; it was a trial. She believed she'd stumbled, unable to release the grip of yesterday and fully inhabit the present. The hibiscus, a vivid echo of her homeland, had prompted an impulsive purchase, costing over @MONEY1, a sum she and her mother desperately needed. In essence, the plant became a symbol of her perceived failure, a tangible representation of her inability to move forward, causing her deep regret and solidifying her sense of defeat.

110	8972	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng and her mother relocate from their familiar homeland to a foreign place, a jarring transition for Saeng. Struggling to adjust, she faces a significant setback when she fails an important test, leaving her disheartened and yearning for the comforts of home. Seeking solace, Saeng purchases a winter hibiscus, a tangible reminder of her past life. However, the act of planting the hibiscus sparks a shift within her. Instead of dwelling on her disappointment, she resolves to embrace the challenge of adapting. She sets a personal deadline, vowing to retake the test by the time the hibiscus blooms. Thus, the story concludes with a sense of hope and Saeng's newfound determination to integrate into her new environment, suggesting a promising path forward."
111	8973	4	2	The concluding paragraph of the story offers an optimistic outlook on Saeng's ability to navigate the challenges of settling in a new country. The geese, initially foreign, have become a familiar sight, suggesting her growing adaptation to her adopted home. The budding hibiscus, mirroring Saeng's own struggle to thrive in an unfamiliar environment, symbolizes her potential for flourishing in @LOCATION1. Her renewed determination to pass the driver's test, which initially represented a barrier to integration, signifies her commitment to overcoming obstacles and fully embracing her new life. Thus, the author ends the story on a hopeful note, encapsulating the theme of successful adaptation through a positive and forward-looking message.
112	8974	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the conclusion intertwines the hibiscus's budding with the protagonist's decision to retake her test, creating a powerful symbolic connection. The presence of geese further emphasizes her integration into a new culture, as she now understands their migratory patterns. The hibiscus's budding transcends its literal meaning; it represents a personal resurgence, mirroring the renewal of spring. This symbolic rebirth fuels her confidence, prompting her to retake the test, timed perfectly with her own ""budding"" in springtime. Thus, the geese, the hibiscus, and the retaken test are all integral elements in the story's resolution, illustrating the harmonious blend of her past and her evolving adaptation to a new environment, showcasing her resilience and growth."
113	8975	4	2	As the geese herald the return of spring, and the first flowers tentatively unfurl, she anticipates renewing her gardening efforts. Her ambition is clear: to cultivate the most impressive garden in the area. More than just a hobby, it's a cherished tradition she's determined to uphold, ensuring its continuation for years to come, thus completing her heartfelt mission.
114	8976	4	2	"Saeng's concluding thoughts reveal her apprehension. She doubts the winter hibiscus survived, picturing it no longer rooted in the ground. She anticipates returning to find her garden vanished beneath a blanket of snow. This bleak vision fuels her resolve to ""take that test again,"" a metaphor for restarting her horticultural journey. She envisions herself retracing her steps, beginning anew with the fundamental principles of nurturing her plants and flowers, suggesting a cyclical pattern of loss and renewal in her gardening endeavors and reaffirming her commitment."
115	8977	4	2	"Saeng missed Vietnam terribly; even uttering the words ""at home"" felt impossible without a tremor. Planting the hibiscus, a vibrant piece of her past, sparked a renewed sense of life, a yearning to truly belong in her new American surroundings. Despite failing her driving test, a symbol of independence and integration, Saeng refused to surrender. She silently vowed to herself that come spring, with the melting snows, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, she would face the test again. Saeng wouldn't give up, determined to conquer this challenge and create a home for herself in this new land, persevering until she succeeded."
116	8978	4	2	"The concluding paragraph likely serves to connect with the character's internal thoughts. The warmth of her welcoming smile suggests a sense of relief and joy at Saeng ìcheep's return. Her dialogue, a mix of playful scolding (""It's past time, what took you so long?"") and genuine inquiry (""Now did it go? Did you?""), reveals her deep investment in Saeng ìcheep's well-being and experiences. This emotional response highlights the close relationship between the characters, emphasizing the significance of Saeng ìcheep's return. She expresses a sense of relief and happiness as she welcomes Saeng ìcheep home."
117	8979	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" signifies a hopeful new beginning for Saeng. Her silent vow to retake the test in spring, coinciding with the thaw, the return of geese, and the hibiscus's budding, establishes a parallel between Saeng and the resilient winter hibiscus. As her mother notes, this particular hibiscus, though less conventionally beautiful, possesses the strength to endure the harsh winter. Similarly, Saeng embodies this resilience, capable of weathering the setback of failing the test. The hibiscus's eventual bloom symbolizes Saeng's future success, suggesting that her current failure is merely a temporary winter before her own springtime of achievement. The ending effectively connects Saeng's evolving feelings about her new and old homes, highlighting her growing ability to overcome challenges, thus solidifying the anticipation for Saeng’s renewed effort and eventual triumph in the spring."
118	8980	4	2	The author likely concluded the story with that particular paragraph because the hibiscus flower symbolizes overcoming challenges. The protagonist's renewed desire to retake the test signifies a need to prove her capabilities to her mother. The hibiscus, acting as a source of strength, instilled a newfound confidence, empowering her to believe in her ability to succeed the second time around and ultimately validating her potential.
119	8981	4	2	The author's choice to conclude the story as they did serves multiple purposes. Primarily, the ending fosters a sense of hope within the reader, suggesting the cyclical nature of life and the availability of second chances, and emphasizing the significance of persistence. The final paragraph generates hope by illustrating the inevitable return of life and opportunity. This inclusion aims to leave the reader with a positive feeling, assured that hope persists. Furthermore, the author uses the ending to convey the message that individuals are consistently afforded new opportunities, regardless of past actions, a crucial lesson the author intends to impart. Finally, the conclusion underscores the vital role of persistence in life. Through natural imagery like melting snow, returning geese, and blooming flowers, the author demonstrates the continuous, almost relentless, drive of nature to persevere, symbolizing the importance of not surrendering. Consequently, the author's decision to end the story with this specific paragraph is deliberate and multifaceted. The paragraph's hopeful tone and its reinforcement of second chances, coupled with analogies emphasizing the necessity of persistence, make it a powerful and purposeful conclusion.
120	8982	4	2	The author ends with that paragraph to show us how Saeng connects with spring. Seeing flowers bloom makes her feel at home. It’s like she draws strength from that feeling, boosting her confidence. This newfound confidence makes her believe she can pass the test, closing the story on a hopeful note.
121	8983	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng resolving to retake the test. This final thought emphasizes her unwavering determination despite her initial failure. The winter hibiscus, a symbol of her grandmother, is central to this resolution. Saeng silently vows to try again in the spring, coinciding with the snow's melting, the geese's return, and, crucially, the hibiscus's budding. This budding represents her grandmother's return, a resurgence of the strength and encouragement Saeng needs to succeed. Saeng equates the blossoming of the flower with the return of her grandmother's spirit, believing that this renewed connection will provide her with the necessary fortitude to face the test once more, illustrating that familial support can fuel personal perseverance.
122	8984	4	2	The author concludes with the image of the hibiscus, ready to bloom anew, to illustrate Saeng's resilience. Like that resilient flower, dormant through winter but poised to burst forth in the spring, Saeng, too, will face future challenges. However, the hibiscus's inherent ability to overcome the dormancy of winter mirrors Saeng's own capacity to triumph over adversity and begin again, suggesting a hopeful future for her journey. The symbol of the budding hibiscus perfectly encapsulates Saeng's spirit, highlighting her potential for renewal and her unwavering strength as she navigates the complexities of life, showing that even after hardship, a fresh start, full of vibrant possibilities, is always within reach.
123	8985	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, marked by melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus. This ending leaves the narrative open, potentially encouraging readers to imagine their own resolution or envision a sequel. By concluding in this manner, the author relinquishes complete control, empowering the reader to participate in shaping the story's ultimate fate, which is a common technique.
124	8986	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to underscore the narrative's implications, compelling the reader to contemplate the protagonist's future. By ending with uncertainty, the author reignites the reader's cognitive engagement, prompting speculation regarding the character's survival and adaptation within an unfamiliar environment. This narrative strategy effectively highlights the protagonist's resilience in the face of adversity, and simultaneously emphasizes the perpetual presence of challenges in life, testing the character's ability to overcome the trials ahead. Consequently, the ending successfully fosters a sense of anticipation and reinforces the theme of enduring hardship.
125	8987	4	2	The author's choice to conclude the story with the final paragraph serves a crucial emotional purpose. The protagonist, Saeng, expresses her intention to retake the test when the hibiscus blooms in spring. She anticipates that the blooming hibiscus, a symbol of her homeland, will provide her with the strength and comfort needed to succeed. Ultimately, Saeng hopes that witnessing the hibiscus in bloom will evoke memories of home, fortifying her resolve and enabling her to pass the test, completing the emotional arc of the story.
126	8988	4	2	Saeng's story concludes with potent symbols of transformation. The hibiscus, altered from her memories of home yet now budding, mirrors Saeng's own burgeoning happiness and resilience. This familiar blossoming instills in her the courage needed to confront her challenges. The geese, meanwhile, act as a seasonal marker, their return synchronized with the plant's blooming. Without this final scene, the narrative would lack the full weight of Saeng's memories and their impact. The author implies that Saeng's initial struggles stemmed from the unfamiliarity of her new environment; the hibiscus buds, a tangible link to home, promise the confidence she needs to conquer her driving test, and ultimately, any other obstacle. The plant and geese together represent a circularity, a returning home that provides strength to move forward.
127	8989	4	2	Basically, the author puts that in there 'cause it proves she's a fighter, not a quitter. And if she's still in the game, she's got more chances to win. Her determination is key because it opens the door for future opportunities.
128	8990	4	2	"The story's conclusion, Saeng's renewed vow to pass her driving test, is directly linked to her emotional journey. Initially, a somber mood is established; ""Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test,"" immediately paints a picture of disappointment and solitude. However, the narrative shifts when she encounters the plant. Buying the plant, despite its cost relative to her mother's garden seeds, becomes a pivotal moment. The plant symbolizes resilience, a quality both Saeng and, eventually, her mother recognize. Just as the author recalls a personal anecdote of initial skepticism turning to affection for a purchased item, Saeng's mother comes to appreciate the plant's significance to her daughter. Seeing the plant's positive impact – the courage and happiness it instills in Saeng – motivates her to try the driver's test again, making it a fitting and hopeful resolution to the story."
129	8991	4	2	"The concluding paragraph's value is questionable; while it extends the narrative and attempts closure, its effectiveness is debatable. The assertion that it provides a ""good ending"" lacks specific justification and relies on subjective interpretation. A more rigorous analysis would examine how the conclusion resonates with the story's themes, character development, and plot resolution, instead of simply stating its perceived quality. The author should therefore elucidate the paragraph's specific contributions to the narrative's overall impact, rather than assuming its inherent worth. Ultimately, the conclusion's merit hinges on demonstrating its functional necessity within the story's broader context, not merely its presence as an extended epilogue."
130	8992	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves a discernible purpose: to elucidate the narrative's aftermath. This concluding section aims to provide clarity regarding subsequent events, solidifying the author's intention to offer a comprehensive understanding. I posit that this drive for resolution and completeness motivated the author's strategic choice to conclude the story with this definitive paragraph, leaving the reader with a sense of closure.
131	8993	4	2	Saeng's decision to wait until winter's end signals her desire for a fresh start. Her previous attempt at gardening faltered when she mistakenly tilled the plants, a setback she hopes to avoid in the future. Inspired by her mother, Saeng aspires to cultivate her own green thumb. The coming of spring represents not only a change in season, but also a chance for Saeng to learn from her mistakes and pursue her dream of becoming a gardener, ensuring the new season is one of growth and accomplishment.
132	8994	4	2	And so, the journey wasn't truly over. It was a pause, a breath held before the plunge back into the familiar chaos. I clung to the quiet moments, the echoes of laughter, the ghost of shared dreams. But beneath the surface, a current stirred. A premonition, perhaps, or simply the stubborn refusal to believe that endings are ever truly final. I knew, with a certainty that settled deep in my bones, that this wasn't goodbye. It was merely farewell for now. I would wait, watch, and remember, secure in the knowledge that their return, in some form, was inevitable. The threads that bound us were too strong, the story unfinished. And so, I understood that the realization of their eventual return was slowly dawning within me.
133	8995	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng's silent vow, a promise to herself whispered as she anticipates the spring's thaw. This moment reveals Saeng's newfound strength, forged in the crucible of adapting to her unfamiliar surroundings. The painful experience of her previous test, marked by tears and self-doubt, fuels her resolve. No longer the vulnerable girl, she now possesses a quiet confidence born from adjustment and resilience. It is this inner fortitude that empowers her to face the challenge again, transforming her past weakness into a powerful determination to succeed when the snow melts and spring returns.
134	8996	4	2	Saeng's confidence, persistence, and memories provide insight into the author's concluding paragraph. Since leaving Vietnam, Saeng has struggled with unhappiness and longing for her homeland; every glimpse of Vietnamese culture serves as a reminder of what she misses. The final paragraph, with Saeng's resolve to retake the test, underscores her self-belief and determination. Her declaration to try again highlights her persistence, suggesting she won't easily succumb to discouragement. Saeng's profound homesickness extends to nearly everything about Vietnam, including the food, her family, and their customs. It's plausible that her memories, though cherished, hinder her concentration, especially during the driver's test. The flower she purchased symbolizes her desire to succeed and improve her emotional state. Ultimately, one hopes Saeng finds happiness and integration in the United States, learning to appreciate her new home while cherishing her roots, which will allow her to find peace.
135	8997	4	2	The hibiscus, vibrant and hopeful, mirrors the protagonist's journey. Its blossoms represent her past, a life now fading. As the plant buds anew, so too does she embark on a fresh beginning. The hibiscus, therefore, isn't merely flora, but a symbol of her evolving narrative, its vibrant growth embodying the promise of a brighter, revitalized existence as she moves towards an optimistic future.
136	8998	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with the flower observation to reinforce a central theme. It appears Saeng draws a parallel between her own experience and the flower's situation. Initially a wildflower, the plant is transplanted into a pot, mirroring Saeng's transition from a carefree existence to life in @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng experience a sense of displacement. Given this symbolic connection, the story's conclusion suggests Saeng finds hope in the flower's resilience. The author implies that Saeng believes if the flower can endure the harsh winter, she too can overcome the challenges of @LOCATION1 and succeed in her endeavors. Therefore, the concluding paragraph serves to solidify the author's intended message of perseverance and adaptation in the face of adversity.
137	8999	4	2	The author ends the story with Saeng's resolve fresh in the reader's mind, a deliberate choice to highlight her unwavering determination to conquer the driving test. Rather than dwell on a potential failure, the story concludes on an optimistic note, ensuring Saeng isn't defined by disappointment. This narrative arc suggests a future attempt where Saeng, armed with experience and a clearer understanding of the test's demands, will be better equipped to succeed. This sets the stage for a more positive and empowering chapter in her life, promising a brighter winter ahead, fueled by her resilience.
138	9000	4	2	The author's chosen conclusion suggests a central theme: perseverance. Obstacles and setbacks are presented not as endpoints, but as challenges to be overcome through persistent effort. The narrative arc implies that repeated attempts, even in the face of failure, are essential to eventual success. The story, therefore, likely aims to demonstrate the value of resilience and the importance of continuous striving towards a goal, reinforcing the idea that ultimate achievement often requires sustained dedication and repeated attempts, ultimately leading to triumph.
139	9001	4	2	Saeng's resolve to retake the test, as the author concludes the story, stems from memories, resilience, and hardship. Resilience is paramount; facing failure once demands courage to try again, especially given the emotional distress caused by remembering her grandmother. Memories also fuel her determination. Cherished recollections of her grandmother inspire her to persevere, driven by a desire to honor those precious moments. Finally, the hardships endured highlight Saeng's appreciation for her grandmother's sacrifices. Witnessing her grandmother's efforts compels Saeng to honor her legacy. These factors collectively explain why the author concludes with Saeng's vow of resilience and the renewed dedication to not let her grandmother's memory fade through accomplishment.
140	9002	4	2	The final paragraph serves to underscore the author's enduring hope. This sentiment is most powerfully conveyed in the concluding sentence, revealing Fong Ho's intention to illustrate that even in moments of apparent despair, when one feels at their limit, hope for improvement remains. The cyclical nature of seasons is invoked; with the arrival of spring comes the promise of renewal. This renewal extends beyond the literal sprouting of Saeng's plant, symbolizing a fresh start for her life as she navigates a new beginning in a foreign land, ultimately implying that hope is a vital element for growth and perseverance.
141	9003	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves to solidify the story's central theme: adapting to change and finding positivity amidst new challenges, ending on a note of optimism. Saeng's internal vow signals her commitment to integrate and discover the positive aspects of her altered reality. This hopeful tone underscores her willingness to embrace life's transitions and strive to conquer difficulties. Her declaration, ""I will take that test again,"" symbolizes her resolve to overcome obstacles through dedicated effort. The image of the hibiscus – ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding..."" – represents a fresh beginning. This budding hibiscus mirrors Saeng's own opportunity for a new start, fueled by her determination to achieve her aspirations of adapting to a new way of life, concluding the story by emphasizing the theme and symbolizing a hopeful future."
142	9004	4	2	The author's concluding statement invites a comparison between Saeng and the hibiscus, highlighting their shared resilience. Saeng's determination to retake the test mirrors the hibiscus's tenacious budding, suggesting a parallel journey of perseverance and eventual triumph. Furthermore, the ending underscores Saeng's unwavering commitment to her professional aspirations, as evidenced by her internal vow to try again. This resolution provides a sense of closure while simultaneously allowing for individual interpretation. While some readers might envision Saeng's immediate success, others may anticipate further challenges, leaving the specifics of her journey open to the reader's imagination, ultimately solidifying the story's impact through its blend of resolution and ambiguity.
143	9005	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to draw parallels between the protagonist and the natural world. The geese, migrating south for the winter and returning in spring, mirror the girl's anticipated return to retake her driving test. The hibiscus, dormant in winter yet blossoming anew in spring, symbolizes her resilience; winter represents her driving test failure, while spring signifies her triumph over this obstacle by drawing strength from her homeland. This placement at the story's end encourages the reader to understand the girl's cyclical journey and her inherent connection to both the geese and the hibiscus, highlighting themes of perseverance and renewal.
144	9006	4	2	The concluding phrase is impactful because it underscores the protagonist's burgeoning maturity. Her acknowledgment of unpreparedness highlights her evolving self-awareness. The failed test, met not with despair but with a commitment to future attempts, exemplifies this growth. The longing for her homeland, poignantly addressed through the purchase of a winter hibiscus, further demonstrates her coping mechanisms and connection to her heritage and grandmother. This symbolic act reveals a capacity for emotional depth, confirming the character's overall development and maturation throughout the narrative, suggesting a hopeful outlook as she navigates future difficulties.
145	9007	4	2	"The story concludes with Saeng and the hibiscus, a potent parallel highlighting adaptation. Saeng, uprooted to @LOCATION1, faces the challenge of adjusting to a new life, mirroring the hibiscus's struggle to survive the approaching winter. Her internal vow, ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding…"" @CAPS1, encapsulates a sense of hope for the future, both for herself and the plant. Initially resistant, Saeng viewed her new home with reluctance, dismissing the hibiscus as ""not like the kind we had before."" However, she comes to understand that the plant can serve as both a comforting link to her past and a symbol of the need to embrace change in her present circumstances. Saeng recognizes that if the hibiscus can endure the harsh winter, she too can persevere in this unfamiliar place, revealing a shared journey of resilience and the enduring power of hope in the face of change."
146	9008	4	2	Saeng struggled to adapt to her new home, a place so unlike the one she’d left behind. The memories of her old life, though painful reminders of what she’d lost and could never regain, also served as a source of strength. Finding familiar hibiscus and other flowers offered solace, their presence a tangible link to her past. Despite the initial setback of failing the test, Saeng made a promise to herself. She would not surrender after just one attempt. As winter began its retreat, Saeng looked forward to spring, a time when the geese would return, and the hibiscus would bloom once more. It was then, with the promise of renewal in the air, that Saeng would take the test again. Spring, for her, represented not just a season, but a fresh chance, a new beginning, and a renewed determination to belong.
147	9009	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph is significant because it reveals Saeng's intention to retake the test. This is foreshadowed earlier in the story, specifically in paragraph @NUM1, where Saeng confesses her failure to her mother. The imagery of the budding hibiscus in spring serves as a parallel to Saeng's renewed effort. Furthermore, the author draws a comparison between Saeng and the temporarily migrating geese. Just as the geese leave due to the harsh winter, Saeng feels a sense of displacement from her home. Ultimately, the author's choice to conclude with the geese's eventual return mirrors Saeng's own journey, implying that she, too, will find her way back and succeed in her endeavors when the time is right.
148	9010	4	2	The author likely ended the story with the hibiscus because it symbolizes Saeng's resilience and determination to succeed. The budding plant suggests a promise of good fortune for her future endeavors, specifically her next driving test after winter. Ultimately, the concluding paragraph serves to highlight Saeng's forward-looking perspective and her plans for the future, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and anticipation for her success.
149	9011	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph resonates deeply, painting a portrait of Saeng's resilience. It suggests a future where, undeterred by her present setback, she approaches the test again, armed with newfound preparation and a fortified sense of self-belief. The reader understands that Saeng's spirit remains unbroken; she will persevere. Her eventual success promises to be a source of immense pride for her mother, validating the unwavering faith placed in her. The earlier scene where Saeng insisted, ""let's plant it, right now,"" serves as a powerful parallel. This act underscores that even in the face of perceived failure and potential disappointment, Saeng's hope persists, mirroring her mother’s enduring belief in her potential, illustrating Saeng's enduring spirit and the unwavering faith she and her mother share."
150	9012	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to highlight Saeng's silent vow, a direct echo of her past experiences with her mother and their garden. Saeng's thoughts are focused on the cyclical nature of life, specifically the return of spring. She considers the implications of renewal: the melting snow, the geese's return, and her own resolve to retake the test. Her internal vow encompasses all these elements, representing her hope for a fresh start and a renewed commitment to her goals. Therefore, the author uses this concluding paragraph to illustrate Saeng's internal promise amidst the promise of the coming season.
151	9013	4	2	The story concludes with a sense of unexpected delight. @PERSON1, entrusted with @MONEY1 to purchase plant seeds, faced her mother's initial displeasure at the expenditure. However, the narrative pivots. The seeds' yield ultimately led to a heartwarming outcome: the family enjoyed egg omelets enhanced with surprising bits of melon, transforming potential disappointment into a shared, pleasant culinary experience, thereby resolving the initial conflict.
152	9014	4	2	"The concluding paragraph serves to highlight Saeng's resilience and future-oriented perspective in the face of displacement. The explicit declaration, ""When they come back in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signals her determination to persevere academically. The ambiguous return of the geese introduces an element of narrative uncertainty, leaving the reader to contemplate the potential challenges ahead. Furthermore, the symbolic adaptation to a new environment is underscored by the mother's observation regarding the winter hibiscus: ""I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus."" This botanical metaphor suggests an attempt to recreate familiar comforts in an unfamiliar setting. Thus, the author strategically employs the final paragraph to emphasize Saeng's adaptive capacity and her commitment to integrating into a new environment, ultimately illustrating her intention to thrive despite adversity."
153	9015	4	2	The author likely concluded the story with that paragraph because she anticipates spring with great eagerness. The budding of her plant will evoke memories of her homeland, and she's also looking forward to retaking the test in spring. Having stayed and prepared, she hopes to pass it this time, unlike her previous attempt. Perhaps the author simply loves spring and its arrival is something she greatly anticipates, making it a fitting conclusion to the story.
154	9016	4	2	The concluding paragraph likely signifies the protagonist's increased preparedness and psychological readiness for the test. Saeng's decision to postpone the examination until after winter suggests a strategic allocation of time for further preparation. More significantly, the delayed test is contingent upon the budding of the hibiscus, a symbolic element interwoven throughout the narrative. The hibiscus functions as a source of comfort for Saeng, anchoring her to cherished memories of her Vietnamese heritage. Given that Saeng derives solace from reflecting on her past, the hibiscus's reemergence implies a restored sense of security and focus. Therefore, the author's concluding emphasis on the hibiscus underscores its profound influence on Saeng's emotional state and, consequently, her ability to confront future challenges with renewed confidence.
155	9017	4	2	The author ends the story with this paragraph to convey a sense of hope. She anticipates a time, specifically spring, when conditions will improve, allowing her to succeed on the test. The return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, familiar elements of her former home, offer comfort. These natural occurrences not only evoke a sense of belonging but may also create a more relaxed environment, thus making her feel more at ease. Ultimately, the concluding paragraph serves to illustrate the author's optimism, rooted in the expectation of a return to normalcy and the restorative power of nature.
156	9018	4	2	Saeng's recent driving test failure stung, yet a vibrant hibiscus caught her eye. From the flower shop, all the way home, Saeng drew parallels between the plant and her distant homeland, a connection rooted deep within. The author uses this recurring image to highlight Saeng's emotional state. Now, the concluding paragraph emphasizes the hibiscus's budding phase. Just as the plant embarks on a new cycle of growth, Saeng too will find renewed determination, mirroring the flower's resilience as she prepares to retake her driver's license test and embrace her own fresh start.
157	9019	4	2	"Saeng's concluding sentiments underscore her resolve to adapt to her altered circumstances. Despite failing her driving test and struggling to adjust to life in @LOCATION1, the familiarity of hibiscus and geese sparks a determination within her. Purchasing the hibiscus, a reminder of her home in @LOCATION2, offers solace but also evokes longing. The hibiscus, thriving in both locations, symbolizes Saeng's potential for similar adaptation. The presence of geese further aids her realization that she's becoming accustomed to her new surroundings. Her recognition of the geese's ""V"" formation signifies growing familiarity, bolstering her confidence to persevere. This burgeoning comfort and her inherent capacity to thrive in @LOCATION1 fuels her decision to retake the driving test, embodying the story's central theme of adapting to change, ultimately showing her path to integration and success."

Rewritten (Objective):  The sentence in question likely aims to foster audience identification by establishing a personal connection with the character, thereby increasing relatability.
159	9021	4	2	The concluding paragraph underscores the story's central theme: the necessity of overcoming adversity and embracing fresh starts. Springtime, symbolically representing new beginnings, provides the protagonist with an opportunity to retake her driver's test, initiating a new chapter. Moreover, the author uses this final passage to highlight the symbolic nature of ordinary objects. Similar to how the hibiscus flower evoked memories of home, the sight of geese will now serve as a potent reminder of spring's promise, reinforcing the idea that even in the mundane, there lies the potential for renewal and hope.

162	9024	4	2	The story's conclusion, it seems, serves to illuminate the protagonist's reconciliation with her history, the flower acting as a catalyst for tranquility. The author paints a picture of a character finding solace in the present moment. Despite the potential hardships of her past, she is able to focus on the beauty of the flower. The intention is to communicate a universal truth: that even amidst unfamiliar circumstances, sources of joy and clarity can be discovered, fostering a sense of calm and centeredness.

I-I failed the test."" This quote serves as a powerful symbolic representation of resilience. The return of the geese, a migratory symbol, signifies a renewed opportunity, a chance to begin anew.

The author wants the reader to understand @ORGANIZATION1 harbors a long memory and their grievances remain. The implication is clear: the events described are not isolated incidents, but rather precursors to a future, inevitable recurrence. This creates a cyclical narrative, suggesting that the underlying issues fueling the conflict have not been addressed and will inevitably lead to a repeat of the described circumstances, thus the story is to be continued.
167	9029	4	2	"Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" portrays Saeng's challenging journey of adapting to a new country, a struggle eased by her mother's support.

Ultimately, the author aims to foster a sense of shared experience, suggesting that even in feelings of alienation, relatable elements can be found, thus creating a bridge between the character's journey and the reader's own life, leaving them with a feeling of connectedness.
170	9032	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph functions to stimulate reader anticipation, potentially as a marketing strategy for their forthcoming publication. The ending serves to heighten reader excitement, rather than simply conclude the narrative.
171	9033	4	2	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring: ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buding, then I willtake that test agien."" This ending emphasizes Saeng's desire for an auspicious environment. The budding hibiscus, the returning geese, and the melting snow all symbolize a return to life and hope, creating a backdrop of renewal that mirrors Saeng's own aspirations. Further, the spring setting evokes a sense of familiarity and comfort, reminiscent of her home country, where a perpetual springtime atmosphere likely prevailed, contrasting sharply with the current snowy landscape.

172	9034	4	2	The author concludes the story with a reflective paragraph, revealing her comfort in memories of her homeland and a deep appreciation for tropical plants. Noting the unbudded hibiscus in winter, she connects its state to her own readiness for the driver's test.

These natural occurrences provide a sense of comfort as she navigates life in the U.S., particularly during her driving test, reminding her of Vietnam and easing her homesickness. The greenhouse plants and the failed test contribute to her emotional state, amplifying her feelings of displacement. The repetitive ""v"" formation of the geese evokes a sense of unease, suggesting that the winter months will lack the comforting presence of the hibiscus and the migrating birds. Having arrived in @LOCATION2 with nothing familiar, Saeng now finds a connection to her past through these natural elements. The author's concluding statement, that Saeng will retake her driving test after winter, offers a glimmer of hope and resolution, suggesting a path forward rooted in both her past and her present."
174	9036	4	2	"Saeng, disheartened, vowed to herself, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return, when this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" Her promise, whispered in the face of winter's chill, hinted at more than just a seasonal delay. The snow likely meant the school was closed, inaccessible beneath the drifts. The return of the geese symbolized spring's arrival, a natural marker aligning with the school's reopening. Saeng's renewed attempt was thus intrinsically linked to the thaw, the return of life, and the resumption of her education, signifying a period of hope and a chance to prove herself once more when the time was right."
175	9037	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the narrative concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake her driver's test, a symbolic act signifying her evolving relationship with her new homeland. The author uses Saeng's initial failure to acquire a driver's license as a metaphor for her difficulty in assimilating into American culture. Her subsequent determination to try again underscores a newfound willingness to embrace this new environment. The text indicates Saeng's lingering disconnect from her present reality when it states, ""She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home…"" This suggests an emotional detachment, a persistent clinging to her past that inhibits her full integration. Ultimately, Saeng's resolution to retake the test during the symbolic rebirth of spring implies a burgeoning acceptance, demonstrating her gradual adaptation and increasing openness to establishing roots in her adopted country, suggesting that she is beginning to consider it her home."
176	9038	4	2	The story's conclusion emphasizes Saeng's resilience. Her initial failure doesn't deter her; instead, it fuels her resolve.

177	9039	4	2	"The concluding sentence of a narrative often carries significant weight, and in this instance, the author's choice to end with ""I will take that test again"" is particularly impactful. One reason for this decision, I believe, is to instill a sense of unwavering resolve in the reader. The emphatic ""will"" conveys a firm commitment, moving beyond mere aspiration to a declaration of intent. Furthermore, the author likely intended to highlight the theme of renewal and fresh starts.

Her initial perception of strangeness transforms into familiarity through the consistent passage of time, suggesting a significant shift in her perspective. Moreover, her evolving understanding of the winter hibiscus plant mirrors this internal change; she recognizes that despite differences, it can still possess profound meaning. Therefore, the author's choice to conclude with this paragraph is fitting, as it encapsulates Saeng's growth and acceptance, solidifying the story's thematic exploration of adaptation and finding meaning in unfamiliar circumstances, ultimately providing a satisfying sense of closure."
181	9043	4	2	"The final paragraph, with its imagery of spring – melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus – serves as a symbolic conclusion. The author seems to suggest that only when her new environment mirrors the familiar comforts of her old home will she truly feel settled and confident. The stark contrast of the unfamiliar winter landscape currently surrounds her, the antithesis of her previous life. Recreating a sense of ""home,"" with the associated positive feelings and comfort, appears to be a prerequisite for her success. It's as if she believes that only when she feels truly at home will she be able to approach the test again, this time with the confidence and ease necessary to pass, her success intrinsically linked to her environment."
182	9044	4	2	"Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" explores Saeng's journey of adapting to a new culture, highlighting the importance of memory and resilience.

The text reveals Saeng's gradual acceptance through the quote, ""She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now."" This demonstrates her evolving perception as she integrates new experiences without abandoning her past. Saeng's emotional vulnerability is evident in her inability to speak of home without crying. However, the concluding paragraph offers optimism. It suggests that as Saeng gains confidence through cultural adaptation, she will find the strength to retake and pass her failed test. The author illustrates the potential for positive change when one embraces adaptation. While the new environment may differ from the familiar, courage and the integration of new and old memories can create a fulfilling home, as Saeng begins to understand in the story's final moments."
183	9045	4	2	The narrative, simplistic in its presentation, essentially conveys the protagonist's anticipated return to the greenhouse in the spring.

The driving test becomes symbolic of her broader ambitions, a challenge she will confront repeatedly until she achieves success, showcasing her enduring commitment and refusal to surrender. This final passage emphasizes the character's determination to keep trying until she passes, solidifying the theme of perseverance.
188	9050	4	2	Springtime brings Saeng a profound sense of comfort, a feeling intrinsically linked to her homeland. The absence of snow and harsh winter conditions suggests a past devoid of such experiences, meaning this season holds no familiar echoes for her. Spring, however, is different; the returning geese and the vibrant resurgence of hibiscus blossoms create an environment that mirrors her origins, evoking strong feelings of home. This return to a familiar landscape fosters a sense of confidence within Saeng, allowing her to feel secure and grounded once more. The arrival of spring is therefore more than just a change in season; it’s a powerful reminder of her roots and a source of renewed assurance.
189	9051	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves as a potent summation of the resilience and fortitude the hibiscus plant imparts to Saeng. Analogous to the hibiscus's displacement, Saeng experiences a sense of alienation in her new environment. The plant facilitates her understanding of the necessity of adaptation for successful integration and contentment. Saeng must transition from dwelling on the past towards embracing her present circumstances. Consequently, the author's statement, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" functions as a direct symbolic representation of Saeng's burgeoning receptiveness to American customs, exemplified by her willingness to learn to drive, thus signifying her evolving assimilation and readiness to thrive."
190	9052	4	2	"The final paragraph featuring the winter hibiscus is likely included to evoke a sense of hope and remembrance in Saeng as she faces her test. The hibiscus serves as a potent symbol of her homeland, promising to rekindle cherished memories and provide much-needed encouragement. Similarly, the geese embody Saeng's resolute spirit and her willingness to adapt to a new environment. The author paints a striking picture of the geese in flight, ""their distinctive I was etched against the evening sky,"" a visual representation of Saeng's own journey and her fading into a new life. The image is not only visually stunning, but also imparts a sense of determination, assuring the reader that Saeng will indeed face her test with renewed vigor, fueled by the memory of her home and the inspiring sight of the geese. Both the hibiscus and the geese are crucial reminders of her past and future, instilling within her the strength to persevere."

It's a hopeful note, suggesting that Saeng will ultimately be okay and, importantly, will embrace life to its fullest. The paragraph serves as a final, optimistic statement, solidifying the idea that Saeng is ready to move forward and make the most of what lies ahead, leaving the reader with a feeling of anticipation for her renewed journey.
192	9054	4	2	"The author employs this paragraph to CONCLUDE the story, illustrating Saeng's desire for assimilation and her burgeoning appreciation for her new home. The line, ""and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" serves as a metaphor for Saeng herself: when the hibiscus BLOOMS, she will be ready. Just as the flower is starting to bloom and GROW, so too is Saeng. The author concludes with this passage to emphasize her growth and newfound potential."
193	9055	4	2	Saeng has associated a specific plant with her sense of well-being and ability to perform on tests. She intends to postpone retaking an exam until her newly acquired tree begins to bud, explaining that she lacks the motivation to test without it, given her lifelong reliance on similar plants. While Saeng believes this plant is essential for her success, attributing her capabilities to its presence, I posit that this is more of a psychological crutch than a genuine necessity. It appears the plant serves as a source of comfort, creating a sense of familiarity and security, even if its actual impact on her test performance is negligible. Ultimately, while the plant may provide Saeng with emotional support, her dependence on it to take the test may be more of a perceived requirement than a real one.
194	9056	4	2	The author initially doubted Saeng's readiness for the test, believing she needed more preparation. Saeng's preoccupation with gardening, stemming from her isolation at school and lack of companionship, further fueled this concern. The prospect of attending school, where she felt she had no one to confide in, was unappealing. Saeng's reluctance to take the test, driven by the fear of potential failure, was understandable. However, the author came to realize that Saeng's determination to at least try was a positive sign, as she would never know her true potential without attempting it. Ultimately, the author's perspective shifted, and they became confident in Saeng's ability to succeed, recognizing that her resolve would likely lead to her passing the test.
195	9057	4	2	The author concludes with a poignant reflection, suggesting a renewed attempt at the test the following spring, driven by a deep connection to her homeland. This anticipation stems from the belief that spring's arrival will trigger a cascade of cherished memories. The season's rebirth, with animals stirring and trees bursting into bloom, promises a landscape infused with the beauty of her origins, providing emotional support and inspiration as she faces the challenge once more, and ultimately, allows her to reconnect with her roots.
196	9058	4	2	"Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with a powerful illustration of the will to survive. The author uses the *dok faeng-noi* plant as a central metaphor. The text explicitly draws a comparison between the plant's adaptation to a colder environment and its previous state, revealing a remarkable ability to change for survival. This demonstrates how the plant, having migrated to a seemingly warmer climate, subsequently adapted to unexpected cold, revealing an inherent instinct to survive and thrive. Likewise, Saeng's determination to retake the test in spring underscores this theme. Her initial disappointment after failing is evident, yet her resolve to try again highlights the human desire to persevere. For Saeng, passing the test is crucial to building a life in her new country, and her decision to prepare again exemplifies the adaptive will to survive and succeed in a new environment. Ultimately, both the *dok faeng-noi* and Saeng demonstrate that the drive to live and flourish necessitates adaptation and resilience."
197	9059	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to illustrate the author's central theme: vigilance and awareness of one's surroundings, particularly in challenging conditions such as snow-covered roads. By depicting the author's successful navigation through the snowstorm, the paragraph reinforces the importance of heeding the story's lesson, demonstrating the practical application of attentiveness and careful observation. Ultimately, it highlights the author's triumph over adversity, achieved through the very principles the story advocates, thereby providing a satisfying and conclusive resolution.
198	9060	4	2	"In “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring, coinciding with the thaw, the return of geese, and the hibiscus budding, gains significance from the concluding paragraph. The author ends the story this way because the hibiscus offers Saeng comfort and bolsters her confidence. The phrase ""Almost familiar to her now"" suggests an increasing sense of belonging; the new environment is beginning to feel like home. The hibiscus evokes cherished memories of her previous life, reminding her of the flowers they once cultivated. Both Saeng and her mother value the flower for its resemblance to their hibiscus back home. As her mother observes, ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here,"" demonstrating their appreciation for its resilience and symbolic connection to their past. Ultimately, the story's conclusion emphasizes the enduring importance of Saeng's memories and heritage, showing how they provide strength and hope in a new setting, thereby enriching the reader's understanding of the story's central theme."
199	9061	4	2	"The story's conclusion is significant because it suggests Saeng's resilience. Despite her deep affection for her hometown and the painful memories associated with leaving it, and despite the pressure she felt after failing the test, she hasn't surrendered. While not fully assimilated into her new environment, she's committed to confronting future challenges. The author provides hope by portraying Saeng's determination rather than simply depicting her post-failure flower purchase. The text reveals her distress and anger after the failed exam: ""I failed the test,"" Saeng said. Her subsequent actions, tearing a hibiscus leaf, reflect the anger at leaving her happy past. These extreme emotional reactions highlight the difficulty of adapting to a challenging new life. The author strategically ends the story on a note of hope, implying Saeng's potential for overcoming adversity, ultimately offering the reader a sense of optimism and the possibility of a brighter future for Saeng."
200	9062	4	2	Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” concludes with deliberate artistry, a choice steeped in purpose. The ending isn't simply a period at the tale's edge, but a carefully woven knot securing thematic threads. The author's decision to conclude as she does amplifies the story's emotional resonance, leaving the reader with lingering questions about cross-cultural understanding and the subtle nuances of familial bonds. The final scene, painted with specific details, allows for reflection on familial expectations and the immigrant experience, prompting contemplation long after the final sentence. It's a deliberate act, inviting us to ponder the characters' futures and the complexities of their intertwined lives, cementing the story's impact and ensuring its message endures beyond the immediate narrative. The story concludes with such artistry to truly allow the reader to understand the complex issues proposed.
201	9063	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves as a culmination, a neat parcel containing the story's essence. Within it lies the anticipation for spring, a season intrinsically linked to the hibiscus. The author, therefore, looks forward to the hibiscus blooming again, a symbol of renewal and a poignant reminder of the narrative's core themes. The promise of spring, imbued with the vibrant image of the hibiscus, offers a sense of closure.
202	9064	4	2	Saeng's final vow, made in silence, hinged on the return of spring. The melting snows, the geese in flight, the hibiscus budding – these were her markers. They represented permanence, a rootedness she craved. The birds always had their home, the hibiscus could thrive. She saw her own potential for resilience mirrored in them. It was a promise to herself that when nature reaffirmed life in her new surroundings, when she felt secure and grounded, she would face the test again. Spring's rebirth would symbolize her own, assuring her that she, too, could flourish. Only then, with nature's cues as her guide, would she attempt the test, confident in her renewed strength and sense of belonging, allowing her to succeed.
203	9065	4	2	The author concluded the story in this manner for two primary reasons. Initially, the ambiguous ending serves to provoke reader speculation regarding potential future events, effectively prompting contemplation about a possible sequel. Furthermore, this open-ended conclusion strategically positions the author to create a continuation of the narrative, as the unresolved plot points offer a clear pathway for further development. Therefore, the ending is best understood as both a thought-provoking device and a strategic setup for a subsequent installment.
204	9066	4	2	She made a vow, a promise mirroring the geese's annual return. Like them, she too would learn and grow through trials. Foremost, she EMBRACED the trials of love, survival, and family tradition, understanding her return was inevitable. The geese offered a clear example: they returned to raise their young, preparing them for the journey ahead, instilling the knowledge that their origins would always call them back, a refuge from the cold and the dangers posed by humans. Winter’s harshness forced their departure, a necessity to THRIVE. Through their example, she absorbed lessons of family bonds, the pursuit of freedom, the essence of life, and the strategies for survival, knowing each lesson would guide her path back home, just like the geese. This understanding solidified her commitment, ensuring that her journey, like theirs, would be a cyclical one, always leading back to the place of her beginnings.
205	9067	4	2	The author's concluding statement indicates a renewed commitment to retaking the test. This decision likely stems from a belief in the possibility of future opportunities. More specifically, this declaration serves as a personal reminder that setbacks are not permanent, and second chances are attainable. Ultimately, the author's words suggest a broader message: that individuals should recognize the potential for repeated attempts and the availability of second chances in various aspects of life, thereby promoting resilience and continued effort.
206	9068	4	2	The author's concluding choice, mirroring the shift in seasons, feels apt as the narrative closes, the cyclical nature of endings and beginnings brought to the forefront. The imagery of changing seasons effectively establishes a distinct atmosphere, leaving the reader with a particular feeling as the story reaches its resolution; the author's selection provides a satisfyingly complete and mood-setting conclusion.
207	9069	4	2	" The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" underscores the story's central theme: adapting to life's inevitable changes. Saeng, facing a multitude of adjustments, hasn't fully assimilated into her new environment. However, the hibiscus, a symbol of resilience, imparts a crucial lesson. The line, ""In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding,"" encapsulates the plant's perseverance, mirroring Saeng's need to embrace determination. The hibiscus's survival through winter serves as a metaphor for never surrendering, even when feeling displaced. Saeng's resolve to retake the test, fueled by her memories, exemplifies this newfound spirit. The final paragraph effectively summarizes the concept of persistence despite feeling out of place. Gradually acclimating to her new surroundings, Saeng's recognition of the changing seasons reflects her growing connection to her new home, solidifying her commitment to adapt and thrive."
208	9070	4	2	Imagine them, the geese. Observe their carriage, their feathered forms, poised between earth and sky. Such a glimpse can be more than a fleeting moment; it can be a doorway. A doorway into deeper study, perhaps ornithology, perhaps animal behavior, perhaps the very mechanics of flight. Or, consider this: a parallel. Their journey, marked by migration and survival, mirrors our own. We too face headwinds, navigate challenges, and strive to reach our destinations. Reflect upon the obstacles overcome, the storms weathered. Just as the geese persevere, driven by instinct and an inherent will, so too must we acknowledge and learn from the hardships that shape our own life's flight. The geese, therefore, offer not only a visual spectacle but also a potent metaphor for the resilience inherent in all living things.
209	9071	4	2	The author concludes the story this way for several reasons, primarily to underscore Saeng's resilience in the face of displacement. Hints of homesickness are woven throughout the narrative, mirroring the flower's tenacity in enduring winter. This parallel suggests Saeng's own ability to persevere. Although the flower isn't identical to those from her homeland, it represents the inevitability of change. By holding onto this symbol, Saeng finds solace and a connection to her past. The ending, therefore, serves as a statement of hope: like the plant, Saeng will adapt and thrive, facing future challenges, such as her driving test, with renewed strength, indicating her journey of adjustment is ongoing and promising.
210	9072	4	2	The author's conclusion stems from their scoring of the preceding lines. They assigned scores, evaluating level and key. The author expresses surprise at the kindly separation achieved. This positive outcome has led to blessings, and a high score reflects the author's overall satisfaction. The author's goodwill extends to all, anticipating continued success until the end of their endeavors, which brings us to the author's final conclusion.
211	9073	4	2	"I think the author included that paragraph to highlight Saeng's resilience. When Saeng tells her mother, ""I failed the test,"" it wasn't a statement of defeat, but rather a prelude to her renewed effort. It painted a picture of someone eager to try again, radiating a positive attitude towards the challenge. I remember failing tests myself, promising retakes that never materialized. The author, through Saeng's words and actions, likely aimed to showcase a contrasting sense of determination, emphasizing Saeng's resolve to persevere despite setbacks, revealing a key aspect of her character and driving the narrative forward by establishing her persistent nature."
212	9074	4	2	The story's concluding paragraph is significant because it offers hope for Saeng's future. Despite the difficulties of immigrating and the sting of failure, she hasn't surrendered to despair. Throughout the narrative, memories of her homeland provide solace, highlighting the emotional toll of her relocation. The author emphasizes this connection with sensory detail, ìIt felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center- just as she had known it would feel.î The hibiscus flower's familiar scent and texture are deeply comforting. Saeng's decision to purchase the plant after failing her test underscores her need for emotional support, a tangible reminder of home. The author's choice to end with Saeng's declaration, ìonce this hibiscus plant is budding,then l will take that test againî is crucial. The hibiscus, as the reader understands, represents a source of positivity in her new life, providing the motivation to persevere and reaffirming that Saeng's spirit remains unbroken, ready to try again.
213	9075	4	2	"Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" culminates with a powerful declaration of Saeng's resolve to succeed in her new environment. The concluding ""vow"" to pass her test underscores her fighting spirit, potentially fueled by cherished memories of her grandmother and the evocative winter hibiscus flowers. Saeng's bravery in confronting homesickness forms the narrative's core, and Ho masterfully transforms a potentially melancholic story into one of unwavering willpower by concluding with this resolute statement. ""Winter Hibiscus"" explores themes of heartache and longing, yet Minfong Ho ultimately delivers a hopeful resolution by emphasizing Saeng's promise, thus reframing a potentially somber narrative with an uplifting sense of closure."
214	9076	4	2	The narrative concludes in such a manner because the cessation of the seasonal period mirrors the culmination of the storyline itself. The temporal boundary established by the season's end provides a parallel to the definitive closure experienced within the plot's progression, thus bringing the story to a natural stopping point.
215	9077	4	2	"The concluding paragraph's cyclical reference to spring and the anticipated re-taking of the test strongly suggests a pessimistic view of lasting change within the narrative. The explicit statement, ""in the spring...I will take this test again,"" functions not merely as preparation, but as an indication of an inevitable, recurring struggle. Therefore, the story concludes with this paragraph to emphasize the author's belief that the challenges presented are not a one-time occurrence, but a perpetual cycle, creating a somewhat disheartening end."
216	9078	4	2	After dinner, Saeng pondered the recent test, a wave of determination washing over her. She knew her capabilities far exceeded her previous performance. A resolve solidified within her: with the coming of spring, signaling winter's departure, she would retake the exam. This time, she promised herself, success would be hers, achieved with exceptional marks, proving her capabilities and silencing any doubts.
217	9079	4	2	Saeng, disappointed by her test result, resolved to retake it. She envisioned the perfect day: a day of blooming hibiscus and radiant weather, a stark contrast to the day of her initial failure. The hibiscus, budding and strong, became a symbol of her own resilience and determination. Its toughness mirrored her own resolve to overcome the setback. Even its delicate beauty reflected the success she aimed to achieve. She confided in her mother, who offered understanding and support. This time, she planned to take the test on a similar day, drawing strength from the memory of the hardy plant. The geese and the beauty surrounding her also represented the achievements she desires. She was determined to succeed and wanted to associate her success with the beauty of that day. When she finally passed, she imagined returning home to that same vibrant scene, forever linking the hibiscus, the weather, and her triumph. The author emphasizes the profound influence of nature and surroundings on Saeng's motivation, showcasing how a strong symbolic connection can encourage someone to persevere towards their goals, finding strength in the beauty that accompanied the experience.

Saeng's intention to retake the driver's test exemplifies this commitment, signifying her determination to learn from her experience and persevere, thus illustrating how new beginnings can arise from perceived failures."
220	9082	4	2	The story concludes by drawing parallels between Saeng's journey and the natural world to suggest her eventual success. Like the transplanted hibiscus, adjusting to life outside the store's familiar confines, and the geese, migrating south to adapt to the changing seasons, Saeng too must adapt. Her challenge isn't merely mastering driving skills, but embracing her new life. The closing paragraph signifies Saeng's understanding: she must leave behind the past and fully engage with her present reality in this new country, a necessary step before she can confidently pass her driver's test, and ultimately, thrive. Thus, the ending implies that Saeng's internal shift will pave the way for her external achievements.
221	9083	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng faces cultural adjustments, her optimism fading amidst the challenges of adapting to a new life. The author concludes the story with a hopeful note, a deliberate choice to counter Saeng's growing despair. Saeng's hibiscus flower serves as a potent symbol, linking her to cherished memories of her grandmother and her former life in Vietnam, a life she clearly prefers to her current one. The sensory detail of ""light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed,"" vividly illustrates this connection. Saeng postpones retaking her driving test, resolving to wait until the hibiscus blooms, hoping its presence will imbue her with strength and happiness. Ultimately, Ho's optimistic ending suggests Saeng's resilience and her ability to find solace in her heritage, ensuring the story concludes on a note of renewed hope for the future."
222	9084	4	2	The author chose that particular ending because it offers the reader a sense of hope and encouragement.

223	9085	4	2	"The story concludes with a paragraph crucial for developing its core theme: adapting to life's inevitable changes. It also offers insight into the protagonist, Saeng’s, future actions following the planting of her hibiscus. The author emphasizes this theme of adaptation in the final paragraph, writing, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" After failing her driver's test, Saeng purchases the hibiscus, a symbolic act representing her homeland and a fresh start. The hibiscus embodies her resilience, suggesting she will face the test again once the geese return. This cyclical return of the geese mirrors Saeng's own anticipated return to the challenge, highlighting her newfound determination and acceptance of change as a part of life’s journey, demonstrating her commitment to overcoming obstacles."
224	9086	4	2	Basically, she remembered to retake the test.
225	9087	4	2	Saeng demonstrated resilience by resolving to retake the test, believing she could succeed with another attempt.

226	9088	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with Saeng's determination to retake the examination in spring, a symbolic choice reflecting the themes of rebirth and renewal.

227	9089	4	2	Saeng's initial failure on the driver's test sets the stage for her journey of adaptation. Immersing herself in the unfamiliar flora of @LOCATION1, she gains new insights. The sight of geese flying in formation, mirroring her homeland of Vietnam, triggers a realization: just as the plants acclimate, she too must adapt to her new environment. This realization underscores the necessity of retaking the driver's test, a symbolic step towards navigating life in @LOCATION1. The story's conclusion, with Saeng facing the test again in spring, is fitting. The return of the geese and the budding hibiscus represent a fresh start, mirroring Saeng's own renewed determination and indicating a hopeful beginning for her in a new land.
228	9090	4	2	The concluding paragraph reveals Saeng's renewed determination to cultivate a plant reminiscent of her grandmother and her former home, a place she anticipates revisiting. This signifies her desire to reconnect with cherished memories and experience the beauty of the authentic flower she loves, rather than settling for a substitute, ultimately demonstrating her resilient spirit and enduring hope.
229	9091	4	2	"The author's concluding choice in ""Winter Hibiscus"" underscores Saeng's resilience. The anticipated spring bloom symbolizes not resignation, but a renewed connection to her roots, mitigating her homesickness. The evocative line, ""Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work,"" illuminates the powerful link between familiar flora and her past. The hibiscus’s eventual blossoming promises a potent reminder of home, fostering a sense of comfort and belonging. This, in turn, will bolster her confidence, providing the necessary strength to overcome the driving test. Just as the plant flourishes, so too will Saeng's sense of ease and self-assurance grow, allowing her to face future challenges."
230	9092	4	2	The author's focus appears to be on snow, specifically its presence outside and its subsequent melting. It seems the snow's presence is relevant to the boys' activities. (Objective)
231	9093	4	2	The concluding sentence effectively encapsulates the protagonist's newfound wisdom. Her journey back to her humble beginnings highlights this transformation, as she now appreciates the friendships she left behind and witnesses her mother's resilience in the garden, even during the harsh cold. Though materially poor, she recognizes a different kind of wealth.

233	9095	4	2	"The author concludes with that specific paragraph to highlight the protagonist's resilience, fueled by her deep connection to the hibiscus. The hibiscus serves as a metaphor; her declaration, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" isn't just about retaking an exam. She's drawing a parallel between her own situation and the plant's dormancy in winter. The ""snows"" represent her failure, hindering her progress just as winter inhibits the hibiscus's growth. But she anticipates spring, a time of renewal. As the hibiscus buds, signaling new life, she too will ""bud"" by overcoming her setback and succeeding on the test, showcasing the power of hope and perseverance."
234	9096	4	2	"The story culminates with Saeng's resolve. ""In the spring,"" she whispers, a promise to herself echoing in the sterile room, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is blooming, then I will take that test again."" Spring, and especially the hibiscus, are anchors, pulling her back to the familiar shores of home. Earlier, the mere thought of home, the inability to articulate the word, had shaken her. She clung to substitutes, like the dok faeng-noi, a pale imitation of the real thing, yet a vital link to her past. This small plant served as a potent symbol of her origins. Ultimately, Saeng finds solace in the hibiscus, and the promise of spring, because they both remind her of home, anchoring her and giving her the strength to try again; it's a reminder that even far away, pieces of home can sustain us."
235	9097	4	2	The author concludes the story with that specific paragraph to impart a message of hope and the virtue of patience. Saeng's driving test failure, much like the premature blooming of the flower, serves as a parallel. Both instances highlight a lack of preparedness. By ending the narrative in this way, the author suggests that with time and readiness, positive outcomes are inevitable, thus reinforcing the notion that patience is rewarded.

Following her failed driver's test, Saeng finds solace in a hibiscus, a plant native to her homeland. Her mother's observation, ""I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here,"" highlights Saeng's struggles to adapt in a foreign environment. The concluding vow encapsulates Saeng's reliance on the hibiscus's strength as a symbol for her own, suggesting that if the flower can thrive far from its origin, so too can she, motivating her to persevere and retake the test."
237	9099	4	2	"She knew the weight of her mother's expectations. The failed test loomed, a heavy cloud. ""When I'm ready,"" she'd say, a mantra against the disappointment, ""when I'm truly good, I'll retake it."" But the readiness felt conditional, tied to an elusive perfection. It wasn't just about knowledge. ""When it's nice out, beautiful even,"" she'd add, ""then I'll have the confidence."" The sun, the sky – they became symbols of her internal state, barometers of her self-assurance. Through these carefully constructed conditions, she revealed the core of her struggle: the fear of failing again and, more acutely, the pain of letting her mother down, a burden she carried with each postponement. Her readiness was not just academic; it was emotional, deeply intertwined with her mother's unspoken hopes and the sunshine she desperately sought."
238	9100	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves a vital function: it provides closure and underscores a key element of the narrative. Specifically, it highlights the protagonist's burgeoning adaptation to her new environment and her renewed commitment to integration. The decision to retake the test symbolizes a shift in perspective, a willingness to engage with her surroundings on different terms. By strategically placing this at the end, the author seeks to synthesize the preceding events, illustrating the protagonist's internal transformation and suggesting a hopeful trajectory, thus demonstrating that the character has undeniably changed and is ready to move forward.

Thus, the author concludes the story, leaving the reader with the understanding that Saeng is equipped to face the impending challenge."
240	9102	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to underscore the protagonist's enduring hope. The hibiscus flower functions as a tangible symbol of her resilience, offering her both solace and strength.

The author concludes the narrative with this image to emphasize the persistence of hope in the face of adversity, suggesting a positive outlook for the protagonist’s future endeavors.
241	9103	4	2	"The concluding line of Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" wherein Saeng silently vows to retake the test in the spring, is significant.

Saeng's observation that ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus"" highlights the connection between herself and the resilient plant, demonstrating how it provides her strength during challenging times, solidifying its importance."
243	9105	4	2	I believe the reason for her action stems from a need for personal growth, much like a plant requiring time to mature before bearing fruit. Retaking the test necessitates further preparation. Education, beyond imparting specific knowledge, fosters maturity and a deeper comprehension of existence. As a tenth-grade student, my understanding of life far surpasses what it was in first grade. She likely requires additional time to process past and present experiences, fostering crucial mental development. Allowing this time will hopefully lead to greater insight and ultimately, success on the retake.
244	9106	4	2	"The story concludes with the girl's resolution to retake the test in spring. This specific timing, coinciding with the melting snow, returning geese, and, most importantly, the budding hibiscus, strongly suggests a renewed sense of hope. The hibiscus, in particular, symbolizes a fresh start, mirroring her own intention to begin anew and succeed where she previously failed. Her tone when declaring ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" isn't one of defeat, but rather one of hopeful determination, indicating a firm belief in her future success, fueled perhaps by the flower's symbolic rebirth and resilience. Ultimately, the author leaves the reader with a sense of optimism, implying the girl's potential triumph in the face of adversity."

(Objective)

For instance, her offer, ""Here let me help you mother,"" demonstrates a motivation rooted in assisting her mother and completing the task at hand. Furthermore, Saeng's internal realization, ""almost reluctantly she realizes that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through a quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar now,"" reveals a burgeoning determination.

Yet, as the narrative progresses, Saeng starts to recognize the familiar in her new surroundings, such as the geese overhead, creating a sense of belonging. The concluding statement signifies Saeng's aspiration to overcome her homesickness by spring, embracing her new country, with its geese and winter hibiscuses, as her home, thus illustrating her growing acceptance and adaptation."
271	9134	4	2	"The author deliberately concludes the story focusing on Saeng's resolution, a fitting culmination to her afternoon-long journey of acclimating to her new home. The entire narrative revolves around Saeng's gradual acceptance of @LOCATION1, making her resolve to conquer the driving test a symbolic victory, ensuring her future there. Several key encounters contribute to this sense of belonging: the distinctive taste of bitter melon, the vibrant hibiscus flowers. These @CAPS1 act as anchors, grounding Saeng and reinforcing the appropriateness of ending with her acceptance of @LOCATION1 as her permanent residence. The hibiscus, in particular, inspires @PERSON1; its resilience, its ability to ""make it through the cold months,"" mirrors Saeng's own determination to persevere in her new life. Furthermore, the sight of geese evokes a sense of familiarity, signaling to Saeng that @LOCATION1 is indeed becoming home, a place from which she cannot simply retreat. These events, along with others woven throughout the story, steadily build towards @CAPS2 final commitment. Therefore, concluding with her firm resolve feels not only justified but also emotionally resonant, effectively illustrating the completion of her journey towards acceptance and a future in @LOCATION1."
272	9135	4	2	The story concludes with a paragraph signifying a fresh start for Saeng and her mother. Their relocation to a new country exemplifies this transition. The author uses the metaphor of spring to represent this new life they are embarking on. The imagery of snow melting serves as a potent symbol of the past hardships receding, like a blanket being lifted. The budding hibiscus further reinforces the theme of renewal and new beginnings. Collectively, these elements—the thaw of the snow, the arrival of spring, and the blossoming flower—illustrate the departure of difficult times and the dawn of a promising future, highlighting the need for a clean slate in their lives. This concluding paragraph effectively encapsulates the essence of their journey towards a brighter, unburdened existence.
273	9136	4	2	The author chose that sentence as the conclusion because it encapsulates Saeng's desire for redemption. Saeng feels she deserves a second shot at the garden test, driven by her past failure and the resulting disappointment of her mother. The concluding sentence highlights Saeng's renewed resolve, her determination to approach the garden test with greater self-assurance. This newfound confidence, declared at the story's end, signifies Saeng's readiness to overcome her previous setback and strive for success, providing a sense of closure and hope for her future endeavors.
274	9137	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it is the end of winter.  **Rewritten (Objective):**  The author likely concludes the story with that specific paragraph to signify the end of winter.
275	9138	4	2	"The author's choice to conclude the story in that manner likely stems from a desire to instill a feeling of hope and wonder in the reader. The narrative centers on the theme of overcoming adversity, exemplified by Saeng's driving test failure and her apprehension regarding the concept of ""home."" The fact that Saeng reflects on the failed test indicates its significance to her, ultimately leading her to the greenhouse. Her search for a particular plant evokes memories of home, specifically her grandmother, causing her distress. This internal conflict within Saeng suggests a struggle she is working to overcome, and the author's ending serves to offer the audience a sense of hope and wonder regarding Saeng's future trajectory, leaving the reader with a positive outlook on her potential to overcome her challenges."
276	9139	4	2	The story concludes with the author's resilience on full display; a single setback won't deter her. She actively seeks connection with her adopted homeland, eagerly anticipating spring. The blossoming hibiscus will serve as a poignant reminder, bridging the gap between cherished memories of home and the burgeoning possibilities of her new existence in @LOCATION1, symbolizing her continued journey.
277	9140	4	2	Saeng's initial attempt to cultivate the desired plant ended in heartbreak, as evidenced by her tears and dejection upon returning home at dusk. The harsh winter winds, described as tearing away the last vestiges of green, contributed to the plant's demise, absolving Saeng of complete responsibility. However, the story concludes with a sense of hope. With winter's grip loosened and spring's arrival imminent, Saeng has another opportunity. The author leaves us anticipating a future encounter where Saeng, armed with renewed determination, will finally succeed in nurturing a thriving plant, illustrating resilience in the face of adversity.
278	9141	4	2	"The story concludes with Carter Saeng contemplating whether to finish a task or retake a test upon their return.

This cyclical imagery emphasizes the enduring nature of hope and determination, concluding with a strong message of resilience."
279	9142	4	2	The story concludes with that specific sentence to highlight Saeng's anticipated success in the spring. This optimism stems from two key factors: Saeng's planned retake of the test she previously failed and the symbolic budding of her hibiscus plant. The author strategically positions this sentence at the story's end to underscore Saeng's resilience and hopeful outlook for the future, suggesting a positive resolution to her challenges.
280	9143	4	2	The story concludes with a symbolic representation of renewal. The author uses the imagery of springtime, a season synonymous with rebirth, to signal a fresh start for the protagonist. Specifically, the budding hibiscus flower serves as a potent reminder of her homeland, fostering a sense of connection and hope. This visual cue, coupled with the promise of spring, suggests that she will approach her upcoming test with renewed vigor and a positive outlook, ready to embrace a new chapter. The hibiscus, therefore, encapsulates both memory and anticipation, culminating in a powerful symbol of a fresh beginning.
281	9144	4	2	Saeng, despite vowing to retake the test next spring, was suddenly overcome by a profound wave of loss. The sting in her eyes mirrored the deep loneliness she felt, a consequence of being uprooted from her homeland and all that she cherished. Even the promise of renewed confidence, symbolized by the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, couldn't fully quell the ache of displacement. The hibiscus, a vibrant reminder of home, served as a bittersweet comfort in her new, unfamiliar surroundings. The story concludes with this potent emotional beat because, despite Saeng's resilience, the homesickness and longing remain a palpable part of her experience, subtly coloring her hopeful outlook.
282	9145	4	2	"The story concludes by illustrating Saeng's growth through her test experience. Initially disheartened by her perceived failure, evident in her statement, ""I-I failed the test,"" and Mrs. Panouvong's initial silence, Saeng's emotional state shifts. The mood begins to lighten as they transition into planning a meal, specifically, an omelet with bitter melon. Saeng's enthusiastic response, ""I'd love it,"" signals a significant change. Instead of remaining upset, she makes a composed decision to try again. This moment demonstrates that Saeng's learning journey led her to a place of calm resilience and determination, proving she can face challenges with a clear mind."
283	9146	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" deviates from conventional narrative expectations, a deliberate choice likely serving multiple thematic purposes. The protagonist's academic setback precipitates a period of withdrawal, yet the subsequent offer to retake the examination signals a renewed commitment to her aspirations, indicative of resilience. This persistence underscores the character's determination to achieve her objective despite initial challenges. Furthermore, the ending can be interpreted as a metaphor for renewal, drawing a parallel with the cyclical transition from winter to spring. Just as winter's dormancy gives way to spring's vitality, the story's conclusion suggests a potential for growth and a fresh start for the protagonist. Therefore, the author's concluding choice emphasizes themes of perseverance and the possibility of regeneration following adversity."
284	9147	4	2	"The author's concluding sentence serves to highlight Saeng's resolution to adapt to her new environment. It signals a shift away from mourning the past and towards embracing her future. The phrase, ""I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-,"" following Saeng's poignant reflection on past memories with her mother, indicates a conscious decision to move forward. This final statement underscores Saeng's intention to accept her new reality and actively build a life within it, providing closure by demonstrating her determination to leave sadness behind and pursue adaptation."
285	9148	4	2	The story concludes with that specific paragraph to convey the symbolic comfort the hibiscus offers Saeng. After the disheartening experience of failing her driving test, the author uses the vivid image of the hibiscus to represent a source of solace amidst her disappointment. The flower becomes a tangible representation of hope and beauty, providing a counterpoint to Saeng's feelings of dejection; thus, the hibiscus underscores the possibility of finding comfort even in moments of setback.
286	9149	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding lines serve to encapsulate Saeng's determination to integrate into her new cultural environment. The author writes, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This resolution signifies her commitment to adapting and overcoming the challenges she faces. An earlier instance, such as her emotional distress in the garden shop – ""and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went"" – illuminates her struggle. It can be inferred that her tears stem from a sense of displacement, intensified by her failure on the test. However, the story concludes with Saeng's renewed resolve, indicating her intention to persevere. Therefore, the author strategically employs the final paragraph to underscore Saeng's decision to retake the test, signifying her proactive approach to assimilation into this unfamiliar world and hinting at a future where she successfully navigates her new life."
287	9150	4	2	The author concludes in this manner to demonstrate unwavering resolve, signaling a commitment to retake the test and dedicate greater effort to surmount the challenge. The purpose is to convey a message of perseverance, illustrating that the author is not defined by setbacks but rather fueled by determination, even amidst conflict, ultimately proving herself to be someone who doesn't surrender easily.
288	9151	4	2	"The author likely concluded the story with that specific paragraph to provide a glimpse into the protagonist's future trajectory. The earlier declaration to her mother, ""I failed,"" highlights a pivotal moment of perceived defeat. Juxtaposed with the image of planting a flower and witnessing geese flying south, the ending suggests a turning point. The southward flight of the geese, a symbol of migration and change, subtly foreshadows the protagonist's own journey forward. The final paragraph, therefore, serves as a narrative bridge, connecting past disappointment with the promise of future growth and a new direction in life, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and anticipation for what lies ahead."
289	9152	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph underscores the protagonist's resilience and determination to persevere. The explicit statement, ""Then I will take that test again,"" signifies an understanding of subsequent opportunities for success. This declaration reveals a strong-willed character who resists succumbing to defeat. The narrative posits a theme of persistent effort as a means to overcome obstacles. Furthermore, the passage, ""she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season,"" suggests a transformative process already underway within the protagonist. This nascent shift in perspective implies an enhanced capacity for future achievement, suggesting that a more favorable outcome is probable on her subsequent attempt, making her future success inevitable."
290	9153	4	2	The author's choice of ending underscores the protagonist's resolve to succeed on the gardening test. The explicit mention of springtime, melting snow, returning geese, and a budding hibiscus directly links the test to the season of growth and flowering, implying the challenge involves cultivating plant life. Given the story's earlier depiction of the character assisting her mother in the garden, the failed initial attempt to cultivate something likely fuels her determination to try again. Therefore, the concluding statement about retaking the test when spring returns effectively highlights her unwavering commitment to mastering the art of gardening, solidifying the theme of perseverance in the face of difficulty.
291	9154	4	2	" This paragraph evokes a memory of Saeng tending to the soil of her ""winter hibiscus."" A flock of Canada geese soared overhead during that moment. The memory links to Saeng's initial test failure. She felt so ashamed that she couldn't meet her mother's gaze. Saeng drew strength and solace from the hibiscus. She relied on the plant's cycle, needing it to re-bud before she could muster the courage to try the test again, demonstrating her deep connection to nature and its influence on her emotional state."
292	9155	4	2	In the story's concluding paragraph, the author provides closure, drawing together the various threads woven throughout the narrative. Recalling the earlier discussions, the final scene depicts Saeng and her mother engaged in the act of planting flowers as spring unfolds. This image serves as a culminating point, encapsulating the themes explored and leaving the reader with a sense of renewal and hopeful anticipation for the future they are building together.
293	9156	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with that particular paragraph to emphasize resilience in the face of adversity. The reappearance of the birds and hibiscus is contingent upon their survival, mirroring the author's own determination to persevere through challenging circumstances. Just as the flora and fauna must endure, she too will remain strong and adapt to her unfamiliar environment, embracing the changes that @CAPS1's lifestyle presents. This ending suggests a commitment to not merely survive, but to thrive by integrating into her new surroundings and demonstrating unwavering fortitude. Ultimately, the cyclical imagery of nature's resurgence underscores her own resolve to emerge stronger from this transformative experience.
294	9157	4	2	The author's choice to end the story as they did feels deliberate. Picture this: you're on the edge of your seat, wondering if the protagonist will succeed, and then—bam!—the story cuts off. It's frustrating, sure, but also incredibly effective. The unresolved nature of the test creates a burning curiosity. Will they pass? What are the consequences of failure? These questions linger, practically begging the reader to pick up the next installment. The author masterfully crafts suspense, leaving the audience yearning for resolution and cleverly ensuring they'll be eager to continue the journey, driven by the need to know the character's ultimate fate.
295	9158	4	2	The concluding paragraph effectively symbolizes Saeng's renewed resolve to persevere despite setbacks. Rather than explicitly stating her intention to retake the driving test next spring, the author employs evocative diction to convey her determination. The passage, noting how previously unfamiliar aspects of her new environment have become commonplace through the cyclical nature of the seasons, underscores Saeng's adaptability. The mention of geese, initially foreign but now familiar, perhaps foreshadows a similar trajectory with the driving test; what seems daunting will, with time and persistence, become manageable. Saeng's journey from Vietnam to @LOCATION1 has been one of continuous adjustment, and this final paragraph highlights her resilience. The author uses the imagery of the geese, representing acclimation, and the hibiscus, symbolizing the comfort of the familiar, to subtly communicate Saeng's unwavering spirit. Ultimately, the paragraph reinforces the story's central theme: the importance of perseverance and the indomitable will to overcome challenges, suggesting that Saeng's determination will lead her to try again, thus highlighting her enduring strength.
296	9159	4	2	The author adores plants. Every winter, she eagerly anticipates spring to assess planting possibilities and cultivate beautiful flora. The spring season is the only time she can nurture unique plant varieties. Her challenge involves creating a flourishing garden filled with stunning plants and vegetables. The author is committed to working diligently, mirroring her mother's efforts to revitalize the gardens, particularly after winter's harshness. This dedicated approach reflects her deep appreciation for the natural world and her commitment to bringing beauty to life through gardening.
297	9160	4	2	The story concludes with a reflection on nature's beauty, sparked by Saeng's profound love for it. The author muses that her passion might even motivate her to return to school and complete her test, driven by the thought of tending her garden and nurturing her plants back home. I believe the author ends on this note to illustrate his own deep appreciation for the natural world, finding beauty in Saeng's connection to it and suggesting a future where she balances her responsibilities with her love for nature, ultimately highlighting the allure and importance of the natural world.
298	9161	4	2	"Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with a powerful image of renewal, carefully chosen to mirror Saeng's emotional journey. The story revolves around Saeng's deep sense of failure after failing her driving test, an experience that leaves her feeling lost and ashamed. The discovery of a winter hibiscus, a familiar plant from her homeland, offers a glimmer of hope. Purchasing the hibiscus becomes symbolic: it represents Saeng's connection to her past and her potential to thrive in a new environment, much like the plant itself. As spring approaches, the hibiscus begins to bud, signifying a fresh start. Saeng identifies with this blossoming, recognizing that she, too, can begin again, retake her driving test, and cultivate a new life for herself. The author uses the budding hibiscus and the coming spring as powerful symbols of new beginnings, mirroring Saeng's resolution to overcome her setbacks and embrace a brighter future."
299	9162	4	2	The story concludes with a potent symbol: the anticipated return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus. These natural events signify a return to normalcy, a cyclical renewal. For the protagonist, this imagery serves as a personal promise. The return of the geese and the blooming hibiscus become intertwined with the idea of facing the relocation test again. It suggests a renewed willingness to move, to adapt, and to try again, showing a sense of hope that is intertwined with the changes in nature. The budding hibiscus and returning geese, therefore, are not merely seasonal occurrences, but harbingers of her own renewed resolve to embrace change and overcome the challenges of adapting to a new environment and her ability to try again.
300	9163	4	2	The story's concluding paragraph, with Saeng's decision to retake the test, underscores her growing acclimation to @LOCATION2, the enduring power of memory, and the capacity of even seemingly insignificant objects to hold profound meaning. Saeng's willingness to persevere with the test demonstrates her commitment to understanding and integrating into @LOCATION2's culture. The hibiscus, a potent symbol of her Vietnamese homeland, embodies the permanence of memories, while simultaneously suggesting her ability to cultivate a new life, just as the flower thrives in her new environment. Furthermore, the hibiscus exemplifies how small things can evoke powerful memories, connecting her to Vietnam and providing comfort as she navigates @LOCATION2. Therefore, the final paragraph effectively illustrates Saeng's increasing comfort in @LOCATION2, the lasting nature of memories, and the ability of even the smallest things to hold significant meaning for us, offering her solace and a bridge to her past.
301	9164	4	2	"In @PERSON1's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng, a Vietnamese teenager adapting to life in the United States, faces a setback: failing her driver's test. Walking home, she spots a familiar plant and buys it at a florist. Back home, after revealing her test result to her initially upset mother, Saeng watches as her mother prepares dinner and plants the ""winter hibiscus."" Saeng reflects that she will retake the test in spring. This decision, I believe, stems from a renewed sense of optimism. The hibiscus, a symbol of home and resilience, coupled with her mother’s subdued reaction, gives her confidence. The promise of spring, mirroring the plant's anticipated bloom, signifies a fresh start, thus empowering her to try again, secure in the belief that things will improve."
302	9165	4	2	"The story concludes with this specific line to highlight the hibiscus flower's inspirational role in Saeng's renewed determination. Like the returning geese, Saeng vows to persevere, stating, ""In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This quote emphasizes the hibiscus as a catalyst for her resolve, mirroring the geese's cyclical return. Therefore, the author's concluding line underscores Saeng's inspiration and unwavering commitment to try again, demonstrating her refusal to surrender to adversity."
303	9166	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves to underscore Saeng's resolute spirit in the face of adversity. Saeng's internal vow to retake the test in the spring, timed with the return of geese and the budding of hibiscus, symbolizes her unwavering commitment. The cyclical nature of these natural events—the annual migration of geese and the predictable blossoming of hibiscus—mirrors Saeng's own intended persistence. This parallel suggests that, much like these recurrent natural phenomena, Saeng will relentlessly pursue her goal of passing the test and integrating into her new environment. Her determination is crucial; without it, the likelihood of successful assimilation would diminish significantly, highlighting the importance of resilience in navigating cultural transitions. Therefore, the author strategically employs this imagery to effectively convey Saeng's unwavering resolve to persevere until she achieves her desired outcome."
304	9167	4	2	"Saeng’s story concludes with the hibiscus, a potent symbol of her emotional journey and renewed hope. Initially disheartened by failing her driver's test and overwhelmed by the unfamiliar landscape, she finds solace in these native plants. The hibiscus, in particular, resonates deeply. The author writes, ""When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub.” This interaction reveals the plant's significance as a tangible link to her cherished homeland. By taking the hibiscus home, Saeng symbolically carries a piece of her past into her present. Her declaration, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signifies a pivotal shift. The hibiscus becomes intertwined with her aspirations, representing a future blossoming with possibilities in @LOCATION1. The final sentence, therefore, underscores Saeng's emotional resilience and the hibiscus's role as a beacon of optimism, suggesting a brighter chapter unfolding in her new life."
305	9168	4	2	"The author's chosen ending suggests a reluctance to progress in her life. The return to the initial state symbolizes a chance to confront a past challenge, likely represented by the test, and ultimately move forward. However, she postpones this advancement, choosing to remain in her current state until a specific condition is met: the disappearance of her flowers. This symbolizes her need to fully process her present experiences before embracing what comes next. The author writes, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese."" This reveals a gradual acceptance of her circumstances, a comfort found in the familiar rhythm of her life. It is clear that the author remains in a state of comfortable acceptance and wishes to remain so until she is ready to confront the challenge that awaits her, highlighting her unwillingness to move forward before she is ready."
306	9169	4	2	The story likely ends with that statement because the natural order is disrupted: snow lingers past its season, geese are absent when they should be present, and the hibiscus, a plant Saeng cherished for its beauty, remains dormant outside of its typical spring blooming. These uncharacteristic events involving the snow, the geese, and, most importantly, the delayed budding of Saeng's beloved hibiscus, collectively emphasize a sense of profound change and loss, mirroring perhaps a deeper emotional or symbolic winter within the narrative that extends beyond the typical seasonal cycle. The hibiscus's failure to bud, in particular, serves as a poignant symbol of deferred hope and beauty within the story's conclusion.
307	9170	4	2	"Saeng's failure on her driving test was a crushing blow. Longing for the familiarity of her homeland, where life felt simpler and driving lessons hadn't been a source of stress, she sought solace in a greenhouse. Surrounded by plants reminiscent of her past, she hoped to recapture a sense of belonging. But in the greenhouse's humid warmth, the weight of her disappointment overwhelmed her, and she wept. The hibiscus she chose represented more than just a plant; it was a tangible link to her roots and a symbol of hope. Her mother understood this implicitly, refraining from criticism about the cost and instead expressing, ""I'm glad you got it."" Together, they planted the hibiscus, an act symbolizing Saeng's desire to grow and thrive in this new land, just as the plant would. The story concludes with Saeng's resolve: if the hibiscus could adapt and flourish, so could she. She would face the driving test again, armed with hope, support, and the knowledge that she, like the hibiscus, possessed the capacity to adapt and grow in her new environment, proving that she too, can thrive."
308	9171	4	2	The author uses the hibiscus plant as a metaphor to illustrate Saeng's resilience and future growth. The comparison in the final paragraph emphasizes Saeng's unwavering determination to retake her test. Just as the hibiscus blossoms in spring, Saeng will flourish and advance when the time is right. The melting snow symbolizes the dissipation of her sorrows, while the sun represents her eventual success and personal development, mirroring the hibiscus she purchased. The plant's growth in sunlight embodies her rising confidence for the next test attempt, effectively dispelling her negative self-esteem, which is likened to the cold snow. By drawing a parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus, the author highlights the plant's connection to her life and attitude, suggesting a transformative impact on her outlook, thereby concluding that Saeng's life will change positively as a result.
309	9172	4	2	The concluding paragraph's effectiveness stems from its powerful depiction of Saeng's inherent resilience and unwavering perseverance. More than simply summarizing events, the finale provides key insights into her character, solidifying her as a figure of strength. The author strategically utilizes this final passage to leave a lasting impression, generating a potent and resonating conclusion that underscores Saeng's defining attributes and the story's central themes, ensuring the narrative ends with significant impact.
310	9173	4	2	The disappearance of winter's white blanket, the melting snowdrifts revealing the earth beneath, signals a shift. Soon after, the honking calls of geese fill the air once more, a sure sign of their seasonal return. These two events, the snow's retreat and the geese's arrival, paint a vivid picture and herald the almost imminent arrival of spring, suggesting winter's grip is finally loosening.
311	9174	4	2	The story concludes with the protagonist seemingly ready to retake the learner's permit test, fueled by a renewed sense of confidence. After the initial setback of failing, a walk home led her to encounter a familiar plant. Intrigued, she then visited a florist, seeking to acquire the very plant that had caught her eye. This act symbolizes her determination and suggests that she feels adequately prepared to face the test again, believing she now possesses the necessary knowledge and composure to succeed, thus concluding on a note of optimistic anticipation.
312	9175	4	2	Saeng, crushed by her failed driving test, felt utterly inadequate. Her mother, understanding her pain, didn't scold her for the impulsive flower purchase. Instead, she chose to plant it, a symbolic gesture promising eventual success. Witnessing this, Saeng was filled with resolve, taking over the task from her mother. Immigration is a challenge, filled with daily struggles. Saeng's mother, braving the cold to cultivate hope, demonstrated resilience. This powerful example inspired Saeng to adopt the same positive outlook, which allowed her to conquer her fears and retake the driver's test, ultimately embracing life in @LOCATION1 with newfound courage, mirroring her mother's strength.
313	9176	4	2	The narrative and the test-taker's situation share a common thread: perseverance. The story's protagonist demonstrates resilience by refusing to surrender, mirroring the individual retaking the test. This act of re-engagement signifies a refusal to be defeated by initial challenges, highlighting a parallel commitment to achieving a desired outcome through sustained effort. Therefore, both the fictional character and the real-world test-taker embody the valuable trait of persistence in the face of adversity.
314	9177	4	2	The author concludes the story on a hopeful note, suggesting that Saeng will use the intervening time to adequately recover from her previous failure and better prepare for a subsequent attempt at the test. This conclusion is supported by the textual evidence indicating Saeng's increasing comfort with elements that initially seemed unfamiliar, marking a clear progression in her adaptation and readiness. Therefore, the author anticipates future success for Saeng.
315	9178	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with a paragraph highlighting Saeng's transformed perspective on her new life in @LOCATION1. The deliberate inclusion of spring, a symbol of rebirth, suggests an intentional parallel. Spring represents Saeng's opportunity for renewal, marked by taking the test and beginning anew in @LOCATION1. The phrase ""When the snow melts"" is significant; winter, symbolizing death, gives way to spring, suggesting Saeng's fears will similarly dissipate. This ending underscores Saeng's transition and the hope inherent in her fresh start."
316	9179	4	2	Spring's arrival witnesses the snow's retreat, unveiling grass far from pristine. Muddy expanses emerge, favored by pigs who revel in the mire. Imagine a mud bath, a ford sculpted by winter's harsh hand. Observe the trees, burdened yet persisting, their leaves striving for life, emblematic of nature's resilience and the cyclical dance of decay and renewal. The enduring trees, weighted down, choose life.
317	9180	4	2	"The author ends with the geese story to illustrate her enduring resilience. The sound of ""overhead...geese...honk..."" now familiar to Saeng, signals a refusal to surrender to despair. This resilience is further demonstrated when she purchases the hibiscus, a flower laden with memories of home, acting as a tangible source of strength. The recollection of her mother preparing ""an omelet with slices of bitter melon,"" evokes a powerful longing and acts as a potent reminder of her origins. This memory waters her mouth, and more importantly, fuels her determination to persevere. The narrative concludes by highlighting these carefully chosen details as evidence of an unwavering spirit, showing that despite the challenges, the author has not succumbed to hopelessness, but rather finds strength in memory and the promise of a future connected to her past."
318	9181	4	2	Saeng possesses a deep love for flowers and plants, a detail the author purposefully integrates into the narrative. As winter's grip loosens and spring breathes life back into the world, Saeng eagerly anticipates the return of her beloved flora. She appreciates the inherent value she finds in plants and derives immense joy from nurturing them. The author includes this element to illustrate the profound connection Saeng has with the plant kingdom, emphasizing her eagerness for winter's departure and the renewal it brings. This anticipation underscores a core aspect of Saeng's character and motivations within the story.
319	9182	4	2	The story concludes with that specific paragraph to highlight Saeng's profound bond with the hibiscus, a living emblem of her homeland. This connection is vital, illustrating the human capacity to adapt to life's transitions. Saeng actively fosters this connection by acquiring and nurturing the plant, visually anchoring her to cherished memories. Moreover, the hibiscus serves as a catalyst, fueling her determination to retake the challenging test in the spring, timed perfectly with the flower's anticipated bloom, signifying renewed hope and purpose. Thus, the plant becomes a tangible link to her past and a source of inspiration for her future, encapsulating her resilience in the face of change.
320	9183	4	2	Having recently arrived, she felt disoriented in this new country. The upcoming test loomed large, adding to her anxiety. She believed a familiar sight, specifically the blooming of a flower she associated with home, would ease her unease. This sense of comfort, she hoped, would sharpen her focus, enabling her to perform better on the exam, as the flower's blossoming would remind her of the familiar and provide a needed sense of security.
321	9184	4	2	"The story concludes with the author finding solace in the cyclical return of the hibiscus. Her failure on the test looms, but she finds reassurance in nature's predictable rhythms: ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The hibiscus, therefore, becomes a symbol of hope and renewal. Its resurgence after the harsh winter mirrors her own anticipated academic resurgence. The author's comfort lies in the promise of a fresh start, timed with the hibiscus's blooming, suggesting that she believes she will be better prepared to face the challenge once more. The hibiscus, in essence, offers a comforting visual representation of the cyclical nature of challenges and the possibility of future success."
322	9185	4	2	"The story concludes with Saeng's resolve to attempt the test again when the geese return in spring, embodying the adage, ""If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."" This ending also subtly reveals the passage of years since Saeng's relocation to @LOCATION2, emphasizing her enduring longing for her Vietnamese homeland, illustrating her continued connection to her past despite the time elapsed."
323	9186	4	2	Her optimism about passing the test stems from the rejuvenating atmosphere of spring. She observes nature's resurgence: flowers blooming, trees regaining their verdant hues, and geese returning. Animals emerge from hibernation, mirroring a sense of awakening. The allure of the beach beckons, offering a tempting distraction, a path she seems inclined to follow. The vibrant, distracting energy of spring, with its promise of renewal and escape, fuels her confidence, though perhaps misplaced, in her test performance, suggesting a potential prioritization of leisure over preparation.
324	9187	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with the given quote to signify a resurgence of hope. The protagonist, initially disheartened by failing her driving test, experiences heightened emotion upon seeing the hibiscus, a reminder of her distant home. However, the sight of the geese as she finishes planting the hibiscus triggers a shift in her perspective, leading her to resolve to retake the test the following spring, demonstrating a renewed sense of optimism and determination to move forward.
325	9188	4	2	The story's conclusion, with Saeng's resolve to retake the driving test in the spring, when snow melts, geese return, and the hibiscus buds, signifies her maturation. The intervening year allows Saeng to acclimate to her situation and prepare for a fresh start, mirroring the renewal of nature. The initial failure deeply affected her; therefore, the delay provides ample opportunity for practice, leading to improved driving skills. This period represents a personal rebirth for Saeng. Her connection to the familiar hibiscus allows her to draw parallels between its budding and her own renewed efforts. The plant's fresh start resonates with Saeng's determination to begin anew. Ultimately, the author concludes the story with this image to emphasize Saeng's growth and resilience as she aligns her personal journey with the cyclical renewal of nature.
326	9189	4	2	The paragraph likely appears in the story to connect the natural cycle of the geese returning home after the snow melts with Saeng's renewed attempt at her test around the same time. The author may be using the geese's migration as a symbolic parallel to Saeng's journey, suggesting a natural rhythm to life's challenges and the possibility of second chances when the time is right. This connection emphasizes the cyclical nature of events, mirroring Saeng's own return to the test after overcoming her initial setback, effectively creating a thematic link between the external world and Saeng's internal resolve.
327	9190	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng's journey embodies the immigrant experience, a struggle to reconcile a cherished past with an uncertain future. Uprooted from her home, she arrives in a new land, where everything feels foreign. Initially, Saeng clings to memories, attempting to recreate her familiar world, but life in her new home proves stubbornly different. Even the hibiscus, a plant that reminds her of home, is altered by this new environment, sparking frustration. Yet, the story culminates in a moment of acceptance. Saeng, though not fully assimilated, vows to retake a test in the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus's budding. This symbolizes her willingness to adapt, acknowledging that complete integration is a process, not an event, and that she will need time to adjust to this new culture before she can fully embrace it."
328	9191	4	2	The story concludes with a sense of cyclical hope, suggesting Saeng will attempt the challenge again in the spring. Earlier, after failing, Saeng confides in her mother, revealing her test failure. This interaction leads me to believe her mother will offer increased support in both her studies and gardening endeavors. The final paragraph underscores Saeng's resolve; with the coming of spring, she pledges renewed dedication to succeed, illustrating her resilient spirit and promising a future attempt fueled by past experience and familial support, implying a more favorable outcome next time.
329	9192	4	2	The story concludes at this point because it coincides with the author's next attempt at the test. Moreover, the geese serve as a potent symbol for her evolving perspective. What once seemed foreign and unusual had, through persistent exposure, become commonplace, much like the annual return of the geese. This transformation was achieved not through sudden revelation, but through the gradual, almost imperceptible, passage of time and the quiet repetition of seasonal cycles. The author's journey mirrors the geese's migration, a testament to the power of time and repetition in fostering familiarity and acceptance, ultimately connecting to her readiness to face the test again.
330	9193	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves as a symbolic restart. The return of the geese and the budding hibiscus represent renewal, offering the protagonist another opportunity to reconcile her memories of home with her adaptation to a new country. This cyclical imagery suggests resilience; she is prepared to face her challenges again, demonstrating a refusal to surrender to the difficulties of assimilation and the weight of her past. The ending implies a strengthened resolve, suggesting she will approach her situation with renewed vigor and a more positive outlook, demonstrating her enduring spirit.
331	9194	4	2	"Her disappointment was palpable. The tropical plant, once vibrant, was now lifeless under her care. That's why she spoke with such self-reproach. But her mother offered comfort, assuring her that failure wasn't final. ""You can always try again,"" she'd said gently. The girl resolved to do just that. She decided that spring, with the snow's retreat and the geese's return, when her new hibiscus bush showed signs of life, she would consider herself ready for another attempt. It was then that she would take that test again, showing that growth, and life, could come from perceived failure."
332	9195	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph, in my estimation, suggests a potential return to the garden, driven by a renewed curiosity. I interpret this as the author signaling, perhaps to herself as much as to the reader, a willingness to re-engage with the very activity she initially found so unappealing. Early in the narrative, we see a clear disinterest in the natural world, epitomized by her choice to spend her mother's money on a Big Mac instead of the intended seeds. This act highlights a disconnect and a lack of investment in the garden project. Therefore, I strongly believe the ending implies a subtle shift in perspective, a possibility that she might find something of value, or even pleasure, in the garden after all, concluding the story with a sense of hopeful, if tentative, exploration.
333	9196	4	2	Saeng's initial failure stung, but the day spent with her mother proved transformative. As the story concludes, Saeng silently vows to retake the test. She sets her sights on spring, a time of renewal mirroring her own budding resolve. The melting show, the returning geese, and the blossoming hibiscus become symbolic markers of her personal growth. When that spring arrives, Saeng pledges to face the test again, armed with newfound perspective, suggesting a complete shift in her attitude towards life and her future endeavors.
334	9197	4	2	The author likely concluded the story with that specific sentence to underscore the protagonist's continued concern for academic performance, preventing the reader from assuming the character's sole focus had shifted to a failing plant. This emphasis on the test suggests the author intends to convey the character's ultimate success and avoidance of re-taking the examination. Furthermore, the concluding sentence could serve as a commentary on prioritizing education over material possessions. The author may aim to highlight the enduring importance of scholastic achievement, even amidst distractions or perceived trivialities. In essence, the ending reinforces the value of education, implying it ultimately outweighs fleeting concerns.
335	9198	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the protagonist's return home after failing a driving test in her new country, @LOCATION1. This test, though unspecified in its particulars, represents an assimilation hurdle for the Vietnamese immigrant family. Instead of the coveted driver's license, the daughter brings home a saebba hedge, a plant already familiar and comforting to the family in their new environment. Her mother, attempting to bridge the cultural gap, questions the expense of the plant, jokingly contrasting it with a ""bee-maagsî,"" her version of a Big Mac, a familiar fast-food treat. The saebba hedge symbolizes the daughter’s failure to meet her parents' expectations and her own desire for acceptance. The story ends with the daughter's resolve to retake the test: ""Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again."" This final paragraph emphasizes her hope and determination to succeed, not only for herself but also to bring honor to her family, who view driving as a symbol of achievement and a luxury perhaps unattainable in Vietnam, thus concluding the story on a note of resilient optimism for the future."
336	9199	4	2	Saeng's relocation from Vietnam initiates a period of homesickness and adjustment. The narrative reveals her internal conflict as she grapples with memories of her homeland while simultaneously encountering new experiences in her adopted country. The hibiscus flower evokes poignant recollections, yet she demonstrates an openness to novelties such as Big @CAPS1 and forming friendships. Though homesickness presents an initial challenge, Saeng anticipates a future where she can reconcile her past and present. She believes that by spring, she will successfully navigate this transition, gaining the resilience to face future obstacles, suggesting an eventual equilibrium between honoring her heritage and embracing her new life.
337	9200	4	2	"The author’s choice to conclude Saeng’s story emphasizing the vowel sound is insightful, reflecting a transformation within her. Saeng's mother's warnings about the harshness of winter contrast sharply with the vitality of spring, mirroring Saeng’s own journey. Winter, a period of being ""thrown around by the wind,"" symbolizes hardship. However, the narrative suggests that spring will bring Saeng's rebirth as she attempts the test again, embracing the @LOCATION1 despite the absence of rain. This cyclical return to life demonstrates the power of perseverance. Ultimately, the author's concluding choice effectively captures Saeng's evolving spirit, making it a fitting end to her story."
338	9201	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph suggests a cyclical theme of return, emphasizing the protagonist's longing for her homeland. The hibiscus, a symbol of home, fuels her desire to return. Saeng's resolve to retake her driver's test ""when the geese come back"" reinforces this idea of recurring cycles. The hibiscus, though reminiscent of Vietnam, is ""Not like the tird we had before,"" highlighting the protagonist's belief that her original home is superior. Ultimately, the author conveys a powerful sense of nostalgia and the enduring pull of home, solidifying the protagonist's yearning to return to Vietnam."
339	9202	4	2	Saeng watched the wind lash at the late-season chicory, ripping away the last bits of green. It was a stark reminder of the coming winter, but she found herself looking forward to spring. The thought of flowers returning filled her with a renewed sense of purpose. She was determined to try again, to plant again, once the snow had melted. The failed test still stung, but with the promise of spring, she vowed to retake it, her resolve strengthened by the hope of new growth. So with the memory of last season's challenges and the anticipation of a fresh start, Saeng readied herself to welcome spring and the chance to cultivate both her garden and her future.
340	9203	4	2	The story ends with the narrator's resolution: when things return to a semblance of their former state, she will actively disrupt the familiar patterns. This isn't about recreating the past; it's about ensuring the future is different. She wants to change the situation of everything because she doesn't like the way it is. She will change anything and everything to get her way. She is determined to reshape her reality, ensuring it diverges from its previous course, because she does not like the way things are.
341	9204	4	2	Saeng's deep connection to nature is evident, particularly her joy at the arrival of spring. The season symbolizes a fresh start, mirroring her renewed determination to retake the exam she previously failed. The author concludes with this imagery to suggest hope for Saeng's future and her eventual adaptation to a comfortable life in her new homeland. While the narrative highlights her initial dissatisfaction, the ending emphasizes the potential for new opportunities and a transformed existence, powerfully symbolized by the regenerative power of springtime, illustrating the story's optimistic outlook.
342	9205	4	2	The author likely ends the story with that specific paragraph to suggest the protagonist's eventual acclimation to her new surroundings. I believe this because I personally experienced a similar transition. Initially, relocation was difficult due to a lack of social connections, but with time, friendships developed, and I grew comfortable. This resonates with Saeng's situation; her persistent reminiscing and emotional responses, such as her tears upon seeing the familiar plant from her old home, clearly indicate a longing for what she's lost. Therefore, the author's concluding paragraph serves as a hopeful note, implying that Saeng, like myself, will ultimately find contentment in her new environment, thus completing the narrative arc.
343	9206	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng's concluding vow is crucial. Her declaration stems from the belief that renewed circumstances will foster a renewed appreciation for life, ultimately leading to greater personal happiness.
344	9207	4	2	The author likely establishes the setting to foreshadow the protagonist's impending struggles and ultimate objective. The location signifies the challenges she will face, the losses she will endure, and the necessary actions she must undertake to succeed in reclaiming what the geese stole from her. Ultimately, the setting underscores the magnitude of the task before her.
345	9208	4	2	The author's choice to conclude the story with that particular paragraph is significant. It encapsulates themes of renewal and the possibility of fresh starts for Saeng. After failing her driving test, a wave of loneliness washes over her. Then, she notices a plant, a familiar sight that evokes memories of her Vietnamese home. This plant, in a way, offers her solace. Her mother's words about the plant resonate deeply: though not conventionally beautiful, it possesses the resilience to endure the harsh winters. Saeng realizes the plant, like herself, is an outsider yet perseveres. The closing paragraph finds Saeng drawing strength from this observation. Just as the flower and the birds adapt and thrive, she too can muster the courage to confront her anxieties. This realization culminates in her decision to retake the driving test, demonstrating her newfound resolve to overcome obstacles and embrace a new beginning, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism about her future.

Her failure on the test is directly linked to her purchase of the hibiscus, a tangible reminder of her homeland that triggered profound sadness and distraction. The final paragraph reveals Saeng's resolve to overcome this emotional hurdle. She anticipates a future spring when the return of the geese will symbolize her own successful acclimation. By then, she believes she will have grown accustomed to her new environment and developed the strength to resist the allure of familiar comforts that might trigger painful memories.

Consequently, she prefers to face the challenge of the test when she is at her most optimistic and comfortable, allowing her to approach it with a more positive mindset. By choosing a time when she feels her best, she hopes to improve her performance.
378	9241	4	2	The concluding paragraph likely serves to highlight Saeng's resilience, mirroring the hibiscus flower. The plant, a reminder of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng's own enduring spirit as she navigates the challenges of adapting to American life. The hibiscus, therefore, acts as a potent symbol of Saeng's survival and her connection to her roots amidst a new and unfamiliar environment. Ultimately, the author uses this imagery to demonstrate Saeng's inherent strength and ability to persevere.
379	9242	4	2	The author concludes with the imagery of springtime to symbolize a fresh start for Saeng. Her failure on the test motivates a desire for renewal, mirroring the regenerative nature of spring. The hibiscus, though currently fading, offers hope, suggesting a return to vibrancy. Spring's association with birth, blossoming flowers, and new beginnings perfectly encapsulates Saeng's yearning for a clean slate and the opportunity to begin again, making the ending hopeful and optimistic.
380	9243	4	2	The sentence concludes in this manner to highlight Saeng's unwavering determination. Her repeated attempts, despite setbacks, underscore her resilience. The author uses this to reveal Saeng's core belief: that perseverance leads to success, regardless of the difficulty of the task. Moving presented significant challenges for her, particularly in communication and forming friendships, common struggles for newcomers. This relocation forced her to adapt to unfamiliar surroundings. However, with time and effort, she acclimated. The author's concluding choice suggests that consistent effort yields positive results, illustrating Saeng's character and emphasizing the power of perseverance in overcoming adversity, ultimately revealing that challenges can be overcome through persistent dedication.
381	9244	4	2	"Young Saeng faced disappointment, failing her test. The narrative concludes with her resolve to try again. Not immediately, but when spring returns. The author marks time with the hibiscus, a significant flower in the story. Saeng's internal vow, ""when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" emphasizes this connection. Instead of merely stating ""next spring,"" the author uses the budding hibiscus as a symbolic marker of the season, linking Saeng's renewed effort to the natural cycle of rebirth and growth. The hibiscus blooming represents a fresh start, tying her academic goal to the beauty and promise of springtime, ensuring her future success is tied to the seasonal renewal."
382	9245	4	2	The author's ending suggests Saeng's eventual return to retake the test. Driven by her deep affection for the Garden, she's unlikely to disregard the transformative impact spring had on her. Therefore, the conclusion implies a future attempt fueled by her enduring love and appreciation, assuring readers of her perseverance.
383	9246	4	2	Her profound affection for her plants is evident throughout the story, meticulously detailing each one and her specific fondness for it. Each plant is perceived as unique, holding a special place in her heart. The narrative emphasizes that her engagement with her botanical collection surpasses her interest in academic pursuits and other common pastimes, illustrating the depth of her passion. This dedication reveals that she finds joy and fulfillment within her verdant sanctuary, making her plants a central part of her life and a constant source of happiness.
384	9247	4	2	"Minfong concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a powerful paragraph that underscores Saeng's resolve to thrive in her new environment, despite the challenges. The winter hibiscus serves as a potent symbol, reminding Saeng of the strength required to endure, much like the hibiscus braves the winter. As the text notes, ""...but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus..."" (Ho @NUM1). Saeng understands that she, too, must be ""strong"" like this resilient plant. Furthermore, Saeng acknowledges her growing adaptation to this new culture, observing, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become almost familiar..."" (Ho @NUM1). This realization fuels her determination. The author concludes the story with Saeng's declaration: ""...in the spring, the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho @NUM1). The coming of ""spring"" represents Saeng's opportunity, embodying her unwavering spirit and her firm intention to conquer the driving test and fully embrace her new life, solidifying her commitment to succeed."
385	9248	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's story, the author concludes with the final paragraph to illustrate how Saeng, like the reviving flower, will find a fresh start by retaking the test. Initially, the flower's condition mirrors Saeng's own state of despair. The quote, ""Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,"" demonstrates the plant's near-death state when Saeng acquired it, symbolizing Saeng's own feeling of being trapped and stifled. Similarly, Saeng's confession, ""I-I failed the test,"" reveals her emotional low point. Thus, both Saeng and the flower were at a breaking point. The concluding paragraph suggests Saeng will pause, allowing both herself and the flower time to recover and strengthen, before she attempts the test again, signifying a hopeful outlook for a future attempt and eventual success."
386	9249	4	2	The final paragraph serves to resonate with the reader, amplifying Saeng's pain while highlighting her resilient optimism. Her vow can be interpreted as a promise of improvement once life normalizes in her new country. Spring, reminiscent of her flower-filled homeland, represents this normalcy. The melting snow mirrors the dissipation of her current suffering. The returning geese symbolize Saeng's unwavering faith in a brighter future, much like the predictable return of the birds each spring. The hibiscus, a potent symbol of home and her beloved grandmother, embodies happiness; thus, when things improve, so too will her overall well-being, culminating in a hopeful outlook that underscores the theme of resilience.
387	9250	4	2	"Saeng faced a dilemma: retake the test, or nurture her hibiscus? The test represented a future opportunity, while the hibiscus symbolized her resilience and growth. Torn between these paths, she voiced her decision, a promise to herself and a testament to her priorities. ""I will take the test again,"" she declared, ""when my hibiscus starts to bloom again."" This concluding statement underscores her commitment to both personal development and the flourishing of her spirit, intertwining academic pursuits with her inner strength, revealing her hope to try again once her habiscus blooms once more."
388	9251	4	2	"*Winter Hibiscus*, by @CAPS1 Ho, centers on the theme of acceptance and adapting to life's transitions. The protagonist, Saeng, a young immigrant from Asia, grapples with her recent relocation to America. Following a failed exam, Saeng impulsively purchases an expensive flower. After speaking with her mother, Saeng makes a silent promise: ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" @CAPS1 Ho concludes the story with this vow to highlight Saeng's journey toward adaptation. Through this resolution, Saeng demonstrates an acceptance of her new American home, even while maintaining a connection to her origins, thus underscoring the central theme of embracing change."
389	9252	4	2	The paragraph ends with Ron Faldse's peculiar affection for his plant. He uses it as a makeshift clock, a signal for when his love interest can take her driver's test. This detail is important because, for non-citizens, the opportunity to take the test is limited to once a year, making Ron's botanical timekeeping all the more crucial to her success. Therefore, the plant indirectly governs her chances.
390	9253	4	2	"The author concludes the narrative with the final paragraph to highlight Saeng's desire for self-improvement. This interpretation stems from the concluding sentence, ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" indicating a personal commitment to actions that benefit her own well-being and suggesting a turning point in her character arc."
391	9254	4	2	"Saeng, disheartened by her driving test failure, doubted her ability to adapt to a new country while seeking her origins. Plants triggered poignant memories of Vietnam, a grief so intense it brought tears to her eyes. She yearned for her homeland, her grandmother, her former life. Returning home, she presented her mother with a plant, its cost initially disappointing, yet her mother recognized the underlying sorrow. ""It's a beautiful plant,"" she conceded, her voice tinged with sadness. Saeng eventually understood the plant's impact, observing its resilience. Seeing its hibiscus buds emerge, she vowed to retake the driving test, a symbol of her renewed hope and determination to embrace her future."
392	9255	4	2	"In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake her driving test in the spring, coinciding with the hibiscus budding, the snow melting, and the geese returning. This emphasizes that just as the hibiscus, a symbol of her homeland, can thrive, so too can Saeng overcome her challenges. Earlier in the story, after failing the test, Saeng's encounter with the flowers evokes a profound sense of homesickness, illustrated by the ""wave of loss so deep & strong that it stung Saengís eyes."" This highlights the flower's power to connect her to cherished memories and alleviate her loneliness. Furthermore, the author draws a parallel between Saeng and the migrating geese, ""like the geese the distinctive V against the sky,"" suggesting that both are adapting to a new environment. The geese's journey mirrors Saeng's own, fostering a sense of hope that she, too, will adjust and flourish. Ultimately, the story's ending serves to underscore Saeng's complex emotions regarding her past and present, solidifying her resolve to succeed in her new home while cherishing her roots."
393	9256	4	2	Like the geese that migrate south for the winter, only to faithfully return when the weather warms, or the hibiscus that blooms anew each spring after seemingly succumbing to the cold, Saeng understood the cyclical nature of hope. The geese abandon their home temporarily, yet their return is inevitable, a testament to resilience. Similarly, the hibiscus, though dormant in winter, invariably blossoms again. Saeng's resolve mirrored this natural persistence; her previous failure hadn't extinguished her desire to pass her driver's test. Instead, witnessing the geese's return and the hibiscus's rebirth instilled in her a renewed sense of possibility. She decided to try again, embracing the lesson nature so eloquently teaches: that setbacks are temporary, and a second chance, like spring itself, is always on the horizon, proving that perseverance often yields success.
394	9257	4	2	Determination, help, and strength all underpin my belief that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph. First, determination is a primary reason Saeng will attempt the test again. Despite her initial failure, she intends to try again, determined to adopt new strategies for success. Secondly, I believe help is also a significant factor in the author's concluding paragraph. Saeng anticipates needing assistance to pass and places her faith in the hibiscus plant for aid, not only for the test but for other endeavors as well, signaling her future readiness. Finally, strength serves as the last reason for the author's chosen ending. Saeng believes the hibiscus plant will grant her the strength required to pass the exam, and the author concludes with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's renewed resolve and anticipated growth, showing she will return more capable than before; these elements collectively support my interpretation of the author's concluding paragraph.
395	9258	4	2	"Mingfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's internal vow: a promise to retake her driving test in the spring, coinciding with the return of geese, the melting snow, and, most importantly, the budding of her hibiscus. This ending underscores Saeng's resilience and her determination to overcome the challenges of adapting to a new life in the United States. The story highlights the hardships Saeng faces, specifically her relocation and her failure to pass the driver's test, culminating in a moment of emotional release in the greenhouse. The winter hibiscus, despite its expense, holds significant symbolic value for Saeng, embodying hope and the possibility of successful adaptation. Just as the hibiscus adjusts to its new environment, Saeng anticipates her own successful integration into American society, signified by the hibiscus's reemergence and her renewed attempt to pass the driving test, demonstrating her unwavering commitment to building a new life."
396	9259	4	2	The concluding paragraph highlights Saeng's transformation. Initially hesitant and lacking self-assurance regarding the test, Saeng benefited from her mother's unwavering support. Her mother's understanding extended even to Saeng's seemingly unusual purchase of a plant, which symbolized home and provided comfort. This reassurance fostered a sense of relaxation and renewed confidence in Saeng, preparing her to retake the test. The culmination of these factors demonstrates Saeng's positive change in attitude and preparedness.
397	9260	4	2	"The story concludes with Saeng resolving to retake the driving test in spring: ""When they come back...I will take that test again."" This ending underscores the importance of maintaining hope. Throughout the narrative, Saeng's homesickness is evident, potentially affecting her performance. Perhaps a seasonal respite would diminish this longing, allowing her to concentrate on her objective. The profound impact of missing her grandmother and Vietnam may have contributed to her failure. Moreover, the author might have intended to alleviate the story's somber tone. The greenhouse scene, marked by Saeng's emotional distress, evokes melancholy. Her vow to try again in spring, however, injects a sense of optimism, ultimately suggesting that perseverance, coupled with emotional healing, will aid Saeng in achieving her goal."
398	9261	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to underscore the author's profound distraction during the examination. Her inability to focus stemmed directly from a powerful yearning to return to her homeland. This desire consumed her thoughts, effectively preventing her from engaging with the test material and highlighting the deep emotional connection she maintained with her country of origin. In essence, the test became secondary to the overwhelming pull of home, thus, the author's performance suffered due to her profound longing for her native land.
399	9262	4	2	The author likely concluded with that specific detail to instill a sense of hope, suggesting Saeng's eventual return and continued assistance. This implies Saeng possesses an affinity for planting, perhaps a latent passion now awakened. Furthermore, the experience seems poised to transform her relationship with her mother, potentially leading to a greater willingness to contribute to household tasks, now that she understands the positive impact of her help. Thus, the story subtly points toward Saeng's growth and her proactive role in future endeavors.
400	9263	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" focusing on Saeng's resolve to retake the test when the hibiscus buds, masterfully unifies the narrative. While the story centers on Saeng's search for the flower and the memories it evokes, her potential test success would have negated the shop visit entirely, highlighting the hibiscus's significance. The test and the flower gain deeper meaning through this connection. Both Saeng and the hibiscus embody displacement and adaptation. Saeng, uprooted from Vietnam, mirrors the hibiscus, removed from its natural environment and purchased from a shop. Saeng's journey parallels the flower's struggle; she must adapt to her new home to thrive, just as the hibiscus must endure the harsh winter to survive. The hibiscus becomes a symbol of Saeng herself. When the flower perseveres through winter, Saeng will find strength and renewed purpose, confident in her own ability to flourish in @LOCATION2, solidifying the hibiscus as a beacon of hope and resilience."
401	9264	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph, where Saeng vows to retake her driver's test upon the spring budding of her hibiscus, serves as a vital beacon of hope. This resolution contrasts sharply with Saeng's earlier despair; within the greenhouse's humid warmth, the flowers triggered a breakdown, exacerbating her homesickness and longing for her native country. Planting the hibiscus in the frozen ground symbolized her determination not to surrender to this sadness, anticipating a symbolic rebirth with the flower's spring bloom and a renewed opportunity. Therefore, Ho strategically concludes the story on an optimistic note, suggesting Saeng's resilience and her capacity to overcome her yearning for her homeland, painting a picture of a future where she finds her place."
402	9265	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng's silent vow, made as the snows melt, geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud. She resolves to retake the test when this hibiscus blooms again. This ending generates suspense, leaving the reader to wonder about the outcome of her future attempt. It is not explicitly stated that Saeng consumed the entire plant, implying she will face the same temptation again. The author uses this ambiguity to highlight Saeng's ongoing struggle and her determination to overcome it, thereby ending the story on a note of anticipation rather than resolution, showing her resolve in the face of the same challenge to come.
403	9266	4	2	The concluding paragraph effectively delivers a satisfying and optimistic resolution to the narrative. (Objective)
404	9267	4	2	The concluding paragraph aims to instill a sense of potential accomplishment within the reader, evoked by the symbolic presence of hibiscus and geese. The hibiscus serves as a poignant reminder of shared moments with her grandmother, picturing the intimate act of having her hair styled and adorned with the flower. This memory represents a foundation of love and connection, suggesting future endeavors rooted in similar warmth. Furthermore, the geese, observed in their southward migration, embody the concept of successful navigation and adaptation. Their flight towards survival in warmer climates mirrors the character's anticipated journey, hinting at her own capacity to overcome challenges and achieve her goals, leaving the reader with a renewed sense of hope and resolve.
405	9268	4	2	He wraps things up with this paragraph because he's explaining how the story finishes. The whole point of that is to let everyone know what eventually happens.
406	9269	4	2	The author concludes the story with a final paragraph to inject optimism into a narrative dominated by Saengís struggles. Throughout the story, Saeng experiences a profound sense of loss, triggered by memories of her home country and exacerbated by the challenges of adapting to a new, unwelcoming environment. This feeling of isolation is further intensified by her failure on the test. To counter this prevailing sense of depression, the author strategically ends the story by showcasing Saengís newfound confidence and a more hopeful outlook, ultimately leaving the reader with a sense of possibility after a journey through hardship.
407	9270	4	2	The author ends her story with that specific paragraph to signal to us, the readers, her unwavering resolve. It's a clear message: she's not throwing in the towel. We understand, through her closing words, that despite the setback, she intends to face the challenge again, to retake the test, and this time, succeed. Her determination shines through, leaving us with a sense of her resilience.
408	9271	4	2	"The concluding paragraph serves two vital functions. It highlights the author's successful adaptation to her new environment and acts as a poignant final reflection. ""When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" this isn't merely an ending; it's the author's conclusive thought, the last subject occupying her mind. The cyclical imagery of spring, melting snow, returning geese, and a budding hibiscus all coalesce to symbolize renewal and hope, indicating her readiness to face future challenges in her adopted home, and the test in spring becomes a symbolic act of embracing new beginnings."
409	9272	4	2	The author deliberately ends the narrative with that specific paragraph to provoke reader response.The concluding paragraph's purpose, as designed by the author, is to elicit reactions and opinions from the audience. The author strategically leaves the narrative open-ended at that point, inviting readers to engage with the material and formulate their own interpretations and critiques. The author's intention is to observe and consider the variety of perspectives that arise from this narrative choice.
410	9273	4	2	The garden, once vibrant with Saeng's mother's vegetables and budding spring flowers, now lay blanketed in snow. The saying echoed the scene: the snow had fallen, and with the thaw would come the need to replant, to begin anew. The story, a celebration of spring's renewal and Saeng's mother's gardening, finds its closure in this wintry scene. The snow signifies a pause, a period of planning before the next burst of life. Saeng, facing the dormant garden, could envision the future: the hibiscus budding, the geese returning, and the promise of a renewed, bountiful spring that she would soon help bring to life.
411	9274	4	2	The author ends the story with that particular passage, I believe, because it reveals Saeng's internal struggle and her deferred plans. Saeng essentially says she will postpone taking the test until the hibiscus blooms again, marking a symbolic return to a time and place where she feels truly herself. Until that moment, she experiences a sense of displacement, of not quite fitting into her current circumstances, rendering her ineffective in the present arrangements; Saeng is waiting to truly thrive in her natural environment, her “bloom town,” suggesting a deep connection to her origins and a belief that her success hinges on being in a familiar, harmonious setting, and thus the story concludes with a sense of anticipation and deferred action.
412	9275	4	2	The concluding paragraph reveals the author's resolve to return to a specific location. This signifies a determination to confront her experiences there, rather than succumb to emotional distress and grief over past losses. It underscores her commitment to navigate the inevitable changes life presents, suggesting a path forward characterized by resilience and acceptance, rather than avoidance or despair, offering a sense of closure.
413	9276	4	2	The story concludes with the image of snow because it symbolizes a dormant period for Saeng's beloved garden. Like the hibernating plants, her vision for the garden is temporarily obscured, awaiting the spring thaw, the return of the geese, and the budding hibiscus. Only then will she truly see the fruits of her labor. This final paragraph underscores Saeng's deep connection to her garden, a passion ignited since immigrating to the United States. Gardening, along with shared family dinners, has become a cornerstone of their newfound happiness and togetherness, a testament to the fulfilling life they've cultivated since their move, making the anticipation of spring and the garden's rebirth all the more poignant.
414	9277	4	2	"Leaving one's homeland is disorienting, so familiar comforts become vital. For Saeng, displaced from Vietnam, these comforts manifested in the presence of things reminiscent of home. The author uses geese, plants, and other details to illustrate this effect, building to the pivotal moment when Saeng feels secure enough to consider taking the test next spring. The greenhouse scene early in the story especially highlights this connection, showing how Saeng's spirits lifted amidst familiar flora. The text emphasizes her affection by including the native Vietnamese names for plants, allowing the reader to ""hear"" her love for them. The author masterfully conveys Saeng's deep caring and how these familiar reminders provide encouragement. By ending the story with Saeng's renewed sense of hope, the author underscores the profound impact of these connections to her past, showing how they sustain and empower her in a new environment."
415	9278	4	2	The author concludes the paragraph with the hibiscus story to highlight its potential, mirroring Saeng's situation. Despite her previous failure, Saeng, like the seemingly out-of-place hibiscus, is determined. Just as the hibiscus perseveres, awaiting the thaw to thrive, Saeng will retake the test, drawing motivation from the flower's resilience. Therefore, the hibiscus serves as a potent symbol of her unwavering resolve.
416	9279	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring, when the snow melts, geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This resonated with me as the author subtly highlighted the mother and daughter's bond through their shared gardening. Throughout the story, the author skillfully reveals the connection between Saeng and her mother, a connection I found particularly neat. The narrative kept me guessing about the end-of-year seat, maintaining my interest until the very end. I especially appreciated the strong friendship between the daughter and mother and the deep connection they shared. The author's insightful portrayal of their relationship also reveals his own thoughtful perspective, showcasing a great mind at work. The story, centered around a Vietnamese mother and daughter who relocate to the @ORGANIZATION1, is well-crafted and engaging. Ultimately, the author successfully uses gardening as a motif to illustrate the enduring bond between Saeng and her mother, creating a heartwarming and memorable narrative.
417	9280	4	2	The final paragraph leaves us pondering Saeng's motivations. Perhaps a desire to please her mother now fuels her determination to finally pass the driving test. A looming need to drive within the year might also be a factor pushing her forward. The financial burden of repeated attempts surely weighs on her mind as well. Then there's her beloved hibiscus, a symbol of something important to her, maybe her independence. Ultimately, the ending suggests a complex interplay of factors driving Saeng's renewed commitment.
418	9281	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph serves to underscore Saeng's resilience. The departing geese symbolize her initial failure, implying that their return will coincide with her renewed attempt at the examination. The melting snow and budding hibiscus evoke the imagery of spring, traditionally representing new beginnings and fresh opportunities. This seasonal rebirth mirrors Saeng's potential for a fresh start. Her distress at failing is evident in her stuttered declaration, ""I-I failed the test,"" indicating her emotional upset. Allowing time for recovery before retaking the test is a wise course of action. Ultimately, the story's conclusion highlights Saeng's inner strength and her capacity to embrace a new beginning, affirming her unwavering determination to succeed despite setbacks."
419	9282	4	2	The concluding paragraph effectively illustrates Saeng's newfound solace in the flower. Despite her initial disappointment with the failed test, the flower serves as a potent reminder of home, fostering resilience within her. Initially, the wave of sadness washes over her, intensified by memories of her grandmother. However, the flower's significance ultimately triumphs, providing comfort and bolstering her determination to persevere. Therefore, the author concludes the narrative on a hopeful note, emphasizing the flower's profound impact and Saeng’s renewed spirit.
420	9283	4	2	The concluding paragraph offers a glimmer of hope for Saeng's future. It focuses on her impending retake of the test she previously failed, a significant challenge in her difficult adjustment to a new life. By framing her decision to wait for the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus, the author emphasizes Saeng's conscious choice to allow herself time to adapt and heal from the setback, and the vivid imagery underscores her resilience. This deliberate postponement highlights Saeng's courage and unwavering hope as she prepares to face the test again, suggesting a brighter path forward for her. Ultimately, Saeng's decision shows her determination to overcome adversity.
421	9284	4	2	Honestly, I'm not quite sure what's going on. Is it that newfound assurance settling in her bones? Or perhaps it's one of those mental trials we're all destined to face, a rite of passage etched into the human experience? The geese returning north, the first brave buds daring to unfurl on the branches – are they, too, part of this metaphoric test, a silent challenge woven into the fabric of spring's renewal? It feels as if the world itself is observing, waiting to see how she – how *we* – respond to this subtle shift in the atmosphere, this quiet pressure to evolve and adapt. Only time will reveal the true nature of this unfolding chapter.
422	9285	4	2	The author concludes the story with a paragraph emphasizing acceptance and determination. Saeng's profound attachment to the hibiscus symbolizes her homeland and past. The final line is representative of rebirth and new beginnings, evidenced by the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus. Saeng’s resolve to retake her test underscores the theme of overcoming obstacles and achieving goals, demonstrating her proactive acceptance of the circumstances. The imagery and Saeng's actions work in conjunction to convey a powerful message of resilience and future-oriented perseverance.
423	9286	4	2	The story concludes in this manner because it aligns with the protagonist's desires for its resolution. Her profound connection to the natural world is evident in her affinity for flora, fauna, and specifically, the Madagascar periwinkle. Her former residences, abundant with plants, animals, and flowers, shaped her character, thus the ending reflects her deep-seated appreciation for the beauty of the natural world, providing a fitting and satisfying conclusion.
424	9287	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Minfong Ho concludes the story with a paragraph rich in feeling, revealing Saeng's unwavering determination. Despite failing the test, Saeng resolves to retake it, as evidenced by her statement, ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This line underscores her resilience and refusal to be discouraged by initial setbacks. Furthermore, Saeng expresses a connection to the returning geese and the budding hibiscus, noting, ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" This suggests that she doesn't regret purchasing the plant, associating it with hope and the cyclical renewal of spring, reinforcing her resolve to succeed in the future."
425	9288	4	2	"""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with a sense of burgeoning hope for Saeng's future. Earlier, dejected from failing her driver's test, Saeng walks home, the harsh wind stripping the last green from the weeds – a visual metaphor for her waning hope in the face of a metaphorical winter. Back home, her mother's observation about the hibiscus – that it's ""strong enough to make it through the cold months"" – becomes symbolic of Saeng's own resilience. The story culminates with Saeng observing geese, a realization dawning on her: the once-foreign aspects of her new life, through repetition, have become familiar. This signals her growing adjustment and hope for the future when spring arrives, the geese return, and the hibiscus blooms anew, completing the cycle of seasons and solidifying her place within it."
426	9289	4	2	From the moment she set out, her mind was consumed by a single objective: to ensnare those geese. It was more than a whim; it was the very reason she hunted, the core of her purpose. She'd watched her grandparents attempt the same feat countless times, their failures and near-successes etched in her memory. This history, these witnessed attempts, ultimately informed her final declaration, the culmination of her hunt and her deeply held aspiration.
427	9290	4	2	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's unwavering determination and resilience. Despite her initial setback, as evidenced by her statement ""I-I failed the test,"" revealing her feelings of inadequacy, the ending showcases her refusal to succumb to defeat. Her declaration, ""I will take that test again,"" underscores her character and highlights her commitment to persevere even in the face of failure. Ultimately, this final statement serves to illustrate that Saeng's spirit remains unbroken, signaling her intent to continue striving towards her goal."
428	9291	4	2	"Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with the promise of spring, mirroring Saeng's anticipated adaptation to her new environment. The author uses the cyclical nature of seasons to symbolize Saeng's gradual assimilation. As the seasons repeat, Saeng finds familiarity in what once seemed foreign, ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become...almost familiar to her now."" This quiet repetition suggests an ongoing process of adjustment, where each season brings Saeng closer to feeling at home. Furthermore, the sight of geese flying in their characteristic V-formation against the evening sky evokes memories of her former home. The image is a poignant reminder of her past, yet it also signifies a connection that transcends geographical boundaries, suggesting that Saeng is finding ways to integrate her past into her present, and by the time spring arrives, Saeng's integration will be even more complete."
429	9292	4	2	Saeng's narrative arc centers on her forced acculturation following her family's relocation from Vietnam to the United States. The @LOCATION3 serves as a constant catalyst for mnemonic retrieval, evoking poignant memories of her life in Vietnam. The penultimate paragraph focuses on the symbolic weight of the hibiscus, the geese, and the shifting seasons. Synthesizing these recurring motifs, the concluding paragraph underscores Saeng's resilient spirit and determination to adapt to the cultural and environmental changes imposed by the @LOCATION3, as reflected in her continued efforts to master driving. This concluding placement is thematically significant, reinforcing the story's central exploration of change, adaptation, and, crucially, reflection. The narrative methodically establishes connections between specific elements in the @LOCATION3 and Saeng's past life, culminating in a final paragraph that aims to shift the overall tone from one of regret and melancholia to one of hope and optimism. By recollecting these symbolic items, the author suggests a pathway for Saeng and her family to find solace and build a future within the new landscape, demonstrating her capacity to overcome obstacles and integrate into the new environment, thus resolving the central conflict of displacement and cultural adjustment.
430	9293	4	2	The story ends with Saeng's silent vow: a promise to retake the test in spring, a time marked by melting snow, returning geese, and the budding of her hibiscus. This concluding paragraph serves to highlight Saeng's connection with the natural world. Earlier in the story, we see her gently pick up a fallen hibiscus blossom, pausing to appreciate its fragrance. This small act reveals her attentiveness to nature's delicate details. Furthermore, the careful way she repots the hibiscus, deftly handling the soil and plant, demonstrates a tenderness towards even a small piece of the natural world. Thus, the author concludes the story by linking Saeng's personal resolve to the cycles of nature, reinforcing her characterization as someone who finds solace and motivation in the world around her. It is precisely this connection that gives her the strength to persevere and try again.
431	9294	4	2	The concluding paragraph is crucial because it illuminates the hibiscus's profound meaning. For Saeng, and presumably her cultural heritage, the hibiscus flower isn't merely aesthetic; it's a source of empowerment. Her earlier test failure stemmed from the absence of this vital symbol. The hibiscus's presence fuels her self-belief and resolve, enabling her to surmount challenges. Therefore, her final statement suggests that when she retakes the test, she will draw strength and determination from the hibiscus, ultimately securing her success. This emphasizes the cultural and personal significance of the flower in her journey.
432	9295	4	2	The persistence demonstrated signals an ongoing effort to adapt and thrive in her new environment. The narrative concludes on a hopeful note, mitigating the preceding sadness. Both the hibiscus and the arrival of spring symbolize optimism, fundamentally altering the story's trajectory. Without this concluding segment, the story would be a tragedy, but its inclusion transforms it into one of hope. The preceding narrative structure suggests this moment signifies either a pivotal change or the culmination of initial struggles. It offers a sense of resolution, although not definitively conclusive, implying that while challenges remain, the presence of hope ensures a brighter outlook, and provides a more positive conclusion.
433	9296	4	2	The final paragraph serves as the author's reflective conclusion, illustrating that despite the preceding emotional turmoil and disorientation, she understands the necessity of time for recovery. She expresses a sense of hope, acknowledging her capacity to heal and eventually embrace a new beginning, mirroring the resilience and regenerative potential of the plant she references. This parallel suggests an acceptance of the healing process and an anticipation of future readiness.
434	9297	4	2	The story concludes with the author's resolution to succeed in the future. Despite failing the test, a disappointment briefly felt by her mother but quickly dismissed, Saeng internalizes the setback. Unlike her mother, Saeng's resolve is strengthened. Inspired by her deep affection for the hibiscus plant, she dedicates herself to future success, vowing to diligently prepare for the test the following year. This final dedication reveals a commitment to self-improvement, fueled by personal passion rather than external pressure, showing her determination.
435	9298	4	2	The author concludes with this sentence to emphasize the necessity of perseverance for success. Saeng's adaptation to her new country will occur over time, but only if she actively engages with her present surroundings rather than dwelling on her homeland. The hibiscus serves as a constant reminder to her of the importance of new beginnings and societal integration. Saeng's decision to retake her driver's test when the plant buds again, symbolizing the renewal of life, underscores her commitment to embracing the challenges and opportunities of her new environment, ultimately showing that success comes through repeated effort.
436	9299	4	2	She plans to retake the test in the spring, after the snow melts. Her strategy involves observing geese and budding hibiscus while testing, hoping this will improve her performance and lead to success.
437	9300	4	2	This was Saeng's present reality. A sense of connection bloomed within her, linking her to the geese in flight and the vibrant hibiscus blossoms. She had raised her head, observing the geese, their unique formation imprinted in her mind, almost recognizable now. Spring would bring another opportunity to retake the test. The hibiscus, with its hopeful bloom, would soothe her spirit, providing solace and a renewed sense of purpose. The anticipation of spring and the comfort of the familiar flora instilled in her a quiet confidence that she would succeed this time.
438	9301	4	2	"The concluding paragraph underscores the profound impact of the hibiscus flower on Saeng's life, catalyzing newfound courage and resilience. The ""shock of recognition"" Saeng experiences upon seeing the flower after failing her driver's test exemplifies the deep, almost visceral connection forged between her and the hibiscus. This connection serves as a guiding force throughout her challenges. Saeng's subsequent visit to a flower shop, where she identifies flowers reminiscent of her childhood home, further reinforces this link to her past, bolstering her courage in adapting to her new environment. Moreover, the text indicates a shift in Saeng's perception, noting that ""many of the things she thought of was strange before had become…almost familiar to her now."" This realization stems from her mother's observation about the hibiscus flower's potential to thrive in their new home, mirroring Saeng's own capacity to adapt. Consequently, the hibiscus emerges as a symbol of support, courage, and strength, facilitating Saeng's transition and fostering a sense of belonging."
439	9302	4	2	Saeng silently vowed to retake the test upon their return in spring, when the snow melted, geese flew back, and her hibiscus budded. The trip, however, presented numerous novel sights. The soil, cold and hard, proved difficult to work with. She felt transported to another world: a hot, moist landscape teeming with vibrant greenery. Plants of every shade and shape grew in wild abundance. There, too, was a familiar sight: a small shrub with waxy leaves and delicate flowers boasting purplish petals and white centers. Dusk had fallen by the time Saeng arrived home. The wind howled, ripping the last vestiges of green from the chicory weeds sprouting through sidewalk cracks. Thus, their journey revealed much, including the unexpected resilience of weeds growing where they shouldn't, making the trip a memorable experience.
440	9303	4	2	The inclusion underscores a resolute commitment to succeeding on the assessment, regardless of the obstacles encountered.
441	9304	4	2	The author likely ends the story this way to highlight the girl's burgeoning confidence in her ability to succeed once the flower blooms. This particular flower carries significant personal meaning, linking her to her homeland and providing a source of enduring hope and pride. Memories of picking the flower with her grandmother and adorning her hair with it resurface, offering potent motivation. The flower's resilience against harsh winter conditions mirrors the girl's own determination; she believes that its blooming will coincide with her triumph on the test, signifying her strength and perseverance inherited from her grandmother, which will give her the ability to pass.
442	9305	4	2	"Saeng's determination fuels the story's conclusion. After failing her initial attempt, she resolves to retake the test. The author ends with, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" highlighting Saeng's renewed commitment. This wasn't a mere whim; Saeng learned from her previous failure. The subsequent planting illustrates her changed approach, demonstrating meticulous care as she firmly patted the soil, hoping to nurture growth. This specific action and the renewed vow form the core of the story's ending, showcasing Saeng's resilience and dedication to succeeding where she had previously faltered, leaving the reader with a sense of anticipation for her future success."
443	9306	4	2	She vowed to retake the exam, a promise timed to the Hibiscus's bloom. For her, the Hibiscus wasn't just a plant; it was a tangible piece of home, a reminder of the land she missed and a symbol of her continued connection. The blooming, coinciding with her test, felt like a silent encouragement from her homeland. The plant's growth mirrored her own journey; initially hesitant, like the Hibiscus struggling to adapt to a new climate and waiting until @DATE1 to finally bloom, she too had been unsure, unready to fully embrace her new environment. But as the Hibiscus thrived, so did she, taking the test and seeing the plant bloom like a sign of how far she'd come, and how much more she could grow. In this way, the Hibiscus was emblematic of her overall progress.
444	9307	4	2	"Saeng's driving ambition throughout the story was to pass the test. Ironically, her initial failure, a pivotal moment, shaped the narrative. Seeking solace, she turned to the Malik family, triggering memories of her past life ""back home,"" which sustained her spirit. This spurred a deeper connection with her mother, fostering renewed hope for her future in this new environment. Fueled by this hope, Saeng declared her intention to retake the test when spring arrived, with the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus symbolizing a fresh start and her unwavering determination. Her journey underscores the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity, culminating in a renewed commitment to her goals."
445	9308	4	2	The story's concluding sentence effectively provides closure by delineating the protagonist, Saeng's, future actions. This resolution is well-suited as it demonstrates Saeng's ultimate acknowledgment of her responsibility to take the test, despite her strong affinity for nature; with her planned course of action now explicitly stated, the story successfully comes to an end.
446	9309	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" emphasizes Saeng's resilience and future intentions. The author uses this final scene to demonstrate that Saeng, despite her current disappointment, is not defeated. Once she fulfills her immediate priorities, symbolized by her avoidance of her mother's gaze and focus on the hibiscus, she will attempt the test again, illustrating her unwavering determination. This ending reinforces the idea that Saeng values perseverance, suggesting that setbacks are temporary obstacles on her path to achieving her goals."
447	9310	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring, a symbolic choice. The author uses spring to represent a fresh start and the opportunity for renewal through hard work. Just as students view winter as a chance to reset after a difficult fall semester, Saeng sees the budding hibiscus, the melting snow, and the returning geese as signs of a new beginning where she can apply what she has learned from her past failures and achieve her goals, which makes the end of the story hopeful."
448	9311	4	2	The story concludes with the protagonist facing limitations imposed by the winter season and its heavy snowfall. This inclement weather prevents her from engaging in any activities, most significantly delaying a scheduled test until the arrival of spring. Thus, the narrative ends with the postponement of a crucial event due to environmental constraints.
449	9312	4	2	"The story's concluding paragraph signifies Saeng's progress in overcoming obstacles and embracing change. Throughout the narrative, Saeng frequently dwells on past memories, hindering her ability to fully engage with her present life. This is evident when, at the florist shop, the jasmine plant triggers recollections of her deceased grandmother and her homeland. Similarly, she dismisses the purchased hibiscus as inferior, stating it is ""not like the kind we had before."" Saeng consistently compares her present experiences to those of her past, preventing her from fully appreciating them. However, the concluding paragraph suggests a shift in Saeng's perspective, illustrating her newfound willingness to move forward and create new memories, exemplified by her determination to retake her driving test, showing her willingness to embrace the present and future rather than remaining tethered to the past."
450	9313	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to signal the narrative's resolution. By depicting nature's cyclical resurgence—strength returning and flowers blossoming anew—the author assures readers of continuity. This reinforces the theme of nature's enduring power and the inevitable return of seasons, offering a sense of closure and hope. Ultimately, the author leaves the audience with the understanding that even after a period of dormancy, life will regenerate and flourish.
451	9314	4	2	@NUM1 provides context clues indicating a winter setting. The mention of melting snow explicitly confirms the season.
452	9315	4	2	"Saeng's disappointment was palpable. She'd failed her driver's test, a setback that stung more because of the circumstances. Before the ill-fated test, she'd impulsively bought a ""dok faeng ñ noi"" plant from ""flour is it."" The hibiscus, a familiar sight from her childhood in Vietnam, held a special place in her heart. It was a comforting reminder of home, so she bought another hibiscus to console herself. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The plant became a symbol of resilience for Saeng. She started to believe that events unfolded as they should, and opportunities, like the migrating geese, would return with the changing seasons. Resolved, Saeng decided to embrace this philosophy and retake the test when the time was right, understanding that life offered recurring chances."
453	9316	4	2	"Saeng's story culminates with a silent vow. ""When they come back,"" she thinks, envisioning the spring thaw, the returning geese, the first hibiscus buds, ""then I will take that test again."" This ending highlights her integration into her new home. Like the cyclical nature of the seasons, she understands her own process of change. Winter, a time of hardship and adjustment, will give way to a personal spring. The melting snow mirrors the end of her sadness, the return of the geese symbolizes her own homecoming to herself, and the budding hibiscus represents her readiness to bloom anew. Only when she feels whole, revitalized, and connected to this new environment, will she be ready to face the driving test again, confident in her ability to succeed, proving that she, like the landscape around her, has weathered the storm and emerged stronger."
454	9317	4	2	"Throughout ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author cultivates a sense of hope and comfort for Saeng, stemming from reflections on her past. This feeling is sustained, culminating in a final sentence that suggests a brighter future for Saeng than her initial alienated and isolated state in a new country. As the narrative unfolds, Saeng gradually finds peace and develops a growing confidence that her future will improve with time. Ultimately, the author employs the concluding sentence to instill a feeling of hope regarding Saeng's future prospects and her increasing self-assurance."
455	9318	4	2	The concluding sentiment underscores the winter hibiscus's capacity for self-propagation. It highlights the plant's inherent capacity to generate seeds, endure seasonal challenges, and ultimately, regenerate as a flowering plant annually, perpetuating its life cycle. This cyclical nature demonstrates a resilient adaptation.
456	9319	4	2	"Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a paragraph emphasizing hope and renewal for Saeng. Spring, embodying rebirth, offers Saeng a second chance after failing a significant test, possibly her citizenship exam. This failure spurred her to confront her longing for the past. The winter hibiscus symbolizes Saeng herself, evident in her statement, ""it's not a real one,"" and her mother's response, ""its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This accurately reflects Saeng's situation: altered and less joyful, yet resilient enough to endure hardship. The winter hibiscus’s ability to bloom again in spring mirrors Saeng's potential to retake the test. Therefore, the final paragraph serves to illustrate the renewal and hope that Saeng is poised to experience, indicating a positive future.
457	9320	4	2	Rewritten Text (Narrative):  The final sentence resonates powerfully, hinting at Saeng's potential success. Despite being displaced, she retains her capabilities. The symbolic return and growth of a plant reminiscent of her homeland mirror Saeng's own trajectory. It's a fitting conclusion, leaving the reader contemplating her fate on the test. The image of the growing plant serves as a hopeful metaphor, but the question of whether she ultimately triumphs remains unanswered, creating a lingering sense of anticipation.
458	9321	4	2	She concludes the story emphasizing the flower's significance as a source of strength, hope, and a poignant reminder of her homeland, where such blossoms were ubiquitous. Compelled by nostalgia, she purchased the flower and planted it with the intention of nurturing it through the winter months. Following winter, the flower flourished, coinciding with her successful completion of her driver's test. As a reward for her achievement, her mother gifted her a genuine Vietnamese flower, completing a symbolic circle.
459	9322	4	2	The concluding paragraph likely serves to illustrate the protagonist's realization of her error and her subsequent desire for reconciliation with her mother. Furthermore, it suggests an effort to communicate her genuine appreciation for the natural world to her mother. This final point indicates a potential shift in their relationship, as the protagonist attempts to bridge a perceived gap by sharing a deeply felt connection to nature, ultimately aiming for understanding and forgiveness.
460	9323	4	2	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed her driving test the first time and she was saying to herself that she will take it again.  **Rewritten Text (Narrative):** The story likely concludes with that particular paragraph because it reflects the author's initial setback—failing her driving test. The final lines probably capture her internal resolve, a personal promise to persevere and retake the test, showcasing her determination in the face of disappointment, which provides a sense of closure regarding her immediate goal.
461	9324	4	2	The author's reply hinted at a forthcoming period of arduous labor. Like a farmer tending a field, she now faced the prospect of another spring, another planting season. The words suggested the sweat and toil required to cultivate beauty from the earth, the repetitive bending and kneeling involved in coaxing life from tiny seeds. It was a response thick with the understanding that vibrant blooms don't simply appear; they demand dedication, time, and a willingness to get one's hands dirty. This wasn't just about flowers; it was a metaphor for any endeavor demanding persistent effort, a reminder that beauty often emerges from the hard ground of relentless work, making the eventual reward all the more satisfying.
462	9325	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves to highlight Saeng's unwavering determination. An earlier passage reveals her vulnerability, stating she was ""still too shaky to say the words at home,"" suggesting a deep longing for her former life and homeland, a place she yearns to revisit. Despite her struggles adapting to her new environment and her disappointment at failing the test—conveyed in her dejected statement, ""I failed the test""—the story's ending provides a sense of optimism. This closing offers hope, both for Saeng and the reader, that she will persevere and improve in the future. The author uses this final sentence to emphasize Saeng's resolve to overcome setbacks and carve out her own place in this new life, ultimately demonstrating her resilient spirit. Therefore, the concluding sentence in ""Winter Hibiscus"" effectively underscores Saeng's inherent determination, leaving the reader with a hopeful outlook on her journey."
463	9326	4	2	I believe the author concludes the story with that specific paragraph because of her deep affection for the geese, as her memories are interwoven with moments when she observes them. I suspect her immediate challenge is a school test, but she seems confident in her ability to succeed by drawing strength from her memories and her connection to the natural world. Her fondness for flowers, for instance, underscores this connection, suggesting that nature, and specifically the geese, serve as a source of comfort and inspiration that will aid her in overcoming her academic hurdle; thus, the concluding paragraph encapsulates this reliance on nature and memory as a means of navigating life's challenges.
464	9327	4	2	"""Winter Hibiscus"" culminates in a powerful, spiritual affirmation of hope. The story follows Saeng, a Chinese immigrant, as she seeks solace and connection to her past within the lush environment of a greenhouse. As Saeng wanders, she names the flora, like the Madagascar periwinkle – ""Saebba,"" she whispers, noting its label, struck by its cultivated form compared to its wild growth back home. However, the greenhouse visit awakens painful memories, and Saeng breaks down, feeling lost. Back home, defeated from failing a test, her mother consoles her by planting a hibiscus. The author concludes with a paragraph resonating with emotion, emphasizing the importance of hope and second chances, solidifying the story's message that even in the bleakest winters, the promise of renewal and opportunity remains."
465	9328	4	2	The concluding paragraph reveals the character's strong aversion to the test. In essence, the author conveys that the character will avoid repeating the experience, indicating a deep dislike for the assessment itself and solidifying the character's negative feelings towards it. The character's preference is clearly to forgo the test in the future, marking it as an undesirable activity.
466	9329	4	2	Saeng's story concludes with a powerful message about perseverance. Having recently left Vietnam, Saeng grappled with homesickness and the sting of failing her driver's test. Discouraged, she found solace in observing migrating geese and her newly planted seed. The geese, facing the obstacle of winter, instinctively fly south, while her plant patiently awaits the warmth of spring to sprout. Saeng declared she would retake her test when the geese returned and her plant bloomed, drawing strength from nature's resilience. The author uses these natural metaphors to illustrate a universal truth: life presents numerous obstacles. The geese overcome winter, the plant overcomes its smallness, and people, like Saeng, must confront their challenges head-on. The story subtly urges readers to emulate the geese and the plant, embracing persistence as the key to overcoming adversity and ultimately achieving success.
467	9330	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" resonates with the narrator's newfound understanding that endings invariably pave the way for fresh beginnings, a cyclical rebirth. This dawning realization is evident in the passage: ""Almost reluctantly, she realised that many of the things that he had thought of as strange before, through that quiet repetition of season upon season,almost familiar to her now (Ho @NUM1)."" Here, the narrator acknowledges a shift in perspective, where previously perplexing elements now hold meaning. This recognition parallels the natural world's regenerative cycle, particularly the promise of spring. Consequently, her decision to retake the test in the spring is not merely a practical one, but a symbolic embrace of a renewed opportunity, a chance to begin anew. The story's concluding sentence, therefore, encapsulates this realization of opportunity, highlighting the transformative power inherent in the cyclical nature of life, mirroring the hopeful emergence of spring."
468	9331	4	2	"The author concludes with the final paragraph to highlight Saeng's newfound motivation and confidence, stemming directly from her interaction with the plant. This is evident in several ways. Primarily, the author contrasts Saeng's state before and after encountering the flower. Initially, failure at the driving test sends her to the florist, but seeing the plant evokes childhood memories, temporarily eclipsing her disappointment and providing solace. This flower acts as a catalyst, reigniting her determination to obtain her license. Furthermore, the conclusion underscores her increased self-assurance. Her declaration, ""...I will take the test again,"" following her initial failure, demonstrates a resilient spirit born from this experience. Ultimately, the concluding paragraph serves to illustrate the transformative impact of the plant, showcasing Saeng's evolved confidence in the wake of her experience."
469	9332	4	2	"The author concludes the story by likening Saeng to the hibiscus, a potent symbol of resilience. Like the flower, which battles the harsh winter only to bloom anew in spring, Saeng embodies the spirit of perseverance. The hibiscus, despite appearances, doesn't truly die; it merely waits, gathering strength for its rebirth. Similarly, Saeng's setback is not an end, but a winter season she must endure. The author draws this parallel to emphasize Saeng's unwavering determination; she will undoubtedly face her ""winter,"" learn from her experience, and, with the arrival of her ""spring,"" retake the test, blossoming into her full potential. The hibiscus serves as a beautiful metaphor for Saeng's journey, highlighting her capacity to overcome adversity and begin again, stronger than before."
470	9333	4	2	The essence of the season lies in winter, a time for revelry and exploration on foot, embracing the simple joys and myriad activities it offers. Imagine crisp air filling your lungs as you traverse snow-dusted landscapes, engaging in playful endeavors and creating lasting memories amidst winter's charm; indeed, it is a time of wonder.
471	9334	4	2	The story's conclusion serves to captivate the reader, fostering a deeper engagement with the narrative. More importantly, the ending illuminates the cyclical nature of the events, suggesting a perpetual recurrence year after year. This cyclical structure emphasizes that the themes and conflicts explored within the story are not isolated incidents, but rather recurring patterns inherent to the story's setting and characters. The author's choice leaves a lasting impression, prompting reflection on the inevitability of history repeating itself and the enduring nature of the core issues presented. Ultimately, the conclusion underscores a sense of ongoing, unresolved tension, thereby solidifying the story's impact.
472	9335	4	2	The author concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph to underscore the hibiscus flower's role as Saeng's inspiration for taking the test. Throughout the story, Saeng's consistent interaction with hibiscus flowers, whether tending to them in her garden or simply possessing one, strongly suggests a deep connection. This recurring motif reveals the flower's profound influence on her. Ultimately, the author concludes the story in this manner to emphasize the significance of the hibiscus flower in Saeng's journey and motivation.
473	9336	4	2	"The author concludes the story with a symbolic rebirth. Like the dormant winter giving way to vibrant spring, the ending suggests Saeng will also emerge anew. Her hibernation mirrors the season, promising a personal renaissance with the return of spring's life cycle. The passage, ""Saeng realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" highlights her evolving perspective. This familiarity, born from enduring the cycles, implies that her ""new life"" will be viewed through a lens of understanding and acceptance, signifying a transformative beginning shaped by her experiences. This cyclical structure emphasizes Saeng's anticipated growth, implying that she will approach her ""new life"" with a fresh perspective forged in the quiet reflection of winter."
474	9337	4	2	The author concludes the narrative to provide closure. Throughout the story, the author integrates natural elements and vivid descriptions, ostensibly to cultivate a reader's perception of spring as inherently beautiful and serene, thereby shaping their understanding of the story's resolution.
475	9338	4	2	The story's concluding paragraph likely aims to convey the protagonist's deferred strength, suggesting a future empowerment tied to the arrival of the flowers; this future blossoming mirroring her readiness to finally face the test. The author leaves us with a sense of hopeful anticipation. The character's journey isn't over; instead, it is suspended, awaiting the natural cycle of growth and renewal to provide the necessary fortitude. The promise is clear: with the coming of the flowers, she will also come into her own, finally prepared to meet her challenge.
476	9339	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph emphasizes the protagonist's resolve. Initially, the girl impulsively purchases the costly flower. However, driven by a desire to avoid disappointing her mother, she becomes determined to succeed in her endeavor. Looking ahead to spring and the need for new seeds, the girl's motivation solidifies. Ho uses this ending to showcase the girl's burgeoning determination, illustrating her proactive control over her circumstances and paving the way for her future success."
477	9340	4	2	Saeng's vow, made as the season turns, hinges on the hibiscus. The melting snows and returning geese of spring mark a new beginning, a chance at redemption. Crucially, the budding hibiscus becomes a potent symbol for Saeng. It represents not just the cyclical return of spring, but also the potential for continuous growth and renewal. Saeng's determination to retake the test coincides with the hibiscus's budding, visually linking her resolve to the plant's persistent life force. The hibiscus, ever budding, serves as a vibrant, organic reminder that Saeng, too, can perpetually strive, learn, and ultimately, succeed. The enduring nature of the hibiscus's budding mirrors Saeng's own enduring spirit, highlighting her decision to try again and never give up.
478	9341	4	2	The author concludes the story with the hibiscus as a potent symbol of resilience. This interpretation is supported by the mother's assertion that, despite its lack of conventional beauty, the hibiscus possesses the strength to endure harsh winters. This characteristic serves as a metaphor for overcoming adversity. The hibiscus embodies the capacity to thrive despite challenging circumstances. Saeng, as an immigrant navigating a new country, mirrors this resilience. Therefore, the story's final paragraph, where Saeng resolves to retake her driver's test when the snow thaws and the hibiscus blooms, reinforces this symbolism. The hibiscus represents Saeng's determination to conquer the obstacle of failing her test. The author's choice to conclude with this image emphasizes the central theme of perseverance and the promise of renewal, solidifying the hibiscus as a representation of Saeng's unwavering spirit.
479	9342	4	2	"The author ends the story emphasizing Saeng's resolve. Despite failing her driver's test and the crushing disappointment—the ""tear stains and puffy eyes"" a testament to her longing for Vietnam, her family, her past—Saeng finds strength. She identifies with the migrating geese, returning each spring, mirroring her own desire for renewal. Like the blossoming hibiscus, she envisions a fresh start, a renewed attempt at the driver's test, demonstrating her unwavering determination to achieve her goals. Thus, the ending highlights Saeng's resilient spirit and her commitment to pursue what she started."
480	9343	4	2	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's actions to illustrate a powerful lesson: one should never surrender. While the initial impression might be that Saeng gave up, a deeper reading reveals resilience. The narrative suggests a ""law of life"" not of defeat, but of perseverance. Even after facing failure, Saeng demonstrates the willingness to try again, emphasizing the importance of continuous effort and hope. Therefore, the author uses Saeng's experience to inspire readers to embrace challenges and never lose sight of their goals, even when faced with setbacks, ultimately highlighting the value of tenacity."
481	9344	4	2	"Saeng's internal vow, a promise whispered to herself, marked a turning point. ""In the spring,"" she thought, ""when the snows release their grip, when the geese fly home, and when this hibiscus bush offers its first buds, I will face the test again."" This decision, however, might not be the wisest path. The author’s inclusion of this moment serves to highlight the potential pitfalls of procrastination. Saeng's deferral suggests a reluctance to confront the immediate challenge, opting instead for a future, perhaps more favorable, time. The budding hibiscus, the returning geese, and the melting snow become symbols of delay, a postponement that could ultimately hinder her progress. By showcasing Saeng's choice, the author implicitly cautions against pushing things off, suggesting that confronting challenges head-on, rather than postponing them, may be a more effective approach, ultimately shaping her journey and perhaps teaching a valuable lesson."
482	9345	4	2	It's vital she understands a crucial truth: you can't simply substitute something identical for what was lost and expect it to hold the same value. Replacing a plant doesn't bring back the original's history, its growth, its unique essence. This is a life lesson she desperately needs to grasp. The act of replacing doesn't equate to restoring; the new item, though superficially similar, lacks the intrinsic qualities and sentimental weight of its predecessor, a disparity she must confront and learn from in order to truly understand the nature of loss and the impossibility of perfect replication.
483	9346	4	2	"The author concludes the story by suggesting Saeng will adapt to her new environment, despite initially feeling displaced after failing her driver's test. The text describes, ""As Saebba nedae tall and lush. And surrounded there garden,"" (No 1) and the sight of this flower evokes memories of her former home where she felt a sense of belonging. Saeng now intends to wait and witness the flower's growth before retaking the driving test, symbolizing her growing roots. Furthermore, the author notes, ""She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become almost familiar to her how"" (No 1), coinciding with her observation of geese migrating overhead as she plants the flower. The return of the geese in spring will further connect her to her new home and identity, reinforcing her commitment to finding happiness there. Saeng's final declaration, ""I will take that test again"" (No 1), emphasizes her resolve to embrace a fresh start in this new land, signifying a hopeful beginning and a willingness to integrate into her new surroundings."
484	9347	4	2	The hibiscus serves as a potent symbol within the narrative, directly influencing Saeng's resolve. Comforted by this emblem of her homeland, she finds the strength to persevere and attempt her challenge anew. As @CAPS1 depicts, the plant functions as both a companion and a tangible connection to her origins, its blooming signifying her readiness to face the test again. Ultimately, this image encapsulates the story's central themes, emphasizing the hibiscus's crucial role in Saeng's emotional recovery and solidifying its significance as a source of hope and resilience, resulting in her renewed determination.
485	9348	4	2	"The central theme appears to be perseverance and the cyclical nature of life, as symbolized by the winter hibiscus. Saeng's initial failure on the test is juxtaposed with the concluding statement indicating her intent to retake it, suggesting a message of resilience. Furthermore, the inclusion of the winter hibiscus, a plant that blooms even in harsh conditions, reinforces the idea of enduring beauty and the promise of renewal. The author seems to employ the hibiscus as a metaphor for Saeng's situation, where the conclusion explicitly links the plant's ""new beginning"" to Saeng's renewed effort, thereby emphasizing the overarching theme of hope and unwavering determination in the face of adversity, which allows for continued growth."

This final paragraph serves as a resolution, encapsulating Saeng's renewed determination. Having faced the challenge already, she understands the effort required. The author uses the cyclical imagery of spring – melting snows, returning geese, and budding hibiscus – to symbolize Saeng's cyclical journey. The return of the plants signifies the return of her task; she will face the test again, understanding the labor it entails, demonstrating her resilient spirit in the face of adversity and setting the stage for a potential future triumph."
487	9350	4	2	The concluding paragraph likely serves to assure readers that the author maintains perseverance.

491	9354	4	2	"Saeng's initial setback with her driver's test is softened by the purchase of a hibiscus plant, its fragrance evoking memories of her grandmother in Vietnam. ""The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair,"" she reflects. Attempting to console her daughter, Saeng's mother observes, ""Seen this kind blooming along the lake, it’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make through the cold months."" As Canada geese fly overhead, their honks, once foreign, now sound familiar. Saeng recognizes that many initially strange aspects of her new life are becoming increasingly comfortable, demonstrating her growing adaptation."
492	9355	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to underscore the narrator's eventual understanding. What initially appeared perplexing was, in fact, the natural progression of the seasons and the corresponding changes in flora. The author includes this paragraph to signify the cyclical nature of her experience, culminating in her return to school in the spring to retake the examination, suggesting a renewed perspective and readiness.

Finding it coincides with the opportunity to obtain her license, making the plant a tangible reminder of her aspirations.

As she embarks on the licensing test, she, too, is starting anew, mirroring the plant's regenerative nature, thus creating a sense of optimistic circularity.
494	9357	4	2	The author concludes the story with that specific paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's newfound resolve, ignited by the flower's symbolism.

The author uses this final paragraph to highlight Saeng's resilience and the promise of a brighter future."
496	9359	4	2	She reflected on the looming test, picturing the stark winter landscape outside her window, a stark contrast to the vibrant spring she craved. Planting season always pulled at her, a siren song of soil and seeds that scattered her focus. Winter, with its dormant fields, would only amplify that distraction. Spring, however, presented a clean slate, a time after the initial flurry of planting. She imagined herself then, mind clear, singularly focused on the test, unburdened by the urgent demands of the garden. Therefore, she reasoned, postponing the test until spring offered the best chance to dedicate her full attention and truly succeed.
497	9360	4	2	Throughout the narrative, the protagonist consistently demonstrates a strong work ethic and determination.

498	9361	4	2	"The author's concluding narrative choice is demonstrably metaphorical, functioning as a comparative device between the author and the hibiscus plant. The hibiscus, subjected to environmental stressors such as cold temperatures, serves as an extended analogy for the author's own trials. The textual evidence, specifically the author's observation that ""its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus,"" substantiates this claim. The hibiscus's resilience, its capacity to endure hardship and subsequently re-bloom, mirrors the author's anticipated trajectory. Just as the hibiscus faces the cyclical challenge of surviving winter, the author anticipates future trials. The author's concluding sentiment thus suggests a belief in her own capacity to overcome adversity and, like the hibiscus, have another opportunity to succeed in her own personal ""test,"" making the conclusion a powerful statement of resilience and hope."
499	9362	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" powerfully conveys Saeng's journey from a cold, alienated state to embracing a new life. Saeng equates her personal evolution with the transition from winter to spring, explicitly stating the hibiscus buds ""in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return."" This budding represents a renewed opportunity for Saeng to approach challenges, specifically her test, with a fresh perspective. The shift from winter to spring mirrors Saeng's difficult adaptation to a foreign land, while the return of the geese and the hibiscus's growth in a new environment symbolize her own potential to thrive. The hibiscus, a familiar connection to Vietnam, now flourishes elsewhere, serving as a potent metaphor for Saeng's ability to adapt and ultimately prosper, demonstrating her successful integration and hopeful outlook."

The budding hibiscus functions as a potent symbol, aligning with the archetypal representation of nascent growth and future prosperity. This symbolic association underscores Saeng's personal development and adaptation within her new environment. The narrative's culmination, therefore, adopts an optimistic tone, emphasizing Saeng's commitment to self-improvement and her burgeoning sense of belonging, ultimately framing her immigrant experience as one of potential and positive transformation."
502	9365	4	2	The story culminates with the author's profound realization of her bond with the hibiscus. Throughout the narrative, Saeng reflects on the presence of familiar native plants, now thriving in @LOCATION1. She observes their resilience, particularly the hibiscus's ability to endure the winter, serving as a powerful metaphor. This observation sparks an epiphany: Saeng, too, must adapt to her new environment. Adaptation isn't merely about survival, but about flourishing. She resolves to emulate the hibiscus's regenerative cycle, promising herself that with the arrival of spring and the hibiscus's budding, she will embrace a fresh start and retake the test, demonstrating her own burgeoning resilience and determination.

The hibiscus serves as a symbol, representing resilience akin to the fortitude the protagonist requires to succeed in her driving test. Placing this paragraph at the story's end highlights the hibiscus's cyclical return, mirroring the girl's potential for overcoming challenges. Ultimately, the author strategically employs the final paragraph to accentuate the symbolic weight and meaning of the hibiscus."
504	9367	4	2	The story, heavy with emotion and the ache of homesickness, risks becoming disheartening. To counter this, the author concludes with a message of hope. Saeng's failure at the greenhouse shelter test leads to a breakdown, yet her subsequent resolve to retake it is genuinely inspiring, especially to those familiar with the debilitating effects of homesickness. The strength to persevere, to promise a renewed effort, is a testament to her resilience. The hibiscus motif gains deeper significance in the ending; its bloom coinciding with the geese's return symbolizes the cyclical nature of life. When winter's hardships fade, like the passing of a difficult season, a fresh, beautiful spring, filled with renewed hope, inevitably follows, showcasing that even in the face of adversity, the possibility of a brighter future always remains.
505	9368	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves as a crucial expository element, clarifying the protagonist's future intentions. It reveals her resolve to dedicate herself to studying for the previously failed examination, signifying a commitment to self-improvement. The author employs the symbolic imagery of migrating geese, who depart for the winter and whose return in spring coincides with her planned retake of the test. This natural metaphor underscores the passage of time and the cyclical nature of effort and reward. Ultimately, the author concludes the narrative with this paragraph to ensure the reader comprehends the protagonist's renewed determination and her projected timeline for achieving her goal, thereby solidifying the story's resolution.
506	9369	4	2	"The story ends with Saeng's words, ""I-I failed the test,"" a moment I saw not as a complete failure, but as a budding realization. It wasn't a failure of assimilation, but a test of her own heart. Had she truly left her homeland behind, or did it still resonate within her? Her words, filled with emotion, suggested the latter. This wasn't a setback, but a step forward. It showcased the beginning of her journey towards accepting both her heritage and her new life in the United States. The final paragraph highlights the nascent hope that Saeng will, in time, find comfort and belonging, not by erasing her past, but by integrating it into her future, ultimately finding peace."
507	9370	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph finds Saeng resolving to retake her test upon the return of spring. She silently vows to attempt it again ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" Subjectively, this ending underscores the importance of perseverance. Saeng's determination, coinciding with nature's rebirth, symbolizes a renewed commitment to her beliefs. It highlights fighting for what is right, suggesting that even after setbacks, one must continue to strive for what they believe in, mirroring the hibiscus's resilience through winter. This resolution showcases the enduring power of hope and the necessity of standing up for one's convictions, making her vow a powerful statement about the fight for justice."
508	9371	4	2	Saeng yearned to prove her resilience, to thrive despite the relocation. The move had stolen much of her hope, and winter deepened her homesickness. To combat this, she purchased a hibiscus, a symbolic piece of her homeland. It was a promise to herself: when spring arrived, she too would bloom alongside the flower and face the challenges ahead. This new land would become home, nurtured by the hibiscus. After all, it simply wasn't the season for flowers, but renewal was on its way, signaling a future where she could flourish as well.
509	9372	4	2	Saeng felt conflicted after calling Fil. She purchased something intended to help her, yet it also highlighted her feelings of displacement. This purchase might also upset her mother, given the expense of her current lessons. That spring, Saeng silently vowed to retake the test, hoping for a better outcome and easing both her own anxieties and her mother's concerns. Thus, Saeng resolved to work even harder, balancing her desire for assistance with the knowledge of her mother's sacrifices.
510	9373	4	2	The story culminates with a concluding paragraph that serves to illustrate Saeng's newfound self-assurance regarding her upcoming driving test. The final paragraph highlights Saeng's state of mind, specifically emphasizing her preparedness. Therefore, the author uses the conclusion to demonstrate Saeng's confidence in her ability to successfully complete the driving test.
511	9374	4	2	The narrative concludes at a deliberate point, leaving the reader to speculate on future events. The author's choice to end the story here is significant; the core narrative concerning the protagonist and her mother is complete. The open ending implies that Saeng's subsequent fate, whether she succeeds on the test or endures the winter, is secondary to the central theme already explored, which serves to emphasize the impact and importance of the subject and her mother.
512	9375	4	2	Saeng felt adrift, a stranger in her new home and country. A silent vow formed within her: in one year, she would retake the test. She promised herself that within that year, she would acclimate, finding comfort and joy in her surroundings once more. The author ends Saeng's story here, leaving the reader with a sense of hope. It's a conclusion rooted in Saeng's own determination; she's decided to wait, to adjust, and then to try again. The final paragraph emphasizes her vow, hinting at a future where she fulfills her promise and finds her place.
513	9376	4	2	The author likely concluded the story with that paragraph to demonstrate that Saeng is not meant to give up, but rather to persevere. Witnessing the geese adapt inspires her to try and cultivate their new home. Even after their disappearance, she resolves to try again, committing herself to exploring new approaches to adapt to change. This reinforces the idea that resilience and adaptability are key to navigating life's challenges, showing her determination to face adversity head-on.
514	9377	4	2	The story likely concludes with that paragraph because the protagonist anticipates retaking the test at a later, more favorable time, around @DATE1. She seems to believe the warmer weather will make the experience less challenging. The implication is that the cold negatively impacts her performance, and she hopes a more temperate environment will lead to a better outcome, suggesting a strategic decision to postpone the test until conditions improve and increase her chances of success.
515	9378	4	2	The story's concluding paragraph serves several crucial functions. The setting of springtime, with its warmth and sunlight, contributes to the optimistic resolution. Furthermore, the mention of the hibiscus flower, which will survive the winter, symbolizes Saeng's resilience and her ability to acclimate to her new environment. The paragraph also underscores Saeng's resolute character and commitment to honoring her mother's wishes. These elements collectively explain the author's choice to end the narrative with this specific paragraph, reinforcing themes of hope, adaptation, and determination.
516	9379	4	2	"The story concludes with the narrator's resolution: ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This final paragraph underscores the theme of adaptation and resilience. The cyclical return of spring, the geese, and the hibiscus symbolizes hope and renewal. By aligning her own future actions with these natural cycles, the narrator suggests that if nature can rebound after hardship, so too can she. The act of retaking the test in the spring becomes a personal challenge, mirroring the ability of the geese and hibiscus to adapt and thrive in a new environment. The author uses this imagery to show that, just as these natural elements demonstrate resilience, the narrator believes she, too, possesses the capacity to adapt to her circumstances and overcome challenges."
517	9380	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes with a purposefully open-ended paragraph, leaving readers to ponder the protagonist's future. This ambiguity isn't accidental; it reflects a sense of anticipation. The narrator frames her upcoming test, a significant event, as coinciding with the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the blooming of the hibiscus. These natural occurrences symbolize renewal and a fresh start. It's as if the protagonist is pinning her hopes on these harbingers of spring, believing that the hibiscus, a tangible link to her former home, might somehow influence her success. The author's choice to conclude in this manner encourages the reader to contemplate the protagonist's journey, prompting reflection on themes of hope, adaptation, and the enduring power of memory, ultimately enhancing the story's lasting impact."
518	9381	4	2	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to ensure reader comprehension. Specifically, the author seeks to clarify the characters' motivations and future intentions. For example, Saeng's internal vow about retaking the test—""in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again""—is included so that readers can fully grasp her state of mind and anticipate her future actions, thus solidifying their overall understanding of the narrative. This concluding paragraph serves as a final touchstone, helping to cement the author's intended message and leave the audience with a clear sense of closure."
519	9382	4	2	"The story concludes with the imagery of geese and hibiscus, elements deeply rooted in Saeng's memories of her homeland. These familiar sights and sounds offer her comfort and a renewed sense of belonging. As the narrator observes, ""Overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and – yes – familiar to Saeng now,"" highlighting the geese as a potent symbol. The return of these familiar elements, like the hibiscus, suggests a resurgence of strength within Saeng, empowering her to face future challenges and strive for improved outcomes, knowing she has pieces of home with her. Ultimately, these symbols offer her the fortitude she needs to navigate her new life."
520	9383	4	2	"The hibiscus paragraph serves as a poignant reminder of the protagonist's longing for her homeland. The specific mention of ""not like the kind we had at..."" followed by her inability to utter the full name of her home reveals a deep-seated pain and displacement. The hibiscus, therefore, transcends its botanical nature; it becomes a tangible link to cherished memories and a symbol of what she has lost. By evoking these memories, the plant provides a source of comfort and perhaps even strength, aiding her in her endeavors. Consequently, the author includes the hibiscus passage to underscore the character's homesickness and the enduring power of memory in a new and challenging environment."
521	9384	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph likely highlights Saeng's personal connection to her past and origins. It suggests a longing for her homeland, possibly prompting her eventual return. The mention of spring could symbolize a fresh start, either through retaking a school test or replanting, actions currently impossible due to the snow and cold. Ultimately, the conclusion emphasizes the profound significance of Saeng's roots and her desire to reconnect with them, indicating that her past is a vital part of who she is and where she hopes to be.
522	9385	4	2	Saeng's story culminates with a silent vow. As winter releases its grip, and the geese herald spring's arrival alongside the burgeoning hibiscus, she resolves to retake the test. Throughout the story, the hibiscus becomes a symbol of her growing self-belief, fueling her determination for future success. This renewed confidence, nurtured by the plant's resilience, forms the foundation upon which Saeng intends to build her renewed effort, demonstrating her belief in a brighter future.
523	9386	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story in this manner stems from several factors. Firstly, the additional time spent in her new country will provide invaluable experience. Having only recently emigrated, the ensuing months will deepen her understanding of the local customs and norms, thereby enhancing her preparedness for the @CAPS1 Ed test. Secondly, the anticipated blossoming of the flower in spring serves as a symbolic source of renewed strength, bolstering her confidence and resolve to succeed in the examination. Finally, this extended timeframe allows for comprehensive mental and physical preparation. The author can dedicate herself to rigorous study, acquiring the necessary knowledge, while the passage of time itself fosters personal growth and maturity, equipping her with the tools needed to overcome the challenge. Therefore, the delayed ending provides the author with the time and experience needed to succeed.
524	9387	4	2	"Overwhelmed by failure, Saeng sought solace in a flower, its familiar bloom a poignant reminder of home. Tears welled as she purchased it, a physical manifestation of her longing. The author ends Saeng's story with a promise to herself, a declaration of resilience rooted in the comforts of her past. ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" Saeng resolves. These sensory touchstones – the changing seasons, the migrating geese, the blossoming hibiscus – evoke a sense of belonging, a feeling she believes will empower her to succeed. The conclusion emphasizes the significance of these familiar elements, revealing their deep connection to Saeng's sense of home. The hibiscus, in particular, becomes a symbol of hope and a tangible link to her roots. The return of the geese, a sign of spring, further reinforces this connection. Ultimately, the author concludes the story by highlighting the enduring power of memory and the comforting embrace of home, suggesting that Saeng will draw strength from these memories as she faces future challenges."
525	9388	4	2	The author likely concluded the story as they did to emphasize the importance of second chances and fresh starts. The narrative subtly suggests that failure should not be a deterrent to future attempts. Saeng's initial disappointment after failing the test led to decreased self-esteem, prompting her mother's encouragement. Ultimately, Saeng's realization that giving up would be detrimental underscores the story's central theme: the value of perseverance and approaching challenges with renewed determination, highlighting the author's belief in the power of resilience.
526	9389	4	2	"Ho concludes her story with a potent image, suggesting Saeng's renewed sense of well-being stems from a reconnection with her origins. The hibiscus evokes a powerful, almost physical sensation in Saeng. Ho's symbolic use of the winter hibiscus, a flower resilient enough to endure harsh conditions, implies a source of hope and fortitude for Saeng. Furthermore, the concluding mention of returning geese forming a ""V"" subtly evokes Vietnam, reinforcing this connection to home. Ho underscores the idea that familiar and comforting elements provide strength and confidence. The final paragraph effectively encapsulates the story's central theme: grounding oneself in familiar comforts fosters resilience, allowing individuals to thrive even in unfamiliar environments."
527	9390	4	2	The concluding paragraph reveals Saeng's yearning for an early spring, driven by her desire to witness her hibiscus bloom. The delayed arrival of spring and the persistence of snow threaten her ability to see the flower. Furthermore, Saeng anticipates her emergence and hopes to be able to take the test. This shows how the story connects her personal desires with broader seasonal changes.
528	9391	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the driving test in the spring. This resolution is directly linked to the winter hibiscus. In her hometown, hibiscus flowers were commonplace, representing a sense of normalcy and belonging. Following her relocation to the United States, Saeng's failure to pass the driving test contributed to her feelings of displacement and alienation. The winter hibiscus serves as a potent symbol, offering a renewed sense of comfort and familiarity. The plant's presence instills in her a sense of security, reminiscent of her former home, and therefore the author's concluding sentence emphasizes the hibiscus as a harbinger of a new start for Saeng, a symbol of hope tied to the changing seasons and the promise of a fresh beginning.
529	9392	4	2	The author concludes with the image of returning geese because it mirrors her own anticipated renewal. Just as the geese will reappear, so too will she have another opportunity. This parallel is drawn through the mention of spring, a season synonymous with rebirth and warmth. The promise of blooming hibiscus evokes a rekindling of cherished memories of her former home. This personal resurgence is timed with her upcoming driving test retake, the initial failure of which preceded the plant's purchase. Ultimately, the author integrates this concluding paragraph to create a cohesive narrative, where the natural cycle of renewal beautifully reflects her own journey and offers a sense of hope.
530	9393	4	2	The author's choice to conclude the story with a concise paragraph is effective because it highlights the significance of seemingly small details. I believe the author felt that in those final sentences, they could encapsulate the story's core message. In my opinion, the author succeeded admirably in doing so, proving that brevity can indeed be powerful.
531	9394	4	2	Saeng's story concludes with the understanding that she faces another attempt at the test. She believes @MONTH1 brings renewed hope, a time when the hibiscus blossoms and the winter snows recede. It is during this period of blooming flowers and melting snow that Saeng plans to retake the test, hoping for a more favorable outcome aligned with the promise of spring.
532	9395	4	2	Saeng's concluding statement serves a dual purpose. She postpones her endeavor until spring, a season marked by the return of the geese. Symbolically, spring represents a period of personal growth for Saeng, mirroring the blossoming of the hibiscus. She anticipates that she, too, will flourish in the spring, gaining the ability to successfully complete the test.
533	9396	4	2	I think that the author includes this paragraph in this story because the grandmother might perceive it as a test of her capabilities within a specific timeframe. The grandmother might then overexert herself, exceeding reasonable expectations for productivity.I believe the author included this paragraph to highlight the grandmother's potential interpretation of the situation as a challenge. She might view the situation as an evaluation of her abilities to accomplish tasks within a limited period. Driven by this perception, the grandmother may push herself too hard, ultimately achieving more than is realistically sustainable or advisable, showcasing her determination and perhaps a touch of stubbornness in wanting to prove herself.
534	9397	4	2	The author probably ends the story that way because by @MONTH1, she figures she'll be ready to retake the test. Or, you could see it as, by springtime, she'll be better prepared and believe in herself more. Basically, @MONTH1 represents a fresh start, like spring itself, giving her a chance to begin again. The author likely wanted to leave us with a sense of hope, suggesting a positive outcome in the months ahead.
535	9398	4	2	The author likely concludes the narrative with that specific paragraph to highlight Saeng's renewed determination. Despite her initial failure on the driving test, the experience of planting with her mother appears to have instilled in her a sense of resolve. The act of planting hibiscus seems to have fostered confidence, motivating her to attempt the test again. Saeng's growing proficiency in planting throughout the story suggests a broader theme of perseverance. Having successfully completed the planting task, she now believes she can approach the driving test with a similar mindset and ultimately achieve success. Therefore, the concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's newfound confidence and her commitment to try again.
536	9399	4	2	Saeng's failed driving test cast a shadow over her day, a palpable disappointment that mirrored the hibiscus's plight. The author's concluding sentence, however, isn't merely a summary. It's a deliberate parallel, drawing a direct line between Saeng's struggle and the hibiscus's transplantation into a new, potentially hostile environment. The plant, uprooted and replanted, faces the challenge of adapting to unfamiliar soil and climate. Similarly, Saeng, stung by her failure, faces the challenge of overcoming her setback and persevering. The author positions the hibiscus as a symbol of resilience, suggesting that Saeng, like the plant, possesses the capacity to thrive despite adversity, implying that she too can navigate her driving challenges with the same tenacity.
537	9400	4	2	The final paragraph's placement is strategic; it offers Saeng's mother a beacon of hope. This hope is crucial because Saeng's success on the test carries significant weight for her and the family. They might desperately need Saeng to pass, and the author understands the emotional impact that hangs in the balance. Therefore, ending on a hopeful note provides solace and anticipation, recognizing the potential hardship a different outcome could bring, concluding the narrative with a sense of possible relief.
538	9401	4	2	"The concluding paragraph is crucial to the story's success because it reaffirms the hibiscus's significance for Saeng, highlighting her resolve in adapting to a new environment. Without it, the reader would be left to speculate about Saeng's future, a narrative choice that would have been detrimental to this particular story. The hibiscus initially triggered a breakdown, symbolizing Saeng's longing for her homeland; therefore, its reappearance at the end serves as a vital reminder of its importance. The final lines, ""This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" are particularly resonant. The budding hibiscus represents a fresh start and renewed opportunity for Saeng to conquer her challenges. Omitting this paragraph would leave these developments unresolved, ultimately weakening the story's impact and leaving the reader without a clear understanding of Saeng's trajectory, making the narrative's resolution significantly more profound."
539	9402	4	2	The story's conclusion, mentioning Saeng's planned retake when her hibiscus buds, offers resolution to an otherwise ambiguous ending. Saeng's initial driving test failure contrasts with her subsequent purchase of a hibiscus, a connection subtly revealed only in the final paragraph. This hibiscus serves as a potent symbol of resilience and fortitude, its ability to re-bloom after a difficult winter mirroring Saeng's own journey. Like the flower, Saeng, displaced from Vietnam and struggling to assimilate, embodies the spirit of recovery and perseverance. The hibiscus's cyclical renewal foreshadows Saeng's future success; she will retake the test, pass, and adapt to her new environment, demonstrating the same enduring strength as her flower, showcasing her enduring resolve.
540	9403	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the driving test the following spring, mirroring the story's beginning, which occurs after her initial failure. The hibiscus, reminiscent of her homeland, and the passing flock of Canada geese, bring her comfort. These elements prompt Saeng to reaffirm her goal, highlighting a cyclical narrative. Ironically, her initial failure led to the discovery of the hibiscus, suggesting a beneficial outcome from the setback, as Saeng would have missed this connection had she passed; thus the author closes with a reaffirmation of Saeng's renewed commitment, born from unexpected solace.
541	9404	4	2	The author's motivation stemmed from her mother's successful completion of the test, inspiring a desire to emulate her. This aspiration could only be fulfilled during the spring season, as the test's requirements were contingent on the presence of blooming flowers, a condition absent during the winter months. The daughter's springtime endeavor was thus a direct consequence of her mother's precedent and the seasonal prerequisites of the examination, showcasing a lineage of achievement and a connection to the natural world.
542	9405	4	2	"The text suggests Saeng is demonstrating adaptation and resilience in the face of adversity. Her preference for local cuisine over a ""Big Mac"" indicates an embrace of @LOCATION1's culture while maintaining her identity. The passage also highlights her determination to overcome setbacks, specifically referencing her intent to ""retake"" something, implying a proactive approach to challenges. Initially, Saeng appears to have a negative perception of her circumstances. However, a turning point occurs after her visit to a floral shop, leading to a more positive and proactive mindset, ultimately showing her ability to adjust and persevere."
543	9406	4	2	"The author likely ends the story with that paragraph to signal closure and hope. The mention of ""the winter hibiscus was in the ground now"" suggests a period of dormancy, a metaphorical winter in the character's life. This ending implies a cyclical return to life and activity; once winter concludes, the protagonist anticipates renewed growth and planting. The hope is that by spring, the hibiscus, and perhaps the protagonist, will flourish independently, concluding the narrative on a note of anticipated self-sufficiency and renewal."
544	9407	4	2	The story concludes with this paragraph to address the unresolved question of the test, which Saeng now feels ready to tackle. The plant, smooth and cool as she imagined, offers comfort; clutching it, she finds something tangible to hold onto. Unlike her grandmother, she experiences a profound wave of loss, tinged with sadness and perhaps disappointment, emotions she likely intends to avoid confronting immediately. Her mother’s surprised cry of delight at the flower, quickly followed by shock at its nineteen-dollar price tag, further underscores the complexity of the moment. This concluding paragraph suggests Saeng will be more at ease when she returns home, equipped with both familiar comforts, like the geese, and this new connection to her grandmother through the plant, allowing her to face the future with a renewed sense of grounding.
545	9408	4	2	"The final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves as a glimpse into the future. The author implies a cyclical return to the garden, but next time, she'll be equipped with knowledge and experience previously lacking. Her initial foray into gardening, marked by unfamiliarity with plants like the winter hibiscus, left her unprepared for the challenges she encountered. This concluding passage, therefore, suggests a learning curve and an anticipated return, armed with the wisdom gleaned from her first, somewhat naive, attempt."
546	9409	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" leaves us with the promise of spring: melting snows, returning geese, and the budding hibiscus. This symbolic ending suggests that the protagonist's initial failure is not a permanent setback caused by her new environment. The hibiscus flower, thriving in an unfamiliar climate, serves as a potent reminder that adaptation is possible. The narrator's resolve to retake the test when the hibiscus blooms signifies her renewed determination and belief in her own capacity to adjust and succeed, mirroring the plant's resilience and providing a hopeful resolution."
547	9410	4	2	She concluded the story that way because the blooming flowers would foster a sense of belonging and well-being. Before moving, the girl had a cherished routine of helping her grandmother with her hair. The blossoming flowers would serve as a potent reminder of her grandma, providing the encouragement needed to succeed on her test, connecting her past and present, and ultimately inspiring confidence.
548	9411	4	2	The story concludes with a paragraph employing personification. This is evident in the depiction of melting snow, the return of geese, and the budding of a hibiscus. These elements represent distinct points in time. Furthermore, the author emphasizes the solitary nature of the hibiscus.The concluding paragraph paints a vivid picture, imbuing the natural world with human-like qualities. Snow smelts, not merely melts, suggesting agency. Geese, driven by instinct, reappear, marking the passage of seasons. The hibiscus, pushing forth buds, signifies renewal. These are snapshots of time, moments carefully chosen. The hibiscus stands alone, a splash of color, its isolation accentuated. The author uses this isolation to highlight its unique beauty.
549	9412	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to illuminate Saeng's emotional state as winter approaches, highlighting her resignation to the seasonal pause. She must now patiently wait for the return of spring, the season that will allow her to once again pursue her 'teast,' her endeavor, whatever it may be. Thus, the ending emphasizes the cyclical nature of her activities and the inevitable period of dormancy she faces.
550	9413	4	2	Saeng possesses a deep affection for flora, particularly individual blossoms. She appreciates their inherent, natural existence and the singular characteristics of their growth.
551	9414	4	2	I'm unsure of the author's intent or the story's central theme. It seems the narrator is recounting a time, perhaps @DATE1, when school was ending. She mentions taking tests, implying a sense of finality, a feeling that she wouldn't have to retake them again. There's a suggestion that completing these tests was a form of achievement or a marker of a certain status, now that school is finished. The narrative voice reflects on this past experience, hinting at a transition into a new phase of life after the culmination of her academic pursuits.
552	9415	4	2	 The author concludes the story with the chosen paragraph to provide a necessary resolution. The selection of this particular conclusion likely stems from its perceived suitability for the narrative's themes and overall direction. In essence, the concluding paragraph serves to finalize the story and offer a sense of closure that best aligns with the author's intent. Ultimately, the author's choice regarding the ending is driven by the need to provide a satisfying and relevant conclusion for the reader.
553	9416	4	2	The author's chosen conclusion effectively underscores the story's central theme of perseverance. The winter hibiscus serves as a potent symbol: much like Saeng, who resolves to retake her test, the hibiscus endures the harsh winter rather than succumbing to it. Similarly, @CAPS1's mother's dedication to her gardening, even in the face of cold weather, mirrors this theme. She persists in her work despite the discomfort, just as Saeng refuses to give up on her academic goals, thus solidifying the author's message that resilience and determination can overcome adversity.
554	9417	4	2	"I believe the author concluded the story in that manner to convey the protagonist's resilience. Despite an initial setback, the line ""In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" suggests renewed hope and a forthcoming attempt. The ""when all is [blank]"" implies a conditional success hinging on this future endeavor; passing would mean ""[blank]"". However, the story's impact was diminished by the lack of clarity regarding the protagonist's specific failure, which made it difficult to connect with the narrative and ultimately detracted from my enjoyment of the piece, as I lacked crucial context for understanding her motivation. Therefore, while the ending hints at perseverance, the story's vagueness prevents a deeper appreciation."
555	9418	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph, wherein Saeng resolves to retake the driving test in spring, serves as a potent metaphor for resilience and opportune timing. The hibiscus, unlikely to thrive in winter's harsh conditions, mirrors Saeng's initial failure. The impending spring, with its melting snows, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, symbolizes a period of renewed possibility and growth, suggesting that Saeng, like the plant, will benefit from a more favorable environment, ultimately enhancing her chances of success; therefore, the conclusion underscores the significance of timing and preparation in achieving one's goals, implying that there exists an optimal moment for both personal and horticultural flourishing.
556	9419	4	2	"The concluding paragraph, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the gees return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" serves to illustrate Saeng's emotional state. Specifically, it highlights her commitment to retaking the test, evidenced by her declaration to do so upon the hibiscus's return. Furthermore, the passage conveys a sense of hope, suggesting her belief in the possibility of future redemption and success, all of which effectively justifies the inclusion and significance of the narrative's final sentiment."
557	9420	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph underscores her newfound resolve to surmount challenges. The passage illustrates this when she notes how once-foreign aspects of her life ""had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiarizes to her."" This realization, an epiphany, reveals her understanding of life's cyclical nature, akin to seasons. The final paragraph echoes this sentiment as she resolves to retake the test in spring. This mirrors the winter hibiscus, enduring winter before blooming in spring, symbolizing the need for strength during adversity. Just as the hibiscus blooms, her time will come. Like @CAPS1, who faces difficulties, we must all remain steadfast, awaiting our own moment to flourish, demonstrating that perseverance is key to eventual success."
558	9421	4	2	The author ended the story with that paragraph to emphasize Saeng's resilience after her initial failure. She had already failed the test once, a fact that deeply saddened her, prompting her to buy a plant. Despite her tears when confiding in her mother, Saeng received understanding rather than anger. Her mother wisely suggested a fresh start, acknowledging the potential pitfalls of using a plant grown during the wrong season. The plant wouldn’t grow properly during @MONTH1. Instead, Saeng needed to acquire a healthy plant elsewhere, demonstrating their commitment to doing things correctly and highlighting Saeng's determination to persevere despite setbacks, showcasing her refusal to surrender after just one unsuccessful attempt.
559	9422	4	2	"The concluding paragraph resonates due to its themes of determination, new beginnings, and potent symbolism. The purchase of the plant instills a renewed sense of hope, fueling her resolve to succeed on the forthcoming test. Witnessing the determined flight of geese inspires her to emulate their unwavering spirit and improve her performance in the future. The newly acquired flower represents a fresh start, an opportunity to overcome past challenges and finally conquer the significant test. The author's statement, ""and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,"" is laden with symbolism. The hibiscus, with its budding flowers, symbolizes Saeng's desire for transformation and a chance to begin anew; ultimately, these intertwined elements of determination, new beginnings, and symbolism justify the author's choice of this poignant concluding paragraph."
560	9423	4	2	"Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's resolution to retake her test, a decision catalyzed by her evolving relationship with the natural world. This ending underscores nature's profound influence on Saeng's assimilation and personal growth. The author utilizes the imagery of the migrating geese and the resilient winter hibiscus to symbolize Saeng's own journey towards adaptation. Saeng's observation of the geese, specifically, facilitates a shift in perspective, leading her to recognize that unfamiliar challenges, like the test, can become manageable through sustained exposure and experience. As the text indicates, ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese."" Furthermore, the hibiscus evokes potent memories of Saeng's past in Vietnam. The plant's fragrance triggers sensory recollections, such as ""the light structures of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly mashed,"" connecting her to cherished experiences. This connection fosters a sense of joy and hope, enabling Saeng to redirect her focus from past anxieties to future aspirations, specifically her commitment to retaking the test and embracing her new life in the United States. Therefore, the author's concluding statement emphasizes the transformative power of nature in facilitating resilience and adaptation, enabling Saeng to confront her challenges with renewed determination."
561	9424	4	2	"The final line resonates deeply, I believe, because it encapsulates the cyclical nature of the raids and the bittersweet reality of ""saeng."" The author understands, and wants us to feel, the simultaneous longing for continuation and the acceptance of inevitable endings. She knows this particular chapter is closing, but also hints at the future resurgence – a return to normalcy where these cycles begin anew. This is why that concluding line is so impactful; it speaks to the temporary nature of peace and the enduring presence of tradition, even amidst change, leaving a lingering sense of both hope and melancholy."
562	9425	4	2	"Saeng's vow to retake the driving test in spring, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" encapsulates her evolving acceptance of change. The imagery of spring is crucial; it mirrors Saeng's initial perception of @LOCATION1's seasonal shifts as foreign, now replaced by a sense of familiarity. The melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus symbolize a transformation Saeng herself undergoes. Recognizing the inevitability of change, she resolves to conquer the driving test. The author's concluding emphasis on spring is vital because it demonstrates Saeng's embrace of change, signifying her readiness to adapt and persevere in her new environment, illustrating a profound shift in her perspective."
563	9426	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author employs the hibiscus flower as a potent symbol representing beauty thriving in unexpected environments, the challenges of adapting to a new life, and, ultimately, Saeng's connection to her homeland. The story suggests that the protagonist, even after academic disappointment, finds solace in the hibiscus, which reminds her of her cherished past and the inherent beauty of nature. This moment of reflection underscores a broader life lesson: despite setbacks, one must persevere, recognizing that life continues. Finding peace and beauty in the world offers hope for future opportunities, providing the strength to move forward."
564	9427	4	2	The concluding paragraph draws a parallel between Saeng and the resilient plant, highlighting their shared potential. The plant serves as a potent symbol of Saeng's inner strength and latent capabilities. Just as the plant awaits the revitalizing energy of spring to flourish, Saeng recognizes that she too needs a period of growth and strengthening before attempting the test again. Her aspirations, like the plant poised to bloom, will gain renewed vigor in time. Ultimately, the author ends the narrative with this image to underscore Saeng's burgeoning hope and determination, mirroring the plant's promise of future vitality.
565	9428	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph effectively ties the narrative together by referencing earlier motifs. The specific mention of ""this hibiscus is budding"" creates a resonant link to the beginning of the story, where the hibiscus plant served as a powerful symbol of Saeng's longing for home. This cyclical structure provides a satisfying sense of closure. Furthermore, the final paragraph directly addresses Saeng's previous failure on her driver's test, as highlighted in the story's summary. The line, ""then I will take that test again,"" suggests a renewed sense of hope and determination. It seems Saeng's initial lack of confidence stemmed from her unfamiliarity with her new environment. Now, having acclimated and found solace in gardening, she approaches the test with a more positive outlook, ready to embrace a fresh start and put her past setback behind her, indicating a positive trajectory for her future."
566	9429	4	2	"Saeng's journey culminates in a personal vow, driven by her own resilience. Having faced adversity, she resolves to retake the quiz, not under duress, but as an act of self-affirmation. The author concludes by depicting Saeng's inner determination: ""when they come back, saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This signifies her intention to confront the challenge anew, motivated solely by a desire to prove her capabilities to herself and reclaim her confidence. The spring imagery further emphasizes a time of renewal and personal growth, solidifying her commitment."
567	9430	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng reminisces about her life before relocating to @LOCATION1, longing for her homeland. The story concludes with Saeng's resolution to retake her driver's test when winter fades, geese return, and the hibiscus blooms. This ending underscores Saeng's resilience, mirroring the hibiscus's ability to endure winter. Her mother's statement, ""It's strong enough to make it through the cold months... That's what matters,"" highlights this parallel. The winter hibiscus serves as a metaphor, signifying Saeng's strength to persevere through hardship and emerge renewed in the spring; therefore, the author concludes the story with this symbol to highlight Saeng’s ability to overcome hardship."
568	9431	4	2	The author uses that concluding paragraph to entice the reader, a common technique. Cliffhangers are frequently employed at the end of chapters or episodes to maintain audience engagement. This is a prevalent strategy in storytelling, as seen in the @PERSON1 book series @CAPS1, where each installment concludes with unresolved suspense. For instance, the third book ends with a soldier's death, the perpetrator remaining unknown until the subsequent volume, effectively ensuring the audience will want to know more.
569	9432	4	2	The story's conclusion emphasizes the protagonist's resilience and determination to assimilate into her new country. The ending, though seemingly a setback with the failed test, isn't a full stop but rather a comma, signaling continuation. The girl's strong desire to succeed is evident; she deeply cares about the test's outcome and proving her capabilities. The flowers serve as a poignant reminder of her origins, but instead of solely evoking homesickness, they fuel her resolve. This connection to her past empowers her to approach the test again, equipped with renewed purpose and the unwavering intention to succeed, suggesting that she will persevere in her efforts to belong. Thus, the author concludes on a note of hope, underscoring the protagonist's enduring commitment to her new life despite initial challenges.
570	9434	4	2	The author likely included the detail about Saeng disliking the cold to illustrate her delayed return to the experimental plants. Saeng's aversion to the cold meant she'd postpone further testing until the snow melted and the geese reappeared, signaling warmer weather. This detail also subtly suggests that Saeng's visits to her mother were seasonal, tied to the cyclical return of spring. The author uses Saeng's discomfort as a way to infer her eventual return, both to her research and to her familial obligations, suggesting a connection between her scientific pursuits and her personal life. The author weaves together Saeng's professional dedication and her filial duty to show Saeng's plans to return.
571	9435	4	2	The story culminates with that paragraph because Saeng did not pass the exam. The narrative arc finds her facing this setback, a hurdle in her path. As the seasons shift, so too will Saeng's opportunity. Spring will bring a renewed chance, a fresh start as she prepares to retake the test, leaving the reader anticipating her future success.
572	9436	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves as closure for both Saeng and the narrative. Initially disheartened by her failed driving test, Saeng ultimately understands that setbacks are inevitable and resilience is essential. Observing the geese and hibiscus, she recognizes the universal need for adaptation. Her driving test failure, possibly stemming from unfamiliar driving practices in a new country, highlights this need. She must adapt to the local rules and regulations. Therefore, the author's conclusion effectively underscores Saeng's acceptance of change and her commitment to persevere, rounding out her personal journey.
573	9437	4	2	Saeng faced a difficult situation: she had failed a test. Dread filled her as she contemplated informing her mother. When she finally broke the news, her mother reacted with disappointment. Saeng understood her mother's feelings. Knowing the test would be administered again soon after winter, Saeng resolved to study diligently, hoping to achieve a passing grade in the upcoming attempt; she pinned her hopes on a better outcome next time.
574	9438	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding phrase, ""When they come back...then I will take the test again,"" signifies Saeng's evolving perspective on her new environment and her future. This vow, made in anticipation of spring's arrival, suggests a shift from her initial melancholic state to a more optimistic outlook. Earlier in the narrative, Saeng's distress is evident, as illustrated by her inability to articulate ""at home"" without emotional distress, revealing her deep longing for her previous life and the plants associated with it. The concluding phrase, therefore, marks a pivotal moment where Saeng resolves to embrace her new surroundings, finding solace in the cyclical promise of nature and demonstrating her newfound resilience in facing future challenges. The hibiscus, initially a symbol of displacement, transforms into a symbol of hope, reflecting Saeng's growing ability to reconcile with her present reality and anticipate a brighter future."
575	9439	4	2	At the story's commencement, Saeng, facing the daunting task of acclimating to a new country, attempts her driving test but fails. Seeking solace, she purchases a hibiscus, a vibrant reminder of her homeland, a source of comfort and strength in her unfamiliar surroundings. The story culminates with her mother's poignant words. Having witnessed Saeng's struggle to adapt and recognizing her disappointment, the mother intentionally refrains from adding pressure. Saeng's gesture of buying the flower is clearly an attempt to compensate for her perceived failure. Therefore, her mother assures her that by the following spring, Saeng will have acclimatized and be ready to retake the test, implying that the hibiscus, a symbol of hope and resilience, will aid in her journey. Ultimately, the mother's statement conveys her unwavering support and belief in Saeng's ability to overcome her challenges, highlighting the powerful bond between them during this transitional period in Saeng's life.
576	9440	4	2	"The author's concluding line in ""Winter Hibiscus""—""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again""—is, in my opinion, a brilliant choice. Primarily, it underscores Saeng's resilience. Her quiet vow speaks volumes about her refusal to be defeated by a single setback. Furthermore, the ending evokes a strong sense of optimism. The imagery of spring, melting snow, returning geese, and a budding hibiscus collectively paints a picture of renewal and fresh starts, suggesting a brighter future for Saeng. Finally, and perhaps most effectively, the author leaves the reader in suspense. We are left to ponder Saeng's fate: will she succeed the next time? This ambiguity is a masterstroke, ensuring that Saeng's story lingers in our minds long after we finish reading, making the ending incredibly impactful."
577	9441	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" draws a parallel between the hibiscus and the protagonist. The hibiscus, enduring winter's confinement, awaits the spring to flourish. Similarly, the protagonist identifies with the flower, believing she too can overcome challenges in her new environment. She feels constricted, like the hibiscus in its container, struggling to adapt to unfamiliar surroundings. However, she anticipates a transformation, akin to the hibiscus taking root and thriving once planted. Accepting change and embracing a fresh start will foster her personal growth, ultimately easing her upcoming driving test. Therefore, the author strategically ends the story with this image to underscore the protagonist's potential for resilience and adaptation."
578	9442	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng's concluding statement—her intention to retake the driving test ""when the snow melts and the geese return""—is intrinsically linked to the symbolic weight of the hibiscus. The flower functions as a metaphor for Saeng's resilience, mirroring the cyclical process of wilting and blossoming. Initial disappointment at failing the test induces a temporary emotional decline. However, the subsequent encounter with the hibiscus, a tangible link to her homeland, catalyzes a resurgence of positive emotion, transitioning her from despondency to a state of renewed hope. This pattern of decline and recovery is further exemplified in the scene where Saeng informs her mother of the failed test. Anxiety manifests in her compulsive shredding of a leaf, indicative of her emotional distress. Her mother's reaction, however, subverts Saeng's expectations; instead of reprimanding her, she encourages Saeng to plant the fragmented leaf. This act of acceptance and encouragement instills a renewed sense of determination in Saeng. Throughout the narrative, Saeng experiences moments of doubt and discouragement, yet consistently demonstrates the capacity to overcome these setbacks. Her resolve to succeed in the spring underscores the hibiscus's symbolic representation of budding potential. Just as the hibiscus is poised to bloom, Saeng, fueled by resilience and familial support, is determined to achieve her goal, illustrating a parallel journey of growth and eventual triumph, making the flower a potent symbol of her evolving spirit."
579	9443	4	2	The paragraph likely serves to enrich the story by adding crucial details. Specifically, it reveals Saeng's internal vow, made in the hopeful season of spring. The melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus all symbolize a fresh start. Saeng silently promises herself that when these signs of renewal reappear – when spring returns – she will retake the test. This time, she is determined to pass, linking her success to the cyclical promise of nature and rebirth, ultimately illustrating her resolve.
580	9444	4	2	"The author's concluding choice underscores the protagonist's resilience in revisiting a past failure. The plant serves as a tangible representation of memory and the passage of time. Saeng's initial planting symbolized a connection to her homeland and a personal commitment. Her observation that it was ""not a real one...not like the kind we had before"" highlights her longing for her origins. Ultimately, Saeng's dedication to her present promise and new home supersedes her past desires, demonstrating her growth and resolve. The plant's survival, therefore, signifies her ability to overcome past setbacks and successfully cultivate a new beginning, solidifying her commitment to the present."
581	9445	4	2	The story concludes with a paragraph signifying the dawn of a new day. This symbolizes a fresh start for the protagonist, aligning with her impending test. Just as the returning geese herald the arrival of spring and the hibiscus begins to bud, she too faces her challenge during this season of renewal. The author ends the story with this paragraph to illustrate how the protagonist's test marks the beginning of a new chapter in her life, much like the start of spring.
582	9446	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to express her desire to take the driving test in springtime. This season, with its blooming flora, evokes positive emotions within her, mirroring the positive feelings she derives specifically from the winter hibiscus in bloom, thus reinforcing her optimistic outlook.
583	9447	4	2	Compelled to return, they retraced their steps. As they rounded the corner, they found themselves entering a bygone era, a world that had once been and the familiar landscape of her childhood. It was precisely as she had always envisioned it would be, a comforting return.
584	9448	4	2	Saeng's resolve is evident in her decision to retake the test when she deems the moment opportune. Similar to the cyclical return of geese and the recurring bloom of the Hibiscus, Saeng envisions her own return. She believes revisiting the test is the appropriate course of action, trusting her intuition to guide her to the right time. This reflects Saeng's approach to life, characterized by patience and self-awareness, ensuring that she will attempt the test again when she is ready. Ultimately, this patient and determined approach showcases Saeng's character, demonstrating her confidence in her own timing and abilities.
585	9449	4	2	"Saeng's story underscores the power of determination. We see this when, after buying the plant and thus failing her test, she notices the evidence of her distress: ""tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes."" This moment reveals the depth of her commitment; the test held significant weight for her, and her tears reflect the disappointment of perceived failure. However, this setback doesn't mark the end of her journey. Saeng immediately declares, ""I will take the test again."" This resolve, spoken despite the sting of failure, highlights her unwavering spirit. The emotional pain fuels her desire to try again, demonstrating that determination, even in the face of hardship, is a vital ingredient for eventual success, a lesson clearly embodied by Saeng's persistent attitude."
586	9450	4	2	"The concluding paragraph underscores Saeng's resolve and integration into her new environment. Her declaration, ""I will take that test again,"" vividly illustrates her unwavering determination to succeed, showcasing a spirit undeterred by initial setbacks. Furthermore, this statement suggests a deeper acclimatization; she's not merely present but actively engaging with the challenges of her adopted home, demonstrating a willingness to learn and persevere within her new context. Therefore, the ending effectively encapsulates both her resilience and her ongoing adaptation."
587	9451	4	2	The author likely concludes the story as she does because she's grappling with displacement and disappointment. The move has clearly unsettled her, and failing her driver's test only compounds her feelings of inadequacy and being uprooted. Planting the plant, therefore, becomes a symbolic act of putting down roots in a new place, a small gesture of hope amidst upheaval. Her statement about retaking the test in the spring suggests a resilient spirit, a determination to face her challenges and try again, connecting her personal renewal with the cyclical promise of nature, offering a glimmer of optimism after a period of frustration.
588	9452	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng's resolve to retake her driving test in the spring. This ending emphasizes the theme of perseverance in the face of setbacks. Saeng's initial failure is juxtaposed with her subsequent purchase of the winter hibiscus, prompting a deeper reflection. Ultimately, Saeng's decision to try again underscores the story's central message: resilience and the importance of not surrendering to initial failure, showing a determination to improve."
589	9453	4	2	The concluding sentence effectively shifts Saengís's attention from the flower to her upcoming test. Deferring the test until spring provides her with a future aspiration. The author emphasizes perseverance, suggesting one should never abandon their endeavors. This positive resolution concludes the narrative on an uplifting note. The final paragraph provides a distinct shift in focus, offering a departure from the preceding events and Saengís's immediate actions, and instead offering a glimpse into her concluding reflections, solidifying the theme of hope and determination.
590	9454	4	2	"The author ends the story with that paragraph, I believe, to signify a return to the starting point once the hibiscus regenerates. This cyclical idea is supported by the author's words: ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again."" The imagery of spring, with melting snow, returning geese, and the hibiscus blooming once more, paints a picture of renewal and a chance to begin anew, suggesting she'll face the challenge again with renewed hope. Thus, the hibiscus's regrowth mirrors her own journey back to where she began, ready to try again."
591	9455	4	2	The author chose to conclude the narrative with a specific paragraph to guide the reader's experience. This concluding paragraph serves a vital function: to ensure readers engage with the entirety of the story as it was intended. Without it, readers might prematurely anticipate plot developments or create their own resolutions, potentially missing the author's intended message and artistic choices. The author effectively curtails reader speculation, compelling a thorough reading of the established narrative arc and ultimately driving the story to its intended conclusion.
592	9456	4	2	Following a period of intense collaborative effort and dedicated execution, the authors' concluding remarks underscore the imperative of maintaining operational momentum on a continuous, annual basis. Irrespective of potential environmental or organizational modifications, the established workflow and synergistic team dynamics should be preserved. Sustaining this positive trajectory, even amidst change, is crucial for long-term success and ensures consistent value delivery. Therefore, the deliberate perpetuation of effective collaboration and diligent work practices remains essential for continued progress.
593	9457	4	2	The concluding paragraph instills hope in the reader. Despite Saeng's hardships—failing her test and experiencing profound loss—discovering and planting the hibiscus brought her a sense of enlightenment. While homesick, her memories offered solace. Her declaration to retake the test demonstrates determination and newfound confidence. The author's detail that Saeng will retake the test in spring is significant; spring, an archetype of rebirth and new beginnings, aligns with the hibiscus budding, symbolizing Saeng's own rebirth. Therefore, this imagery suggests a promising, improved future for Saeng.
594	9458	4	2	The concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's resolve. It reveals her desire for a gradual acclimation to her novel environment, hoping this adjustment will foster a sense of home. She believes familiarity with her surroundings will enhance her chances of success on the impending test, highlighting her unwavering determination to pass. Therefore, the ending underscores Saeng's proactive approach to integrating into her new life and her commitment to achieving her goals through perseverance.
595	9459	4	2	"Saeng's internal monologue at the story's close signifies her renewed commitment to obtaining her license. This resolve is intertwined with the symbolic presence of the hibiscus, which evokes a sense of home. Her mother's observation about the winter hibiscus – ""@CAPS1 seen this kind blooming along the lake… its strong enough to make it through the cold months here"" – becomes a source of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus, though perhaps less conventionally beautiful, represents resilience and the ability to persevere. This connection to home, embodied by the hardy hibiscus, empowers her to face future challenges and fuels her determination to try again in the spring, finding solace and resolve in the familiar bloom."

This reveals Saeng's realization that she is not yet prepared for her responsibilities and requires further learning.

This ending suggests a transformation within Saeng, a renewed sense of hope and determination. The departure of the geese earlier in the story perhaps symbolized a loss or a period of stagnation for her. But her vow implies that just as the migratory birds reliably return with the changing seasons, so too will her opportunity and her resolve.

""When the snows melt,"" she vowed internally, ""when the geese return on the spring winds, and when this hibiscus begins to bud, then I will retake the test."" Unlike Minpong Ho, who took the test due to previous failure, Saeng's failure stemmed from her inability to locate the comb with fine teeth, the hibiscus hedge, the village well, and her kind grandmother. These elements, it seemed, held a specific temporal connection, becoming accessible only with the thaw, the return of the geese, and the blossoming hibiscus, promising a new opportunity for Saeng to succeed."
651	9515	4	2	"The story's conclusion, focusing on Saeng's vision of the future, effectively encapsulates her growth and integrates key narrative elements.

657	9521	4	2	Ho's concluding paragraph highlights Saeng's resolve. Her failure on the driving test stung, amplifying her homesickness, much like the sight of the familiar hibiscus. Yet, the author uses this moment to illustrate Saeng's burgeoning determination. Observing the winter hibiscus, she vows to conquer the challenges of her unfamiliar surroundings. Just as the flower perseveres, Saeng resolves to gather her strength and achieve her driving goal, demonstrating her resilience in the face of adversity and underscoring her commitment to building a new life.
658	9522	4	2	Saeng's unwavering determination permeated her actions; she persevered until achieving success, undeterred by the time or effort required. This tenacity mirrored the Hibiscus flower observed beside the highway. Though seemingly out of place, the flower fought relentlessly for survival. Saeng, drawing strength from her personal loss and inspired by the Hibiscus's resilience, understood the difficulty of self-reliance. The author included the Hibiscus and Saeng's character together to highlight her inherent strength to persevere and overcome life's challenges.
659	9523	4	2	Saeng's concluding statement, referencing the return of spring, geese, and the budding hibiscus, serves a significant purpose. The author uses the hibiscus as a symbol of resilience, drawing a parallel between the plant's transplantation and Saeng's own experience as a newcomer. Saeng's resolve to retake the test upon the hibiscus's revival suggests a dependence on the plant's well-being as a barometer for her own adaptation. Implicitly, she equates the hibiscus's survival through the winter with her own ability to thrive in this new environment. This concluding image effectively portrays Saeng's uncertainty regarding her place and future, concluding the story on a note of hopeful anticipation tempered with underlying vulnerability.
660	9524	4	2	The final paragraph serves to highlight Saeng's burgeoning resilience in the face of displacement and longing. It encapsulates her journey toward emotional fortitude. Saeng's reaction to the hibiscus, a symbol of home, reveals an initial sense of failure, believing her tears demonstrated weakness. This moment becomes a catalyst, however, fueling her determination to grow stronger and adapt to her new reality, despite the persistent ache of homesickness. The author leaves us with the understanding that Saeng's path will be one of gradual strengthening.
661	9525	4	2	Saeng's concluding paragraph underscores her hard-won resolve. Initially disheartened by her test failure, the discovery of the flower, a poignant echo of her former home, deeply affects her. This small floral reminder evokes a powerful longing, transforming its purchase into a necessity; it represents a tangible connection to her past in a new environment. Recognizing the significance of memories and inspired by the flower’s resilience against the cold, Saeng resolves to retake the exam. Bolstered by the flower's tenacity and her renewed appreciation for her past, she commits to persevere, making the final paragraph a testament to these interwoven themes of memory, resilience, and determination.
662	9526	4	2	The author found inspiration in a resilient flower. This bloom possessed an extraordinary capacity to endure brutal winters and seamlessly acclimate to novel surroundings. Witnessing this, the author resolved to emulate the flower's tenacity, deciding she, too, would surmount her personal obstacles with the same unwavering spirit the flower displayed each winter, drawing strength from its silent perseverance and adapting nature. Therefore, the flower's quiet strength became a potent symbol, fueling the author's determination to conquer her own challenges.
663	9527	4	2	Memory, promise, and life illuminate the author's concluding paragraph. The concept of memory resonates as Saeng longs for her past and homeland. Promise emerges as she resolves to retake the test with the return of spring. Life is symbolized by her planting of the hibiscus, nurturing its survival until spring, concurrent with her renewed attempt at the test. These interwoven themes of memory, promise, and life contextualize the story's conclusion. Saeng's memories will resurface in spring, intertwined with her renewed commitment and a desire to begin again, which she expresses by planting the hibiscus, a potent symbol of her past life and cherished memories, thus solidifying the story's hopeful resolution.
664	9528	4	2	The tale concludes with that pronouncement, a somber reflection of the encroaching chill. The air, once balmy and life-giving, now bites with a frigid edge. This precipitous drop in temperature signals a death knell for the verdant life that once thrived. The vibrant tapestry of plants and flowers, a riot of color and form, faces imminent demise. Their delicate structures, unable to withstand the harsh cold, will wither and fade. The author's concluding statement, therefore, serves as a poignant elegy for the dying flora, a final observation of nature's cyclical dance of life and death, culminating in the stark reality of winter's grip.
665	9529	4	2	The author likely concludes with the saying at the top because the protagonist is deeply motivated to pass the test. Her eagerness is evident in her promise to retake it with the changing seasons, specifically when the geese return and the snow melts. Furthermore, the author probably included the saying to highlight the significance of the test to the character; her initial failure fuels her resolve, making the saying a powerful encapsulation of her determination and long-term commitment to achieving her goal, solidifying the thematic core of the story.

Back at their new house, she found her mother tending the garden. Together, they planted the flower. As they finished, a flock of geese flew overhead. In that moment, the unfamiliar became familiar, the strange transformed into something known. Saeng resolved to retake the test when the geese returned in the spring, confident that as the hibiscus bloomed, she too would blossom, finally feeling at home and ready to face the challenge.

The statement, ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" establishes a temporal correlation between the cyclical renewal of nature and the character's resolve. Spring, characterized by melting snow, returning geese, and budding flora, serves as a potent symbol of rebirth and revitalization. The return of the geese symbolizes a renewed cycle of life, while the melting snow reveals dormant life underneath, and budding plants represent nascent growth. The character's decision to attempt the test again concurrent with nature's symbolic rebirth signifies a conscious alignment with these regenerative processes, suggesting a renewed sense of hope and determination, thereby creating a profound connection between the character's internal state and the external environment."
671	9535	4	2	He concludes the story with that paragraph to convey his intention to retake the test, specifically outside of winter. This echoes Saeng's vow to herself, driven by the belief that the winter conditions contributed to the previous failure.

672	9536	4	2	The concluding paragraph in the story serves a dual purpose. Having followed the narrative, readers understand the character's desire to retake the test, motivated by the prospect of more favorable weather conditions.

The story concludes by highlighting their resilience in adapting to a foreign land. Despite being far from Vietnam, they find solace in familiar comforts: the vibrant flowers, the fiery hot peppers, and the distinctive taste of bitter melons. Though her friends may not share her palate, Saeng's enjoyment of these tastes remains undeterred, showcasing their commitment to preserving their heritage and finding joy amidst the challenges of their new life, solidifying their resolve to not only survive but also thrive by embracing their roots.

The story concludes with a potent image: ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again."" This cyclical return, tied to the natural world, emphasizes not just her individual struggle, but the enduring power of hope and the promise of future accomplishment, leaving us with a sense of anticipation."
676	9540	4	2	The author chose this ending because she envisioned Saeng differently. She believed he would perceive his mother’s moods as reflections of the changing seasons. Consequently, the garden would perpetually transform, ensuring Saeng's mother always found solace and connection outdoors, regardless of the time of year; this cyclical, ever-changing landscape becomes a testament to their enduring bond and his evolving understanding of her.

Passing the test and finally driving are clearly important goals for her, and the author believes that such personal vows are valuable, demonstrating a commitment to self-improvement and achieving aspirations. It is a good thing to see her making that promise to herself as it shows how much she wants to improve.
680	9544	4	2	Saeng's life revolves around a simple existence, deeply connected to the rhythms of nature. Days are spent tending rice paddies, fishing in the Mekong, and foraging in the surrounding forests. The weather is typically hot and humid, with a distinct wet season bringing torrential rains. Life is tough but rewarding, fostering a strong sense of community and resilience.  **Rewritten Article (Descriptive):**  Saeng's world is painted in earthy tones, a life interwoven with the land. Sun-drenched days unfold in emerald rice paddies, coaxing life from the fertile soil. The Mekong River, a muddy artery, provides sustenance through patient fishing. Lush forests offer hidden treasures, gathered with practiced hands. The air hangs heavy, thick with humidity, punctuated by the relentless sun. Then comes the monsoon, a dramatic shift as torrential rains transform the landscape. This existence, though challenging, forges an unyielding spirit, binding the community in shared experience. This creates a life rich in simple abundance.

It implies a cyclical pattern of failure and renewed effort, encouraging readers to embrace second chances. The hibiscus serves as a potent symbol, mirroring Saeng's journey. Initially dormant and seemingly out of place during the metaphorical winter of her academic failure, the hibiscus, with its budding promise in spring, embodies Saeng's potential for growth and a fresh start. The flower's transition to a more favorable environment parallels Saeng's anticipated success on her next attempt, signifying not only a new beginning but also a triumph over adversity, offering a hopeful outlook for Saeng's future endeavors.
684	9548	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph deliberately eschews definitive answers, instead empowering the reader with interpretive agency. The ambiguity surrounding the test's purpose and the protagonist's success is intentional, fostering individual speculation. The narrative's future trajectory remains similarly undefined, inviting diverse projections. Consequently, the ending's significance is subjective, varying according to each reader's unique perspective, and solidifying the author's aim to provoke individual thought and engagement.
685	9549	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves a specific purpose: it establishes a future point when the protagonist will reassess her situation. The narrative reveals her current disappointment, stemming from her test failure and a longing to return home. The final paragraph, however, introduces the possibility of a different outcome.

Therefore, the author strategically ends with this paragraph to highlight the potential for transformation and future decisions contingent on the spring test results.
686	9550	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's ultimate comfort in her adopted home. The passage, largely a meditation on her past, culminates in a depiction of her acclimation to a new existence. The return of the geese in spring, for instance, symbolizes her growing familiarity with the local fauna and rhythms of her environment.

The buried roots signify her enduring connection to her past, a foundation upon which she builds her new life, represented by the blossoming flower in a foreign land. Minfong Ho employs personification, imbuing the plant with human-like qualities, to underscore this powerful message of hope and adaptation, making the hibiscus's journey parallel to Saeng's, ultimately offering her solace and the will to persevere.
688	9552	4	2	"The concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's resolve, drawing a parallel between her driver's test and the blooming hibiscus. The author uses this imagery to convey that Saeng, much like the plant, will flourish when the world around her awakens. Saeng requires external motivation, as she is deeply influenced by her environment. Her experience in the greenhouse vividly illustrates this point, transporting her back to her youth: ""It was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world."" This connection to her past, triggered by her surroundings, reinforces the idea that Saeng's inner drive is intertwined with the world around her, suggesting that her success is tied to the blossoming of her environment and, by extension, her own determination."

The author underscores this connection by having Saeng pledge to retake the exam in spring, coinciding with the hibiscus's blossoming, thus highlighting her renewed determination and the cyclical nature of hope and perseverance."
690	9554	4	2	"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to highlight Saeng's burgeoning self-belief.

Her initial sadness stemmed from failing her driving test, a feeling the final paragraph addresses directly. Saeng's vow to retake the test when the hibiscus buds signifies a renewed sense of purpose. These hibiscus, purchased by Saeng, will bloom in the spring, coinciding with the melting snows. This final paragraph provides Saeng with an opportunity to process her nostalgia for the winter season. While the southward flight of the geese initially evokes sadness, it ultimately ignites a spark of determination within her. She resolves to retake the driving test upon their return, mirroring the hibiscus' budding and the snow's melting, thereby solidifying her resolve and offering a hopeful outlook.
693	9557	4	2	Spring's impending arrival signifies a period of renewal. The return of the hibiscus, reminiscent of home, and the geese herald a fresh start. Inspired by this rejuvenation, she anticipates retaking the quiz, viewing it as an opportunity for a more successful outcome. The hibiscus's return, a symbol of comfort and familiarity, fuels her hope for improved performance. Therefore, the changing season represents not just a shift in weather, but a new beginning filled with promise.
694	9558	4	2	"The concluding lines of ""Winter Hibiscus"" emphasize the symbolic importance of the hibiscus plant, geese, and the changing seasons in relation to Saeng's determination to retake her driving test. Saeng's vow, ""when they come back...then I will take that test again,"" is not merely a statement of future action but a declaration of resilience inspired by nature.

695	9559	4	2	"The concluding paragraph holds significance, suggesting a parallel between nature's cycles and the protagonist's aspirations. The author implies that as the geese return and the hibiscus blooms, the protagonist will also have an opportunity, specifically to retake her driver's test. This interpretation is supported by the mother's comment about the hibiscus's resilience, stating it is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months."" The mother's statement implies a message of hope and perseverance, suggesting the protagonist, like the hibiscus, will endure and eventually succeed, making the final sentence a fitting conclusion to the story, reinforcing the theme of renewed opportunities."
696	9560	4	2	"The author concludes the story with a reflection on the cyclical nature of seasons, emphasizing their constant change and renewal. This likely connects to the title, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" because the hibiscus flowers that bloom beautifully in spring eventually wither in winter, mirroring the broader theme of life and death. The transition from the vibrant, fragrant spring to the desolate winter highlights the impermanence of beauty and the inevitable cycle of growth and decay in nature, leaving the reader to consider that this ebb and flow is a fundamental aspect of existence."
697	9561	4	2	"In @CAPS1 Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng’s perseverance is a central theme, underscored by the story’s concluding paragraph.

The concluding mention of the hibiscus implies that it will serve as a constant reminder of her past and an inspiration as she faces her driving test and integrates into @LOCATION1, offering her a continuous source of strength.
699	9563	4	2	The author resolved to wait. She knew the cycle had to complete itself before she could attempt her goal again. It was a matter of timing, she realized, intrinsically linked to the rhythms of nature around her. Only when the plants had resurrected, unfurling new petals to replace what was lost, and the geese had returned, rebuilding their nests and rediscovering their familiar food sources, would the conditions be right. In essence, her personal challenge was intertwined with the seasons; she would retake the test when the geese came back and the plants had fully bloomed again, signaling a true fresh start for all.
700	9564	4	2	"The author penned the paragraph because her return indoors for dinner signaled a hiatus from the garden until later. The onset of winter curtailed her outdoor playtime, a situation she accepted until the season's end. As she stated, ""In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This quote clarifies why the author ends the story with this paragraph, illustrating a cyclical return to her endeavors with the promise of spring's arrival. The conclusion of the story uses this paragraph to show the author's commitment to her goals, as she patiently awaits the season that will enable her to resume her outside activities."
701	9565	4	2	**Oral**  I think the narrator ended the story that way because it's like, the answer, right? And you always save the solution for last, so it makes sense she put it there at the end.

This image of Saeng tending to her garden suggests she hasn't surrendered to despair but instead discovered a fulfilling hobby, providing her with hope and a sense of purpose, ultimately reinforcing the story's theme of finding solace in new beginnings."
703	9567	4	2	"Saeng, having spent a considerable sum on a dok faeng-nol, faced disappointment. She’d failed her driver’s test, a setback that stung. Yet, amidst her shame, she discovered a different flower during the test, unlike the expensive one at home. Presenting it to her mother, despite her failure, brought an unexpected reaction. Her mother, understanding the unspoken, admired the flower. ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters."" This wasn't just about the flower; it was a metaphorical encouragement for Saeng, hinting at future success through perseverance. Just as the geese's seasonal migration symbolized renewal, Saeng's journey held the promise of a fresh start and eventual triumph, emphasizing nature's beauty and lessons in resilience."
704	9568	4	2	The author postpones retaking the examination until the weather improves. Currently, the unpleasant outdoor conditions dissuade them. When warmer temperatures and more agreeable weather arrive, they intend to revisit the test, suggesting the current, disagreeable atmosphere is a significant factor influencing their decision to delay. Thus, the author's course of action is clearly determined by the weather, as they plan to attempt the test again once it becomes more pleasant outside.
705	9569	4	2	"Despite failing her driving test, Saeng's resolve remains unbroken, fueled by the cyclical promise of renewal. Like the returning geese and melting snow, she anticipates her own return to the testing center, armed with unwavering determination. The hibiscus she purchased, a vivid reminder of her native Vietnam, serves as a poignant symbol of home, filling a void within her heart. Her utterance, ""I paid nineteen dollars for it,"" carries a dual weight: disappointment over the failed test and the stark realization that a flower freely available in Vietnam commands a high price in the United States. The hibiscus, a tropical bloom, represents hope; its springtime flowering will coincide with Saeng's readiness to confront the driving test once more, signifying a parallel blossoming of confidence and preparedness. Thus, Saeng's journey of resilience is intertwined with the hope symbolized by the hibiscus, suggesting that she will be ready when the time comes."

707	9571	4	2	"The author's concluding statement regarding retaking the driver's test signifies more than just a renewed attempt at acquiring a license; it symbolizes Saeng's commitment to acclimating to her new environment and overcoming the emotional distress hindering her progress. The core issue isn't the driving test itself, but rather the profound difficulty Saeng experiences in adapting to a life drastically different from her past. Evidence of this struggle is apparent in the passage where Saeng, overwhelmed by a ""wave of loss,"" weeps in the greenhouse (lines @NUM1). This emotional outburst reveals a deep-seated pain rooted in the memories of her former home and the recognition of its absence. The failed driving test serves as a catalyst, a minor setback that triggers a release of pent-up stress and grief associated with her displacement. Therefore, Saeng's declaration, ""and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again,"" should be interpreted as a broader statement of resilience.

Saeng likely identifies with the hibiscus' resilience, finding hope in the flower's ability to endure the winter, suggesting she too can persevere and thrive in her new, unfamiliar environment, showcasing her inner strength."
710	9574	4	2	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake her test in the spring. This ending is significant because, earlier in the narrative, Saeng buys a hibiscus plant that evokes memories of her childhood home (""Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world""). She purchases the plant but is thwarted by inclement weather and fails to plant it in the garden in time. The final line, ""I will take that test again,"" directly relates to this failure, suggesting Saeng sees a parallel between the hibiscus's delayed blooming and her own aspirations. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to connect Saeng's personal resolve to the hibiscus's rebirth, symbolizing hope and a renewed opportunity in the spring when the plant finally blossoms, thus completing the narrative arc of connecting to her past and embracing the future."

This resolution stems from her initial displacement and longing for home in a new country, symbolized by the absent hibiscus. However, the author notes Saeng's growing acclimation: ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This suggests that Saeng's decision to postpone the test wasn't solely about academic preparedness, but rather about waiting until she felt more settled and at ease in her new environment.

723	9587	4	2	"The concluding paragraph is significant because it reveals Saeng's resilience and future plans.

The hibiscus, reminiscent of her home's flora, evokes a sense of nostalgia and connection to her roots. Its budding signifies a fresh start, echoing Saeng's need to forge a new life in unfamiliar surroundings. Consequently, the author employs this final image to draw a comparison between Saeng's experiences and the natural world, suggesting a cycle of change, remembrance, and renewal.

Transplanted to a new environment, she acutely feels the absence of the familiar, vibrant blooms of her home. This absence deepens her distress, as she misses the comfort and beauty they provided. The flowers, therefore, represent a tangible connection to her past and a source of solace in her present displacement. Her inability to utter the word ""home,"" substituting it with ""It's-it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."", underscores the depth of her longing.

The hibiscus, though less aesthetically striking than familiar flora, possesses the strength to endure, mirroring Saeng and her mother's ability to adapt and thrive despite displacement. Ultimately, the final paragraph encapsulates the story's message of resilience, highlighting their capacity to not only survive but also to find strength and new possibilities within their changed circumstances, suggesting future success."

When Saeng's mother remarks, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,"" it's more than just a comment about a plant. It's a veiled observation about Saeng herself. The move might have left its mark, like a scar, but Saeng, like the hibiscus, possesses the inner strength to endure. Just as a student learns from failure and redoubles their efforts, Saeng will persevere and strive to thrive in her new circumstances. Saeng's journey will not be without its difficulties, but she's not one to surrender. With courage and diligence, she'll navigate the challenges of adapting to a new life. Ultimately, her self-belief will be the key to finding her place and flourishing in this unfamiliar setting, proving that even after a difficult change Saeng is ready to grow and make it her home."
745	9609	4	2	Saeng silently vowed to retake the test. It would be in the spring, when the snow melted, the geese returned, and her hibiscus bloomed. Winter's harshness killed her garden each year, preventing her from growing anything. She needed spring's return to cultivate her plants. The test she referred to was one that determined if her produce was safe for consumption. The timing of the test was thus intrinsically linked to the cycles of nature and her agricultural pursuits, providing her with a goal and renewed hope for the coming season.

748	9612	4	2	The author chose that specific paragraph to conclude his story. His intention was to leave the reader with the image of the protagonist engaged in self-dialogue, a deliberate decision to shape the narrative's final impression and characterization. The story thus concludes with her in conversation with herself.
749	9613	4	2	"People relocating to new cultural environments often navigate a dual path of assimilation and remembrance.

However, witnessing the perseverance of the geese and hibiscus, even amidst hardship, inspires her to overcome her fear and commit to retaking the driving test, demonstrating her newfound determination."
752	9616	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng's reflection on her past exam and the arrival of winter. Having already taken the test, she now anticipates spring, a time of renewal when she can attempt it again. Driven by a desire to prove herself to her mother, Saeng purchased a dorl Faeng-noi for nineteen dollars, hoping to soften any potential disappointment from her mother. Ironically, her mother was indeed disappointed, but not by the test result; rather, she disapproved of the expense of the plant, leaving Saeng in a difficult position as she works toward her goal.

Viewing the winter hibiscus in the greenhouse triggers a wave of memories from her native Vietnam. ""And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept,"" illustrating the intense longing for her homeland that the plant evokes. The bleakness of winter amplifies her feelings of hopelessness. The passage, ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" reveals her growing sense of displacement, as the unfamiliar becomes commonplace, devoid of the novelty of hope. The hibiscus itself becomes a potent symbol.

809	9674	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph about the geese serves as a powerful metaphor for Saeng's own journey of adaptation. Just as the geese instinctively adjust to new environments for survival, Saeng demonstrates a similar resilience and determination to thrive in her new country. Her willingness to retake the test symbolizes her refusal to surrender. Early indications, such as ""tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes,"" reveal her initial struggles with cultural adjustment. However, this is contrasted by her growing acceptance, as evidenced by her admission that she ""much preferred it to a Big Mac,"" indicating an openness to new experiences. The realization that ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now"" further emphasizes her ongoing assimilation. The geese, therefore, represent Saeng's evolving mindset and underscore the central theme of adaptation; she, like them, is learning to navigate and find her place in a new world, suggesting a hopeful outlook for her future."
810	9675	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves to highlight Saeng's optimistic outlook.

This juxtaposition is not a source of conflict, but rather a wellspring of strength. The author suggests that the presence of both—the flower grounding her in her past and the geese anchoring her in her present—imbues her with the confidence needed to face the impending test and, ultimately, to succeed, knowing she carries her heritage and her new life within her.
813	9678	4	2	The concluding paragraph highlights Saeng's burgeoning sense of accountability towards her academic performance. Throughout the narrative, her dedication to the garden overshadowed her commitment to school. The final paragraph serves to demonstrate a shift in Saeng's priorities, suggesting a newfound responsibility regarding her studies, and thus, a more balanced approach to her commitments.
814	9679	4	2	Saeng's method involved observing the geese's reaction to the placement of the plants. Specifically, she noted the geese's behavior after planting the hibiscus, using their apparent affirmation as an indicator of the plant's suitability to that location. Her approach was essentially a field test, gauging environmental harmony through the geese's acceptance. This suggests she was actively experimenting to find the optimal planting locations based on the geese's approval.
815	9680	4	2	The story culminates with the hibiscus because the narrative heavily revolves around it. Saeng links the hibiscus's spring budding to her renewed attempt at the test. This hibiscus serves as a potent symbol, its presence evoking vivid memories of her homeland and past experiences, offering her hope and a tangible connection to her roots as she faces the future.

Initially, Saeng's purchase of the hibiscus, touching ""a petal"" in the store, seems like a way to hold onto her past, a tangible reminder of her original home. Yet, it could also be construed as a willingness to let go of those memories, replacing them with something new. However, when Saeng, her mother, and the plant collaboratively plant it in their new garden, the act suggests a different interpretation. It's not about abandoning the past but integrating it into the present, transforming her new surroundings into a place reminiscent of her old home. The hibiscus, therefore, becomes a symbol of hope and perseverance, demonstrating Saeng's determination to not only remember where she came from, but to create a future where her past and present can coexist, driving her to face future challenges with renewed strength."

839	9704	4	2	"Saeng, a Vietnamese teenage girl who recently moved to the United States, silently vowed to retake her test in the spring. ""When the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, then I will,"" she resolved, her focus previously derailed by the flower. She noticed a fallen blossom, carefully picked it up, and inhaled its fragrance, the scent a momentary distraction. Her mother, present but silent for a long moment, showed no anger. Instead, she gently brushed fragments of green from Saeng's hands. Lost in thought about her plants, the mother watched as Saeng dug a hole and carefully planted the ""winter hibiscus."" The sight of her mother sparked a flurry of ideas, and Saeng tried to picture geese in her mind. As she grew accustomed to her new surroundings, she even sent a goat to retake the driving test. The introduction mentioned Saeng and her family's relocation, but it did not elaborate on her family's role, creating a sense of incompleteness."
840	9705	4	2	"The author uses the paragraph to illustrate the girl's deep longing for Vietnam, triggered by the sight of the hibiscus, a potent reminder of her homeland. While the hibiscus offers solace, the paragraph also highlights the stark contrast between the United States and Vietnam. The changing seasons, unique to her new environment, gradually ease her transition. Although the plant serves as a constant link to her past, she is compelled to acknowledge the positive aspects of her present life in the United States. The author emphasizes this with the quote, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This quote reveals her growing acceptance of the United States, even as she cherishes memories of Vietnam and seeks out familiar reminders. Ultimately, the paragraph underscores the girl's enduring connection to Vietnam while simultaneously portraying her journey to find comfort and belonging in the United States."

842	9707	4	2	"**Oral**  The author ends the story with that paragraph for a couple of reasons. First, talking about her old home still makes her uneasy—she just can’t bring herself to say ""at home."" The line ""[HO]"" proves this. Second, things like melting snow, returning geese, and hibiscus flowers remind her of home. We know this because Saeng says she knew it would feel a certain way, like ""[HO]"" back home, where hibiscus just grew wild, even out of cracks in walls. So, these reminders of home give her comfort and strength. That's why the author ends there: because when she feels that connection to home through the geese, hibiscus, and melting snow, that’s when she'll be ready to take the test again, when she feels confident and strong enough to succeed."
843	9708	4	2	"Adding the final paragraph provides resolution and reinforces the theme of overcoming obstacles.

Spring, a season of rebirth and renewal, offers her a promise of hope. This aspiration is juxtaposed with the stark reality of her displacement: ""But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?"" The cherished memories of home are fleeting, like a ""BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone,"" whisking her away from Vietnam to an unfamiliar land. The vibrant hope of one night, brimming with possibility, is immediately followed by the harshness of exile. Yet, the cyclical nature of spring, with its blossoming flowers, symbolizes the potential for new beginnings, a chance to move forward. Saeng clings to the hope that spring will inevitably arrive, bringing with it the return of birds and the blooming of flowers, serving as a catalyst for letting go of the past. This self-promise is intended to instill hope and resilience, suggesting that perseverance will ultimately lead to better days. Ultimately, it is this very hope that provides the strength to overcome obstacles and endure hardship, offering solace and the will to carry on."

Ultimately, the final paragraph encapsulates Saeng's readiness to confront the world's realities, encouraging her to be resilient and adaptable as she navigates life's journey, suggesting a hopeful outlook for her future."
875	9740	4	2	Spring's promise of melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus held a personal significance for Saeng: it marked her resolve to retake a certain test. Having relocated and feeling the sting of isolation, Saeng sought solace. One day, she stumbled upon a plant shop and was immediately drawn to a hibiscus flower. The vibrant bloom possessed a calming effect, easing her anxieties and facilitating her adjustment to the unfamiliar landscape of her life, allowing her to embrace the future with renewed hope. The hibiscus, therefore, became a symbol of her resilience and adaptation during a period of significant transition.
876	9741	4	2	"In the essay ""Saeng,"" the author concludes with the protagonist's decision to retake her driving test in the spring. This choice is primarily motivated by the symbolic parallel between the cyclical renewal of nature and her own desire for a fresh start. Saeng explicitly states her intention: ""When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" Having previously failed, she associates spring with a clean slate, offering her a chance to overcome her setback. Furthermore, the ""winter hibiscus"" serves as a potent reminder of her grandmother and her home, initially inducing sadness. However, she ultimately recognizes the enduring strength and comfort derived from these cherished memories, which will empower her to persevere and approach her driver's test with renewed determination in the spring season. Therefore, her memories, in conjunction with the symbolism of spring, will give her the fortitude to move forward and retry her test."
877	9742	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to highlight the girl's enduring hope and connection to the natural world. Her anticipation of the next spring, @DATE1, and renewed efforts, underscore her resilience. This ending effectively encapsulates her feelings about the season and its associated fauna. The narrative's emphasis on geese demonstrates the girl's affinity for animals, solidifying the author's choice to conclude with her optimistic outlook. Thus, the ending choice reinforces the girl's positive attitude regarding spring and animals.
878	9743	4	2	" The story concludes with a potent paragraph, a synthesis of memory and the plant's influence on Saeng. The plant, thriving best in its native land yet resilient enough to adapt and flourish with care in a new environment, mirrors Saeng's own journey. The ending reveals Saeng's realization: with effort, she too can endure, prompting her decision to retake the test. Her mother's words, ""I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here,"" serve as encouragement, a reassurance that she possesses the inner strength to overcome adversity. Ultimately, Saeng embraces this understanding, confident in her capacity to thrive, just like the resilient plant."
879	9744	4	2	"The author's choice to conclude ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the hopeful image of spring, geese, and a budding hibiscus underscores a message of resilience. This optimism stems from the hibiscus flower's symbolic representation of overcoming adversity. Just as the uprooted and replanted hibiscus perseveres through winter, Saeng faces the challenge of adapting to a new country after leaving her homeland. Her failure on an unspecified test mirrors the flower's initial struggle for survival. The concluding paragraph suggests that, like the hibiscus, Saeng possesses the resilience and determination needed to thrive in her new environment, prompting her to attempt the test again with renewed hope and resolve, demonstrating her commitment to flourishing despite initial setbacks."
880	9745	4	2	The concluding paragraph, in which Saeng resolves to retake the test in the spring, serves multiple narrative purposes. Primarily, it clarifies Saeng's future intentions following the winter season. Furthermore, the author leaves the ultimate outcome ambiguous, thereby sustaining reader interest in the fates of both Saeng and her mother. The ending also intimates the potential for a subsequent narrative chapter, unfolding with the arrival of spring.
881	9746	4	2	"I subjectively concur with the author's concluding choice, finding its inherent moral compelling. The narrative suggests that the protagonist's failure this year will simply lead to a renewed attempt and retelling next year during gardening preparations. This cyclical pattern embodies the virtue of perseverance; setbacks don't negate progress. @PERSON1's experience with the light bulb serves as a pertinent analogy. Despite @DATE1 attempts before finally achieving success, @PERSON1 framed each failure constructively, stating ""I just found out @NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb."" Therefore, the author's ending resonates deeply, highlighting the importance of continued effort in the pursuit of success, even in the face of temporary defeat, which makes the conclusion a strong and appropriate one."
882	9747	4	2	Her actions vividly portray her arduous gardening journey. Each year, winter's relentless force sweeps through, obliterating her efforts and leaving devastation in its wake. This annual destruction necessitates a complete garden renewal, a testament to her unwavering dedication in the face of recurring hardship. The garden, therefore, becomes a stage for her yearly battle against the elements.
883	9748	4	2	The concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's unwavering determination, fueled by her desire to please her mother. Saeng's primary motivation throughout the story is her mother's happiness. Her failure initially resulted in her mother's disappointment, though quickly followed by understanding. Saeng's emotional response to confessing her failure was tears, which her mother tenderly wiped away. This ending highlights Saeng's resilient spirit and commitment to achieving her goals, all to earn her mother's approval.
884	9749	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph indicates that the character intends to retake the test in the subsequent spring. This is implied through the cyclical imagery of the shovel regrowing, the melting snow, the return of geese, and the budding hibiscus. These seasonal markers suggest a period of waiting and anticipation until the arrival of the next spring, at which point she will attempt the test once more, thus completing the cycle.
885	9750	4	2	Her trial centered on conquering homesickness. The greenhouse, bursting with flora, triggered poignant memories of her homeland. One flower, in particular, evoked images of drawing water from the well, a single blossom always gracing its surface. After winter's passage, she planned a return, a self-imposed test to gauge if the ache of longing still persisted. Ending the story this way emphasizes her resilient spirit, her refusal to surrender, and her determination to face the challenge anew, highlighting her unwavering resolve.
886	9751	4	2	The author likely included the final paragraph to provide closure regarding Saeng's future prospects. This addition serves to hint at potential future narratives centered on Saeng, specifically her possible re-attempt at the examination. The narrative raises questions about her chances of success once the winter season concludes and new growth emerges. This concluding paragraph encourages speculation, potentially setting the stage for a sequel exploring Saeng's continued journey and the ultimate outcome of her efforts.
887	9752	4	2	The author likely concluded the story with those lines to underscore Saeng's newfound confidence. Initially saddened by the hibiscus, Saeng's mood shifted to happiness upon seeing the flower. Further bolstering her spirits, her mother assisted her in planting it, instilling in Saeng a certainty of its survival until spring. Ultimately, this experience, coupled with personal reflection, contributes to Saeng's improved emotional state, explaining the author's choice of ending to highlight her growth and resilience.
888	9753	4	2	"Minfong Ho likely ended ""Winter Hibiscus"" as she did to underscore Saeng's tenacious spirit. Despite failing her exam, Saeng's acquisition of the hibiscus is pivotal; it rekindles her determination. This tangible connection to her homeland and family likely reminds her of their aspirations for her success. Consequently, she vows to retake the exam when the hibiscus buds, signifying a renewed commitment fueled by her heritage and familial expectations, solidifying the story's focus on Saeng's resilience."
889	9754	4	2	"The conclusion of Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" culminates with Saeng's renewed determination, signified by her vow to retake the examination in spring. This deliberate choice by the author underscores Saeng's profound connection to her homeland. The symbolic resonance of spring, a period of renewal and rebirth, directly links to Saeng's emotional state. The return of spring mirrors the familiar environment of her native country, thus fostering a sense of comfort and belonging. It is this psychological association with home that empowers Saeng to confront the challenges of the test, suggesting the author strategically positions this statement to emphasize the enduring influence of Saeng's origins on her resilience."
890	9755	4	2	"Saeng, displaced from her native Vietnam and now residing at @LOCATION2, grapples with the profound changes in her life. The winter hibiscus becomes a potent symbol of her longing for home, each flower stirring memories of her childhood. Overwhelmed, she often succumbs to tears, a testament to the difficulty of adapting to a foreign land. Yet, planting the hibiscus is also her way of coping, a promise to herself that she will adapt. She finds solace in the gradual familiarization with her new surroundings, noting that ""many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become… almost familiar to her now."" Her vow to retake the driver's test when the hibiscus blooms is deeply symbolic. The flower's transformation, its ability to overcome the harsh winter and blossom anew, mirrors Saeng's own journey of change. Similarly, the return of the geese each spring, their migration a cyclical pattern of leaving and returning, reflects Saeng's intention to avoid the test during her own ""winter"" of discomfort, but to embrace it when she feels ready, just as the geese embrace their return home. Ultimately, the hibiscus and the geese represent Saeng's hope and belief in her capacity to transform and adapt, signaling her eventual readiness to face new challenges in her adopted home."
891	9756	4	2	**Oral:**  Basically, she's planning to do the test next year.
892	9757	4	2	The story concludes as it does, arguably, because the author aims to suggest a cycle of renewal. The ending implies a readiness for future challenges, a preparation to face the plant, and the associated childhood memories, without succumbing to tears or emotional collapse. The author sets the stage for the protagonist’s anticipated resilience and emotional fortitude in the coming year, signifying a hopeful outlook.
893	9758	4	2	"Saeng purchased a winter hibiscus, a poignant reminder of her distant homeland, intending to plant it in her garden. A recent academic setback weighed heavily on her mind, the sting of failure still fresh. Her mother, sensing her daughter's distress, overlooked the hibiscus's @MONEY1 price. As Saeng carefully planted the shrub, a quiet determination filled her. ""In the spring,"" she murmured, ""when the snows melt, the geese return, and this hibiscus begins to bud, I will retake that test."" The author leaves the reader contemplating Saeng's future success, the annual nature of the test suggested by the cyclical imagery of blooming hibiscus and returning geese, further intensifying the suspense surrounding her eventual triumph or defeat."
894	9759	4	2	I believe the author concluded the paragraph to convey a specific message to the reader. The author seems to be drawing a parallel between the plant's survival through the harsh winter and the character's upcoming driver's test. The underlying message is that if the plant can endure and overcome a challenging period, then the character, too, possesses the resilience and strength to succeed in her own challenge, which is passing the driving test; this is the purpose of the author's inclusion.
895	9760	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" where Saeng vows to retake the test in spring, is a powerful choice by the author. This promise encapsulates hope and unwavering determination. Saeng's internal vow, ""I will take that test again,"" underscores her resilience and refusal to be defeated by an initial setback. This declaration alone offers encouragement to anyone who has experienced failure and desires another opportunity to succeed. Furthermore, this concluding paragraph effectively summarizes Saeng's admirable character, highlighting her inner strength. Despite the pain of previous failure, she demonstrates courage by choosing to confront the challenge again. The willingness to persevere after experiencing defeat reveals significant personal fortitude. Finally, the author’s description of ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" creates a sense of cyclical completion, mirroring the promise of renewal and improved circumstances that spring brings. In essence, the author concludes with this promise to leave the reader with a sense of optimism and the assurance that Saeng will not be deterred from achieving her goals."
896	9761	4	2	"The author strategically placed the story's hopeful resolution at the end to illustrate Saeng's gradual adaptation to her new circumstances. This is supported by the preceding paragraph, which highlights Saeng's evolving perspective: what once felt foreign had become ""almost familiar."" The concluding lines, referencing the cyclical return of geese in spring, serve to emphasize that Saeng's failure on the test is not a permanent setback. Just as spring follows winter, she will have another opportunity to succeed, effectively reinforcing the story's central theme and leaving the reader with a sense of optimism and closure."
897	9762	4	2	After failing her @CAPS1 test, Saeng trudged home, heavy with disappointment. But then, a splash of color caught her eye – a hibiscus, a familiar flower that stirred memories of her Vietnamese homeland. Seeking solace, she entered a flower shop and discovered the very plant that had captivated her. The hibiscus evoked cherished memories, a stark contrast to her present struggles. Planting it in her vegetable garden, Saeng nurtured the flower and, in turn, the flower nurtured her spirit. The story culminates with Saeng's silent vow: when spring arrives, when the snow melts and the geese return, and when the hibiscus blooms once more, she will retake the @CAPS1 test. The hibiscus, a symbol of resilience and renewal, has given Saeng the strength and hope to face her challenges again. It's more than just a flower; it's a reminder of her roots and her inner strength, fueling her determination to succeed.
898	9763	4	2	The concluding paragraph signals the story's seasonal closure. Winter's onset is marked by the hibiscuses' demise, mirroring the end of a cycle. The protagonist's departure is temporary, tied to the promise of spring and the return of planting season. Her eventual comeback is also linked to retaking the test, suggesting a cyclical pattern of effort and renewal. The author strategically uses this paragraph to encapsulate the themes of ending and hopeful rebirth.
899	9764	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves to inject a sense of hope, a buoyant counterpoint to the story's overall melancholic tone. This deliberate choice underscores the theme of resilience, illustrating that persistent effort can propel one forward, even amidst hardship. The author suggests that the perceived end is self-imposed, a consequence of surrendering to despair. Therefore, the final, potent statement is employed to reinforce this message of empowerment and enduring possibility."
900	9765	4	2	A spark ignited within her; confidence bloomed like a desert flower after a rare rain. The sight of the plant, so reminiscent of her distant homeland, filled her with an unexpected joy and a potent sense of comfort, a balm to her weary soul. This connection to home fueled a newfound motivation, a quiet determination to succeed. She declared that when these feelings solidified, when the comforting presence truly settled within her, she would dedicate herself to the daunting test. She was setting a deadline, a personal challenge, like so many others who sought to push their limits and achieve their goals, proving that she too could overcome adversity.
901	9766	4	2	" The concluding paragraph serves as a poignant reminder that timing is crucial; opportunities must align with readiness for success. The author illustrates this through the Madagascar periwinkle. The narrator observes, ""Madagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, 'How strange to see it in a pot.' Back home it just grew wild jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between roofs."" This detail highlights how the plant, once thriving effortlessly in a specific environment, now finds itself confined and potentially struggling. It suggests that re-attempting something, like cultivating the periwinkle in a new setting, requires patience until conditions are favorable, demonstrating that recognizing and respecting the right moment is essential for achieving desired outcomes. The author implies that the narrator, like the periwinkle, may need to wait for the opportune moment to flourish again."
902	9767	4	2	The author's chosen conclusion, rich with emotion and symbolism, serves specific purposes. The ending deliberately evokes mixed feelings in the reader: sadness for the girl's academic setback and longing for home, hope for a future return, and wonder at the unanswered questions. The reader feels sadness, hope, and wonder because the ending shows the girl missing home, but also provides the possibility of return. Symbolism plays a crucial role, particularly through the plant and the geese, which gain prominence in the concluding sentences. The plant, in particular, likely represents the home the girl deeply misses. Ultimately, the author leaves the reader pondering several aspects, such as the significance of the plant and the reasons behind the family's relocation from their beloved home, and this open-endedness is precisely why the author concluded the story as they did, prompting reflection and continued engagement with the narrative's themes.
903	9768	4	2	"Saeng, the protagonist of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" cherishes vivid memories of the flowers from her homeland. The winter hibiscus, with its velvety red petals, held a special place in her heart. However, she also faced a setback, failing a recent exam.

The author implies the plant is destined to repeat the cycle of enduring the harsh cold, with the daunting ""test"" of winter survival and subsequent blooming presented once more, highlighting the plant's cyclical existence and the persistent challenge it must overcome."
906	9771	4	2	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to convey a sense of resilience and hope for the future.

Furthermore, the paragraph signifies a fresh start in a new country, as indicated by ""Not like the same kind we had before,"" implying adaptation and adjustment to a different environment. Finally, the image of the ""hibiscus is budding"" serves as a powerful metaphor for potential and growth, indicating that she, like the hibiscus, will flourish in this new chapter, completing the sense of optimism."
907	9772	4	2	Alone in her new surroundings, Saeng resolves to retake the test she previously failed. The familiar comfort drawn from a newfound connection to her past life fuels this decision. Having begun to acclimate to her unfamiliar home, she now feels ready to persevere, suggesting a growing sense of belonging is empowering her to face challenges.
908	9773	4	2	The author concludes the story in this way to highlight the theme of new beginnings after setbacks. Saeng's failure on her herb driving test significantly affected her, but she plans to attempt it again in the spring. This suggests her belief that personal renewal will lead to improved performance, reinforcing the idea that one can always start over despite past mistakes; therefore, the ending underscores the potential for redemption and growth inherent in new opportunities.
909	9774	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng eagerly anticipating spring. The melting snow signals a time for renewal, a return to the familiar comfort of planting.

Saeng's deep affection for this flower, especially after moving to the United States, is evident. The final image is one of hope and anticipation; she patiently waits for the right moment to cultivate her beloved hibiscus, a symbol of her connection to the past and her embrace of the future, suggesting a hopeful outlook and the enduring power of nature's cycles.

This convergence of natural events and sentimental echoes creates an optimal environment in her mind, making it the most favorable time for undertaking various tasks and projects. The presence of the geese and hibiscus, acting as potent symbols, triggers a cascade of positive feelings that empower and motivate her. Consequently, this particular time of year provides her with the ideal blend of inspiration and emotional support needed to accomplish her goals, making it, in essence, the perfect moment to act.
911	9776	4	2	The story finds its resolution with the hibiscus serving as a potent symbol of renewal and motivation. The author's journey isn't over; it's merely paused. The harsh winter, much like her initial failure, will eventually give way to the promise of spring. With the melting snows, the returning geese, and most importantly, the budding hibiscus, she finds a renewed sense of purpose.

The hibiscus, therefore, becomes more than just a flower; it’s a personal deadline, a vibrant reminder that she will face the drivers test again in the spring, emboldened by hope and the promise of a fresh start.
912	9777	4	2	Spring seemed the right time. She needed space to breathe, to truly settle into her new life. The hibiscus, too, was key. As the first buds swelled, promising vibrant blooms, a sense of comfort would wash over her. It was more than just a flower; it was a tangible connection to her childhood in Vietnam, a thread linking her present to her past. The hibiscus's own journey, from pot to earth, mirrored her own. When its roots finally took hold and it flourished in the new soil, she believed, a similar strength would blossom within her, making her ready to face the test anew, its success a symbolic parallel to her own. The budding of the hibiscus would signal her own readiness, a visual cue that she, like the plant, was prepared to thrive.
913	9778	4	2	The story ends with Saeng's vow to the hibiscus. This resolution signifies a promise of return. Implicit in the narrative is Saeng's determination. Year after year, she will persist. The hibiscus, despite any past failures, will be tended to once more. She commits to another season, another chance. A new year brings renewed effort and hope for a different outcome with the flower.

Therefore, the author concludes the story as such to emphasize Saeng's resilient spirit and her commitment to future endeavors.
922	9787	4	2	The author ends the story with the hibiscus because she wants to show us what happens to it over the winter. If it survives until spring, she can finally take the test. I think she's using the hibiscus as a symbol for her own life and the challenges she faces. If the plant is still standing after the winter, it means she'll be okay and ready to go back and take that test, demonstrating resilience in both nature and life.

928	9793	4	2	I believe that the author ends the story the way she did because it talkís about both of the subjects. The author is trying to say that when she takes her driving test next spring the hibiscus will give her confidence to pass her driving test. The author  **Rewritten Article (Narrative):**  The story concludes as it does, I think, because it circles back to both central themes. The author seems to suggest that next spring, when the protagonist faces her driving test, the vibrant hibiscus will serve as a symbol of strength, bolstering her confidence and guiding her toward success behind the wheel. Thus, the hibiscus and the driving test are intertwined at the end, suggesting a hopeful future.

931	9796	4	2	The concluding paragraph highlights the protagonist's need for acclimation to her new environment. Saeng's emotional response to the plants, specifically her tears, reveals her homesickness and unfamiliarity with her surroundings. The hibiscus, in its budding stage, serves as a metaphor for Saeng's own potential for adaptation. Just as the plant adjusts to its new environment, Saeng anticipates her own eventual acclimatization. The narrative suggests that she intends to postpone retaking a test until she feels more settled, drawing a parallel between her personal growth and the blossoming of the hibiscus, finding solace in the plant's resilience, implying that once she adapts, she will be ready to face new challenges.
932	9797	4	2	Saeng's story culminates with a silent vow made in the spring. The snow's melt, the geese's return, and the hibiscus's budding signify a period of renewal and a renewed determination within Saeng. This vow to retake the test stems directly from her failure and the anticipated disappointment of her mother. The hibiscus flower, therefore, becomes a symbol of both consolation for her failure and a promise to try again, suggesting that without the initial setback, the flower might not have been acquired at all. This act of vowing underscores Saeng's resilience and her commitment to overcome her academic challenge, demonstrating a quiet strength forged in the face of potential familial disapproval.
933	9798	4	2	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng making a vow related to the hibiscus, highlighting the flower's profound significance for her. The hibiscus serves as a source of resolve, a tangible link to her Vietnamese homeland. Saeng's promise, ""If this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" reveals the flower's power to instill determination. Moreover, the hibiscus bolsters her self-assurance, evoking memories of her life in Vietnam before relocating to @LOCATION2. Ultimately, the author strategically ends the narrative with this specific paragraph to underscore the hibiscus's symbolic weight in Saeng's life, representing resilience, hope, and a connection to her roots."
934	9799	4	2	The hibiscus, a vibrant splash of home in this foreign land, held a profound connection for her. It wasn't just a plant; it was a living, breathing echo of her past. She saw a parallel between its struggle to bloom and her own journey. The tenacious effort the hibiscus exerted to produce its flowers mirrored her need to push through her own challenges. Just as the sun patiently melts the snow, she felt a similar pressure to shed old habits and embrace the actions necessary to succeed in her upcoming test, a personal benchmark of growth. The memories of her homeland, inextricably linked to the hibiscus, served not as a distraction, but as a source of strength. A silent vow passed her lips: she would face the test again, armed with the lessons learned from her past and the resilience she saw reflected in the blooming hibiscus. This renewed commitment underscored her determination to honor her origins while forging a new path forward.
935	9800	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter @CAPS1"" serves as a promise of renewed exploration and engagement. As the seasons cycle back to warmer days, the protagonist anticipates a return to the hibiscus plants. Her curiosity remains piqued, fueling a desire to deepen her understanding of these vibrant flowers and their life cycle. The anticipation is palpable; she eagerly awaits the opportunity to nurture them as they begin to bud, highlighting a connection to the natural world and a hopeful outlook for the future. This cyclical return underscores the character's sustained interest and foreshadows continued discovery."
936	9801	4	2	"This paragraph is significant for several reasons. Firstly, the flower's budding serves as an emotional support, a reminder of home, evidenced by her reflection that ""a blossom of two would have blown into the well,"" evoking her homeland. Secondly, it illustrates her ongoing adaptation to her new environment. The passage regarding the geese explicitly states this, noting that ""many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now."" This demonstrates her acclimation and newfound appreciation for her present life. Ultimately, this final paragraph is crucial because it encapsulates the transformative nature of her journey and highlights her evolving perspective."
937	9802	4	2	She wasn't ready yet. Not quite. The bare branches of the trees outside her window were a constant reminder of the waiting that still lay ahead. But a shift was coming, she could feel it in the lengthening days and the subtle softening of the air. Soon, she thought, soon enuff. She pictured the first brave shoots pushing through the earth, unfurling towards the light. She imagined the honking chorus of geese returning, a winged promise of renewal. When the flowers bloomed, painting the landscape in vibrant hues, and the geese flew home, completing their long journey, she would be ready. The arrival of spring, marked by these vivid signs, would signal her own readiness, concluding her period of preparation and ushering in a new chapter.
938	9803	4	2	"The story concludes with the author's indication that she intends to retake the driver's test when the weather improves. This inference is supported by the earlier statement, ""As Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test,"" which explicitly reveals her failure. It is implied that the snowy conditions may have contributed to her unsuccessful attempt, leading to anticipation of a more favorable outcome in warmer weather, as plant growth suggests a more suitable time for testing. Therefore, the concluding paragraph suggests a future attempt contingent upon improved weather conditions."
939	9804	4	2	"In ""Hibiscus,"" the author ends the story with the line, ""in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to emphasize a crucial point. These specific conditions—the arrival of spring, the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus—must all coincide before she feels ready to retake the test. The convergence of these elements signifies a personal renewal and readiness, implying that her success on the test is inextricably linked to her overall well-being and connection with nature's cycles, thus highlighting the deep interconnectedness of her internal state and the external world."
940	9805	4	2	The story concludes with the plant to symbolize Saeng's fresh start. Disheartened by her failed test, Saeng sought solace in the greenhouse. There, for @MONEY1, she purchased a vibrant hibiscus, its blooms echoing memories of her homeland. Yet, the hibiscus signified more than nostalgia; it represented her current home and a new chapter unfolding. The plant offered Saeng a renewed sense of hope, suggesting that beginnings can be positive and that future attempts, such as retaking the test, can lead to success, ultimately providing her comfort in her new environment.
941	9806	4	2	The author ends the story captivated by the imagery of geese. Spring's promise, with its budding flora, also draws him in. He's made a promise to himself: he'll face that test when spring arrives. His anticipation builds with each melting patch of snow, eager for the day he can finally take it, and complete this chapter.
942	9807	4	2	The author concludes the story with that final paragraph to express a longing for the past. Specifically, she desires a return to the specific circumstances and aspirations she held at the time she took the test. This yearning encapsulates both the external environment and the internal ambitions that defined her then, suggesting a dissatisfaction with her present reality and a desire to recapture a previous state of being. Ultimately, the conclusion underscores the author's wistful reflection on a past era characterized by particular goals and surroundings.
943	9808	4	2	In my interpretation, the author's concluding word selection strongly implies the narrative's continuation beyond the text's confines. However, I posit that the true underlying trial lies in the protagonist's enduring connection to, and remembrance of, her origins and homeland. The ending serves not as a full stop, but as a reminder of where she came from, and thus, where a part of her will always remain, even as her story unfolds elsewhere.
944	9809	4	2	The author frames the narrative with Saeng's internal vow: she will retake her driving test. This promise is anchored to the return of spring, specifically the melting snow, the arrival of geese, and the budding of her Winter Hibiscus. The author connects this cyclical return to Saeng's initial failure of the driver's test. The Winter Hibiscus, absent in the cold, becomes a symbol of hope and good luck, especially when coupled with the return of the geese; Saeng associates familiarity with them, thus linking their return to her renewed resolve and the cyclical promise she makes. These natural events serve as a personal calendar, marking the time until her next attempt and solidifying her determination.
945	9810	4	2	"Oral: Saeng's story ends like that because it shows you can always fix things if the past lets you. Like, CAPS1 didn't pass, right? But she says, ""in the spring...I will take that test again."" That's like, even when it's snowy and cold, spring's coming. You can grow again. It's the same with Saeng. She messed up, but she gets another shot. We all get chances to try again and do better, showing that redemption and second chances are always possible."
946	9811	4	2	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in spring. This signifies her future adaptation to her new environment. The winter hibiscus, though not the kind from her former home, represents her lingering attachment to the past. By spring, when the hibiscus buds, Saeng's fondness for her origins will remain, but she will be more adjusted to her present life. The return of the geese symbolizes her eventual discovery of a new place to call home. Once she establishes this sense of belonging, she will feel ready to ""take the test,"" indicating her return to normalcy. The author's concluding sentence suggests Saeng's eventual integration and growth within her new life, solidifying the theme of adaptation and hope."
947	9812	4	2	The author ends the story on a note of optimism, mirroring the return of the geese with the character's own resolve to retake the test, confident in her eventual success. The recurring imagery of the geese suggests a cyclical pattern of hope and renewal. The story highlights the character's evolving perception of her surroundings. Initially, the unfamiliar environment seemed strange and alien. However, with each passing season, the once-foreign landscape has become increasingly familiar, transformed by the comforting rhythm of nature's repetitions. The strangeness she experienced upon arrival has gradually faded, replaced by a sense of belonging and acceptance, signifying her growing connection to her new home and suggesting a future where such feelings of displacement are no longer present. The character's acclimatization to her environment reflects her internal growth and newfound sense of place, showing how with time and experience, even the most unfamiliar setting can become home.
948	9813	4	2	"The final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" leaves the reader with a sense of hope because Saeng, having failed her test and received the flower that evokes powerful memories, seems determined to persevere. The flower's presence signals a return to better times, suggesting she's ready to try again. Furthermore, the image of the geese flying overhead reinforces this idea of cyclical return and renewal; their eventual reappearance in spring, coinciding with the hibiscus's bloom, symbolizes Saeng's own resurgence and her commitment to retaking and ultimately passing the test. It's a conclusion steeped in optimism, implying that just as winter gives way to spring, Saeng's current struggles will lead to future success, and therefore she will take that test again."
949	9814	4	2	The author ends the story as she does out of profound affection. Her homeland, her father, her mother – all are sources of deep love. She revels in the vibrant green landscape and eagerly anticipates the arrival of spring. Ultimately, the conclusion reflects her willingness to personally endure the challenge of feeling displaced, a sacrifice seemingly motivated by her deep connection to home and family; it is a testament to her commitment.
950	9815	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" strategically emphasizes Saeng's resolute nature while simultaneously cultivating reader anticipation for future developments. This interpretation is supported by the clear portrayal of Saeng's unwavering commitment to success, a characteristic consistently demonstrated throughout the narrative. Furthermore, the author's deliberate choice to conclude the story without complete resolution serves as a potent narrative device, effectively generating suspense and a desire for continued engagement with Saeng's journey. Consequently, the ending's dual function – highlighting determination and fostering anticipation – underscores the author's skillful manipulation of narrative closure to leave a lasting impact."
951	9816	4	2	"The concluding paragraph effectively portrays Saeng's growing acclimation to her new environment. Saeng herself acknowledges that once-foreign aspects of her surroundings have become familiar. The winter hibiscus offers solace, evoking memories of home. Her reflection, ""In the spring when the snows melt,"" signifies her acceptance of the cyclical nature of the seasons. Even the distinctive V-formation of geese is now a familiar sight. Therefore, the final paragraph provides a fitting conclusion by demonstrating Saeng's increasing comfort and her optimistic outlook on the future."
952	9817	4	2	Upon their return, Saeng made a silent vow. She would retake the test in the spring, a time marked by the melting snows, the honking return of geese overhead, and the burgeoning buds of the hibiscus. This passage emphasizes Saeng's resolve to adapt to her circumstances, finding a connection to her roots and the cyclical nature of the seasons, thereby offering her a sense of solace and a renewed determination to try again when nature blooms anew.
953	9818	4	2	Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring, amidst melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, suggests a strategy of delaying gratification and anchoring herself in hope. Her past actions support this interpretation. For instance, after failing the test, Saeng sought solace by purchasing something evocative of her homeland, using the familiar object to reconnect with comforting memories and mitigate the sting of failure. Similarly, the intense recognition she felt, almost a visceral jolt, momentarily eclipsed her present struggles – the relocation to @LOCATION1 and the failed test – grounding her in a sense of home. Ultimately, the author's concluding paragraph reinforces the idea that Saeng copes with adversity by drawing strength from memories and symbolic connections, much like the enduring presence of a plant that reminds her of home, providing a foundation to persevere.
954	9819	4	2	The author likely concludes the story as they do to signify Saeng's upcoming growth and adaptation in the new year. Saeng's reflection on how initially strange things have become commonplace highlights her assimilation. The hibiscus symbolizes hope and inspiration for her future. She seems to be acknowledging the reality that @LOCATION1 is now her home, and while Vietnam remains a part of her, a return is not immediately possible; therefore, she's beginning to embrace her life in @LOCATION1, suggesting a path toward acceptance and belonging.
955	9820	4	2	"Saeng's concluding comparison to the hibiscus flower underscores her hope for a fresh start. Her plan to retake the test ""when the hibiscus is @NUM1)"" reveals a belief that her fate is intertwined with the flower's cycle. Just as the hibiscus revives, so too will she. Saeng draws strength from the hibiscus's ability to endure; if it can survive the ""cold @NUM2),"" she believes she can overcome the driver's test and build a life in a new land. The author uses winter as a symbol of death and hardship, contrasting it with spring, which embodies rebirth and opportunity. Saeng's internal declaration, ""in the spring… I will take the test @NUM3),"" encapsulates this renewed sense of possibility. Ultimately, the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's resilience and her unwavering optimism for a brighter future."
956	9821	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding sentence, ""when they come back...in the spring,"" is pivotal. Saeng, having previously failed, vows to retake the test when spring arrives, marked by melting snow, returning geese, and a budding hibiscus. This imagery signifies renewal and second chances. The geese return to experience a new spring, and the hibiscus produces new flowers, symbolizing a fresh start. Saeng draws inspiration from nature's resilience, believing that if the geese and hibiscus can succeed in their cyclical endeavors, she too can overcome her setback and pass the test. The author uses this to highlight the innate determination within all living things to fulfill their purpose. The flower strives to re-bud, the geese to return, and Saeng to pass her test. Minfong Ho ends the story with this quote to inspire readers to persevere in life's journey; even after failure, one can always try again, and it provides inspiration to continue pursuing one's goals."
957	9822	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the driving test in spring, a declaration emphasizing the hope she derives from nature. The author uses imagery of geese and hibiscus to evoke a sense of peace and connection to her homeland. This connection provides Saeng with strength, allowing her to carry a piece of her past with her. Throughout the narrative, Saeng's relationship with nature is a source of resilience, mirroring her mother's garden and her preference for natural foods like bitter melons over @LOCATION1. Ultimately, the final paragraph underscores the power of nature in her homeland to inspire Saeng and assist her in adapting to a new life, offering a hopeful resolution.
958	9823	4	2	The concluding paragraph suggests the author's hope for future resilience and adaptation to her new surroundings, anticipating diminished homesickness. The author's prior failure to fulfill her grandmother's request, choosing to spend the money on something else, likely contributes to her perceived shortcomings during the year; this context illuminates the significance of the author's concluding reflection. Therefore, the final paragraph serves to underscore the author's desire for emotional fortitude and implicitly acknowledges a past misstep, providing a sense of closure and forward momentum.
959	9824	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to highlight Saeng's resilience and ongoing adjustment to her changed circumstances. Her internal vow, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” suggests a renewed commitment to succeeding within her new environment. Therefore, the author ends the story with this specific paragraph to illustrate Saeng's adaptive nature and her proactive approach to navigating change, showcasing her determination to integrate into her new life.
960	9825	4	2	The author employs metaphors to illustrate the author's feelings regarding Saeng's private life. The author utilizes metaphorical language to convey their sentiments concerning Saeng's personal affairs.
961	9826	4	2	"The story concludes by highlighting Saeng's empathetic nature and desire to mend her perceived failings in her mother's eyes. Saeng feels remorse for her actions and expresses a wish to assist her mother with the garden, stating, ""Here, let me help, mother,"" moved by her mother's delicate appearance. Earlier, she avoided eye contact after failing her driving test, understanding her mother's potential disappointment, evidenced by the line, ""Saeng didn’t dare look her mother in the eye."" Despite Saeng’s worries, her mother appreciates the plant, declaring, ""It’s a beautiful plant, I’m glad you got it,"" revealing a strong bond between them. Ultimately, the story's ending illustrates Saeng's compassionate drive for self-improvement, fueled by her empathy for her mother."
962	9827	4	2	"In “Winter Hibiscus,” Saeng prioritizes gardening, specifically her winter hibiscus, above her academic performance. The story suggests that with the passing of winter and the hibiscus, Saeng will be able to refocus on her studies and succeed on the test she previously failed. This is evidenced by her willingness to spend a significant amount of money – ""I paid over nineteen dollars for it"" – on the plant, indicating a dedication that supersedes even basic needs like food. Her failure, underscored by the quote ""I failed the test"" accompanied by her tears, is directly linked to her preoccupation with the hibiscus. Therefore, the conclusion posits that as spring arrives and the winter hibiscus fades, Saeng's attention will shift back to her education. She will likely pass her test and then possibly return to gardening as a leisure activity, having first addressed her academic responsibilities."
963	9828	4	2	Saeng's story culminates with a powerful image, deliberately chosen by the author. Having emigrated from Vietnam to the United States, Saeng struggles to assimilate, symbolized by her failure to pass her driving test. Seeking solace and a connection to her past, she purchases a hibiscus, a plant deeply rooted in her memories of Vietnam. The author uses this act to illustrate a larger point: the importance of retaining cultural ties when navigating a new environment. Saeng's planting of the hibiscus, despite the unfavorable winter season, becomes a metaphor for her own potential growth and adaptation. The author suggests that when spring arrives, and the hibiscus blooms, Saeng too will be ready to blossom in her new home, equipped to face challenges like the driving test. The narrative begins and ends with this tangible symbol of home, emphasizing the theme that cultural touchstones provide strength and facilitate adaptation when transplanted to unfamiliar soil, suggesting that a piece of home can ease the transition and foster eventual success.
964	9829	4	2	"Saeng's story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" culminates with her decision to retake the driver's test in spring, a detail that underscores the themes of adaptation and unwavering determination. As an immigrant, Saeng navigates the unfamiliar landscape of her new home, grappling with cultural differences as she strives to assimilate. Her surprise at seeing a Madagascar periwinkle in a pot – ""how strange to see it in a pot,"" remembering ""Back home it just grows wild"" – exemplifies this disconnect. The symbolic return of the geese, mirroring Saeng's own adaptation by recognizing their migratory patterns, precedes the final, resolute declaration: ""I will take that test again."" This sentence encapsulates Saeng's persistent spirit, evident throughout the narrative. Her struggle to plant the hibiscus, where ""the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it,"" highlights her resilience. Despite the initial difficulty, she ""Dug out a hole,"" demonstrating her ability to persevere and create a foundation for growth, even in challenging conditions. This final line, therefore, resonates deeply, encapsulating key themes and offering crucial insight into Saeng's enduring character, confirming her commitment to overcoming obstacles."
965	9830	4	2	"The story concludes with a paragraph emphasizing the budding plant, a potent symbol for Saeng. This @CAPS1, purchased after failing her driving test to soothe her homesickness, embodies much more. It represents her confidence, beauty, and adaptability, qualities she hopes to cultivate within herself, mirroring her cherished memories of her homeland. I interpreted the @CAPS1 as a metaphor for Saeng herself, the same being but flourishing in new soil, just as she remains Saeng, but now in a new home. The final paragraph's focus on the @CAPS1 budding is crucial; its potential blossoming symbolizes Saeng's deep affection for her origins. The concluding line, ""then I will take that test again,"" gains deeper meaning when viewed in this light. It speaks to a renewed confidence she will possess when the @CAPS1 blooms, representing her own personal growth. Ultimately, the plant's budding promises not only blossoms but Saeng's renewed self-assurance."

Despite missing her former life, her grandmother, the well, and the comb, she actively tries again, exemplified by her willingness to ""take that test again."" This act demonstrates her resilience and refusal to succumb to the @CAPS2 of loss and the pain of her grief, showing her resolve to move forward."
967	9832	4	2	"Saeng's story closes with a silent vow, a promise made to herself as she anticipates the return of spring. ""When they back,"" she thinks, envisioning the melting snows, the honking geese, and, most importantly, the budding hibiscus. It's then, she believes, that she'll face the test again. On the surface, drawing strength from a plant might seem simplistic. However, the hibiscus is more than just flora; it's a potent symbol of her distant home, a place she deeply misses. The plant's well-being mirrors her longing for that familiar, warm environment. Her hope isn't in the plant itself, but in what it represents: a thriving connection to her roots. When the hibiscus flourishes, mirroring the vibrancy of her tropical home, Saeng believes she will find the solace and strength needed to finally succeed. This is why her story concludes with the image of renewed growth and a renewed determination."

The plant acts as a tangible link to her past, comforting her with familiar images and emotions despite her current sadness. Using the hibiscus as a tool for comfort, Saeng connects with her roots, drawing strength from cherished memories. Determined to cultivate hope, she plants the hibiscus. As she finishes, a flock of geese flies overhead, becoming a symbol of this day, a marker in time. The final image anticipates a future spring: ""When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" This hopeful vision suggests Saeng will face the driver's test again, renewed by the memories and resilience fostered by her connection to home, signifying a positive future intertwined with the plant's growth."
969	9834	4	2	Saeng needs to retake the test to improve her grade. She worries about snow in the spring, concerned it will cover the flowers. Her mother allowed her to assist with the peppers and melons and permitted her to stay up for dinner.
970	9835	4	2	"The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to emphasize the protagonist's unwavering determination.

971	9836	4	2	The concluding paragraph leverages the symbolic resonance of winter's dormancy and spring's resurgence to illuminate Saeng's psychological trajectory. Winter, a period of apparent lifelessness, mirrors Saeng's anxieties and struggles, while the anticipation of spring, a season of renewal, instills a renewed impetus for academic achievement. The parallel drawn between Saeng and the winter hibiscus, a plant that perseveres through harsh conditions, suggests a process of personal growth.

He captures the ephemeral nature of weather, documenting its constant flux and its profound impact on the surrounding world, drawing readers into a sensory experience of the changing atmosphere and underlining the weather's powerful influence.
973	9838	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with that paragraph to draw a parallel between herself and the natural world. As the plants bloom, she anticipates her own personal growth, symbolized by her willingness to face the upcoming test. This realization stems from her gradual acceptance of the once-foreign, now-familiar rhythms of life. Just as the geese instinctively lift their heads, observe the V-formation against the sky, and turn towards the horizon, she too is embracing the future, showcasing a newfound sense of acceptance and direction, which solidifies the ending.
974	9839	4	2	The author highlights the final quote to emphasize the protagonist's aspirations. She now recognizes the comforting familiarity in the recurring seasons, a stark contrast to her past.

The author concludes the paragraph with this statement, summarizing the speaker's rationale and future course of action.
976	9841	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to instill a sense of hope and resolve in Saeng's future.

982	9847	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saengís resolve to acclimate to her new environment. The flower, first mentioned when Saeng, feeling isolated after failing her driving test, clutches it as a tangible link to Vietnam and its comforting memories, becomes a central symbol.

This vow signifies Saeng's renewed self-belief and determination, suggesting that her commitment will serve as both encouragement and motivation for future success, leaving the reader with a positive outlook on Saeng's prospects.
985	9850	4	2	The story culminates with a reflection on the cyclical nature of life, symbolized by the plant's impending dormancy and subsequent rebirth. The author observes the approach of winter, acknowledging the inevitable death of the current bloom. However, this is not an ending, but a pause. Central to the narrative is Saeng's anticipation of spring, when the plant will bud anew. More than just botanical interest, Saeng cherishes the sensory memories evoked by the flower and the introspective thoughts it inspired. The author suggests that Saeng is eager to witness the flower's future blossoming and anticipates the novel experiences and insights it will bring her in @MONTH1. Thus, the ending emphasizes a hopeful outlook, tying the natural cycle of growth and decay to the ongoing evolution of Saeng's personal journey and the enduring power of memory.

987	9852	4	2	"The concluding paragraph serves multiple crucial functions. Primarily, the author utilizes it to inject a sense of optimism into what has been a largely melancholic narrative.

This act symbolizes her determination to overcome her previous failure and succeed where she had faltered. The narrative recalls an earlier scene, mirroring Mrs. Lambert's appreciation for the unique flavor of the bitter melon – a sharp, almost unpleasant taste that ultimately yields a pleasant golden aftertaste. Similarly, the protagonist anticipates a challenging journey, yet hopes for a rewarding outcome, demonstrating resilience and an optimistic outlook for the future.
989	9854	4	2	The story concludes with that paragraph because the author seeks to leave the reader with a sense of optimism.

This potential success marks a fresh start. The season's renewal offers new opportunities for everyone, and the blooming hibiscus embodies Saeng's developing ability to overcome challenges, forge connections to her past, and find solace. The hibiscus serves as a potent symbol, encapsulating themes of resilience and hope, leaving the reader with a sense of optimistic uncertainty.
992	9857	4	2	 The concluding paragraph emphasizes the central theme of the story. Saeng's observations of winter's effects drive her to anticipate its return. She attempts to internalize the patterns she witnesses, indicating that the story's core is her quest to understand and predict future events based on past experiences, revealing the story's fundamental focus.
993	9858	4	2	The narrative concludes with the implication that the protagonist's assimilation into her novel environment will mirror the hibiscus's adaptation to a foreign climate. The author suggests that the passage of time, specifically until the end of winter, will allow the character to acclimate to the societal norms and expectations of her new surroundings. The hibiscus, a symbol of resilience, serves as an analogy for the protagonist's journey of integration.

Although her mother initially worried about the cost, she recognized Saeng's longing for home and relented, understanding the comfort it brought her daughter. After planting the hibiscus, Saeng observed the migrating geese, recognizing their annual journey and adaptation.

995	9860	4	2	The paragraph concludes perfectly, suggesting hope. It ends with a quiet instruction: tell @LOCATION1 the snow is gone, she'll try the test again. Reading between the lines, it’s more than just the test. The hibiscus is key; its spring revival mirrors her own. The plant's influence is clear, a potent reminder of her old home. It embodies the idea of second chances, not just for her test, but for everything. Spring will bring months in @LOCATION1, time to adjust. Right now, it's homesickness, even if @LOCATION1 is now home. The hibiscus is her anchor, a tangible piece of her past to hold onto, offering solace and the promise of renewal. Ultimately, the hibiscus provides her with the strength to persevere.
996	9861	4	2	Minfong Ho concludes the story in a way that highlights the theme of overcoming adversity. The narrative details Saeng's challenges in transitioning from her old life to her new one, exemplified by a difficult day: she fails her driving test, misses lunch with a friend, and impulsively buys a hibiscus plant reminiscent of her former home. The hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng herself. Like Saeng, the plant is displaced, facing hardships such as the unfamiliar cold, a confining pot, and a foreign environment. Ultimately, the concluding paragraph draws a parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus, emphasizing their shared struggle and resilience, and reinforcing the story's central message of surmounting obstacles.

999	9864	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's desire for transformation, aiming for it to be realized by spring. This change involves achieving comfort in her new location and being able to recall memories of her former home without emotional distress.

This parallel underscores Saeng's potential for growth and acceptance in the face of change.
1000	9865	4	2	"The author concludes the story with that particular statement to underscore the necessity of resilience in the face of setbacks. Saeng's disappointment after failing her driving test is a pivotal moment. Her subsequent journey to the greenery, where she encounters flowers reminiscent of her homeland and purchases the hibiscus, highlights the theme of adapting to change. The hibiscus and the unfamiliar ""V"" formation of geese Saeng initially found strange serve as symbols of acclimation to a new environment. Just as she grew accustomed to the geese, Saeng's driving test failure becomes an opportunity to demonstrate her ability to persevere; it emphasizes the idea that even when confronted with disappointment, one must gather strength and attempt again, learning from the experience and moving forward with renewed determination."
1001	9866	4	2	The concluding paragraph served as a testament to her unwavering dedication to the art of gardening. The words painted a vivid picture of a gardener so committed that the return of geese became the pivotal moment, marking the recommencement of her cherished horticultural pursuits. This wasn't a casual hobby; it was a deeply ingrained passion, a promise etched in the seasonal cycle, proving her resolve to wait for the geese before tending her garden once more.
1002	9867	4	2	The author wrapped up the story with that specific paragraph because Saeng's a total nature lover. She's super into protecting the environment, wouldn't dream of harming it. I guess the writer wanted to end on a positive, feel-good note, despite her needing to retake that test. It's a fitting ending, considering her deep connection with the natural world.
1003	9868	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the narrative in this manner underscores her unwavering determination. The ending suggests a commitment to continuous self-improvement and adaptation to her new environment, signaling her intention to persevere until she finds acceptance within her adopted home. The symbolic representation of budding flora mirrors her own personal growth, emphasizing a transformation that is more psychological than physical. Her decision to retake the test reflects a deep-seated faith in her capacity to mature and evolve, ultimately becoming an individual who, while cherishing memories of her homeland, embraces her present reality. Therefore, the author concludes the story this way to highlight her resilience and hopeful outlook on building a fulfilling life in her new home.

Consequently, exhaustive scrutiny is indispensable for efficacious implementation; this detailed review ensures the policy's intended outcomes are realized."""
1006	9871	4	2	The story concludes with the specified paragraph either because the inclement weather proved unbearable for Brufield, or because the author consciously avoided being present during the period of intense cold. At that particular juncture in the narrative, the low temperature was a significant environmental factor.
1007	9872	4	2	The author likely ended the story with that paragraph for several compelling reasons. It seems she wanted us to feel bad for the hibiscus, for one. More importantly, it highlights Saeng's determination to make her mom proud; she's not giving up. This also tells us Saeng believes in herself and her ability to pass the test. Ultimately, I think the author uses the hibiscus as a symbol, showing how even something small can inspire Saeng to overcome challenges and pursue her dreams. That final paragraph drives home the idea that Saeng's belief in herself is unshakeable, and that's why it's the perfect ending.
1008	9873	4	2	The author concludes the story with that specific sentence because the narrative centers on Saeng's disappointing driver's test. More importantly, the hibiscus acts as a powerful symbol. As Saeng recalls in an earlier paragraph, its “rich, sweet scent” was deeply familiar, triggering memories of her home in @LOCATION1. Saeng's displacement, first from @LOCATION1 and then compounded by her failure in @LOCATION2, leaves her disheartened. However, the unexpected sight and scent of the hibiscus provide a comforting link to her past.

She draws strength from the anticipated renewal, mirroring it with her own determination. Ultimately, the author aims to highlight the necessity of self-belief and the human capacity to acclimate to changing circumstances, thus justifying the story's conclusive emphasis on Saeng's resolve.
1010	9875	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" effectively encapsulates the story's themes and evokes a poignant emotional response. Saeng's silent vow, ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,"" creates a vivid image of a solitary figure kneeling in a cold garden, whispering with determination. This imagery contributes significantly to the story's touching quality, fostering empathy within the reader. Furthermore, the conclusion acts as a concise summation of key narrative elements. The line, ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again,"" directly references the symbolic hibiscus flower, a recurring motif throughout the story; the geese, significant in the story's final scene; and Saeng's initial academic setback. Therefore, the author's selection of this paragraph as the conclusion is strategically sound, providing both emotional resonance and thematic closure, thus enhancing the story's overall impact."
1011	9876	4	2	Saeng's winter test proved a hurdle she couldn't overcome. The story concludes with this unfortunate outcome, but it doesn't end there.

The author suggests that the coming spring, with its promise of renewal and growth mirroring the hibiscus's own cycle, will offer Saeng a renewed opportunity and the strength to succeed on a future test, thereby linking her academic prospects to the rhythms of nature and her personal passions.
1012	9877	4	2	The author concludes with that paragraph because she seeks to assure the reader that failure isn't final. Despite the setback, her story isn't over; she intends to recover and try again next year, framing it as a temporary pause rather than a full stop, instilling a sense of hope.
1013	9878	4	2	"The concluding paragraph indicates the author's intention to retake the test, signaling a renewed effort within her present environment. The passage, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon, almost familiar to her now,"" suggests an adaptation to her surroundings. This implies an acceptance of her current situation, a softening of her initial negative perception of a place that differed significantly from her home. Therefore, the author's willingness to try again is intertwined with her growing comfort in her new environment, indicating a potential for success rooted in familiarity and adaptation."
1014	9879	4	2	Having faced defeat in her endeavor, the author concluded with that specific sentence, a reflection of the protagonist's experience. The story detailed her efforts, culminating in a setback that fueled a renewed determination. It wasn't just an ending; it was a promise. The final phrase echoed the character's desire to revisit the challenge, to learn from the initial failure, and to strive again. The author chose to close the narrative not with resignation, but with a potent seed of hope and the unwavering resolve to attempt the feat once more, implying that the journey, despite its hurdles, was far from over.
1015	9880	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" effectively encapsulates the story's central themes.

Similar to the plant's dormancy during winter, Saeng's initial failure to obtain her driver's license represents a temporary setback. However, the hibiscus's eventual resurgence embodies Saeng's determination and newfound ability to adjust to change, providing insight into why Saeng confidently declares her intention to retake the test and succeed, demonstrating her successful adaptation and renewed resolve to overcome the challenge."
1016	9881	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng silently vows, as spring breathes life back into the world—snows melting, geese returning, hibiscus budding—that she will face the daunting test. The quote suggests that after enduring the metaphorical winter and fall, Saeng anticipates a personal resurgence, a readiness to replant and regain her self-assurance. As the geese form their characteristic ""V"" against the twilight sky, fading into the distance, Saeng finds solace and validation in their symbolic departure. Reflecting on the scene, it seems Saeng interprets the geese's flight as an affirmation, a subtle reassurance that her chosen path is, indeed, the right one, solidifying her resolve to persevere and succeed in her endeavor."
1017	9882	4	2	The story concludes with the protagonist's visit to a greenhouse, a self-imposed trial intended to confront the pain of displacement. Within, she encounters a plant native to her homeland, triggering a powerful memory of her grandmother and a flood of tears as other familiar flora evoke similar poignant connections to her lost home. The experience suggests a profound bond with her grandmother and underscores the deep sense of loss she experienced upon leaving their shared land, a loss that likely manifested in extended grief. Ultimately, the greenhouse visit serves as a turning point, revealing her desire and willingness to heal and move forward, embracing a future beyond the borders of her past.
1018	9883	4	2	The author likely included the paragraph to illustrate the protagonist's emotional nadir, stemming from the combined stressors of relocating to the United States, failing her driving test, and the symbolic disappointment of a fake plant, showcasing her declining self-esteem. Conversely, the author also intended to highlight her subsequent resurgence in confidence and determination, suggesting a pivotal shift away from self-defeat, ultimately conveying a message of resilience.
1019	9884	4	2	The author concludes with those specific words to highlight a powerful, albeit incomplete, metaphor within the narrative. The winter hibiscus serves as a symbol for Saeng and her examination, suggesting resilience and cyclical return. Just as the winter hibiscus blooms again each year, Saeng is destined to return and ultimately face her challenge. This resonates with my own experience. I once entered a triathlon with the ambition of winning. The first year, I finished @NUM1. Driven by that initial experience, I dedicated myself to rigorous training. When the next year's triathlon arrived, I competed again and achieved @NUM2, finally realizing my goal. Like the persistent winter hibiscus, I returned, persevered, and ultimately completed my objective, demonstrating the enduring spirit of renewal.

1021	9886	4	2	"The hibiscus plant represents a fresh beginning for the author, a tangible symbol of hope and renewed determination. After failing a test, she acquired the plant. Now, she associates its growth with her own aspirations. The budding of the hibiscus in spring, coinciding with the melting snow and the return of the geese, signifies a second chance. ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" she declares, revealing her belief that the plant's flourishing mirrors her own potential for success on the retake. The hibiscus isn't merely a plant; it's a living embodiment of her resolve to overcome past setbacks and embrace a hopeful future. The author's determination is tied to the plant's progress, indicating her belief in ultimate success."
1022	9887	4	2	The author likely included the paragraph about spring, with its melting snows and returning geese, to highlight the cyclical nature of seasons. This imagery contrasts with winter, a period characterized by persistent snowfall until the arrival of spring and the sun's warmth initiates the thaw. Essentially, the author seems to be emphasizing the transformative power inherent in the changing weather patterns, illustrating a broader theme of cyclical change and renewal.
1023	9888	4	2	 A wave of self-reproach washed over her; she'd impulsively purchased the hibiscus, a fleeting bloom, instead of the promised potential of plant seeds. Tears welled, fueled by the bittersweet memory of their previous hibiscus, a vibrant spectacle of summers past. She envisioned its radiant petals unfurling in the sun, a stark contrast to her current disappointment. Her academic aspirations, much like the dormant seeds, were on hold. The upcoming test, a symbol of her future, would be retaken only when the snow receded and spring breathed life back into the world. This symbolic ending suggests a fresh start; a renewed opportunity to cultivate not only a garden, but also her dreams, come next year's thaw.
1024	9889	4	2	She likely included the paragraph to underscore the significance of the matter to her. The stated intention to retake the test in spring suggests a commitment to dedicated preparation and diligent execution. This reinforces the idea that she strives to fulfill commitments related to matters of personal importance, ultimately showcasing her dedication.
1025	9890	4	2	The paragraph concludes the story because Saeng didn't pass the test. Also, hibiscus flowers need time to bloom. Besides, it seems like a fitting conclusion, and she probably wouldn't want to be tested in the snow anyway.
1026	9891	4	2	The author concludes the story with the hibiscus paragraph to highlight its significance to Saeng and, presumably, her upcoming test. The author implies that the hibiscus serves as a good luck charm for Saeng, bolstering her confidence. This is supported by earlier descriptions of Saeng's interaction with the plant; she gently touches a petal, appreciating its smooth, cool texture. By ending with this image, the author emphasizes the hibiscus's positive influence on Saeng's emotional state, suggesting a connection between the plant's presence and her increased feeling of confidence and hope for success.
1027	9892	4	2	"The story concludes with a palpable sense of anticipation, deliberately crafted to leave the reader pondering Saeng's future.

1029	9894	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to highlight the protagonist's newfound sense of purpose.

This ending highlights Saeng's ambition and her deep-seated desire for a fulfilling life. Driven by this aspiration, she actively explores new avenues and confronts challenges head-on, underscoring her determination to succeed in the world. Her planned return demonstrates that Saeng’s pursuit of a better life is a journey marked by persistence, not a single, make-or-break event, suggesting an enduring spirit that refuses to be extinguished.
1031	9896	4	2	"""Winter Hibiscus"" tells the story of a young immigrant girl's attempts to adjust to life in @LOCATION1. Her fondness for tropical flowers becomes a central theme.

1034	9899	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves as a powerful emblem of closure in the protagonist's journey. The hibiscus plant, a tangible representation of her home and roots, stands in stark contrast to the evocative image of geese in seamless flight. Observing this natural phenomenon, she internalizes a fundamental truth: the inevitable departure from the familiar nest is a universal experience. This realization signifies a crucial acceptance of her present circumstances, fortifying her resolve to reattempt her driver's license examination in the near future. The subsequent blooming of the hibiscus will then become a deeply personal symbol for her, marking the opportune moment for her to confidently pursue her goal once more, completing the cycle of growth and renewed determination.

It's as if clutching the bud allows her to grasp at a disappearing peace and serenity. The text suggests a profound sadness stemming from displacement; she yearns for the familiar comforts of her grandmother's care, the simple ritual of having her hair washed and adorned with a dok mallk. Bereft of everything else, the flowers become a potent symbol of what she's lost. Her lament, ""where was the fine toothed come the hibiscus hedge, the well. her gentle grandmother,"" underscores the breadth of her longing. The author positions Snow in a space of acute nostalgia, magnifying not only her personal connections but also her appreciation for the tangible beauty of her origins, suggesting the flower serves as a constant, albeit small, reminder of home and therefore comforts her."

Therefore, the author ends the story with this paragraph to show that while adapting to a new land, life and its familiar comforts live on."
1043	9908	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because her immediate concern isn't the retake, but the plants she selected. Knowing the test is far off, she feels she has ample time to prepare and focus more effectively. The ending also conveys her determination; despite failing the first time, she intends to return and persevere until she succeeds, suggesting that her resolve will ultimately prevent future failures.
1044	9909	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves several key purposes related to themes of perseverance, cyclical narrative structure, and detachment from the past. The re-emergence of the test scenario underscores a message of resilience, highlighting the character's intention to persist despite prior setbacks. This cyclical structure, mirroring the story's beginning, provides a sense of completion and emphasizes the character's ongoing journey. Finally, the conclusion addresses the importance of not dwelling excessively on the past. The character's decision to confront the test, and the associated floral imagery, suggests an effort to process past experiences without being overwhelmed. In essence, the ending reinforces the idea that confronting difficult memories is crucial for moving forward, demonstrating the author's intent to leave the reader with a sense of hope and continued effort.
1045	9910	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to provide a hopeful and encouraging resolution to Saeng's narrative. Her expressed disappointment at failing the test indicates its significant personal importance. The author likely chose this ending to highlight Saeng's dedication to succeeding in this endeavor, suggesting a determined and dependable character. Considering Saeng's emotional investment, it's plausible the test involves managing limited finances, with her motivation being to gain her mother's approval. Thus, the final paragraph effectively underscores Saeng's commitment to achieving this specific goal.
1046	9911	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" where Saeng vows to retake her driving test in spring, serves to reinforce the hibiscus plant's symbolic significance. The text highlights the plant's springtime budding, signifying growth and adaptation to a new environment. This mirrors Saeng's own journey. Having recently immigrated from Vietnam and failed her driving test, she feels culturally disoriented. Her preference for bitter melon over a Big Mac exemplifies this, suggesting a feeling of being misunderstood. Saeng's insecurity reflects a belief that she is not accepted. However, like the hibiscus adapting to its new surroundings, Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring suggests her own potential for growth and assimilation, indicating a hopeful future where she too will flourish."
1047	9912	4	2	"Saeng vowed to retake her driving test in the spring, a season that resonated deeply with her, evoking memories of home. Vietnam in spring was a tapestry of vibrant wildflowers. Following her recent driving test failure, a wave of homesickness washed over her, prompting a visit to the flower shop. She sought a tangible piece of her past, a connection to her roots. The plant she found, its ""leaves quivering in the wind"" yet devoid of buds, felt incomplete, a pale imitation of the blooming flora she remembered. Undeterred, Saeng decided to wait until spring, when the hibiscus would bloom again. The vibrant hibiscus, a symbol of her homeland, would offer her a renewed sense of belonging and, with it, the hope and confidence needed to succeed on her driving test."
1048	9913	4	2	Saeng's world revolved entirely around her plants. They were her lifeblood, her purpose. So, with their disappearance, it's understandable that she felt utterly devoid of motivation. The author's concluding paragraph perfectly encapsulates this devastating loss. It highlights the central role the plants played in Saeng's existence. Without them, her world shrinks, and the drive that once fueled her simply vanishes, leaving her adrift in a now-empty existence. This ending emphasizes the profound connection she had and validates her feeling of desolation.
1049	9914	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng, after failing her driver's test, finds solace in a florist shop, a place that evokes powerful memories of her homeland. Stepping inside, ""it was like walking into another world,"" she says, momentarily forgetting her recent setback, captivated by the familiar flora. These flowers offer her comfort and a sense of belonging, reassuring her that everything will be alright. The story concludes with Saeng's silent vow: ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author's choice of this concluding statement suggests that these comforting memories of her farm life will empower Saeng, alleviating her anxiety and enabling her to succeed on her next attempt at the test, demonstrating the power of familiar memories to ease distress and bolster confidence."
1050	9915	4	2	The author's conclusion likely stems from a combination of factors: the story's title and initial setup perhaps guided the narrative arc. Alternatively, the author may have simply chosen that ending based on personal preference. This conclusion might aim to illustrate events occurring for @MONTH1. However, whether this ending constitutes a truly *good* conclusion is a matter of subjective interpretation and depends on the reader's expectations and critical evaluation of its effectiveness.
1051	9916	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph seems perplexing, potentially stemming from the character's sudden commencement of speech.   The concluding paragraph's purpose is unclear, perhaps motivated by the character finally breaking their silence.
1052	9917	4	2	"The concluding paragraph underscores Saeng's resilience. Despite experiencing hardship and longing for her homeland, coupled with feelings of alienation, Saeng remains resolute. The narrative implies a continuation of life's trajectory, which Saeng intends to navigate. Her declaration, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signifies this intent. The inevitability of spring, the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the hibiscus's blossoming represent the cyclical nature of life and Saeng's decision to participate in it. Despite a previous setback, her willingness to reattempt the test exemplifies her strength. Saeng's acceptance of her new environment, while cherishing memories of home, is evident. Ultimately, the concluding paragraph highlights Saeng's determination to not only survive but also thrive in her new world, illustrating her enduring spirit in the face of adversity."
1053	9918	4	2	The narrative concludes with Saeng's deliberate action of digging a hole in the vegetable patch, an act intended by the author to demonstrate Saeng's resilience. This suggests Saeng possesses a firm sense of self-assurance and a willingness to confront challenges, specifically implying she will not be deterred by her initial experience and will undoubtedly attempt the test again. Thus, the digging symbolizes her resolve and renewed determination.
1054	9919	4	2	The concluding paragraph offers a sense of hope and burgeoning growth. The hibiscus flower, a potent symbol of Saeng’s homeland, serves as a profound source of comfort, grounding her in her emotions and reminding her of her true self. The plant's flourishing mirrors Saeng's own journey; its growth equates to her progress. The eventual bloom signifies not only a tangible piece of home but also the readiness to face future challenges, specifically the test. Ultimately, the narrative explores themes of resilience and adaptation. The vibrant, almost poetic imagery of the blooming hibiscus elevates the reward of perseverance, rendering the fruits of her struggles exceptionally beautiful and worthwhile, a testament to her journey.
1055	9920	4	2	"The story begins with young Saeng's disheartening failure of her driving test, compounded by her mother's sharp reprimand. This initial negativity casts a shadow over the narrative. However, the author concludes with a sentence brimming with hope, a stark contrast to the earlier despair. This shift is crucial, illustrating Saeng's potential for resilience. Where once she was overcome with emotion, stammering, ""I-I failed the test,"" the ending suggests a newfound ability to adjust and persevere. The author's deliberate choice to end on such a positive note provides readers with a sense of optimism for Saeng's future, suggesting that she will overcome this setback and continue to grow, ultimately shaping a more hopeful trajectory for her life."
1056	9921	4	2	The story concludes with a focus on renewal. Saeng's failure on the test is juxtaposed with the coming winter, a season of apparent death for the plant. However, the narrative suggests hope: just as the plant will inevitably bud again in the spring, so too will Saeng have another opportunity to retake the test. This cyclical imagery emphasizes the theme of new beginnings and second chances for the protagonist.
1057	9922	4	2	Saeng, a girl of few words, often preferred solitude, especially during much of the year. However, spring held a special allure for her. As the season blossomed, Saeng transformed, spending countless hours playing outdoors, particularly on @DATE2. She had silently promised herself to embrace the joy of spring, revealing her inherently kind nature.
1058	9923	4	2	 The story concludes with that particular paragraph to highlight the protagonist's resilience in the face of setbacks. A central element of her life is her passion for gardening, and her emotional connection with plants is clearly established. Therefore, the resurgence of her beloved plant serves as a powerful symbol: it signifies a renewed opportunity for her to confront and overcome a previous failure, specifically her test. The plant's revival inspires her to embrace a second chance, reinforcing the theme of perseverance and demonstrating that failure is not necessarily final but can instead be a stepping stone towards eventual success, and ultimately, the character's love for gardening and the return of the plant are intertwined to propel her forward, allowing her to approach the challenge with renewed determination.
1059	9924	4	2	As the story concludes, winter's arrival signals a period of dormancy and departure. The trees shed their leaves, geese migrate southward, and flowers wither. This ending suggests a cyclical pattern, hinting that with the return of spring, the protagonist will initiate the test anew. It is symbolic of rebirth, an opportunity to begin again, echoing nature's own renewal. The narrative suggests the cycle of life and death, and the hope for a fresh start when spring breathes life back into the world, she too will try again, giving her another chance at success.
1060	9925	4	2	" The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's silent vow to retake the test in spring. This ending is significant because it mirrors nature's cyclical pattern of dormancy and rebirth. Just as the winter hibiscus lies dormant, so too can our ambitions face temporary setbacks. Failure can feel like a descent, a period of being ""underground."" However, the author, Minfong Ho, uses the imagery of spring—melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus—to symbolize hope and renewed opportunity. Saeng's decision to wait for spring suggests an understanding that after a period of dormancy and reflection, she will be ready to rise again. This resonates with the idea that failure isn't final; it's a temporary state. By linking Saeng's resolve to the natural world's rhythms, Ho emphasizes the importance of perseverance and the promise of a fresh start, inspiring readers to embrace challenges and to rise again after setbacks, striving towards their goals with renewed determination."
1061	9926	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to establish a resolute and hopeful atmosphere, illustrating Saeng's unwavering determination to acclimate to her changed environment. This fosters a sense of warmth and inspiration for the reader. The story's conclusion functions as a call to action, encouraging perseverance in the face of adversity. By presenting Saeng's vow to improve, the author provides a tangible example for readers to emulate in their own lives. Ultimately, the author strategically positions this final paragraph to serve as a source of encouragement, potentially offering solace and guidance to those experiencing similar challenges, thereby solidifying the story's impact and resonance.
1062	9927	4	2	" The author ends the story with that particular paragraph because the plant acts as a potent symbol for Saeng, evoking memories of her homeland and providing a sense of tranquility. Saeng, feeling like an outsider, finds solace in the hibiscus, a tangible link to her past. Her difficulty articulating the phrase ""at home"" underscores her displacement. When she observes the hibiscus budding, it signifies her growing readiness to embrace her new country as home, mirroring the flower's origin. Progress is seen in the final statement where she is acclimating to the country and the geese flying in formation, alluding to her upcoming test, suggesting that she will be ready when she is finally able to accept her new home, hinting at a hopeful future where she will pass her test and fully integrate."
1063	9928	4	2	"The hibiscus, in its vibrant bloom, is more than just a flower; it's a living calendar for Saeng. The phrase, ""when they come back...then I will take that test again,"" reveals how Saeng anchors her sense of time to the hibiscus's life cycle, measuring the distance to her next exam by its flowering. Beyond time, the hibiscus embodies resilience. Saeng's academic struggles are mirrored in the plant's persistent beauty, a visual reminder to persevere. This strength extends to Saeng's mother, who witnesses her daughter's disappointment. The hibiscus becomes a focal point for her own resolve, inspiring her to act with love and plant the flower, hoping to uplift Saeng's spirits. Thus, the hibiscus serves as a powerful symbol of endurance, fortifying both Saeng and her mother as they navigate their respective challenges, offering a shared beacon of hope and perseverance."
1064	9929	4	2	"This reflects the story's core: perseverance is key to understanding and embracing life. Saeng faces a pivotal ""test,"" designed to gauge her readiness to adapt and thrive in her new surroundings. Her initial attempt fell short, a temporary setback on her journey. But the narrative emphasizes hope. When the time is right, symbolized by the blooming hibiscus, she will rise again. She will challenge herself anew, striving to release the past and embrace happiness in her transformed world, suggesting that true contentment lies in the willingness to evolve."
1065	9930	4	2	"Realizing her failure to complete the assigned task, she confessed to her mother. Initially, her mother displayed anger, but quickly composed herself. Expressing affection, she said ""I love it"" and offered her daughter food, leading them inside. The daughter, viewing the situation as a test, resolved to succeed next time, solidifying her determination to improve. This experience turned a moment of potential disappointment into a learning opportunity, reinforcing her commitment."
1066	9931	4	2	"The narrative concludes with the ""test"" likely because this trial holds significant cultural weight within Saeng's life and traditions."
1067	9932	4	2	The author's choice to conclude the story with that specific paragraph is multifaceted. Primarily, the ending evokes a strong emotional resonance, ensuring the narrative leaves a lasting impression on the reader. Moreover, it underscores Saeng's resilience, highlighting her mental fortitude rather than physical prowess. Her declaration of retaking the test, despite initial failure, demonstrates a refusal to be defeated. Furthermore, @MONTH1 likely employed this concluding paragraph to impart a vital lesson: perseverance. The story illustrates Saeng's setback and her mother's disappointment, yet emphasizes her unwavering commitment to try again. In essence, the author concludes the story with this powerful image of unwavering determination, encouraging readers to embrace challenges and never relinquish their goals, ultimately reinforcing the importance of resilience and persistence in the face of adversity.
1068	9933	4	2	The concluding sentence likely emphasizes the author and child's shared passion for gardening, perhaps hinting at the child's particular fondness for hibiscus plants. Gardening appears to be a cherished activity for the mother and child, and the ending leaves the reader pondering the author's specific intention. While seemingly ambiguous, this concluding line effectively injects an element of intrigue, inviting further reflection on the narrative's themes and the bond between mother and child, making it a successful conclusion.
1069	9934	4	2	"The concluding lines of ""Winter Hibiscus"" offer a peek into Saeng's imminent future, signaling a shift in her disposition. Previously, she had been consumed by nostalgia for her homeland, struggling to adapt to her new environment. The hibiscus flower serves as a catalyst, revealing the unexpected commonalities between her past and present. The final sentence, ""When the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" suggests a period of patient anticipation. It implies that Saeng will allow time to pass, and that by retaking her driver's test, she will actively embrace the possibilities of her new life, finally reconciling with her present reality and beginning to build a future there."
1070	9935	4	2	After failing her driving test, Saeng resolved to retake it in the spring, driven by a need to prove her capabilities. Walking home, a familiar flower sparked an idea, leading her to a flower shop. Surrounded by blossoms that evoked memories of her homeland, she chose a hibiscus. Back home, Saeng and her mother planted it, a symbol of resilience after Saeng learned the flower could withstand the winter. As she gazed upwards, watching birds soar, Saeng understood she too had adapted to life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus, a vibrant reminder of her roots and strength, instilled in her the courage and hope needed to face the driving test again and to thrive in her new environment, signifying her enduring spirit and ability to flourish.
1071	9936	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with the final paragraph to emphasize @CAPS1's deep passion. Saeng's consistent dedication suggests she cherishes this activity and will repeat it annually. Her profound love for plants is evident, along with her anticipation for the next opportunity. The concluding paragraph effectively conveys her commitment and highlights her appreciation for spring and the Hibiscus, solidifying the importance of these elements in her life.
1072	9937	4	2	"The author's concluding line draws a parallel between Saeng and the resilient hibiscus, suggesting that, like the flower adapting to a foreign environment, Saeng will persevere and integrate into her new country. This interpretation is reinforced earlier in the story when Saeng's mother observes the hibiscus, stating, ""It's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters"" (Ho). This quote establishes a clear symbolic link between the plant's struggle and Saeng's own challenges. The author highlights Saeng’s feelings of isolation and displacement, noting that ""not even her classmates or friends, or Mrs. Lambert"" (Ho) fully grasped her experience. Therefore, Saeng’s vow to retake the test signifies her commitment to overcoming adversity and cultivating inner strength, mirroring the winter hibiscus's ability to thrive despite the unfavorable conditions, revealing her determination to bloom where she is planted."
1073	9938	4	2	**Oral**  Basically, she figured time brings causes. Like, later on, things'll be different, so her performance might be too. I showed this by hinting she's starting to miss Vietnam, and memories shift over time. Time changes stuff, that's just how it is. I think I mostly got the overall point, though. Saeng said it 'cause time equals change. So, it all boils down to the fact that Saeng understood how time inevitably brings about transformation.
1074	9939	4	2	The author's concluding emphasis on the hibiscus underscores the plant's profound significance. Removed from her homeland, the author likely finds herself in an environment devoid of familiar comforts. Discovering the hibiscus in an unexpected locale, therefore, provides her with resilience and empowers her. It is plausible that facing a challenge in @MONTH1, the author draws strength from the plant's presence, bolstering her confidence and enabling her to overcome obstacles, highlighting the plant's powerful role as a symbol of hope and perseverance.
1075	9940	4	2	The story concludes with the hibiscus and the narrator's comparison of Saeng to returning geese, highlighting key parallels. Just as the geese return, Saeng is restarting, facing driving school again. The hibiscus, enduring through winter, symbolizes Saeng's resilience; it suggests that, with the arrival of spring, she will gather strength and retake the test, and that is the symbolic intention with which the narrator ends the story.
1076	9941	4	2	The author likely ended the story with a hint of renewed hope, perhaps envisioning future narratives stemming from this point. Personally, I interpret the ending as a symbolic promise of perseverance. The protagonist's intention to try again in the spring suggests a cyclical return, a chance for both her and her plant to experience a revitalizing fresh start. Ending the narrative on this hopeful note provides a satisfying sense of closure, while simultaneously leaving the door open for potential sequels or expansions of the storyline, concluding on a note of optimistic anticipation.
1077	9942	4	2	"The story's conclusion, with Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring, resonates deeply. The hibiscus serves as a potent symbol; its springtime budding mirrors Saeng's own anticipated growth and adaptation to her American environment. Just as the flower acclimates to the changing seasons, Saeng, too, is maturing and gaining wisdom, preparing her for a renewed attempt at the driving test. The narrative highlights her increasing comfort: ""she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quit repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This growing familiarity echoes the hibiscus's ease in its surroundings, solidifying the parallel between nature's rhythm and Saeng's personal journey, ultimately suggesting that she will be ready to pass the test when spring arrives."
1078	9943	4	2	The author @CAPS1 concludes the narrative with Saeng's declaration that When She @CAPS2 returns, @CAPS2, she will retake the test, implying that her entire experience was a trial of service. The story's beginning marks the start of this trial, and its end signifies both the test's conclusion and their departure. Saeng's desire to return reflects her curiosity about what will flourish in their absence. Furthermore, the author suggests a broader theme: an unawareness of one's own good fortune, leaving the reader to consider the value of what is often taken for granted.
1079	9944	4	2	"The ""Winter hibiscus,"" finally nestled in its earth home, received Saeng's firm attention as she tamped the soil. High above, a skein of Canada geese winged its way across the sky, their distant honking reaching Saeng—a definitive ""Yes""—confirming the rightness of the moment and her actions."
1080	9945	4	2	The inclusion of the paragraph highlights the challenges inherent in adapting to a new work environment and the potential impact on work ethic. The observation that even a senior figure seemingly lacked enthusiasm suggests a discouraging atmosphere for a newcomer. A lack of positive reinforcement can negatively affect a student's mental state and motivation. Consequently, the girl's discomfort and lack of zeal stem from the perception that her efforts might not be valued, ultimately impacting her engagement with the task at hand. This demonstrates how critical a supportive and appreciative work environment is, especially for those new to it.
1081	9946	4	2	"The author's concluding remarks underscore her resolute commitment to succeeding on the driving test, following a prior unsuccessful attempt. The internal vow, explicitly stated as ""she vowed silently to herself,"" serves as a potent indicator of her unwavering determination. Vows, by definition, signify a profound dedication to a specific objective. Consequently, the subsequent declarations articulated by the author should be interpreted as sincere expressions of her intent. In essence, the concluding sentence functions as a powerful affirmation of her devotion to achieving her stated goal, solidifying the reader's understanding of her unwavering resolve."
1082	9947	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" featuring Saeng's emotional release in the greenhouse, signifies a crucial turning point. This moment suggests Saeng is beginning to adapt to her new environment, moving away from nostalgic longing for her past. Her tears, shed within the greenhouse's nurturing atmosphere, represent a necessary catharsis, allowing her to process her emotions and ultimately embark on a new chapter in her life. The author uses this scene to demonstrate Saeng's readiness to embrace her future rather than remaining fixated on the past."
1083	9948	4	2	The final paragraph suggests the author wants us to understand the timing of Saeng's next attempt: with the changing seasons. Perhaps Saeng felt shame regarding her failure, hence the delay. To distract herself from the disappointing test, Saeng walked home, pausing at a flower shop. Seeking solace, she purchased a plant for @MONEY1. Initially, her mother displayed displeasure, but upon recognizing Saeng’s unhappiness, her demeanor softened. This act of kindness, buying the plant, and her mother's eventual understanding underscores Saeng's effort to cope and find comfort after her setback, ultimately showing resilience in the face of disappointment.
1084	9949	4	2	The author's concluding remarks suggest resilience in the face of adversity. Given the protagonist's recent relocation from Vietnam and her struggles adapting to American life, the ending implies a commitment to perseverance. I interpret the geese as a symbol of constant change and adaptation, mirroring the protagonist's own journey. Their arrival, in my view, signifies a renewed determination in her to pursue her driver's license, suggesting that she will continue to strive for her goals despite the challenges she faces. This indicates that she will not be deterred and that she will keep trying.
1085	9950	4	2	The story concludes with that specific paragraph because it signifies a renewed sense of purpose for the author. After facing some kind of setback, she now possesses a tangible goal to strive towards. Alternatively, the author might have chosen that ending to emphasize the extended waiting period before she can attempt something again. We can also infer that the waiting period could also mean that Saeng wanted to wait and see her plant grow big and strong. These possibilities explain the author's decision to conclude the narrative with that particular paragraph. This leaves the reader with a feeling of hopeful anticipation for the future and a more personal understanding of the character.
1086	9951	4	2	"Saeng's quiet persistence in spring leads to a positive resolution. This ""good ending"" stems from the narrative's emphasis on resilience and renewal, particularly the re-emergence of a ""malance"" ready to flourish again. The story highlights the beauty and restorative power of springtime, symbolizing a fresh start. While Saeng faces near-failure and the need to ""take the test again,"" the successful conclusion is attributed to strong leadership focused on machines and growth. The story concludes with a sense of stability and endurance, solidifying the ""good ending"" because the plant stays, representing the enduring legacy of Saeng's efforts and the strong leadership, ultimately justifying the positive resolution."
1087	9952	4	2	The story concludes with the hibiscus, a potent symbol for Saeng. It represents her own resilience and offers her solace. The hibiscus's ability to endure the harsh winter months provides her with a deep sense of hope and the conviction that she too can overcome challenges. Saeng plans to retake her driver's test when the hibiscus buds emerge, a time that evokes memories of her homeland and provides comfort. Even if she doesn't pass the test, the blooming hibiscus will bring her joy. The author's choice to end here emphasizes the parallel journeys of Saeng and the plant; both face hurdles – the hibiscus, the winter, and Saeng, her driving test. Ultimately, the hibiscus embodies Saeng's spirit; its survival signifies her own endurance, signaling the continuation of life's journey and her ability to persevere.
1088	9953	4	2	"The author's concluding line, ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,"" encapsulates the story's central theme: adapting to life's changes. Saeng's decision to retake the test underscores her commitment to embracing her new circumstances. The hibiscus serves as a potent symbol, facilitating her adjustment. As an example, ""The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair,"" highlighting its connection to cherished memories of home. Ultimately, the hibiscus inspires her to accept her altered reality and persevere, striving for improvement; she decides to try again, showing her acceptance of change."
1089	9954	4	2	"The author likely concludes the story as they do to highlight Saeng's sense of comfort. Having relocated from Vietnam, where winter hibiscus are common, Saeng associates them with familiarity. The story's ending, therefore, evokes a sense of home for Saeng, who feels more at ease during that season. The line, ""And beside it was yet another old friend,"" suggests that the plant serves as a comforting presence, reinforcing Saeng's connection to her past and contributing to her overall well-being, which explains the author's narrative choice."
1090	9955	4	2	"The story concludes with the phrase, ""Plant it right now!"" This resonates as a symbol of hope and renewal, mirroring the anticipated arrival of spring and its inherent beauty. ""Plant it right now"" suggests a desire for a second chance, a fresh start. The author envisions a future where, like the burgeoning spring flowers reaching their full potential, she too will have the opportunity to thrive and succeed, seizing her chance to excel; thus, the ending underscores the character's determination to learn from the past and embrace a brighter future."
1091	9956	4	2	"The story ends with a paragraph tinged with regret. The ""test"" she recounts centered on responsibly using their limited twenty dollars for a specific purchase. However, she admits to a significant misstep: impulsively spending a large portion of it on a plant, a nostalgic reminder of home. The final paragraph conveys her resolution. Should the opportunity to retake the ""test"" arise, she pledges to adhere to the original objective, suggesting a desire for redemption and a recognition of her earlier failing. This final sentiment underscores the theme of learning from mistakes and striving for responsible decision-making in the future."
1092	9957	4	2	"Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a paragraph that reinforces the theme of overcoming adversity. Saeng's initial despair after failing her driving test is palpable, creating a sense of hopelessness. However, the hibiscus plant serves as a potent symbol of resilience, reminding her of her Vietnamese heritage and instilling a renewed sense of determination. Furthermore, the mother's initial disapproval of the expensive plant quickly dissolves upon witnessing Saeng's happiness, demonstrating the power of perseverance to bridge divides. Finally, the act of planting the hibiscus, a challenging task in itself, directly inspires Saeng to retake the driving test, drawing a clear parallel between nurturing the plant and confronting personal challenges. Thus, the ending emphasizes Ho's central theme: obstacles, like the difficulty of cultivating a tropical plant in winter, can be overcome with perseverance and a connection to one's roots, ultimately leading to growth and success."
1093	9958	4	2	"The concluding paragraph underscores the theme of resolute determination. The hibiscus flower serves as a poignant reminder of the protagonist's past life, evoking a sense of nostalgia even as she acknowledges the void left by @CAPS1 in her present circumstances. This recollection fuels her resolve. The protagonist's eventual recognition of familiarity, symbolized by the V formation of geese, signals her acceptance of her new environment as ""home."" While cherishing her former life, she understands the necessity of moving forward. The final paragraph's reference to retaking a driving test transcends its literal meaning, instead representing the character's determination to fully embrace her new home and life, signifying a commitment to building a future in this new chapter."
1094	9959	4	2	She will retake the test. Her confidence stems from the hibiscus and snow. As the snow melts and the hibiscus buds bloom, she will grow again, much like the hibiscus. Ultimately, she expects to have enough confidence for the test, ensuring she is adequately prepared this time.
1095	9960	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves a dual purpose: to summarize the narrative's events and to offer potential interpretations. The final sentence suggests a parallel between the cyclical nature of spring, with its promise of renewal and burgeoning life after the thaw, and the protagonist's future. Just as plants emerge with renewed vigor, the protagonist, by the following academic term, will demonstrate newfound courage and retake the test, thus showcasing personal growth. This concluding comparison invites reflection on the story's themes and their resonance with both natural processes and individual development.
1096	9961	4	2	"In @CAPS1 Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph reveals Saeng's resolve: ""When they come back...then I will take that test again."" This passage draws a parallel between Saeng and the hibiscus, highlighting her resilience. Like the flower that perseveres through winter, Saeng demonstrates a similar strength, determined to retake the test. The hibiscus's spring budding becomes symbolic of Saeng's own renewal and hope, suggesting the act of taking the test again is not merely about passing, but also about finding solace and connection to her roots, solidifying her commitment to face future challenges."
1097	9962	4	2	"He concludes the paragraph with that specific phrasing to either entice the reader to continue or to highlight the parallel between the hibiscus and Saeng. The passage, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" illustrates the flower's resilience, its ability to endure winter and bloom anew.

The sight of geese flying overhead became another symbol, this time of change and the cyclical nature of life. She watched their V-formation, a promise of spring's new beginnings, the melting snows, and the return of familiar flora and fauna. For Saeng, the hibiscus in full bloom represented her own potential. Just as winter prepared the plant for its vibrant display, it was also a period of personal preparation. With the hibiscus thriving, she felt ready to face any challenge, drawing strength from the enduring connection to her roots, finding that when these familiar symbols flourished, so too would she.
1211	10076	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story concludes with Saeng's quiet resolution: ""when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending is significant because Saeng purchased the winter hibiscus after failing an important exam. The flower, therefore, became a symbol of her setback. Saeng's vow to retake the test when the hibiscus blooms represents her determination to overcome the challenge and try again. The blooming of the flower mirrors her hope for a fresh start, and her renewed effort in the spring signifies her resilience in the face of adversity. Therefore, the flower's budding symbolizes her academic rebirth."

The winter hibiscus itself embodies Saeng's journey, representing her Vietnamese origins and her arduous adaptation to life in America. The parallel between Saeng and the plant is evident: both face challenges to flourish in a foreign environment. Saeng's resolve to retake her driver's test upon the plant's springtime revival underscores this symbolic link, suggesting her own resurgence will mirror the plant's. Consequently, Ming-Fon Ho's deliberate choice to conclude the narrative with this powerful symbol emphasizes the interconnectedness of Saeng's personal growth and her ability to thrive in her new home, offering a hopeful vision for her future."

1215	10080	4	2	"The concluding paragraph serves to underscore Saeng's perceived failure, stemming from her acquisition of an artificial plant instead of a living one. This disappointment is evident in her direct statement, ""I failed,"" which reflects her assessment of the situation. Furthermore, the author highlights Saeng's sense of displacement through her comparative remarks, such as ""it's not like the one at home,"" revealing a longing for her previous environment. Consequently, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's feelings of inadequacy and her yearning for familiarity, solidifying the narrative's focus on her emotional state."
1216	10081	4	2	"Saeng, confined indoors during the snowy months, eagerly anticipated spring. ""When they comeback,"" she vowed, eyeing the dormant hibiscus, ""in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Her connection to the garden was profound; winter kept her from her sanctuary. The promise of spring held not just a renewed chance at the test, but also the joy of tending to her plants. Her passion for the botanical was evident in her later distress when a purchase at the florist went awry, underscoring the deep personal importance of these natural elements in her life, motivating her to eagerly await the gardening season once more."
1217	10082	4	2	"The mother's comment about the winter hibiscus, ""It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here... That's what matters,"" serves as a potent metaphor for Saeng. The hibiscus, though perhaps lacking conventional beauty, possesses the resilience to endure hardship, mirroring Saeng's own inner strength.

Just as the winter hibiscus perseveres through the harsh winter, Saeng, too, will demonstrate fortitude and emerge in the ""spring"" – a symbolic representation of a period of growth and renewal – with increased confidence and a blossoming spirit. The flower's eventual beauty and strength in spring further reinforces the idea that Saeng, like the hibiscus, holds the potential for future flourishing."
1218	10083	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph, which mentions Saeng's intention to retake her driving test, serves a crucial purpose: to underscore Saeng's determination to acclimate to her new life in the United States. Having recently emigrated from Vietnam with her mother, Saeng grapples with homesickness throughout the story, longing for her grandmother and the familiar hibiscus hedge of her past. ""Where was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?"" The discovery of a hibiscus at a local flower shop, a flower reminiscent of her homeland, provides a turning point. Observing its adaptation to the unfamiliar winter climate, Saeng, while planting the hibiscus in her backyard, resolves to conquer the driving test the following spring. This vow, emphasized in the final paragraph, highlights Saeng's commitment to integrating into her new environment, suggesting she aspires to navigate her life in the new @LOCATION3 with increasing independence and reduced longing for her former home.

Concluding the story with this image reveals Saeng's profound recognition of her inner strength, mirrored in the enduring symbol of the hibiscus.
1220	10085	4	2	"The author likely concluded the paragraph in that manner to impart a significant message to the reader. Specifically, the author aims to convey a sense of perseverance, illustrating that failure is not final. Despite not succeeding on this particular attempt, the character expresses a firm resolve to try again. This determination is directly supported by the author's inclusion of the quote: ""in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The cyclical imagery of nature's renewal – melting snow, returning geese, budding hibiscus – reinforces the character's commitment to future success, clarifying the hopeful intent behind the paragraph's conclusion."
1221	10086	4	2	The author incorporates the hibiscus story because its budding coincides with Saeng's initial driver's test failure, signifying a potential life transition.

Therefore, through these actions and reflections, the author makes it clear that Saeng is choosing to neither abandon her new home nor forget her old one, but rather to integrate both into her identity."
1224	10089	4	2	The story concludes with that particular paragraph because the author anticipates a similar experience in the coming year.

Thus, that final paragraph serves as a testament to the enduring value of their shared experiences.
1225	10090	4	2	"The hibiscus at the story's close offers solace to Saeng. Having just failed her driving test in a new place, @LOCATION1, and longing for her Vietnamese home, Saeng finds herself disheartened. The flower evokes memories of her grandmother. The text depicts her closing her eyes, deeply inhaling the fragrance, which then conjures images of ""combing her grandmother's long grey hair, freshly washed."" This sensory experience provides comfort in a moment of profound disappointment. The absence of her grandmother is palpable, making the flower's presence all the more significant, as it effectively fills a void. Despite her setback, Saeng recognizes the flower's beauty, describing it as ""exquisite."" Furthermore, the simple act of uttering the @CAPS1 words ""dokor malik,"" meaning hibiscus, allows her to relish the sound and feel of her native language.

This adaptability becomes a metaphor for Saeng's own journey. Despite failing her license test, she resolves to emulate the hibiscus. Just as the plant perseveres through winter to bloom in spring, Saeng plans to use the time to study and prepare, ensuring her success on the next attempt.

This leads her to purchase the plant, initially facing her mother's disapproval before receiving gratitude. As Saeng plants the hibiscus, the familiar sound of Canada geese underscores her gradual acclimation to @LOCATION1.

The familiar fragrance evokes vivid memories, as ""the familiar frogrence filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmothers long gray hair."" This suggests a deep longing for her roots, which she carries within her. The hibiscus, described as ""yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers,"" emphasizes her connection to nature and its comforting qualities. After failing a test, Saeng buys a hibiscus, nicknamed ""Malik,"" for comfort. Planting it with Malik in their garden provides her with renewed confidence to try again, ultimately demonstrating the flower's significant positive influence."
1229	10094	4	2	"The author draws a parallel between a specific paragraph and the broader experience of school, focusing on the challenges of socialization and academic performance. The act of ""making new friends"" and ""doing good on tests and classes"" is presented as analogous to the paragraph's content. The repetition implied by the phrase ""Then I will take that test again"" within the paragraph is the key element driving this comparison; it suggests a recurring cycle of evaluation and potential improvement, mirroring the ongoing nature of schooling. Ultimately, this cyclical nature of testing and retesting, both in the paragraph and in the school environment, highlights a continuous process of learning and adaptation."

1241	10106	4	2	The author likely conveyed this sentiment to express a personal experience of transformation. Winter, in this interpretation, serves as a period of authentic self-expression, possibly a time of introspection and uninhibited behavior.

Much like the cyclical return of the geese and the hibiscus's transformation into a blossoming flower, Saeng demonstrates a commitment to personal growth and adaptation. This resolution assures the reader that Saeng will persevere and evolve within her new environment, mirroring the plant life and the geese. Ultimately, it encapsulates Saeng's aspirations for the future as she navigates the complexities of assimilation."
1244	10109	4	2	The author might have chosen to conclude the story with that particular paragraph for several reasons. It's plausible the author aimed to offer a compelling detail about the hibiscus's response to snowfall.

Perhaps the author concluded that by illustrating how the snowy conditions initiate the cycle anew, they could effectively conclude the story, leaving the reader with a sense of cyclical completion and the enduring nature of life, even in the face of harsh conditions.

The final paragraph emphasizes this intention: ""when they come back,"" referring to the returning geese and the cyclical nature of the seasons, ""Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" The narrative deliberately omits the test's nature, focusing instead on Saeng's determination and the symbolic rebirth associated with springtime, suggesting her renewed commitment to succeeding whenever the opportunity arises again."

This peculiar connection allows her to relax, finding solace in the season's inherent dangers. Spring's aesthetic appeal is undeniable, a vibrant tapestry woven with blossoming flowers. Among these, a particular species serves as a potent reminder of the blessings she associates with home. The confluence of risk, beauty, and nostalgic reminders ultimately creates a tranquil and deeply personal experience for the author in springtime.

This ending underscores the transformation of past memories into a source of hope and determination for Saeng. Overwhelmed by memories of her homeland and grandmother after failing her test, Saeng purchases a hibiscus, a tangible link to her past. Planting it in her new vegetable garden and witnessing the return of Canada geese inspires her. By integrating her cherished memories with her present reality, Saeng finds the resolve to persevere, with the story's final lines solidifying the idea that Saeng's experience in her new home will be one of continued effort and resilience."
1257	10122	4	2	"The author concludes with the anecdote of the geese and hibiscus to illustrate Saeng's readiness to embrace her changed circumstances.

1259	10124	4	2	Defeated, I confessed to my mother that I had failed the exam. Winter's chill still clung to the air, a stark contrast to the vibrant blooms I longed to see. Our hibiscus, usually so full of life, was struggling, attempting to recover its delicate petals. I declared that I wouldn't retake the test, not until the hibiscus showed signs of renewal, until spring returned to breathe life back into everything, signifying a fresh start and new possibilities. The exam would wait, I decided, until nature herself signaled it was time for growth again, mirroring my own readiness to try once more.
1260	10125	4	2	This feels like the end. After everything in the story, all the gardening lessons learned from her mother, the hibiscus saying stuck with her. The final sentence, that’s her thinking about springtime and the test. It's a test of everything she absorbed from her mother during their time together. When spring arrives, she'll face that test again, ready to show how much she’s learned and grown alongside her mother’s garden. It's a fitting conclusion because it shows her readiness to apply her knowledge practically.
1261	10126	4	2	The story concludes with the author implying a significant event coincided with the geese's migration or the blooming of flowers. It seems the author's grandmother passed away around the same time these natural occurrences took place, suggesting a connection between her death and the cyclical rhythm of nature. Therefore, the concluding paragraph likely links the grandmother's passing to either the commencement of the flower bloom or the time when the geese were flying.
1262	10127	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a paragraph designed to suggest the protagonist's eventual acceptance of her new life, even while cherishing memories of her homeland. Initially, Saeng struggles with displacement, unable to even voice the word ""home"" without succumbing to grief. The winter hibiscus, a tangible link to her past, initially intensifies her longing. The flower's scent evokes vivid memories of her grandmother, providing a comforting yet poignant connection to her former life: ""Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto."" This physical connection marks the first step in her journey towards acclimation. Progressively, Saeng begins to find familiarity in her new surroundings: ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now."" The period between fall and spring, mirroring the hibiscus's dormancy, represents a period of adjustment. The implication is that, by undertaking the test, Saeng actively participates in integrating into her new society. Ultimately, the author uses the final paragraph to imply that Saeng will take definitive steps toward embracing her new country and moving forward, symbolized by taking the test, all while keeping the memories of her old country alive through the enduring symbol of the winter hibiscus."
1263	10128	4	2	This paragraph is crucial because the story opens with the girl's academic setback—failing a test and witnessing her mother's disappointment. Later, the act of replanting symbolizes a fresh start, motivating the girl to retake the test, hoping to earn her mother's approval. Removing this paragraph would leave readers questioning the mother's reaction to the initial failure. It creates anticipation: readers naturally wonder if the girl will attempt the test again and, crucially, what motivates this decision, making the paragraph essential for a complete narrative arc centered on redemption and familial relationships. Ultimately, its inclusion ensures a satisfying resolution, showing the character's growth and addressing the initial conflict.
1264	10129	4	2	The author's decision to conclude the story with an unresolved ending appears to be a calculated strategy to cultivate reader engagement and stimulate interest in their broader body of work. This open-ended approach, while potentially frustrating for some, effectively leaves narrative threads dangling, incentivizing readers to seek resolution in subsequent publications. Furthermore, the inconclusive finale provides a foundation for future development, affording the author opportunities to refine existing plotlines and expand the story's universe in a potential sequel; however, it remains to be seen if this tactic truly enhances the overall literary value or merely serves as a marketing ploy.
1265	10130	4	2	"The story's concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's resilience despite her initial failure. Her mother's dismay at the expensive plant, ""But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much!,"" clearly marks Saeng's misstep. Crushed by this realization, Saeng understands she has not met her mother's expectations. However, the narrative doesn't end with defeat. The image of Saeng planting the winter hibiscus, ""Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the ìwinter hibiscusî into it,"" illustrates her determination. Even though she failed the immediate test, Saeng's act of planting suggests a deeper commitment; she isn't abandoning the hibiscus, a symbol perhaps of her cherished home, indicating that she is resolved to keep trying to fulfill her mother’s task, showing her persistence and unwavering spirit."
1266	10131	4	2	The author concludes with the final paragraph to provide closure. This concluding section serves the purpose of summarizing key points and reinforcing the central argument presented throughout the piece. It offers a final perspective on the topic, drawing together the various strands of thought explored in the preceding sections. The concluding paragraph does not introduce new information; instead, it consolidates existing ideas to leave a lasting impression on the reader. It ultimately aims to solidify the author's stance and ensure that the main idea is clearly understood and remembered, providing a sense of completeness to the overall work.
1267	10132	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng’s nascent adaptation to her new homeland. Initially, Saeng experiences acute homesickness, a sentiment exacerbated by failing her driver's test. The hibiscus she observes in a flower shop becomes a poignant symbol. For Saeng, the hibiscus embodies comfort amidst disappointment, a tangible link to her Vietnamese past, and the resilience needed to surmount obstacles. Her initial maladjustment profoundly impacts her well-being. The author's choice of this concluding paragraph emphasizes the inevitability of change and challenges in life, suggesting that solace and strength can be found in unexpected places or individuals. Saeng, in essence, mirrors the hibiscus; it represents her capacity for resilience. Ultimately, the author implies that Saeng will be prepared to retake her driving test once she has fully adjusted, signifying her successful adaptation.
1268	10133	4	2	The concluding paragraph suggests the author's belief in renewal and perseverance. The budding hibiscus symbolizes a fresh start after winter and spring, indicating a willingness to try again. Specifically, the author implies Saeng anticipates spring, eager to cultivate her own garden, highlighting her hopeful outlook and determination. This anticipation encapsulates the author's purpose in ending the story with this image.
1269	10134	4	2	"Saeng envisioned the coming year as a chrysalis. She would spend the time transforming, rebuilding herself into someone ready to conquer the retake exam, a complete rebirth. Her mother, however, seemed perpetually displeased, scrutinizing every decision, every step of the way. Then, a sudden understanding bloomed: the hibiscus. Its wilting, its apparent death, wasn't an end, but a phase—""... thought the quiet repetition of season upon season."" Like the flower, like the migrating geese, Saeng saw her own cyclical journey. A period of dormancy, of perceived failure, followed by a vibrant resurgence. She would wither, yes, but only to bloom again, stronger and wiser, a brand new Saeng ready to face her challenge, her transformation ultimately providing her with the strength she would require."
1270	10135	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng's return from a failed driver's test, where the sight of a vibrant winter hibiscus captivated her. Despite its high cost, she purchased the flower. Her mother, upon discovering the expense, was understandably angry, questioning Saeng's judgment. Saeng, however, remained resolute in her decision to keep the hibiscus, perhaps drawn to it as a reminder of Vietnam. The author includes this final paragraph, I believe, to symbolize a parallel between the returning geese, the blooming hibiscus, and Saeng's own journey. The flower, initially barren when purchased, now flourishes, suggesting a renewed sense of hope. Just as the hibiscus bloomed in time, Saeng, I infer, will revisit the driver's test, armed with patience and the understanding that growth, like the flower's blossoming, requires time. This ending offers a hopeful resolution, implying that perseverance and the beauty found in embracing one's heritage can lead to eventual success.
1271	10136	4	2	"Saeng's story concludes with a silent vow, a promise made to herself: ""when they come back..."" This ending provides closure, suggesting a future attempt at her driver's test after acclimating to her new life abroad. Her detachment from Vietnam contributes to her sense of isolation, but the hibiscus offers initial solace. ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel,"" illustrating her longing for familiarity. The final paragraph implies a growing comfort in @LOCATION2, extending beyond a simple plant and a few geese, and hinting at a future where she will find her place and feel at home, ready to tackle new challenges, including that driver's test."
1272	10137	4	2	The story concludes with the thaw and the geese's return, signaling a period of intense gardening activity. The snow's departure means planting can begin, and the geese mark the optimal time for sowing seeds, promising a bountiful harvest. The upcoming season represents a personal challenge: to surpass the yields of previous years, striving for an even more impressive garden. The author's ultimate test is to achieve a higher grade, a metaphorical measure of success, compared to previous gardening attempts, making the return of spring a moment of both anticipation and determined ambition.
1273	10138	4	2	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because, in their estimation, it represented the most fitting resolution. Therefore, the chosen ending reflects the author's deliberate intention to conclude the narrative in that particular manner.
1274	10139	4	2	Saeng's story concludes with a promise: to retake the test in the spring. This seemingly simple act reveals a profound adaptation to her new American life. In Vietnam, the hibiscus held deep meaning. It adorned her grandmother's hair, a shared tradition of comfort and love. Even drawing water from the well sometimes brought a hibiscus blossom, linking it to the familiar rhythms of her homeland. Now, in a new country, Saeng seeks that same comfort. She observes the cyclical return of geese in spring, mirroring the season's promise of renewal, much like the budding hibiscus in her garden. The test, then, becomes a symbol of this rebirth. Just as the potted hibiscus represents a blend of old traditions and new beginnings, Saeng's decision to retake the test signifies her willingness to embrace change while holding onto cherished memories, demonstrating her resilient spirit as she blossoms in her new environment.
1275	10140	4	2	The author included the specified sentence to furnish the protagonist with adequate time to successfully complete the examination. A secondary motivation, potentially influencing this narrative decision, is the author's affinity for geese. Therefore, the sentence serves a dual purpose within the story's framework.
1276	10141	4	2	"In the story's final moments, Saeng's resolve and newfound strength are palpable. The plant acts as a catalyst, a tangible symbol urging her to persevere and succeed in her test. More than just flora, it evolves into a comforting object, a constant reminder of the homeland she left behind. Her return, plant in hand, was meant to be a reunion, a shared moment with her mother. Yet, the words ""at home"" catch in her throat, a testament to the depth of her longing. Despite this profound homesickness, Saeng experiences a pivotal realization. This new land is gradually transforming into her home, each day bringing increased familiarity. The plant, therefore, represents not just the past, but the blossoming of her future in a new environment, solidifying her acceptance and growth."
1277	10142	4	2	The concluding sentence resonates with rebirth. Winter, a metaphorical killer of her past, has faded. Spring, potent with fresh starts, mirrors Saeng's emotional state. Leaving her homeland felt like the displaced winter hibiscus, but the approaching spring promises renewal. “Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,” Saeng finds solace. This cyclical change fuels her resolve; the turning seasons assure her that she can face challenges, motivating her to retake the driver's test, embodying a confident embrace of her new life.
1278	10143	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves multiple crucial functions. Primarily, it acknowledges the author's present setback while simultaneously implying future chances for success. Furthermore, it underscores a sense of hope, suggesting that even amidst current adversity, positive developments remain a possibility. In essence, the author employs this paragraph as a potent and economical means of concluding the narrative, leaving the reader with a sense of both closure and anticipation.
1279	10144	4	2	The author employs symbolism, specifically the hibiscus, to enrich the narrative. Saeng's declaration that she will retake the test in the spring, coinciding with the melting snow, the return of the geese, and the budding of the hibiscus, is significant. The hibiscus, in this context, symbolizes Saeng's maturation; just as the flower blossoms over time, so too will Saeng develop the readiness to face the challenge again, allowing the symbolism to convey more depth to Saeng's journey and her eventual preparedness.

1281	10147	4	2	"The concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's deep connection to planting, a central theme in her life. Her existence is interwoven with the cycle of seasons and cultivation. Saeng and her mother depend on their garden for sustenance, dedicating their days to growing crops for both consumption and trade. These efforts allow them to prepare for winter and acquire essential tools. The mention of ""when they come back"" refers to the geese, whose presence Saeng cherishes, especially on pleasant days. As the snow recedes, she eagerly anticipates returning to the soil, feeling the earth beneath her hands as she begins planting anew. The budding of the hibiscus serves as a signal for the flourishing of all other plants. Ultimately, Saeng's life revolves around continuous planting, and the author includes this concluding paragraph to underscore her profound longing to immerse herself once more in this essential aspect of her being, completing the narrative arc by highlighting her devotion."

It is a testament to the author's storytelling prowess that the conclusion leaves such a lasting and thought-provoking impression.
1308	10175	4	2	Basically, the author's drawing from some personal stuff, probably a tough time they're going through.

Moreover, she possesses the inner conviction that her readiness will coincide with the blossoming of her flower, a symbol of her own personal growth and capabilities.
1310	10177	4	2	"I'll provide examples for ""narrative"" and ""objective.""  **Understanding the Prompt:**  The core of the question is: *Why did the author end the story with a specific paragraph that hints at a sequel?* The possible answers revolve around leaving the door open for future storytelling.  **Narrative Rewrite:**  As winter's grip tightened, a silent vow hung in the air, unspoken yet palpable. He would pen their tale, a saga woven from the threads of spring's return. The promise resonated, a seed planted in the frozen earth, awaiting the thaw. The story, dormant for now, would blossom anew with the returning birds, a testament to the enduring power of hope and the cyclical nature of life, ensuring their adventures would continue.  **Objective Rewrite:**  The concluding paragraph serves as a narrative device to establish potential for future installments. The character's vow to write the story in the spring introduces a temporal delay and suggests a continuation of the narrative arc. This open-ended conclusion strategically positions the author to revisit the characters and setting, capitalizing on established reader engagement and facilitating subsequent publications, should the author choose to expand the storyline."
1311	10178	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves as the author's assertion that if natural, cyclical events can overcome adversity, then she too should be capable of conquering the test. This is achieved by juxtaposing unrelated phenomena, such as the spring thaw and the return of geese with the budding of a hibiscus, framing these as conditions for her retaking the examination. The author suggests that if the things she cherishes can surmount challenges, she should confront the test again, despite the pain it inflicted. Implicit in this is a question of repeated attempts; she doesn't know if persistence will ultimately lead to success. Her struggle to assimilate, rooted in her foreign knowledge, is highlighted, but the author implies that increased effort could bridge the gap. The conclusion, therefore, acts as a conditional statement of self-belief, hinging on the possibility of overcoming perceived obstacles through dedicated effort and perseverance, even if success is not guaranteed.
1312	10179	4	2	The author likely ends the story with the protagonist's tearful confession of failing the test because the situation was more complex than a simple academic setback. While the immediate trigger was the test, the crying hinted at a deeper, underlying issue: homesickness. Perhaps the protagonist, struggling to adapt to a new environment away from her family, found it difficult to focus on her studies. The failed test then became a convenient, acceptable outlet for her emotions, allowing her to express her distress without directly admitting to missing home, a vulnerability she might have been hesitant to reveal to her mother. Therefore, the concluding paragraph serves as a poignant revelation of the protagonist's hidden struggle, illustrating the emotional toll of being away from home and the indirect ways in which that pain can manifest.
1313	10180	4	2	Saeng, chilled but resolute, made a silent promise. Spring, with its melting snows, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, would mark her return to that test. The story concludes as her mother, seemingly immune to the biting cold, continued working in the vegetable garden, her rusty trowel unearthing the last of the onions, a testament to enduring spirit.
1314	10181	4	2	The hibiscus serves as a potent symbol in the story, offering Saeng a unique solace unmatched by human interaction.

More importantly, I realized that a single failure didn't define me. Life offers second chances, new beginnings. I decided not to dwell on the setback. Instead, I'd use the time to prepare, to adapt. The hibiscus in my garden, usually a reliable source of blooms, was still just showing buds. When those flowers finally burst open, a signal of nature's enduring cycle, I'd sign up for the test again, ready to face it with renewed perspective and a quiet confidence born from understanding that setbacks are temporary and that time keeps moving forward, and eventually, I will retake it.
1367	10234	4	2	Defeated, the author reflects on her experience. She acknowledges the weight of the test, the pressure that caused her to falter. But the story doesn't end there. A sense of hope emerges as she looks forward to the future, symbolized by the changing seasons. The author envisions spring, a time of renewal and rebirth. She pictures the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus, all representing a fresh start. It is in this season of promise that she intends to face the challenge again. The author vows to retake the test when spring arrives, the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, resolved not to succumb to pressure and give up like before.
1368	10235	4	2	"The concluding paragraph encapsulates the character's essence. Her willingness to ""take that test again"" reveals her dedication and enjoyment of the challenge. Furthermore, the phrase ""in spring; when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is' budding"" serves as a poignant reminder. It signifies a cyclical return and an invitation to remember the listed elements, solidifying the author's purpose in ending the story with this particular sentiment."
1369	10236	4	2	Saeng's story epitomizes perseverance. She possessed unwavering faith in her ability to pass her driver's test, and the initial failure, though disheartening, didn't break her spirit. She found solace in the hibiscus, a flower deeply connected to her homeland, its beauty a stark contrast to the ugliness she felt during this difficult period. Adapting to a new country in a short time is challenging; even small setbacks can feel monumental, triggering a sense of helplessness and isolation, much like the solitary hibiscus beside the highway in the photograph she saw. For Saeng, this flower became more than just a plant. It was a symbol of herself, weathering the storm. Inspired, Saeng resolved to retake the test when her own hibiscus bloomed again in the spring, her determination mirroring the flower's resilience and hopeful promise of renewal. In essence, the hibiscus became a vibrant reminder of her own inner strength and her unwavering commitment to achieving her goals.
1370	10237	4	2	Saeng's disappointment after failing her driving test was palpable. Seeking solace, she bought a plant, finding a connection to the natural world. The departure of the geese and the absence of hibiscus buds had seemingly become intertwined with her perception of the test. Now, the anticipated return of the geese and the budding hibiscus offered a sense of reassurance. The author concludes the story with this cyclical return to nature because it signifies Saeng's shifting emotional state. Her initial disappointment fades as she realizes the rhythm of nature mirrors the opportunity for a future attempt. The geese's return and the hibiscus's budding become symbolic of a renewed chance, instilling in Saeng the confidence needed to succeed in the following year's driving test, comforted by the predictable and reassuring cycle of the natural world.
1371	10238	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves as a potent tool for authors, prompting readers to engage in sustained reflection beyond the narrative's immediate confines. It provides a lingering point of consideration, allowing the reader to extrapolate meaning and contemplate potential future developments. For instance, ending with the assertion that the protagonist intends to resume planting after winter's cessation signals a cyclical continuation of growth and perseverance, inviting contemplation on themes of resilience and the enduring power of hope.
1372	10239	4	2	"Minfong Ho's choice to conclude ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's flower purchase is telling. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with her new environment, a struggle exemplified when she's too emotional to even speak about the flower at home. This winter hibiscus, a vibrant reminder of her Laotian home, represents a desperate grasp for security amidst unsettling change. The author, I believe, ends here to highlight Saeng's budding resilience. The flower isn't just a pretty object; it's a symbol of her growing ability to self-soothe and find comfort in the familiar. The final paragraph promises a future where Saeng, armed with the memory of this difficult year and her symbolic flower, will face future challenges like tests with newfound confidence and a stronger sense of self, suggesting a hopeful trajectory of adaptation."
1373	10240	4	2	The author ends with Saeng, resolute. This final scene isn't just about her; it's a message. It's a story meant to inspire persistence in the reader. Even when faced with overwhelming obstacles, the narrative suggests, one must continue striving. The path might require pauses for reflection, perhaps a strategic retreat for further learning or a revised approach. But the core message is clear: do not surrender the pursuit of your goals, because the journey, with all its trials, is worth undertaking.
1374	10241	4	2	"Upon their return, Saeng Voed silently vowed to herself, her thoughts mirroring the cyclical renewal of spring: the melting snow, the returning geese, the budding hibiscus. ""Then,"" she resolved, ""I will retake that test."" The author included this passage to illustrate Saeng Voed's determination and long-term commitment to improving her academic performance, suggesting a dedicated approach to her studies and a willingness to persevere until she achieved her desired outcome. The author's intention is to display that the character intended to work towards her goal."
1375	10242	4	2	**Oral:**  Basically, he finishes the paragraph like that 'cause he'd rather retake the test when the weather's nicer. So, yeah, that's why I reckon the author wraps it up with that line. He's just saying he'd prefer a sunny day for test-taking, which pretty much sums up why the author ends the paragraph that way, showing his preference for a better testing environment.
1376	10243	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding line—""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again""—serves as a crucial element, injecting hope into an otherwise melancholic narrative. This optimistic note sharply contrasts with Saeng's pervasive sorrow stemming from her abrupt displacement and the loss of her childhood and grandmother. As Saeng poignantly recounts, ""A blink, a channed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone,"" highlighting the profound sense of loss that permeates her experiences. The story further emphasizes Saeng's emotional distress through her frequent tears, particularly when she reminisces about her grandmother in the greenhouse, recalling intimate moments like, ""Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s grey hair Saeng would help knot the hair the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it."" Her emotional state is similarly evident in the garden while conversing with her mother and planting the flower. Therefore, the addition of this hopeful ending effectively counterbalances the prevailing sadness, offering a glimpse of a brighter future and providing the story with a sense of resolution and renewed determination, ultimately suggesting that Saeng's future holds promise despite her past trauma."
1377	10244	4	2	Spring's cloning felt like her last chance. Another failed test meant facing her mother's disappointment, a consequence she dreaded; it could irrevocably damage their already fragile bond, perhaps even severing ties. Her mother believed these failures stemmed from an inability to separate past experiences and emotions for her new homeland. She couldn't see her daughter's struggles to adapt, to overcome the obstacles in her path. Instead, her mother saw a lack of effort. Spring, on the other hand, found solace in memories of home, a comfort that seemed to hinder her progress in the present, leaving her feeling trapped between worlds, her future uncertain and overshadowed by the weight of expectation and the bittersweet pull of nostalgia.
1378	10245	4	2	Concluding the story with that particular quote primarily serves to underscore the protagonist's enduring hope. Hope, as a character trait, is vital in narrative, fostering reader engagement and contributing a positive moral dimension to the story's overall message. Therefore, the author's choice to end with that quote is driven by its capacity to highlight the girl's hopefulness, thus enhancing the story's impact and resonance.
1379	10246	4	2	"The author crafted the final paragraph to provide a powerful conclusion, emphasizing perseverance. Saeng's initial statement, ""I failed the test,"" is directly countered by her renewed determination: ""I will take the test again."" This decision to not give up is crucial for the story's resolution, mirroring the resilience found in @LOCATION1. This last paragraph provides a sense of completion, highlighting Saeng's resolve and underscoring the importance of continuous effort in achieving one's goals, thus ensuring the narrative ends on a note of hope."
1380	10247	4	2	"The story concludes with Saeng's internal vow: ""when they come back...then I will take that test again."" This ending is crucial; it frames Saeng's future not with despair over her initial failure, but with resolve. The author carefully situates this decision within the cyclical renewal of nature – the return of geese, the melting snow, the budding hibiscus. These images suggest a fresh start, mirroring Saeng's own intention to rise again. Her silent ""wow"" isn't just admiration for nature's beauty, but a quiet promise to herself. Thus, the author uses this concluding scene to emphasize Saeng's unwavering determination to conquer her past failure and approach the test again with renewed vigor, ensuring the story ends on a note of hopeful anticipation for her future success."
1381	10248	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves a dual purpose: it extends the narrative and provides a satisfying resolution. However, the specific significance of this ending remains unclear. A more explicit explanation from the author would enhance the reader's understanding and appreciation of the intended meaning, as interpretation should ideally originate from the creator's intent.
1382	10249	4	2	Saeng held a deep connection with the plant, a living piece of her homeland. Its eventual bloom served as a personal milestone; she vowed to retake her driver's test upon witnessing it. More than just flora, the plant reminded Saeng of her origins. Through hardships, this botanical link to her past became a source of confidence, ultimately giving her the resolve to keep moving forward.
1383	10250	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph likely aims to evoke a sense of wonder. The ambiguity surrounding the word ""test"" is key to this interpretation. ""Test"" could represent the protagonist's struggle to surmount her sorrowful circumstances. Alternatively, it might signify the challenges she will face adapting to her new environment when spring arrives. This deliberate ambiguity, inherent in the multiple possible interpretations of ""test,"" suggests the author intended to leave the reader with a feeling of open-ended contemplation, thus creating a sense of wonder about what awaits the character."
1384	10251	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng faces the challenge of adapting to a new environment. Struggling at school, she finds a connection to her homeland in an unexpected place. One day, walking home, Saeng spots flowers native to where she grew up. ""Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost painful."" Among them, the hibiscus, a symbol of her past, offers solace. Her mother observes that while the winter hibiscus may not be as beautiful as it once was, ""It’s flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough. That’s what matters."" This realization inspires Saeng. Like the resilient winter hibiscus, Saeng resolves to persevere. She decides to embrace the challenge, to adapt and thrive, as she declares, ""when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test."" The geese's return symbolizes hope and a new beginning, mirroring Saeng's commitment to overcome her difficulties and succeed."
1385	10252	4	2	The test lay before her, a stark white expanse filled with daunting questions. But outside the window, a riot of color beckoned: vibrant blooms swaying gently in the breeze. She confessed her disinterest later, explaining, almost apologetically, that her attention had been thoroughly captivated by the flowers. Their allure, their delicate beauty, had proven a far more compelling subject than any academic query. Ultimately, her fascination with the natural world had overridden any concern for the impending examination, revealing a clear preference for floral appreciation over scholastic assessment.
1386	10253	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves a pivotal role by illustrating a transition from one phase to another. Initially, the protagonist experiences distress and longing for her familiar home. However, this is followed by a recognition of an emerging reality that necessitates acceptance. Consequently, the symbolic imagery of spring suggests a fresh start, mirroring the blossoming of a flower. Therefore, the author uses this paragraph to convey a sense of closure to the previous emotional state, while simultaneously foreshadowing a period of renewal and adaptation for the protagonist, ultimately suggesting a hopeful outlook for the future.
1387	10254	4	2	The author concludes the story with that specific paragraph to underscore the protagonist's deliberate approach to life. She prioritizes thoroughness and integrity over expediency, actively choosing to avoid shortcuts and instead committing to a path of careful consideration and conscientious action, ultimately highlighting her commitment to doing things the right way.
1388	10255	4	2	The Hibiscus holds profound significance for Saeng, a testament to her deep devotion to its beauty. Her appreciation is so immense that she anticipates the arrival of the following spring, eagerly awaiting the opportunity to once again behold its vibrant bloom. This highlights not only the flower's allure but also Saeng's unwavering commitment to cherishing its fleeting presence, making the anticipation of spring a symbol of her dedication and longing.
1389	10256	4	2	The author concludes the story with that specific paragraph to elucidate her internal reasoning behind taking the impending test. She is articulating her thought process and the underlying motivation for her actions. The paragraph serves as a prelude to the future, signifying that the subsequent year will be pivotal in determining whether her current environment genuinely resonates as a place of belonging and comfort, a true home.
1390	10257	4	2	Saeng's concluding vow to retake the test upon the spring's arrival—marked by melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus—underscores resilience, solace, and a link to her origins. Firstly, the passage exemplifies the ability to overcome obstacles. The cyclical imagery of nature, particularly the hibiscus awaiting its bloom, symbolizes the inevitable recurrence of challenges. The weather impeding the flower's blossoming serves as a metaphor for temporal delays and difficulties. Secondly, the vow illustrates finding comfort amidst disappointment. Saeng acknowledges the presence of future obstacles yet anticipates their arrival with the same assuredness she has with the hibiscus, revealing an acceptance that tempers potential disillusionment. Finally, the passage highlights Saeng's connection to past experiences. Her unfamiliar environment creates a sense of alienation, mirrored in the hibiscus's potential metaphorical representation of her own perceived eccentricity. The hibiscus, therefore, is a symbol of Saeng's adaptation and resilience, echoing her survival in a foreign land, as she, like the flower, perseveres. Thus, Saeng's promise encapsulates her determination, acceptance, and rooted identity, offering a powerful vision of future triumph based on her past.
1391	10258	4	2	"The concluding paragraph encapsulates Saeng's resolve amidst her new, disorienting reality. Freshly arrived, she's yet to find her footing, her initial disappointment palpable, likened to ""shaft of the war afternoon starlight,"" where ""war"" signifies her profound upset. The flower evokes a poignant longing for her homeland. However, a renewed sense of hope flickers within her. Though admitting she is not ready to be at home, she understands the need to adapt. The subsequent tears reveal the depth of her homesickness. The ""snows"" become a metaphor for her current hardships, but she holds onto the belief that she can surmount them, fueled by the anticipation of ""spring,"" symbolizing a hopeful new beginning, a time when she anticipates success. The author strategically positions this paragraph at the end, emphasizing her unwavering determination and the promise of a brighter future, concluding that hope will prevail."
1392	10259	4	2	"The author felt Saeng deserved a second chance after failing her test, recognizing her prior diligent efforts. Saeng's declaration, ""Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it,"" regarding a plant, sparked her mother's dismay. The expense, a considerable sum, was upsetting because Saeng had spent so much to recapture a sense of home she associated with her previous residence. However, witnessing Saeng's distress, her mother relented, offering a consoling ""It's a beautiful plant."" This change of heart reflects empathy for her daughter’s struggles. Ultimately, the author included this final passage to highlight the emotional toll of Saeng's experiences and her mother's eventual understanding, creating a poignant moment of reconciliation after hardship."
1393	10260	4	2	The concluding paragraph suggests Saeng's unwavering determination to succeed on the test. The author implies a relentless pursuit, continuing indefinitely, even until death. This interpretation draws directly from the events of the story. In essence, the author conveys Saeng's unyielding commitment.
1394	10261	4	2	Each spring, the snow recedes, the honking of returning geese fills the air, and a familiar sense of obligation settles upon her. The reappearance of the plant signifies a recurring responsibility, much like the looming pressure of a significant examination. The meticulous care the plant requires feels akin to the preparation demanded by a challenging test, suggesting a substantial and ongoing commitment, which makes the concluding sentence such an accurate way to sum up the annual event.
1395	10262	4	2	Gardening, particularly planting flowers, is @CAPS1's passion. This activity is crucial for her cognitive function and creative processes. Delaying action until her return will enhance her well-being and enable her to resume her work with renewed vigor, as gardening is so essential to her mental state and creative output.
1396	10263	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves multiple purposes. Primarily, it suggests a return to normalcy as the prerequisite for retaking the test. The implication is that only under ideal conditions can a true measure of ability be obtained. Furthermore, the narrative's closure hinges on this restoration; an altered state would preclude further commentary. Analogously, construction halts during adverse weather, resuming only when conditions improve. Therefore, the author deliberately ends the story with this paragraph, signifying a deferral pending the return of favorable circumstances, allowing for a proper resolution.
1397	10264	4	2	"Minfong Ho's conclusion to ""Winter Hibiscus"" underscores the theme of new beginnings. The mother's statement, ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty but it’s strong enough to make it through the winter. That’s what matters,"" reinforces this idea. This declaration functions as a metaphor, suggesting that while life in @LOCATION1 may lack the perceived beauty of their past, the family's resilience will ensure their survival. The mother's words alleviate her daughter's anxieties regarding their relocation. Furthermore, the burgeoning hibiscus serves as a potent symbol of rebirth, mirroring the cyclical nature of life, death, and renewal. The family's transformation from a @CAPS1 family to a @CAPS3 one represents a symbolic death of their former lives, yet their heritage persists. Ho's deliberate choice to conclude with a flower embodying both @CAPS1 and @CAPS3 attributes, like Saeng herself, emphasizes the enduring nature of identity amidst change, solidifying the theme of starting over while retaining one's cultural roots."
1398	10265	4	2	"Saeng's story concludes with a powerful testament to her resilience and her burgeoning adaptation to life in @LOCATION1. Despite the considerable challenges of navigating a new culture, Saeng refuses to succumb to despair. The final line, a promise to attempt the driving test again in the spring when ""the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,"" encapsulates her unwavering determination and optimism. Throughout the narrative, Saeng grapples with adapting while cherishing memories of her homeland, which offer a sense of comfort. This concluding sentence not only summarizes her emotional state but highlights her inner strength. Where others @CAPS1 might abandon their pursuit, Saeng perseveres. The story, though tinged with sadness, ultimately offers a hopeful resolution. The hibiscus, a symbol of Saeng's connection to her past, will flourish, and so too will Saeng. She commits to embracing her new life, and the plant will serve as both a reminder of Vietnam and a source of companionship during the winter months. The author's choice of conclusion is masterful, instilling a sense of hope, perseverance, and ultimate success. Consequently, the reader is left with a feeling of satisfaction and goodwill towards Saeng's journey, demonstrating her ability to adapt to change and find joy in her new life in @LOCATION1. This ending reinforces the idea that Saeng will integrate into her new environment and build a fulfilling existence."
1399	10266	4	2	"Defeated, she trudged homeward after failing her driving test, the weight of disappointment compounded by a deeper ache. Tears streamed down her face as she grappled with the loss of her true ""home,"" Vietnam, a place she could no longer return to. The emotional dam finally broke. Afterwards, she wandered into a small shop and impulsively bought a potted plant. This simple act, coupled with the raw emotional release, marked a turning point. Slowly, acceptance dawned: she no longer lived in Vietnam, and she had indeed failed her test. But with this realization came a new perspective. She simply had to learn to appreciate her present life. The road ahead might be challenging, but her time would come, and one day, she would be driving. The author concludes here because this moment encapsulates the protagonist's shift from despair to acceptance, recognizing that even amidst setbacks, there is hope for the future and the capacity to find contentment in the present."
1400	10267	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the story culminates with Saeng's silent vow to retake her driver's test. The sight of geese in a ""V"" formation and the winter hibiscus evoke a profound sense of longing for her native Vietnam. The author masterfully uses these images to suggest Saeng's gradual acclimation to her new environment. The hibiscus serves as a potent symbol, whispering assurances to Saeng that everything will be alright; it acknowledges her yearning for Vietnam while simultaneously validating her pursuit of a new life. Therefore, with a renewed sense of hope and determination, Saeng intends to face the driving test again in the spring, confident that she will finally succeed, embracing both her past and her future."
1401	10268	4	2	The paragraph's purpose is twofold: to evoke vivid imagery and to convey the author's emotional state. Through carefully chosen words, the author aims to paint a picture in the reader's mind, allowing them to visualize the story's setting and events. Simultaneously, the author uses the paragraph to express their own feelings, adding depth and emotional resonance to the narrative, ultimately enhancing the reader's understanding of the story.
1402	10269	4	2	In conclusion, the author includes the final paragraph to provide a glimpse into Saeng's future. Specifically, it reveals the timing of Saeng's next attempt at the test and foreshadows a reunion with the plant. This concluding paragraph serves to extend the narrative beyond the immediate events of the story, offering readers a sense of what lies ahead for the protagonist and, therefore, solidifying the story's resolution.
1403	10270	4	2	"Saeng's story concludes with a powerful image: her silent vow to retake the driving test when spring arrives, signaled by the melting snow, returning geese, and, most importantly, the budding hibiscus. This ending highlights a crucial comparison—Saeng's present anxiety versus her future hope, tied directly to the flower. The hibiscus serves as a potent symbol of home. When she clutches a petal, the narrative emphasizes, ""That, at least she could hold on to,"" revealing her deep longing and lack of confidence in this new place. The flower, therefore, is more than just a plant; it's a tangible piece of home, a source of needed confidence to navigate her unfamiliar surroundings and even pass the test. Saeng's feeling of displacement is palpable, and the hibiscus offers motivation, a connection to her past within her present reality. The scent, too, offers solace; ""that rich sweet scent- that was familiar too."" The author's choice to end with the image of the hibiscus budding underscores its vital role in Saeng's adaptation, emphasizing the contrast between her current struggles and the anticipated renewal of spring, when the flower's bloom will hopefully coincide with her renewed confidence and success. Thus, the plant's importance lies in its ability to provide Saeng with a sense of home and familiarity, ultimately aiding in her adjustment to a new environment."
1404	10271	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a powerful symbol of hope, tying Saeng's personal journey to the cyclical renewal of nature. Spring, traditionally a season of rebirth marked by blossoming trees and melting snow, mirrors Saeng's determination to start anew. Saeng's silent vow to ""try again in the springtime"" is directly linked to the winter hibiscus she purchases. This flower serves as both a reminder of her homeland and a signal for her own readiness to re-emerge. The hibiscus's blooming becomes a symbolic cue for Saeng to persevere. Her resolution, emphasized by the phrase ""that test again,"" reveals a newfound positive attitude, suggesting a willingness to confront challenges. Ultimately, Ho's ending underscores the promise of new beginnings and Saeng's commitment to embracing future opportunities, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism for her future."
1405	10272	4	2	"A profound sense of absence permeates her days. The @ORGANIZATION1's hopeful utterance, ""when they come back,"" echoes in her mind, a constant reminder of their absence. The cyclical rhythm of nature offers a bittersweet solace; ""the geese return & this hibiscus is budding,"" she observes, a poignant juxtaposition of renewal and longing. These natural occurrences highlight the void their absence has created, while simultaneously fueling anticipation for their eventual return. The blossoming hibiscus symbolizes her hope for a future where she can resume her life where it was interrupted, continuing her journey as evidenced in her resolute statement, ""Then I will take that test again,"" a testament to her unwavering determination to carry on where they left off, patiently awaiting their return and the resumption of shared experiences."
1406	10273	4	2	"I found ""I Think It Was a Good Enough"" by Minfong Ho to evoke a unique blend of emotions. The narrative fosters a sense of calm, punctuated by moments of both happiness and sadness. Happiness arises particularly when the characters discuss the plants and when the mother accepts the plants despite the daughter's academic setback, which initially suggests a possible reprimand. A feeling of empathy surfaces for the girl in light of her test failure, but the story maintains a calm atmosphere, highlighting her resilience and patient determination, ultimately allowing the reader to appreciate the story's subtle emotional complexity."
1407	10274	4	2	"The author ends her story with a reflective paragraph, revealing her intent to retake the test. This time, she is determined to succeed and avoid the disappointment she previously experienced. The specific timing of this retake is significant, indicated by the imagery of spring: ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" These details pinpoint the season of renewal and rebirth as the moment she will face the challenge again, hopeful for a different outcome, allowing her to move past her previous defeat and look toward a brighter future."
1408	10275	4	2	"Saeng made a silent vow, a promise to herself and in memory of her mother. She resolved to confess her academic failure. ""I failed the test,"" she'd say, bracing for her mother's initial disappointment, knowing a deeper conversation would follow. Her mother noticed the new plant Saeng held. Saeng explained she bought it with @MONEY1. The purchase was a solace, a small comfort against the sting of the failed test. Buying the plant made her feel a little better. The author likely ends here to suggest a glimmer of hope. Perhaps, buoyed by this small act of self-care, she will find the strength to persevere. The implicit encouragement in the phrase ""@CAPS1 then I will take that test again"" suggests a renewed determination, possibly inspired by the plant, and a commitment to try again."
1409	10276	4	2	The author ends the story with that paragraph to emphasize Saeng's renewed determination to pass her driver's license test. We see Saeng's initial disappointment after failing, a clear low point in her journey. However, the flower symbolizes a turning point. Discovering it sparks a feeling that motivates her to try again. Before, she was dejected by the failed test, but the flower's presence reignites her spirit. Therefore, the author concludes with this image to assure readers that Saeng will eventually succeed in obtaining her driver's license, leaving us with a sense of optimism about her future endeavors.
1410	10277	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding lines, where Saeng expresses her intention to retake the test ""when they come back in the spring… and this hibiscus is budding,"" offer a sense of hope that contrasts with the story’s overall melancholy tone. Earlier, Saeng struggles with adapting, revealing, ""It’s not a real one… not like the ones we had… at home,"" unable to voice her longing for Vietnam without succumbing to tears. The author's choice to end with Saeng's resolve suggests that despite her homesickness and the profound changes she has experienced, she remains determined to build a fulfilling life in the United States, showing that she will face the challenges ahead with renewed optimism."
1411	10278	4	2	The author concludes the story with Saeng anticipating the budding hibiscus to instill hope. Rather than leaving the reader with the bleak image of her watching geese fly away after failing her driving test, the author provides a sense of closure. Saeng's disappointment at failing evokes sadness in the reader, and the ending serves to alleviate this feeling. The budding hibiscus and returning geese remind Saeng of home, and more importantly, signal a renewed sense of confidence. By ending with this image, the author leaves the reader with a feeling of optimism for Saeng's future success.
1412	10279	4	2	Despite her profound longing for her homeland, its gardens, and the comforting presence of her grandparents, the author's resolve to thrive in @LOCATION1 remains unshaken. Moments like inhaling familiar floral scents in a flower shop, reminiscent of her grandmother's freshly washed, long gray hair, highlight her deep connection to her past. Ultimately, the author's declaration about retaking the test when the hibiscus blooms next winter underscores her enduring commitment to her future in @LOCATION1, indicating that nostalgia fuels, rather than hinders, her ambition.
1413	10280	4	2	"Saeng's disappointment was palpable. The hibiscus wasn't the same, not like the ones from home. ""It's-it's not a real one,"" she stammered, fear making her tremble, afraid of her mother's reaction. Her mother simply acknowledged, ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake."" The author highlights Saeng's resolve through her quiet vow: ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" This ending emphasizes Saeng's resilience, her determination to persevere despite setbacks, choosing to face the challenge again when spring returns."
1414	10281	4	2	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes as it does to emphasize Saeng's resilience. Having emigrated from Vietnam, Saeng faces considerable challenges adapting to her new environment, acutely missing her homeland and the vibrant flora that characterized her life there. The winter hibiscus, unlike its Vietnamese counterpart, symbolizes this displacement. Saeng's decision to plant the unfamiliar flower and postpone her driving test until spring reveals her strategy for coping with adversity. She metaphorically plants her difficulties, choosing to defer confronting them until a more favorable time. This act doesn't represent surrender, but rather a strategic pause, a postponement of challenges until a period of greater ease. The author ends the story here to underscore that although Saeng acknowledges her difficulties, she demonstrates her ability to delay, and ultimately face her challenges with renewed hope and determination in the future."
1415	10282	4	2	I believe the narrator uses that phrase as their final statement because she desires a similar experience next year. She wants to understand the feeling of deep affection for something and the responsibility of caring for it, even for a short period. This yearning to replicate the experience, to once again nurture and cherish something, explains the resonance of that closing phrase.
1416	10283	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph highlights Saeng's adjustment to life in America.

The author seems to imply its significance will become apparent with the changing seasons.

It is therefore likely the plant represents the author's optimistic perspective moving forward.

Their passion for their work is evident. The closing lines about springtime—the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus—highlight her eagerness to embrace the challenge of nurturing the garden again, demonstrating her commitment to its care. Her determination and dedication towards her garden is the main reason why she loves it.
1481	10348	4	2	The weight of fleeting beauty settled heavily on her shoulders. She knew the vibrant blooms in her garden, so captivating now, would inevitably fade. But unlike the ephemeral flowers, her academic performance felt like a singular chance, a test she could only take once. A decision solidified in her mind: she would retake the exam. The allure of nurturing life, of losing herself in the rich earth, still tugged at her. Gardening, she mused, was far more appealing than poring over textbooks. Yet, the understanding that her grades held lasting significance overpowered her desire, leading her to prioritize her studies and secure her academic future.
1482	10349	4	2	The story concludes with the winter hibiscus and the mother's understanding because they offered the author solace. The hibiscus, blooming unexpectedly in the cold, symbolized hope amidst disappointment. Adding to this, the mother's compassionate reaction to the failed test provided comfort and acceptance. Consequently, the author ends the story noting these positive aspects, indicating a sense of renewed optimism derived from both nature and familial love.
1483	10350	4	2	"The author concludes with a hopeful vision of the future. Saeng's silent vow, ""when they come back…then I will take the test again,"" coinciding with the spring thaw, the return of geese, and the budding hibiscus, underscores this optimism.

Even amidst hardship, one can persevere by drawing strength from meaningful connections, demonstrating that Saeng's persistence, fueled by the hibiscus, underscores the power of finding personal anchors in times of change."
1485	10352	4	2	The author revisits that paragraph because Saeng deeply regrets failing to @CAPS1 the test. Driven by remorse, Saeng resolves to @CAPS1 the test as a form of redemption. Similar to how personal determination fuels action and perseverance in the face of adversity, @CAPS3. This mirrors the story's central theme: Saeng's commitment to retaking and @CAPS1 the test, illustrating the importance of fulfilling one's goals through dedication and resolve. Thus, the story emphasizes the power of commitment in overcoming past failures and achieving desired outcomes.
1486	10353	4	2	The author includes this anecdote because it continues to explore Saeng's character. This section, mirroring Saeng's free-spirited nature—like a butterfly escaping confinement—reflects the open dialogue between Saeng and her mother. As a teenager, the narrator identifies with this dynamic, finding a relatable parallel between herself and Saeng's experiences.

1489	10356	4	2	"The narrative of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" penned by Ho, suggests Saeng derives joy and tranquility from the plant, a conduit to cherished childhood recollections. The author illustrates this with sensory details, noting, ""And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar ton,"" showcasing the plant's evocative power. The scent of a fallen leaf transports her back to her grandmother. It's plausible that Ho draws upon personal experiences to craft this poignant portrayal, aiming to resonate with individuals who have emigrated and possess objects that trigger nostalgia. The feeling is akin to how the touch or scent of a sweater evokes memories of my own grandmother. It seems likely Ho wrote this from a place of personal connection, hoping to tap into a universal experience of memory and displacement."
1490	10357	4	2	The author ends the story with quiet vows to illustrate a reluctance to express oneself, perhaps stemming from mistrust, even of oneself. I remember a similar period of isolation, a withdrawal from all communication. My world shrunk to the confines of my room, consumed by existential questions about life after death. Would I be reborn? Would my soul wander? This darkness held me captive until the realization dawned: I was young, with a vast, unexplored future. The time for such weighty contemplation would come later. This shift in perspective propelled me back into the world, reconnecting me with the people I had shut out, teaching me the importance of embracing the present rather than dwelling on unknowable futures, ultimately leading to a brighter and more engaged existence.

1492	10359	4	2	As spring nears, my thoughts drift to the garden, and a familiar feeling of inadequacy bubbles up. My mother possesses an almost magical green thumb; her garden is a riot of color and abundance, a testament to her skill. I, on the other hand, struggle to keep even the hardiest plants alive. This spring, however, I'm determined to improve. I aspire to reach her level of gardening prowess, not just to grow beautiful flowers, but to also feel the satisfaction she derives from nurturing life. The challenge is set, and with renewed dedication, I hope to cultivate a garden that mirrors, even a little, the beauty and skill of my mother's.

1494	10361	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves to highlight Saeng’s resolute spirit and enduring hope. The returning geese and the resilient hibiscus act as potent symbols of her determination. Like the geese, Saeng is determined to return and retake the driver's test. Similarly, the hibiscus, transplanted and facing an impending harsh winter, mirrors Saeng's own journey and future challenges. Despite these adversities, the hibiscus's eventual return and blossoming in spring embody Saeng's aspirations. The author strategically uses this final paragraph to establish a symbolic parallel between Saeng, the migratory geese, and the enduring hibiscus, thereby underscoring her unwavering resolve and optimistic outlook. Therefore, the author ends the story with this reflection to emphasize this symbolic connection, solidifying the themes of perseverance and the cyclical nature of hope.
1495	10362	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph essentially suggests a belief in fate, where events unfold according to a larger plan, possibly linked to the cyclical nature of time. The character, in @MONTH1, anticipates improved test performance in spring, naively associating academic success with the season's blooming vitality; the conclusion subtly implies that outcomes are predetermined, regardless of such expectations.
1496	10363	4	2	The concluding paragraph underscores the protagonist's resilience in overcoming challenges encountered after leaving her homeland. Furthermore, it highlights her enhanced self-assurance, suggesting this newfound confidence is the reason for the author's chosen ending.
1497	10364	4	2	Saeng resolved internally that spring, with melting snows, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, would mark her renewed attempt at the test. While the story mentions a fallen blossom tenderly cared for, suggesting attention to the garden, the concluding paragraph focuses on Saeng's personal determination. The image of spring, a time of rebirth and renewal, is directly linked to her vow to retake the test. Therefore, the author uses the garden imagery, specifically the hibiscus, as a symbol of Saeng's hope and her commitment to persevere, signifying that her life will have a new begining.
1498	10365	4	2	"The concluding paragraph, ""When the snow melts and the geese return,"" provides a concise encapsulation of the narrative's core themes.

Ultimately, this concluding paragraph serves to underscore the cyclical nature of life, mirroring Saeng's initial act of planting and bringing the story to a satisfying resolution."
1499	10366	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several key reasons. Primarily, the test holds significant personal importance for Saeng, representing an opportunity to validate her capabilities. Furthermore, the concluding paragraph generates suspense for the reader, leaving them uncertain about Saeng's potential success or even her decision to retake the test. Finally, it serves to highlight Saeng's core personality traits, emphasizing her persistence, determination, and strong will, effectively painting a vivid picture of her character and resolve.
1500	10367	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng, having just failed her driver's test, purchases a vibrant flower reminiscent of her Vietnamese homeland. Planting it in her garden, she confesses her setback to her mother, who responds with understanding and encouragement. The story culminates with Saeng's silent vow: ""when they come back…In the spring, when the snow melt and geese return and this hibiscus Is budding, then I will take the test again."" This final passage serves as a powerful moral. Saeng's experience, from the initial disappointment to the symbolic act of planting the hibiscus and her subsequent resolution, highlights the importance of resilience. The author conveys that failure is not final, and, like the cyclical return of spring and the blooming of the hibiscus, opportunities for renewed effort will always arise. Therefore, the story's conclusion underscores the central theme: never surrender to discouragement, and persistently pursue your goals until they are achieved."
1501	10368	4	2	The author's ambiguous ending serves a deliberate purpose: to ignite the reader's curiosity. I think she concluded the narrative in this manner to signal an eventual return, one where the protagonist is fully prepared to confront any challenge, especially that looming test. The open ending leaves us anticipating what transpires upon her return, eager to learn the outcome of her renewed efforts and whether she ultimately conquers the test. By making a private vow, the protagonist avoids the potential disappointment of letting others down should she falter, further reinforcing my belief that the author strategically crafted the ending to maximize suspense and reader engagement, leaving us eager to witness the next chapter of her journey.
1502	10369	4	2	The story concludes with the author's expressed intention to return the following year and retake the test. More than the exam itself, she articulates a desire to witness the unfolding of nature's cycles, specifically the growth of the plants. Her deep appreciation for the natural world is underscored by her yearning to observe the hibiscus flourish. This concluding sentiment reinforces her connection to her surroundings and her commitment to experiencing the beauty of their development, thus suggesting she intends to be present for the coming year's bloom.
1503	10370	4	2	The final paragraph underscores the hibiscus's profound sentimental value for Saeng. Her intention to retake the test after winter's end, acknowledging the incompatibility of ordinary hibiscus with cold weather and expressing a specific need for a winter-hardy variety, highlights her deep longing for a hibiscus reminiscent of home. This quest for a suitable plant, after initially experiencing self-doubt, ultimately reveals Saeng's newfound resolve and determination, demonstrating her resilience in pursuing a tangible connection to her past.
1504	10371	4	2	"Saeng's vow to retake ""that test"" upon the spring thaw, marked by melting snow, returning geese, and hibiscus budding, concludes the narrative with deliberate ambiguity. This ending, rather than offering a concrete moral, prompts reader inquiry, a technique reminiscent of modernist storytelling. Similar to the unresolved departure of @PERSON1, signified by a slamming door, in the example, this story leaves crucial questions unanswered. What test does Saeng refer to? Is she contemplating a significant relocation? Does this vow represent a personal resolution? The ambiguity compels readers to seek further understanding, potentially revisiting the text for deeper insights, thus enhancing the story's lasting impact. The author masterfully uses uncertainty to extend the narrative's reach beyond its final sentence, encouraging active reader engagement and speculation."
1505	10372	4	2	"The relatively somber yet hopeful narrative of ""Winter Hibiscus"" employs significant symbolism, culminating in a resolute ending that provides the reader with a sense of satisfaction. The author's concluding paragraph serves primarily to establish a hopeful tone and to connect the objects Saeng observes with the theme of spring. The hopeful tone arises from Saeng's silent, confident commitment, a resolution following a difficult day, designed to offer her a tangible goal. This also serves to underscore Saeng's inner strength, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism and assurance. Furthermore, the conclusion links Saeng's observations to the spring season through symbolism. The geese symbolize her new environment, while the hibiscus represents her former home. By juxtaposing these symbols, the author encourages the reader to associate them with the promise of spring. The story's conclusion, therefore, is skillfully crafted, effectively conveying a hopeful tone and integrating symbols that resonate with the theme of renewal, ultimately concluding the narrative with confidence and reader contentment."
1506	10373	4	2	The author likely concludes with that specific paragraph to emphasize the importance of perseverance. The ending serves to illustrate the lesson that one should not surrender, even in the face of failure. Consequently, the author's choice of concluding in that manner is probably intended to inspire readers to adopt a resilient mindset and to persist despite setbacks, thereby reinforcing the central theme of unwavering determination.
1507	10374	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves as the author's deliberate attempt to solidify her message. Through vivid imagery and carefully chosen details, she aims to foster a deeper comprehension of the passage's intricate layers. The author aspires for readers to connect with her message on a visceral level, as if they were present and directly experiencing the events she describes, and to ultimately feel the weight and significance of the story.
1508	10375	4	2	"The author ends the story with Saeng finding the flower to illustrate her newfound hope and motivation for her driving test. This flower acts as a catalyst, sparking memories of her former life in Vietnam. She struggles to articulate the specifics, hesitant to utter the word ""home"" directly, revealing a lingering vulnerability. Planting the flower in her new garden is symbolic; it's like transplanting a piece of Vietnam, offering comfort and familiarity in unfamiliar surroundings. Ultimately, the flower's inspiration, and the cherished memories it evokes, bolster Saeng's confidence, allowing her to embrace her new life and approach her driving test with a renewed sense of purpose, showing that Saeng now has a reason to start over."
1509	10376	4	2	The author ends the story with a promise of renewal. She paints a picture of the returning spring, vividly depicting the resurgence of life after winter's dormancy.

This closing line paints a vivid picture of hope mirroring nature's cyclical renewal. Saeng, like the winter hibiscus anticipating spring, embraces her circumstances. The melting snow and returning geese symbolize the thaw of her challenges, preparing for new beginnings.

This follows Saeng's sadness, triggered by memories of her Vietnamese home and the pain of displacement. However, the narrative subtly suggests Saeng will find acceptance in her new location. The honking of Canada geese, ""familiar to Saeng now,"" indicates her growing connection to her surroundings. The hibiscus serves as a tangible link to her Vietnamese culture, traditions, and memories, while the geese foster a sense of belonging in her new environment. By cherishing her heritage through remembrance, Saeng ensures a successful future, symbolized by passing the test, which explains Minfong Ho's deliberate concluding paragraph, emphasizing resilience and the enduring power of hope amidst transition."
1513	10380	4	2	"Saeng's story in ""Winter Hibiscus"" ends with a peculiar, almost humorous twist. After facing challenges, the final sentence resonates with determination.

The story concludes with the promise of spring, rebirth, and Saeng’s renewed commitment."
1514	10381	4	2	The concluding paragraph underscores the narrator's newfound readiness.

1519	10386	4	2	"Minfong Ho concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with Saeng's resolution to retake the test in spring to illustrate the symbolic parallel between Saeng and the flora within the story. Saeng's initial encounter with the store's vegetation evokes forgotten memories of her Vietnamese childhood, effectively reintegrating her into that familiar world. Plants trigger recognition of a past she unconsciously suppressed. Observing a potted plant, Saeng reflects on its natural, unrestrained growth in Vietnam compared to its confined existence in the store, mirroring her own feelings of displacement and restriction in a new environment. This plant, once wild, now caged, embodies her own transition. The hibiscus, specifically, becomes a potent symbol. Her mother notes its resilience, its capacity to endure the harsh winter. Saeng internalizes this characteristic, projecting it onto her own situation. Therefore, Saeng's determination to retake the test when the hibiscus blooms signifies her belief that, like the plant, she too will overcome adversity, mature, and be prepared to achieve her academic aspirations. Thus, the cyclical rebirth of the hibiscus mirrors Saeng's journey of adaptation and eventual triumph."
1520	10387	4	2	Saeng's first driver's test in the United States ended in failure, a setback in her new life. But as winter tightened its grip, she observed the hardy hibiscus, dormant yet resilient. A silent vow formed within her: when spring arrives, melting the snow and heralding the return of geese and budding hibiscus, she would retake the test. Saeng drew strength from the hibiscus's ability to endure hardship and adapt, believing that she, too, possessed that resilience. Although transplanted to a foreign land, she understood that her strength was enough to overcome challenges. The failed test wasn't an indictment of her abilities, but rather an opportunity for a fresh start, mirroring the hibiscus's rebirth. Saeng's renewed determination to face her fears and thrive in her new environment underscores her capacity for growth and adaptation.
1521	10388	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's resilience. This is evidenced by a shift from her earlier despair.

1522	10389	4	2	This concluding paragraph underscores Saeng and her family's resilience and adaptability. Initially, Saeng felt resentment upon failing the exam.

This implies a hopeful outlook on the potential for growth and advancement in the future.
1525	10392	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" reinforces the story's central theme of adapting to life's inevitable changes. Saeng's relocation from Vietnam to the United States represents a significant adjustment, mirrored in the altered state of the hibiscus plant. While reminiscent of home, the hibiscus is not identical to its Vietnamese counterpart. Her mother's observation that ""Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus,"" highlights the plant's resilience and adaptability. The final paragraph, with its imagery of melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus, further emphasizes this theme of transformation.

""Don't lose heart,"" she murmured, her voice soft as the rustle of autumn leaves. ""I'll try again next year."" He looked up, searching her eyes. ""Next year?"" he echoed, the words catching in his throat. She nodded, her gaze drifting towards the distant horizon, where a V-formation of geese etched itself against the fading light. ""When the geese come back,"" she whispered, a promise hanging in the crisp air, a promise of renewed hope amidst the present despair, ensuring that their shared dream would take flight again with the returning season."

1528	10395	4	2	The concluding paragraph likely serves to draw parallels between the author and the hibiscus and geese, highlighting themes of resilience and adaptation. The geese's migratory behavior, driven by the need to survive winter, mirrors Saeng's relocation to a new environment necessitating adaptation. Just as the geese seek warmer climates, Saeng confronts unfamiliar challenges. Furthermore, the hibiscus's struggle to endure the winter season becomes a metaphor for Saeng's own trials. The plant's potential for survival symbolizes Saeng's capacity to overcome adversity. The hibiscus's ability to withstand the harsh winter mirrors Saeng's need for strength to navigate her own challenges, suggesting that her survival, like the hibiscus's, hinges on her fortitude to endure and ultimately thrive.
1529	10396	4	2	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" suggests resilience and cultural integration through the protagonist's anticipation of spring's return: a symbolic rebirth mirroring her own potential to adapt. The narrator plans to retake a test when the season changes, drawing a parallel between the budding hibiscus and her own growth. Her ability to retain a connection to her heritage is illustrated by her continued preference for traditional foods over Western fast food. ""But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac,"" the author writes, revealing how she maintains her cultural identity while navigating a new environment. This excerpt demonstrates the protagonist's successful blending of cultures, suggesting a path towards contentment and a balanced existence."
1530	10397	4	2	The story's concluding paragraph is rich with potential interpretations, all circling back to Saeng's future. I see it as a symbol of hope and renewal. As winter's grip loosens and spring arrives, Saeng will find renewed motivation to conquer the driving test. The melting snow signifies the resolution of past difficulties, the hardships endured throughout the previous year now receding. The returning geese and the budding hibiscus mirror Saeng's own return, a symbolic rebirth as she prepares for a fresh start. This imagery suggests a forgetting, a conscious effort to put the driving test failure behind her. Saeng is using this period of reflection to steel herself for the next attempt. By shedding the negativity associated with the past, she aims to approach the test with a clear mind and renewed determination. The author ends the story on this note to illustrate Saeng's proactive approach to problem-solving. The paragraph's open-ended nature invites diverse readings, but for me, it signifies the dawn of a new chapter, one where Saeng is poised to face challenges with resilience and optimism, suggesting that the spring will usher in a period of growth and success, ultimately leading to her triumph in the driving test and a sense of personal accomplishment.
1531	10398	4	2	As the story concludes, Saeng silently makes a vow. She resolves that upon their return – a return timed with the spring thaw, the honking of geese overhead, and the burgeoning hibiscus – she will face the test once more. This silent promise underscores her determination to be prepared for the challenges that lie ahead, signaling a readiness to confront and overcome future obstacles. Saeng's internal commitment highlights a cyclical pattern of challenge, reflection, and renewed resolve, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and anticipation for her future endeavors.
1532	10399	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" with Saeng's vow to retake the test, effectively underscores the story's central themes. Primarily, the narrative emphasizes perseverance. Just as the winter hibiscus endures the harsh winter to bloom, inspiring Saeng, so too must individuals persist through adversity. Furthermore, the story highlights the importance of overcoming obstacles. The flower's survival despite numerous threats mirrors Saeng's own desire to conquer her challenges and succeed on the exam. Consequently, Saeng's determined resolution at the story's close aptly embodies these thematic concerns, reinforcing the narrative's message about resilience and the pursuit of goals."
1533	10400	4	2	The author concludes this section to highlight the narrative's distinctive elements. Saeng's remark about the plants' return, for instance, provides a memorable moment. Furthermore, the ending gains resonance by focusing on the anticipated return of both the plants and the geese, rather than abruptly shifting the topic. This dual expectation allows the reader to contemplate the cyclical nature of hope and renewal, solidifying the narrative's impact. Therefore, concluding in this manner enhances the story's thematic depth and memorability.
1534	10401	4	2	The author concludes the story with the girls viewing the plant as a potent symbol of strength and faith. Inspired, she resolves to take the test the following year when it is offered again. She genuinely admires the plant and harbors a strong hope that it will bring her good luck in her future endeavors, solidifying her determination and optimism.
1535	10402	4	2	"The author's concluding phrase underscores the protagonist's resilience and refusal to succumb to defeat. The protagonist's declaration, ""I failed the test,"" is directly countered by the story's final statement indicating her intent to retake the examination, revealing a determination to overcome adversity. Furthermore, the author strategically employs this ending to cultivate a sense of suspense, leaving the reader contemplating the uncertainty of the protagonist's future success, effectively concluding the narrative with a note of unresolved anticipation."
1536	10403	4	2	It seemed the author felt unprepared for an impending test. The return of the geese and the blossoming of the hibiscus flowers mark a turning point. It's as if these natural events signify a personal readiness. Perhaps before, a mental block or a lack of physical stamina hindered her. Now, these returning signs suggest a renewed state of preparedness. This implies that once the geese fly back and the hibiscus blooms again, she will finally attempt the test, indicating a newfound mental and physical readiness to conquer it. Ultimately, the author connects her readiness to external signs in nature.
1537	10404	4	2	"Authors meticulously craft their concluding paragraphs, and this author is no exception. The final paragraph, laden with symbolic weight, serves as a crucial element in understanding the character's journey. The statement, ""this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" is particularly significant. The hibiscus embodies the character's resilience and determination to overcome obstacles, specifically the failed test. The author's choice to conclude with this image underscores the character's commitment to retrying. Furthermore, the phrase ""when the snow melts and the geese return"" signifies new beginnings and renewed opportunities for the character. This imbues her with hope and the belief that she will succeed in her subsequent attempt. Therefore, the author's deliberate inclusion of this paragraph at the end symbolizes not only the character's capacity to overcome challenges but also the promise of fresh starts, ultimately reinforcing the story's core message of perseverance and optimism. This deliberate choice of ending highlights the author's intention to leave the reader with a sense of hope and the character's unwavering spirit."
1538	10405	4	2	The story concludes with that paragraph to capture the character's duality. When winter's cold silence blankets the world, she retreats inward, becoming a source of internal warmth and self-sufficiency. But with the arrival of spring, the thawing snow unleashes her vibrant, outgoing spirit, prompting her to embrace joy and engage in a flurry of delightful activities; the ending emphasizes the cyclical nature of her personality, forever shifting between introspection and exuberant engagement with the world.
1539	10406	4	2	The author ended the story with that paragraph because the geese, in their perfect V formation, migrate south every year. She comforts herself, thinking that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds bloom again, she'll retake the test. Almost reluctantly, she realizes how the passing seasons have made the once-strange familiar. Looking up at the geese, she's reminded of a somewhat similar experience she once endured, and this cyclical return offers a sense of comfort and renewed hope for her future attempt.
1540	10407	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng's silent vow. As spring returns, melting snows give way to the honking of returning geese, and the hibiscus begins to bud, she will retake the test. This act symbolizes her belief in the cyclical nature of life, where defeat is not final. The hibiscus, significant to both Saeng and her ailing mother, becomes a potent emblem of renewal. Their effort to nurture the plant by digging the hole, mirrors Saeng's preparation to tackle the test. The hibiscus's renewed growth signifies resilience and the promise of better times. For Saeng, the test represents an opportunity that will present itself again. The concluding paragraph suggests that life operates in seasons; what is missed in one cycle can be attained when the appropriate time returns, emphasizing life's cyclical nature and the possibility of new beginnings, ultimately demonstrating the importance of perseverance and patience.
1541	10408	4	2	She eagerly anticipates the return of spring. Once the snow melts and the weather warms, she knows the flowers will bloom again. It's a hopeful sign. She's also preparing to retake a test she previously failed. Her renewed attempt coincides with the arrival of the geese and the blossoming flowers, a period of rebirth and second chances for her, representing a fresh start to overcome her previous setback and succeed this time.
1542	10409	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" serves as a symbolic resolution for Saeng, who initially grapples with feelings of displacement and disappointment in her new country. After failing her driving test, Saeng finds herself emotionally drawn to a hibiscus plant in a florist shop, an object that evokes both painful memories and a sense of comfort. This connection deepens when she plants the hibiscus in her garden with her mother. As her mother returns inside, Saeng observes migrating geese overhead, prompting a subtle shift in her perspective. The author writes, “Almost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. Like the geese.” This moment of recognition is crucial: just as the geese will predictably return each spring, Saeng understands that she too will have opportunities to return to her challenges, such as retaking her driving test. The recurring bloom of the hibiscus, a plant initially tied to her distress, further reinforces this cyclical sense of hope and renewal, suggesting that Saeng, like the geese and the hibiscus, will find her way back, armed with resilience and a renewed sense of belonging."
1543	10410	4	2	The concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's enduring determination, a trait mirrored in the plant she brings home. Though native to her homeland and accustomed to unrestricted growth, the plant is now confined within a pot in the United States. This confinement parallels Saeng's experience in a new, unfamiliar country where she feels displaced, yet her unwavering resolve, much like the plant's potential, suggests a future where she will flourish despite the limitations.
1544	10411	4	2	"The story concludes with Saeng's resolve to retake the test, a decision that encapsulates the narrative's central theme: adapting to a new environment by discovering its beauty and recognizing parallels to one's homeland. Saeng reflects that the once-foreign elements of her new surroundings have, ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost become familiar to her now like the geese."" The greenhouse, filled with plants, evokes vivid memories of Vietnam and her grandmother, bridging the gap between her past and present. Despite her initial struggles adjusting to life in @LOCATION2, Saeng's determination mirrors her successful adaptation to the differences between @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. The author's choice to end with the image of geese, hibiscus, and Saeng's renewed commitment to the test underscores her ongoing adjustment and demonstrates her capacity to overcome challenges, assuring both her and the reader of her potential. Her vow to succeed foreshadows her future success and complete integration into an @CAPS1 lifestyle, solidifying the story's message of resilience and adaptation."
1545	10412	4	2	Saeng's story concludes with a paragraph that signifies both an ending and a fresh start. The author masterfully employs sensory details, grounding the narrative in the present season of winter while foreshadowing the approaching spring. Saeng's winter failure on her driving test, a time when nature appears dormant, contrasts sharply with the promise of renewal. The anticipated return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus serve as potent symbols of spring's arrival and the resurgence of life. Similarly, Saeng anticipates a revitalized attempt at her test, envisioning success where she previously faltered. The cyclical nature of the seasons mirrors Saeng's journey, suggesting that just as spring follows winter, new opportunities and growth will inevitably emerge, enabling her to finally achieve her goal of passing the driving test. Thus, the story ends with a sense of hope and anticipation for the future.
1546	10413	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves as a microcosm of the entire narrative. It encapsulates the essence of the story, presenting a condensed reiteration of its key themes and plot points.

1548	10415	4	2	The concluding paragraph serves as the story's culminating point, effectively encapsulating its central theme. The author strategically employs this final passage to clarify the narrative's trajectory, presenting the preceding events not merely as a sequence of occurrences, but as the organic development of a flower. This analogy suggests that the characters' experiences, challenges, and triumphs collectively contribute to a process of maturation and flourishing. The ending, therefore, functions as a key to unlock the deeper meaning embedded within the narrative, revealing the author's intention to portray a story of growth and transformation, and it ultimately contextualizes the entire story as an illustration of this singular, overarching metaphor.
1549	10416	4	2	"The short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho concludes with a seemingly open ending, yet it resonates with symbolic meaning. Saeng, having failed her driving test, purchases a winter hibiscus, vowing to retake the test in the spring. Holding the plant, she feels a chilling helplessness mirroring its own vulnerability. The author notes, ""Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind."" Saeng's mother's acceptance of her decision is pivotal to Saeng's personal growth. Her mother's simple statement, ""I'm glad you got it,"" underscores this acceptance. Furthermore, her observation, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing,"" subtly reflects Saeng's own struggle to reconcile her identity and connection to her homeland. The mother's assurance that the plant will not only survive but thrive come spring parallels Saeng's own journey. Just as the hibiscus will strengthen, so too will Saeng. Therefore, the author's choice to conclude the story at this juncture highlights the promise of renewal and resilience, suggesting that Saeng, like the winter hibiscus, will blossom in due time."
1550	10417	4	2	"The story culminates by illustrating the profound link between the girl and her hibiscus, revealing its symbolic weight as her connection to her roots. The ""Winter hibiscus"" embodies her homeland, a tangible piece of her past thriving in a new environment. Her decision to postpone her driving test until the plant buds signifies a parallel journey; she equates her own bravery with the plant's blossoming. Further emphasizing this theme of transformation, the southward migration of the geese mirrors her personal evolution. She vows to retake the test upon their return, signifying her own homecoming, a completion of her journey of adaptation and self-discovery, finally ready to embrace new challenges with renewed confidence."
1551	10418	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves multiple purposes, primarily to lighten the story's overall tone. Having established a melancholic and nostalgic atmosphere that evokes a longing for the past, the author shifts the focus to resilience. This change emphasizes the importance of inner strength, even when one is dissatisfied with their current circumstances. Furthermore, the ending highlights the protagonist Saeng's fortitude. Despite failing an exam in a foreign and unfamiliar environment, Saeng maintains a desire to persevere. This choice enriches her character, transforming her from a static figure to a dynamic one capable of growth and adaptation, making the story particularly resonant for readers experiencing homesickness, providing them with encouragement to move forward.
1552	10420	4	2	The author's concluding statement underscores her need for time, a crucial element mirroring the hibiscus's transplantation. Like the flower requiring time to establish roots in unfamiliar soil, she too requires an interval to acclimate to her new environment and forge her own roots. The hibiscus, observed at the orchard, serves as a poignant trigger, simultaneously evoking bittersweet memories of her former home, prompting tears tinged with a sense of well-being. The hibiscus, therefore, becomes a symbol of her transition, representing the simultaneous pain of displacement and the hope of eventual thriving in a new place, requiring patience and time.
1553	10421	4	2	The author likely concludes the passage to illustrate Saeng's enduring patience. The narrative suggests Saeng must wait for the arrival of spring, with the hope that the season's characteristics will evoke a sense of her familiar home. She favors spring over winter, finding comfort in the return of birds, specifically geese, which migrate away during the colder months. Thus, the author likely concludes the passage to underscore Saeng's hopefulness, her willingness to patiently await a time when her surroundings might once again resonate with the comforting familiarity of her origins.
1554	10422	4	2	"Saeng, displaced by a move to a foreign land, felt the unfamiliarity pressing in on all sides. Her old home was more than just a dwelling; it was a tapestry woven with loved ones and cherished memories. The new environment, initially daunting, often left her feeling adrift, far removed from her comfort. The hibiscus, a vibrant bloom reminiscent of her past, momentarily transported her back, stirring a wave of longing. This reverie, however, was fleeting, ending with the realization that she had, in her eyes, ""failed her test."" Yet, the story concludes with a glimmer of resilience. ""When they come back,"" she vowed, anticipating the spring's thaw, the return of the geese, and the hibiscus's renewed bloom, ""then I will take that test again."" This final declaration reveals Saeng's enduring hope. Despite the challenges of adapting to a new home and culture, she remains determined to embrace her new life and ultimately, to pass her self-imposed trial, demonstrating her commitment to building a future in this unfamiliar place."
1555	10423	4	2	Saeng's vow at the story's conclusion—to retake the test in spring when the snow melts, geese return, and the hibiscus buds—suggests her determination to succeed and bring joy to her mother. Spring, symbolizing nature's rebirth, represents Saeng's desire to approach the test with a renewed and focused mindset. The author's placement of this paragraph at the end emphasizes Saeng's hopeful outlook and commitment to her goal, leaving the reader with a sense of anticipation for her future success, demonstrating that the author made the right choice in ending the story with such an optimistic promise.
1556	10424	4	2	"The final paragraph of the story serves a crucial purpose: to provide resolution to Saeng's internal conflict. The narrative details Saeng's struggle to reconcile with her past traumas, specifically the loss of her grandmother and homeland. Her return with the hibiscus symbolizes her perceived failure to move forward, encapsulated in her statement, ""I-I failed the test."" This ""test"" represents her ability to cope with grief and adapt to her new reality. However, the concluding paragraph offers a glimmer of hope. Saeng's declaration, ""When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" signifies her renewed commitment to confronting her emotional obstacles.

The protagonist's homesickness is palpable, exacerbated by her recent relocation to the United States and the added sting of failing her driver's test. The line, ""She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again,"" poignantly illustrates her fragile emotional state. The concluding paragraph serves to suggest that with the arrival of spring, she anticipates a fresh start, a chance to rebuild her life in @LOCATION2, thus offering a resolution imbued with optimism and resilience."
1558	10426	4	2	The author concludes the story with that specific paragraph to convey Saeng's intention to retake the test when circumstances improve. It signals a future attempt, timed with an upswing in her life. Consequently, the author strategically uses this paragraph to bring the narrative to a close, emphasizing hope and resilience.
1559	10427	4	2	"In @CAPS1 Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the narrator encounters a greenhouse brimming with flora, yet her attention is captured by a singular ""winter"" hibiscus. This plant evokes potent memories of her homeland, a place where she once watched her grandmother dry her long, silvery hair in the sun. Afterward, she would assist her grandmother in knotting it into a bun, adorned with a hibiscus bud. The author concludes the story with this poignant image, a stark contrast to the narrator's earlier declaration of academic failure: ""I-I failed the test."" This concluding scene of the hibiscus and grandmother ultimately inspires the narrator to persevere, leading her to affirm, ""... then I will take the test again,"" demonstrating resilience and a renewed sense of hope rooted in her cultural identity."
1560	10428	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng's disheartened announcement, ""I-I failed the test,"" marks a turning point.

Saeng's decision to postpone the retest until the geese return, the snow melts, and her hibiscus begins to bud suggests a need for introspection and reconnection. She envisions creating a hibiscus garden, a physical manifestation of her longing for home and a space for healing. The hibiscus, confined to a pot, mirrors Saeng's own situation; just as she stumbled on her driving test, the plant is restricted. However, both Saeng and the hibiscus share the promise of future growth and a chance to overcome their present limitations, indicating that with time and care, both will flourish anew."
1561	10429	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph highlights Saeng's renewed determination, sparked by the discovery of a familiar plant. Despite failing her driving test, the plant, reminiscent of home and her grandmother, ignites a desire to succeed in this new country.

As the narrative progresses, Saeng begins to find familiarity in her surroundings, noting, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her."" The geese, initially foreign, now represent a growing comfort.

1570	10438	4	2	Saeng is so carefree that it will be a long time before she worries about schoolwork again. This is precisely why the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph, highlighting her newfound freedom. (Objective)
1571	10439	4	2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to highlight the girl's nuanced feelings about leaving home. It wasn't utter dissatisfaction; rather, the ending suggests a glimmer of hope. The author chose this specific concluding paragraph to show the potential for the girl to eventually adapt and even cherish her new environment, leaving the reader with a sense of optimistic possibility for her future.
1572	10440	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng requiring respite before her next attempt at the test.

1577	10445	4	2	Authors employ various literary techniques to enrich their narratives; without them, stories might appear uninspired. Minfong Ho, for example, subtly conveys Saeng's determination to retake the test. Rather than directly stating this intention, Ho crafts a scene where Saeng vows on the geese to try again.

The author's inclusion of this element allows readers to connect with the story on a deeper level, finding their own sources of hope. Knowing the hibiscus will bloom again each year, even after facing difficult conditions, reassures Saeng and reinforces her own ability to thrive. Therefore, the hibiscus provides a tangible representation of Saeng's inner strength and her unwavering belief in a brighter future.
1579	10447	4	2	"The final paragraph serves as a potent symbol of rebirth and renewed hope for Saeng. The returning geese mirror her own journey of resettlement and the promise of a fresh start. Similarly, the anticipated blooming of the hibiscus, a plant that evokes memories of her homeland and grandmother, signifies a resurgence of life and beauty. This connection to her past provides Saeng with the strength to face the future, specifically, to retake her driver's test. In contrast to the initial despair she felt upon leaving her old country and grandmother—a feeling described as ""a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes""—Saeng's newfound comfort and confidence, drawn from the hibiscus and her memories, empower her to move forward, demonstrating her resilience and the cyclical nature of life and hope."

Her decision to postpone the test until the weather improves and the geese return suggests a desire to align her mental state with the comforting rhythm of the natural world.

1582	10450	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng vows to retake her driver's test come spring, coinciding with the geese's return and the hibiscus's budding. Ho employs rich symbolism: the winter hibiscus from the floral shop symbolizes Saeng's link to her native land, while the bittermelon, a beloved food for Saeng but unpalatable to those in @LOCATION1, mirrors her struggles to connect with people there. The budding hibiscus and returning geese signify a renewed chance for Saeng to pass her test and integrate more fully into life in @LOCATION1, ultimately representing a hopeful outlook on her adaptation."

The author's choice to conclude the story as they did felt remarkably apt. I remember reading how Saeng watched the geese – a @CAPS1 flock of them taking flight. Before, she'd felt like an outsider, clumsy in this new land. So much was unfamiliar. But then, a shift. A quiet realization dawned: life here wasn't so bad after all. The image of her planting the ""winter hibiscus"" stayed with me. It symbolized her resolve, her intention to begin again, to nurture new roots and flourish. ""Plant a new seed,"" the story says. This ending worked so well because it offered a glimpse into Saeng's future, hinting at the growth and possibilities that lay ahead. The story's message of hope resonated deeply, and the carefully crafted conclusion amplified that feeling, suggesting a brighter path for Saeng."
1585	10453	4	2	In the story's closing moments, Saeng finds herself drawing a parallel between her own struggles and the resilience of the hibiscus. Just as the hibiscus adapts to its environment, Saeng realizes she, too, possesses the capacity to adjust and thrive. The hibiscus's ability to endure the harsh winter months becomes a symbol of hope for Saeng, reinforcing her determination to overcome her previous academic setback and retake the test. This newfound resolve is further strengthened by her observation of the geese, once foreign, now familiar, flying overhead in their characteristic V-formation, migrating to warmer climates.

After failing her driver's test, a wave of disappointment washes over her as she walks home. Then, a splash of color catches her eye – a hibiscus flower. The vibrant bloom evokes memories of her former home, stirring a sense of longing and hope within her. Driven by this renewed connection to her past, Saeng visits a local greenhouse and purchases her own hibiscus plant. Upon returning home, she carefully plants it, nurturing it with the same care she intends to apply to her future endeavors. The hibiscus becomes a symbol of perseverance, a tangible representation of her refusal to surrender to setbacks. The author implies that Saeng will not attempt the driving test again until the hibiscus begins to bud, symbolizing a renewed sense of optimism and growth, reinforcing the idea that Saeng's determination remains unbroken and rooted in the hope represented by the blossoming flower.
1588	10456	4	2	"The author strategically placed that paragraph at the end, hinting at a future opportunity for Saeng to rectify her error. ""I-I failed the test!""

Seeing her mother struggling in the garden, Saeng offered, ""Here let me help mother,"" taking the shovel. This act underscores her determination to improve her gardening skills.

1597	10465	4	2	"The author's concluding remarks serve to exemplify the theme of perseverance. Saeng's observation, ""through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,"" illustrates her adaptation to altered circumstances. This suggests an ongoing process of assimilation into her novel environment, contingent upon the passage of time. The narrative implies that sustained perseverance will facilitate her successful integration.

1599	10467	4	2	Saeng's vow in the concluding paragraph to retake the driving test in spring signifies her resolve, mirroring the hibiscus's resilience. As her mother notes its strength, Saeng embraces this quality to overcome the challenge.

The hibiscus, symbolizing her homeland, and the geese, representing her new environment, suggest her increasing integration. Acknowledging her past while embracing her present is crucial for success, and like the returning plant and geese, she will persevere. Thus, Saeng's determination, coupled with her acceptance of her new reality, positions her for future success.
1600	10468	4	2	I believe the author concludes the paragraph with the plant because he's trying to convey a message to the reader. It seems the author intends to draw a parallel between the plant's resilience and the girl's upcoming driving test. The implicit argument is that if a plant can survive the harsh winter, then the girl is certainly capable of passing her driver's test, offering her, and perhaps the reader, a source of encouragement. Therefore, I interpret the inclusion of the paragraph about the plant as a symbolic gesture, representing the girl's potential for success.
1601	10469	4	2	The story likely concludes in that manner because the author cherishes the sight of geese and embraces the season of spring. This affection, coupled with her aspiration to succeed on an impending test, fuels her current dedication to studying; therefore, her passions and goals converge to explain the story's ending.
1602	10470	4	2	The story concludes as it does because the author believes the hibiscus holds the key to Saeng's success on the test. This belief stems from the flower's unique qualities, which the author seems to imbue with symbolic power. Furthermore, the hibiscus serves as a potent reminder of Saeng's former home, a place she left behind when she moved to the @ORGANIZATION1. Initially, Saeng felt lost and uncertain in her new surroundings. The author's ending suggests that the hibiscus, by connecting her to her past, will provide Saeng with the strength and familiarity needed to navigate her present challenges, implying a hopeful outlook for her future endeavors.
1603	10471	4	2	"The author cleverly wraps up Saeng's story, ending on a hopeful note. Despite the sting of failing her test, the image of the hibiscus, ""building,"" suggests resilience. Saeng's belief that she'll succeed once the snow melts underscores this optimism. The author uses this ending to provide solace after Saeng's disappointment, which served as the story's climax. Rather than leaving the reader dwelling on her failure, the author offers a glimpse into Saeng's future, hinting at her determination to try again and ultimately framing her setback as a temporary obstacle she is ready to overcome.

1604	10472	4	2	Oral: Basically, he ends the story focusing on the test because that's what he was mostly going on about the whole time. The test was the central point, so it makes sense he wrapped things up by talking about it, keeping the focus where it belonged from start to finish.
1605	10473	4	2	"The conclusion of Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" is significant. After failing her driver's test, the narrator, Saeng, silently vows to overcome this setback, highlighting a crucial theme. The story largely details Saeng's melancholy; she misses her Vietnamese grandmother and the familiar flora of her homeland, even purchasing a hibiscus to alleviate her homesickness. Her initial experiences in @LOCATION2 are tainted by failure, compounding her sense of displacement. The ending, however, offers a stark contrast. Saeng's vow symbolizes her resilience and determination, suggesting that she will confront and conquer future challenges, making it clear she won't be defined by past failures."
1606	10474	4	2	The concluding paragraph of the story serves to underscore Saeng's transformative journey, highlighting her resilience and adaptability. The hibiscus flower, a symbol of delicate beauty, becomes a potent metaphor for Saeng's own capacity to endure hardship and flourish in unfamiliar circumstances. This parallel between nature's struggle for survival and Saeng's experience in a new environment illustrates the fundamental principle of adaptation. The narrative suggests that both living organisms and individuals possess an inherent ability to adjust to their surroundings, ultimately finding a sense of belonging and home. Thus, the author's narrative choice effectively employs the conclusion to demonstrate Saeng's biological and psychological growth, solidifying the story's central theme of resilience through adaptation.
1607	10475	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng's new to @LOCATION1 and homesick. Spotting a hibiscus reminds her of Vietnam. Planting it, she vows to retake her driver's test when it blooms. The story ends this way because Saeng and the flower mirror each other. She feels displaced in @LOCATION1, but the hibiscus links her to home. The ending suggests if the hibiscus can survive winter, so can she. Passing her test will signify overcoming hardship. The story's theme is things improve with time. Saeng will adjust to @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom, and Saeng will pass, showing perseverance prevails."

Most importantly, it reveals the girl's resilient spirit; much like the flower struggling to take root, she faces challenges adapting, yet the promise of a renewed opportunity assures us of her continued growth.
1610	10478	4	2	The inclusion of that paragraph likely stems from its symbolic significance. It could represent a good luck charm or a cherished tradition, thus explaining its importance within the narrative. Alternatively, the paragraph might function as a subtle clue, suggesting a specific pattern or condition related to the character's actions, such as the character exclusively taking tests during the hibiscus budding season in spring, thereby highlighting a temporal connection.
1611	10479	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph serves a dual purpose: it acknowledges Saeng's longing for home while simultaneously highlighting her growing resilience. Saeng's repeated references to her homeland reveal her deep yearning, and her inability to complete the sentence, ""I mean, it’s not like the one we had at-at-,"" underscores the pain associated with those memories. Furthermore, Saeng's reluctance to purchase a ""real"" test, reminiscent of the dreaded driving test, symbolizes her emotional avoidance. The ""test"" acts as a metaphor, representing both the hibiscus and the driver's examination, embodying the challenges Saeng faces. Her final vow, ""... and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test,"" signifies her commitment to confronting these emotional obstacles. This declaration of intent demonstrates Saeng's burgeoning strength and foreshadows her eventual triumph, concluding the story on a hopeful note of perseverance."
1612	10480	4	2	The fluorescent lights hummed as the author finished the last question, a sense of completion washing over her. The test, a significant hurdle, was finally done. As she gathered her things, she reflected on the experience, the intense preparation, and the anticipation that had consumed her. It felt like standing at the edge of a vast landscape, ready to explore. With the test behind her, the author realized that with nothing left to prepare for, she could focus on true growth. The exam had been a constraint, a defined boundary. Now, that boundary was gone. The author knew that the real learning, the deeper understanding, would begin now that she was free to explore her interests and pursue knowledge without the pressure of evaluation. Only then could she truly grow.
1613	10481	4	2	The story concludes with a paragraph rich in natural imagery, a consequence of the protagonist's failure to pass her driving test. The author's detailed descriptions of nature suggest a deep connection to the environment, implying that an appreciation for the natural world is a central theme within the narrative. This focus on nature, brought to the forefront by the girl's disappointment, ultimately paints a picture of resilience and finding solace in the world around her.
1614	10482	4	2	"She added that paragraph, I think, to let us know that even after all the loveliness comes back, she's going to try and settle in again. Start over, almost. Get used to the way things are, even if they're new. It's like she's saying, ""Yeah, it was awful, but I'm not giving up. I'll learn to love it again, whatever 'it' is."" So, the paragraph serves as a promise, a quiet vow that even amidst change, she will adapt and find beauty anew."
1615	10483	4	2	The concluding paragraph of Winter Hibiscus is significant because it signifies a fresh start for Saeng. The winter season, mirroring her unsuccessful driver's test and the hibiscus's dormancy, gives way to spring. This cyclical return of the hibiscus, a potent symbol of her homeland, fuels Saeng's resilience. She finds kinship with the migrating geese, whose initial strangeness evolved into familiarity through seasonal repetition, much like her own adaptation. The final paragraph promises a renewal, suggesting that with the spring bloom of the hibiscus and the geese's return, Saeng, too, will experience a rebirth, embracing new beginnings. This creates a sense of hopeful anticipation, emphasizing the cyclical nature of life and the potential for growth even after setbacks.
1616	10484	4	2	The author likely concludes the story with Saeng's renewed commitment to retake the test to emphasize her resilience. The earlier scene where Saeng confesses her failure to her mother illustrates this point; her mother, recognizing the difficulty Saeng faced, refrains from reprimanding her about the plant. Saeng implicitly draws a parallel between herself and the enduring plant, perhaps reasoning that if the plant can survive the harsh winter and continue to grow, she too can overcome the setback of failing the test. Therefore, this symbolic connection and Saeng's determination to persevere likely motivated the author's choice of ending.
1617	10485	4	2	"The story concludes with the author imbued with newfound hope and a steely resolve. Central to this transformation is her deep admiration for the hibiscus, symbolized by her mother's observation: ""But it's strong enough to make it through winter."" This simple statement resonates deeply, fueling Saeng's desire to emulate the flower's resilience in the face of adversity. The hibiscus becomes a potent metaphor for perseverance. Consequently, Saeng's internal declaration, ""Then I will take the test again,"" signifies a powerful commitment to overcoming challenges, demonstrating she is ready to face future obstacles."
1618	10486	4	2	The author's concluding paragraph serves as the culmination of the narrative arc, providing essential resolution. Without this concluding statement, the preceding events and character development would lack purpose, rendering the entire story fundamentally incomplete. Consequently, the concluding paragraph is vital, as it furnishes the story with its ultimate meaning and significance. (Objective)
1619	10487	4	2	The story's concluding paragraph serves to illustrate Saeng's impending adaptation to her new life in the United States, using the hibiscus as a potent symbol. The hibiscus, a plant flourishing in Vietnam's warmth, mirrors Saeng's own initial comfort and love for her homeland, complete with its vibrant flowers and cherished grandmother. The transition to the United States, however, presents a challenge, a stark contrast to her familiar environment. The introduction of the winter hibiscus, a resilient variety capable of thriving in both warm and cold climates, becomes a turning point. This particular flower acts as a metaphor for Saeng's potential to adjust, suggesting she too can flourish in this new, colder environment. The return of the geese in spring signifies hope and cyclical renewal, further motivating Saeng. Seeing them reclaim the area as their seasonal home, she resolves to take her driving test, demonstrating her willingness to embrace her new surroundings. The author concludes the story with this image of Saeng poised to adapt, mirroring the winter hibiscus's resilience and the geese's seasonal return, solidifying the theme of embracing change and finding home in a new land.
1620	10488	4	2	The story concludes with a powerful image: the snow's surrender to the returning green. This thaw isn't merely a seasonal shift; it's a rebirth, mirroring the protagonist's renewed determination. He will face the test again, his motivation revitalized like the landscape around him. The author masterfully depicts the protagonist's deep connection to the natural world, emphasizing the profound impact of his experiences within it, and showing how the cyclical renewal in nature directly influences his personal resolve.
1621	10489	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph effectively encapsulates the story's overall sweetness and vividly paints a beautiful picture in the reader's mind with each sentence. The proposed alternative ending, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" resonates with similar aesthetic qualities.  **Descriptive:**  The story concludes perfectly, mirroring the delicate beauty woven throughout its entirety. Each sentence contributes to a tapestry of sweetness, leaving readers with a vibrant and heartwarming image. An alternative ending, such as, ""As spring promises return, Saeng silently pledged, when melting snow kisses the earth, geese grace the sky, and hibiscus unfurls its crimson glory, then I shall face the test anew,"" captures a similar essence. The imagery of renewal and quiet determination echoes the story's gentle strength, making it a fitting and beautiful resolution."
1622	10490	4	2	The author concluded in that specific way to highlight their intention to observe behavioral variations in the subsequent spring, despite the subjects' familiarity with the stimulus. While the subjects possess prior experience, the focus will be on discerning nuanced differences in their seasonal responses.
1623	10491	4	2	The story concludes with this line to signify a renewed opportunity for the protagonist to succeed. The plant symbolizes resilience and rebirth, mirroring her chance to try again. This ending is effective because it establishes a lasting motif, where plants, even in @MONTH1, become sources of inspiration, encouraging a hopeful outlook. Furthermore, the plants might represent a unique channel through which she connects with her mother, adding a layer of emotional depth and potential for continued growth.
1624	10492	4	2	"In the story winter Hibiscus they end the story with that paragaph, because it repents that she is geting use to the new contrury.

Furthermore, the narrative implicitly suggests the necessity of adaptation in the face of unfamiliar circumstances. Therefore, the story concludes with this paragraph to highlight the theme of embracing change."
1625	10493	4	2	For Saeng, the bush's blossoms held a profound comfort, their presence a vivid echo of her Vietnamese home. The budding of the plant, a harbinger of spring, mirrored the promise of new beginnings. Saeng hoped that this spring would mark a turning point, a chance to finally succeed and pass her test. Yet, a sense of reassurance lingered: even if she faltered, the fully bloomed flowers would be there, offering solace and a gentle reminder of home, thus providing comfort in the face of potential disappointment.
1626	10494	4	2	The essay ends on a reflective note, drawing a parallel between the author and the resilience of flowers. Having taken root and flourished in her surroundings, she sees herself as akin to a blossoming plant, deeply connected to her environment. The sting of failure, represented by a disappointing test result, becomes a catalyst for growth, mirroring the cyclical nature of a flower's life. Just as a flower withers only to bloom again, she intends to embrace the setback as a temporary dormancy, a period of renewal before she returns to face the challenge of the test once more. The conclusion emphasizes her determination to persevere and learn from the experience, suggesting that, like the ever-returning bloom, she will use this experience to grow.
1627	10495	4	2	The author likely ends the story with that paragraph because the protagonist, having failed the initial hibiscus taste test, anticipates a future opportunity for redemption. The absence of hibiscus during the winter months signifies a period of waiting. However, the return of hibiscus in the spring represents a renewed chance to succeed in the test, suggesting the protagonist will try again to master the flavor and achieve a passing grade, thereby framing the ending as one of hopeful anticipation.
1628	10496	4	2	"The author likely concludes the passage with this paragraph for two primary reasons. First, the flower serves as a potent symbol for the protagonist herself; like the dormant bloom awaiting the thaw, she too is poised for a resurgence. The flower's anticipated blooming mirrors her own resolve to persevere and ""bloom"" by succeeding on the test. Second, the flower evokes a strong connection to her home and mother. This shared understanding between them, exemplified by her mother's willingness to care for the expensive plant, creates a sense of belonging and comfort. Therefore, the paragraph serves as a fitting conclusion, intertwining the protagonist's personal aspirations with her familial roots, offering a hopeful outlook for her future endeavors."
1629	10497	4	2	"Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng's resolution to retake her driver's test in the spring, a symbolic act of starting anew, timed with the return of the geese and the rebudding of plants. This final paragraph is crucial, highlighting Saeng's willingness to overcome adversity. After failing her test and experiencing a wave of homesickness while visiting a greenhouse, Saeng purchases a hibiscus. Planting it coincides with the geese's southward migration for the winter, transforming the hibiscus into a potent symbol of her Vietnamese memories. The plant's initial bloom and anticipated spring rebudding, leading to a larger blossom, mirror Saeng's journey of healing and the creation of positive new memories, fostering personal growth. The migrating geese, seeking refuge from the winter's cold, represent a parallel. Their return in the spring signals a fresh start – rebuilding nests, raising young, and recreating their lives. Similarly, Saeng aims to start over by passing her driving test, seeking greater integration and acceptance in her new location. Ultimately, Ho's choice to conclude the story with this hopeful vision underscores the character's resilience and her determination to rebuild a fulfilling life."
1630	10498	4	2	"The final paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" reveals the narrator's regret and disappointment over failing the test. Her mother's disappointment stings, a reflection of her own belief in her potential. As she gazes at the winter hibiscus and the geese in flight, a renewed sense of hope ignites within her. This moment of contemplation fuels her determination to retake the test. Resolved, she commits to facing the challenge again the following year, convinced that this time, she will succeed, solidifying her resilience and future success."
1631	10499	4	2	The story concludes with a specific paragraph that mirrors the girl's emotional state. The ending reflects her hopefulness and anticipation for renewal in the spring. She believes the coming season offers a chance to improve upon past experiences and actions, suggesting a cyclical pattern of reflection and aspiration as the story draws to a close, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism.
1632	10500	4	2	When she's distressed, she retreats to her comfort zone, a familiar pattern of behavior she habitually repeats. The story reveals this as her coping mechanism, a desire to relive or redo something, offering solace in its repetition. It's her way of dealing with being upset, an action she defaults to when faced with emotional turmoil, effectively restarting a situation as a means of regaining control and finding peace. This cyclical action defines her reaction to upsetting events and underscores her need for familiarity in times of stress, highlighting the repetitive nature of her coping strategy.
1633	10501	4	2	"As the snow began to hint at its eventual retreat, Saeng watched the dok faeng-noi, the hibiscus, with renewed determination. The geese would soon return, a sure sign of spring's arrival, and with it, her renewed attempt. ""In the spring,"" she promised herself, a silent vow echoing in the cold air, ""when the snow melts, and the geese fly north, and this hibiscus blooms, I will retake that test."" Her earlier setback hadn't diminished her spirit, but instead fueled it. Looking at the hibiscus, she thought of her family's unwavering support; she knew she wasn't alone in this journey. Leaning in to the vibrant plant, she acknowledged, ""It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,"" a statement that reflected not just the flower's beauty, but also the resilience it represented, and the support that was always there to guide her, solidifying her conviction to persevere and try again."
1634	10502	4	2	The concluding paragraph likely serves to illustrate the protagonist's newfound appreciation for nature. Her anticipation of spring, coupled with her intention to retake the test, strongly suggests a shift in her perspective. The author, in my view, uses this ending to highlight the character's deep affection for the beauty of the natural world, implying a transformation that positions nature as something worthy of her renewed focus.
1635	10503	4	2	"Saeng's final vow, ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again,"" hinges on the symbolic weight of the hibiscus. Its absence signifies a lack, a disruption of the natural order where success feels impossible. The hibiscus isn't merely a charm; its return embodies a restored harmony, a promise of better things to come.

Ultimately, the author's ending highlights Saeng's faith in something beyond herself, a source of hope that bolsters her resolve and shapes her future actions. Thus, the hibiscus isn't just a flower; it’s a visual representation of Saeng’s hope blooming."
1636	10504	4	2	The narrative concludes as it does to underscore the theme of overcoming adversity. Functioning as a symbol of Saeng's resilience, the hibiscus plant's survival is paramount. The concluding paragraph provides resolution to the central conflict. The hibiscus's capacity to endure the winter months symbolizes Saeng's own perseverance, creating a symbolic parallel. By stating that she will retake the test in the spring, the final paragraph reinforces this symbolism while simultaneously providing closure, thus solidifying the author's message about the importance of perseverance in the face of challenges.
1637	10505	4	2	Saeng's final statement, a promise to retake the test, serves as the story's open-ended conclusion, leaving the reader contemplating her future success. This deliberate ambiguity encourages reflection on the cyclical nature of challenges and perseverance. The author equates Saeng's resolve with the resilience of the plant she and her mother cared for. Just as the plant endures the harsh winter, Saeng will face the test again, strengthened by the experience. Witnessing the plant's survival during changing seasons instilled a renewed sense of hope and determination within her, a stark contrast to her initial despair after failing. Furthermore, the plant is a symbol of her bond with her mother and now it is a reminder for Saeng to keep going. Ultimately, Saeng's commitment to try again signifies her growth and the enduring power of hope, suggesting that even after setbacks, new beginnings and future triumphs are always possible.
1638	10506	4	2	Saeng sighed, her thoughts a tangle of equations and budding tulips. It was always like this: her schoolwork, a demanding vine, intertwined inextricably with the gentle rhythm of her garden. She knew the plants needed her, the thirsty blossoms practically begging for water, but the textbooks called louder. Spring, that explosion of color and life she usually reveled in, loomed, not as a season of growth in the garden, but as the season of exams. A bittersweet feeling washed over her. She yearned to nurture the seedlings, to witness their unfurling beauty, but she knew that by the time the garden reached its peak, she would be sequestered, absorbed entirely in the academic world, preparing for the looming test, a necessary, if unwelcome, constraint on her springtime joy. This internal conflict highlighted the transient nature of the season, as she would miss the full bloom due to her academic obligations.
1639	10507	4	2	The story's conclusion underscores Saeng's unwavering resolve; she will not surrender until her task is complete. The author evokes empathy, highlighting Saeng's deep sorrow and longing for home. Saeng's character mirrors the hibiscus: delicate in her beauty, yet resilient. Her promise to retake the test when the hibiscus buds symbolizes her personal growth, suggesting a parallel journey of blossoming and adaptation, solidifying her commitment to persevere despite her homesickness.
1640	10508	4	2	"The concluding paragraph serves as a crucial element, offering a message of resilience. The line, ""when they come back... I will take that test again,"" reveals Saeng's identification with the returning geese and budding hibiscus. Her ""winter"" symbolizes the challenging test, implying that renewed readiness will bring success. The hibiscus's budding signifies her eventual preparedness to overcome adversity and attempt the test again. The paragraph's placement at the story's end synthesizes the hibiscus's thematic purpose. Without it, readers might misinterpret the hibiscus solely as a link to Saeng's past, overlooking its broader significance. The final paragraph's inclusion emphasizes the universal capacity to recover from setbacks, providing a hopeful resolution. Therefore, the author uses this final message to convey a sense of optimism and determination, allowing readers to understand the deeper meaning of the budding hibiscus."
1641	10509	4	2	She might be limited to spring testing. Alternatively, the relaxed atmosphere of that season could have been conducive to her performance. Her subsequent disappointment concerning her poor driving test score was palpable. (Descriptive)
1642	10510	4	2	"The author ends the story on a hopeful note, deeply connected to the hibiscus. This flower serves as a powerful metaphor for the protagonist's own life and potential. She equates her academic test to the hibiscus's growth cycle, planning to retake it when the plant blooms anew. The hibiscus embodies hope and good fortune, signifying a fresh start. Without it, despair consumed her, as evidenced by her own words, ""I failed the test"" and ""I bought it."" The failed test triggered a deep depression, leading her to purchase the hibiscus, seeking to positively influence her destiny. She resolves to begin a new chapter, marked by retaking the test when the hibiscus blossoms, proving to herself the profound influence the plant has on her life, and establishing the symbolic importance of the hibiscus as a source of personal renewal."
1643	10511	4	2	Saeng's impulsive purchase of a winter hibiscus sparked her mother's ire. The financial implications of buying a fully grown plant, rather than starting from seeds, fueled the maternal disapproval. Her mother, aghast at the expenditure, voiced her disbelief. Unexpectedly, Saeng's tears flowed in response to the reprimand. Moved by her daughter's distress, the mother's anger dissipated, and she readily forgave Saeng. This rapid shift in emotion, from anger to forgiveness, underscores the story's central theme: the unpredictable nature of events and relationships, illustrating that truly anything can happen within its narrative.
1644	10512	4	2	The author likely concludes the story as they do to illustrate the importance of resilience in the face of setbacks, and discourage stubbornness. Saeng's failure on her driver's test is not presented as a final defeat. Instead, the author uses the budding of the hibiscus plant in the spring as a symbol of hope and renewal. Saeng interprets this natural event as an auspicious sign, motivating her to try again, suggesting that perseverance, rather than obstinate refusal to accept defeat, will ultimately lead to success, completing the story on a hopeful note.
1645	10513	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng's silent vow, signaling her intention to emulate the hibiscus plant's growth and retake the licensing test. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope, evoking memories of her beloved homeland and fueling her resolve. The author suggests a parallel between the plant's budding and flowering and Saeng's own anticipated development and eventual acquisition of her license, thus emphasizing her determination and future success. Her renewed commitment underscores the theme of resilience and the potential for personal growth, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism regarding Saeng's future endeavors.
1646	10514	4	2	The passage indicates a specific time – springtime, characterized by melting snow, the sun's activity, the return of geese, the start of hunting season, and budding hibiscus flowers – as the period when a test will be retaken. Therefore, the passage suggests that the test will be taken again sometime in the spring, coinciding with the described seasonal changes, effectively connecting the test retake to the arrival of spring.
1647	10515	4	2	"The author strategically placed the paragraph about Saeng's spring test at the story's conclusion to convey a sense of peace and acceptance regarding her life in the U.S. Saeng's observation, ""and this hibiscus plant is budding,"" connects her to her homeland through a familiar symbol. Her resolve to ""take this test again"" suggests a personal commitment to fully embracing her new life when she feels more settled. Ultimately, this ending illustrates Saeng's journey towards accepting her relocation while finding comfort in reminders of her native country, showcasing her evolving sense of belonging."
1648	10517	4	2	The concluding paragraph of this story serves a significant purpose, strategically positioning the narrative for potential continuation. The author may intend to cultivate reader anticipation, signaling the possibility of future installments and ensuring continued engagement. By drawing a parallel between Saeng's journey and the cyclical renewal of nature—the sprouting plant and returning geese—the author emphasizes her resilience and determination to retake the test. This parallelism strongly suggests a sequel focused on Saeng's rebirth and her unwavering commitment to her vow. This deliberate ambiguity fuels speculation about Saeng's future endeavors, leaving readers pondering the direction of her life as spring revitalizes the world around her. The author clearly enjoys fostering this sense of suspense, prompting readers to eagerly anticipate the next chapter in Saeng's story and solidifying the enduring impact of the narrative. Ultimately, the open ending ensures that the audience remains invested in Saeng's fate, eagerly awaiting the resolution of her journey.
1649	10518	4	2	"The author concludes the story with a powerful image: Saeng’s encounter with the hibiscus, emphasizing her resilience and adaptability in her new American life. This hibiscus serves as a potent symbol of Saeng's burgeoning hope and unwavering determination to thrive in the United States. The text describes the flower: ""…its fine petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral."" This moment of recognition, where Saeng connects her Vietnamese past with her American future, is overwhelming. The hibiscus embodies newfound hope amidst challenging circumstances, suggesting that as it blossoms, Saeng’s world will expand, and a fresh start will materialize. This realization at the story's close assures the reader that Saeng has discovered stability and is poised for success. Furthermore, the tactile memory evoked – ""it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel"" – demonstrates how the hibiscus allows Saeng to access cherished memories, providing crucial inspiration in an unfamiliar environment. By ending with Saeng's renewed hope and recollection, the author underscores her successful integration and the enduring power of memory in shaping a new life."
1650	10519	4	2	"The author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a specific paragraph to demonstrate that even amidst the hardship of leaving her past behind, Saeng can discover a fulfilling new life. The winter imagery symbolizes past difficulties, contrasted by the spring which represents a hopeful future and fresh starts. Despite her grief, Saeng can still find happiness. The hibiscus, once unique to her home, now grows where she is, acting as a comforting reminder of her past. The story notes, ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This acceptance, highlighted by the quote, transitions into the final paragraph, showcasing her growing appreciation for her new environment. The concluding paragraph states, ""...when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again."" The return of familiar elements and reminders of home empowers Saeng to pursue her goals and build a positive future in this new place, illustrating her resilience."
1651	10520	4	2	**Oral**  The story ends like that to show it's always possible to start over, to never quit when you really want something. Danita wanted to pass, worked hard, but didn't make it. But like spring for a plant, she knows life will offer new chances, and you can always change what you don't like about yourself. I totally agree. Without second chances, everyone would be a loser since everyone messes up and has the ability to fix things. That's why the author ends the story with that hopeful thought.
1652	10521	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng's hopeful anticipation of her new hibiscus blooming next spring, symbolizing good luck for her upcoming driving test. This ending is effective because the hibiscus, initially absent from her life, becomes intertwined with her future aspirations post-failed driving test. Saeng now associates the hibiscus with her past experiences, resilience in the face of challenges, and solace during moments of disappointment, factors she believes will contribute to her success on the next driving test; therefore, the plant offers her a renewed sense of hope and a tangible symbol of her journey, making it a fitting and optimistic conclusion.
1653	10522	4	2	The concluding paragraph likely serves to illustrate the author's transformation throughout the narrative. Initially, the author expresses discouragement and frustration over failing her test. However, the final paragraph reveals her newfound resilience in the face of fear. The parallel drawn between Saeng, her family's relocation to the United States, and the geese's migratory patterns is significant. Just as the geese navigate unfamiliar landscapes yet return annually, Saeng, like a unique flower, must adapt to her new environment. Her recognition that the flower will bloom and the geese will return in the spring signifies her commitment to perseverance. Instead of succumbing to defeat, she resolves to try again later in the year, demonstrating her evolving capacity to adapt and thrive in her new surroundings, signaling a hopeful outlook that concludes the story.
1654	10523	4	2	"In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph emphasizes Saeng's resolve to both pass her driving test and assimilate into her new environment. The author's use of ""vowed"" carries a positive connotation, highlighting her commitment. The phrase, ""almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become...familiar,"" illustrates her ongoing adaptation to a new lifestyle. However, the final paragraph suggests that complete acclimation will require further time, demonstrating that while she is adapting, the process is not yet entirely complete."
1655	10524	4	2	"Saeng, haunted by a past exam failure, vowed to never repeat the experience. Yearning for her origins, she purchased winter hibiscus, tangible reminders of her homeland. The flowers fueled her determination. As the narrative closes, Saeng looks to the future, declaring, ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" This spring rebirth symbolizes her readiness to adapt and integrate into her new environment, signaling her intention to confront the test anew and embrace her present circumstances."
1656	10525	4	2	The author concludes the story with that specific paragraph for two key reasons: to synthesize the narrative's central themes and to illustrate Saeng's readiness for future challenges. The act of placing the flower serves as a culmination of its symbolic significance, representing the protagonist's emotional state and its fluctuations between happiness and sorrow. Furthermore, Saeng's vow to retake the test signifies her preparedness for what lies ahead, coupled with an openness to new experiences and a willingness to learn from past mistakes. Therefore, the author strategically ends with this paragraph to both create a sense of intrigue regarding Saeng's ultimate fate and to provide a satisfying resolution to the story's core themes, leaving readers to ponder the possibilities while understanding her readiness for the unknown.
1657	10526	4	2	*Descriptive*  The narrative concludes in winter, a stark contrast to the season of planting when the flowers bloomed. The flowers are gone, but the author's internal landscape has transformed. The period of cultivation fostered a personal growth, evidenced by the shift in perspective; once-unfamiliar concepts now resonate. She is gaining proficiency, a testament to her dedication. This acquired knowledge prepares her for the upcoming spring test, suggesting a cyclical journey of learning and anticipation, making the winter a time of quiet preparation.
1658	10527	4	2	" As the year drew to a close, she knew this wasn't truly the end. This moment, this feeling, was just a pause. A breath before the plunge. Because in exactly one year, give or take a few days, she'd be right back here, facing the very same trials, the same challenges, the relentless ""test of life."" It wasn't a one-time exam you could cram for; it was a recurring assessment, a yearly gauntlet. The memory of past struggles and victories faded, replaced by the stark realization that the curriculum was never truly over, it was only on hold, ensuring that the journey, with all its tribulations, would begin anew, demanding growth and resilience."
1659	10528	4	2	"The conclusion of a story is paramount in shaping its overall meaning, serving as a definitive resolution that often lingers in the reader's memory. In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the concluding paragraph functions as a source of encouragement. The narrative closes with the implication that Saeng will persevere and retake the examination the following year, coinciding with the hibiscus's bloom. This resolution is inherently encouraging, highlighting Saeng's resilience and determination to succeed. The author's choice to conclude on this note leaves the reader with a sense of inspiration. This ending effectively reinforces the story's central theme: throughout the narrative, Saeng faces disappointment regarding the flower, her connection with her mother, and her homeland, yet she is consistently encouraged to move forward and persevere. Therefore, the ending is both meaningful and successful in conveying the author's intended message of hope and perseverance."
1660	10529	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the protagonist grapples with the profound displacement of leaving home. The unfamiliar culture, customs, and even the food create a formidable barrier to adaptation. The protagonist's initial sorrow and struggle are palpable as she navigates this alien landscape. However, the story concludes on a note of determined hope. The protagonist resolves to retake the test, a symbolic act demonstrating her commitment to overcoming these challenges and integrating into her new environment; this resilience suggests a belief that with time, her situation will evolve, illustrating her unwavering resolve to achieve her goals despite the initial hardship."
1661	10530	4	2	Saeng's final contemplation of the geese symbolizes her renewed determination to surmount challenges. Initially crestfallen by her test failure, she sought solace in nostalgic recollections of her native land. The purchase of a hibiscus, a flower evocative of her homeland, provided her with both comfort and affection. However, the hibiscus also mirrored her resilience, and as she planted it, witnessing the geese in flight instilled in her a resolve to persevere, signifying that she would attempt the test again, demonstrating her commitment to overcoming adversity.
1662	10531	4	2	The author's decision to embark on a new gardening endeavor stems from a previous, less-than-successful attempt. Recounting the tale in her book, she acknowledges the crucial role her mother played in trying to salvage the first garden. Now, armed with experience (albeit of the learning-from-failure kind), she intends to cultivate a garden independently. This new venture marks a determined step towards self-sufficiency in the horticultural realm, hoping for a more fruitful outcome this time around.
1663	10532	4	2	Saeng's realization marks the paragraph's conclusion: she acknowledges her longing for her past life while recognizing the necessity of adapting to her new surroundings. A profound wave of homesickness washes over her, bringing a sharp sting to her eyes as she reflects on cherished memories. However, this feeling is tempered by the recognition that not everything is unfamiliar. The honking of Canada geese overhead, once foreign, now resonates with a comforting familiarity. This realization provides Saeng with the resilience to embrace her new life in a new land, suggesting a hopeful path forward.
1664	10533	4	2	The author concludes the story with the provided paragraph because it offers a fitting resolution. Specifically, the ending focuses on Saeng's anticipated return with the melting snow, and her renewed attempt at the test, providing a sense of closure and hope for the character's future.
1665	10534	4	2	"The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng resolving to retake her driver's test in the spring. This final paragraph is significant because the story revolves around Saeng's initial failure and her subsequent encounter with a familiar hibiscus plant at a florist shop. Discovering more about the plant reignites her determination. Her homesickness, evident in her longing for her grandmother and childhood mementos, peaks when she almost breaks down explaining the hibiscus to her mother, revealing her deep discomfort in her new home. However, by the story's end, Saeng's perspective shifts from despair to hope. Despite failing the test, her vow to try again demonstrates a newfound resolve to adapt and succeed in this new country, symbolized by the return of spring, melting snows, and budding hibiscus, signifying a fresh start and a renewed commitment to her future."
1666	10537	4	2	He likely included this passage to convey a metaphorical message. The melting snow symbolizes a clean slate, suggesting one should move on from initial failures. The return of the geese signifies a second opportunity. Finally, the budding hibiscus represents success achieved after overcoming previous obstacles. Thus, the passage uses natural imagery to illustrate themes of renewal, opportunity, and perseverance.
1667	10538	4	2	The story concludes with that paragraph, a fitting end given their shared preoccupation with both the cold weather and @CAPS1. The finality of the snow melting resonates because it echoes their earlier conversations, solidifying the connection between their dialogue about the weather and @CAPS1, thus bringing their shared narrative to a satisfying close.
1668	10539	4	2	The story's conclusion effectively illustrates the protagonist's transformation. Initially, we see her grappling with failure, both in her driver's test and in her mother's eyes regarding her extravagant plant purchase. One might anticipate a descent into despair. However, influenced by her grandmother's wisdom and a connection to her homeland, she defies expectations. Her optimistic declaration of retaking the test when the plant blooms again demonstrates resilience. This reflects a profound bond with the plant, almost imbuing it with human qualities, and signifying her renewed hope. The ending therefore highlights the character's growth and the enduring impact of her heritage, showcasing a shift from disappointment to hopeful anticipation.
1669	10540	4	2	"The author's concluding paragraph effectively encapsulates the story's central theme: the power of determination in the face of adversity. This message is embodied in Saeng's character, an immigrant navigating the challenges of a new country, both within the microcosm of the garden and in her broader life. The hibiscus, the melting snows, and the returning geese symbolize a cycle of renewal and perseverance. Saeng's declaration, ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" serves as a powerful testament to her resilience and unwavering commitment to overcoming any obstacles in her path, demonstrating her refusal to be defeated by initial setbacks."
1670	10541	4	2	Ultimately, the author concludes the story as such because the protagonist transcends merely absorbing pain, gaining instead the ability to glimpse the future. This vision offers her a path to move beyond the past, allowing her to learn from it and strive for a more positive future, effectively concluding her character arc with hope rather than despair.
1671	10542	4	2	The story concludes with a symbolic image: a flock of Canada geese in flight, their calls audible even at a distance. This is juxtaposed with Saengís’s earlier despondency. The geese, heads held high in confident migration, offer a contrast to her bowed spirit. Saengís resolves to retake her test the following year, coinciding with the snowmelt, the geese’s return, and the blossoming of her hibiscus. This suggests a shift in her perspective. The hibiscus, a symbol of her new home, will evoke memories, but not sadness. She anticipates facing the future with renewed strength and gratitude, her head held high like the Canada geese, ready to embrace her new life.
1672	10543	4	2	The author likely concluded the story with that paragraph for two key reasons. First, Saeng's quiet acquisition of the Winter Hibiscus suggests a renewed hope for passing her driving test. Second, the ending implies her determination to retake the test, driven by her desire to drive independently upon succeeding. These motivations, however, are somewhat obscured, making the author's intended conclusion challenging to fully grasp.
1673	10544	4	2	I believe the author ended the paragraph as they did to highlight the profound loneliness Saeng experienced concerning the geese. This ending choice, in my opinion, effectively underscores the depth of Saeng's solitary connection, suggesting a unique bond forged in isolation. The author's deliberate focus on this solitude, I feel, emphasizes the emotional weight of Saeng's relationship with the geese. Ultimately, it is this very loneliness that makes Saeng's attachment to the geese so poignant and memorable.
1674	10545	4	2	"The conclusion of Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus"" is open to interpretation, yet strongly suggests a message of resilience. Saeng's mother's comment on the purchased flowers–""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here""–echoes in Saeng's own resolve. Saeng's vow to retake her test is a symbolic declaration of her inner strength, a promise to endure the difficulties of her new life. Furthermore, the author notes Saeng's growing familiarity with her surroundings, signifying an eventual adaptation to her new home. While homesickness persists, Saeng's subconscious declaration to retake the test shows her belief in her ability to overcome challenges, requiring only time for adjustment and acclimation, highlighting her underlying fortitude. Thus, the ending emphasizes Saeng's capacity for growth and her potential to thrive despite adversity."
1675	10546	4	2	Saeng failed her driving test, a nineteen-dollar setback that stung. Her mother, initially furious at the wasted money, softened upon seeing Saeng's tears and offered comfort. Beyond the financial loss, Saeng’s disappointment stemmed from a deeper desire: to pass the test in the spring. This wasn’t just about driving; it was about rediscovering a piece of her past. As a child in her homeland, she had cherished a particular flower. She hoped to find it again on her walk home after passing the test, a tangible link to her memories. Despite the initial setback, Saeng resolved to retake the test, fueled by the hope of spring blossoms and the freedom a license would bring, showing her resilient determination to succeed.
1676	10547	4	2	"In Minfong Ho's ""Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng's story resonated with me, particularly her struggle to adapt to a new life so drastically different from her past in Vietnam. The author masterfully portrays Saeng's melancholy through vivid sensory details. The scent of jasmine, for instance, triggers a wave of nostalgia, reminding her of her grandmother's loving presence. The image of her weeping at the sight of the hibiscus and jasmine is heartbreaking; it underscores her profound sense of displacement.  Saeng's failure to pass her driving test, a common teenage setback, is amplified by her existing emotional burden. At this point, I genuinely felt empathy for her, imagining the weight of leaving behind everything familiar, clinging only to fragmented memories and a winter hibiscus—a pale imitation of its Vietnamese counterpart. I wondered if Saeng would ever find happiness again.  However, Ho concludes the story on a more optimistic note, leaving Saeng contemplating the coming spring. This shift towards hope suggests a potential turning point for Saeng. The final line, with its imagery of returning geese and budding hibiscus, offers a glimmer of promise, suggesting that Saeng may be able to blossom in her new environment, just as the winter hibiscus eventually blooms, showing that her future holds the potential for growth and renewal."
1677	10548	4	2	"The concluding paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" offers a sense of hope, contrasting sharply with Saeng's earlier despair after failing her test. This feeling of dejection, stemming from both academic setback and displacement from her homeland, dissipates through the symbolic power of the flower. Her final declaration, ""Then I will take that test again,"" encapsulates a renewed determination. The narrative shifts from a predominantly depressing tone to one of optimism, suggesting that even in moments of hardship and apparent impossibility, sources of inspiration and resilience can be found. The author implies that within every negative situation lies the potential for positive transformation, requiring only the willingness to seek it out. Saeng's journey demonstrates that even after facing significant challenges, one can rediscover confidence and face the future with renewed resolve, proving that hope can blossom even in the face of adversity."
1678	10549	4	2	Cultivating a garden presents unique difficulties depending on the time of year. Winter and early spring, for example, can pose considerable obstacles to successful plant growth. The phrase likely refers to the increased difficulty, or perhaps a specific challenge, associated with establishing and maintaining a thriving garden during less favorable seasons, therefore implying it is more difficult to garden during certain times of the year.
1679	10550	4	2	The author concludes the story with that particular sentence to underscore the theme of courage prevalent throughout the narrative. The protagonist's journey demonstrates resilience and the ability to overcome adversity, which ultimately leads to her improvement. This final statement emphasizes her determination to face the challenge again, signifying that the initial failure will not deter her from pursuing her goal, and solidifies the overarching message of bravery and perseverance.
1680	10551	4	2	The author likely concluded the story with that particular paragraph for a multitude of reasons, primarily to signify renewal and the potential for a fresh start. The cyclical migration of geese, their departure and subsequent return, serves as a powerful metaphor for the changing seasons. This recurring seasonal shift, representing transition and new beginnings, could symbolize the protagonist's opportunity to retake a test. The geese's journey underscores the theme of second chances, suggesting the character, like the geese, will have another opportunity to succeed, thus completing the narrative arc with a sense of hope and anticipation.
1681	10552	4	2	Seems like they figure it's gonna bring 'em good luck, y'know? That's the idea, anyway. They're banking on it, hoping it'll turn things around for 'em. Basically, they see it as a charm, a little something to give 'em an edge. So, yeah, luck's what they're after.
1682	10553	4	2	The concluding paragraph effectively encapsulates the story's central themes. Saeng's initial failure on the test is contrasted with her subsequent actions: purchasing a plant reminiscent of her homeland and persevering in planting it despite unfavorable conditions. This symbolizes her resilience and adaptation to a new environment. The realization that once-foreign elements have become commonplace underscores her successful integration. Her decision to retake the test highlights her determination and belief in her goals. Saeng's journey demonstrates that setbacks are not definitive failures, and perseverance is crucial. While acknowledging the enduring importance of her roots, she embraces the possibility of moving forward. Ultimately, the story suggests that positive outcomes can emerge from challenging experiences, as illustrated by the symbolic act of buying the flower after her initial setback, making the conclusion a fitting summary of Saeng's transformative journey.
1683	10554	4	2	The hibiscus excerpt is purposefully placed at the end to resonate with Saeng, as the flower embodies her home, history, and solace. The hibiscus serves as a metaphor, suggesting that Saeng, like the flower, possesses the capacity to flourish, allowing her to acclimate to her new environment and successfully retake her test. Furthermore, the hibiscus symbolizes hope; its ability to endure winter and bloom in spring mirrors Saeng's potential for resilience. The author masterfully uses the flower's inherent qualities to parallel and reinforce Saeng's emotional journey, solidifying the connection between her personal struggles and the natural world.
1684	10555	4	2	The author draws a parallel between Saeng's situation and the migratory patterns of geese. Just as the geese journey south for the winter and reliably return in the spring, Saeng, having failed her driving test in winter, is expected to return and retake it with the arrival of spring. The familiar plant she notices after her failure serves as a symbolic anchor, suggesting her inevitable return. The geese's seasonal departure and anticipated return mirrors Saeng's temporary setback and presumed determination to try again. The author concludes by highlighting this deliberate comparison, implying that Saeng's persistence mirrors the natural, cyclical behavior of the geese, reinforcing the idea of resilience and renewed effort.
1685	10556	4	2	"The story concludes with Saeng's resolve not to succumb to despair. Earlier events, such as her test failure and longing for Vietnam, weighed heavily on her. Constant reminders of her homeland permeated her new life with her mother. The evocative sensory detail of ""light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair"" deeply affected Saeng, highlighting how pervasive these memories were. The author's concluding image emphasizes the profound impact of these experiences on Saeng, ultimately underscoring her determination to persevere despite the challenges."
1686	10557	4	2	The author concludes the story in this manner to foster a feeling of resolve. Saeng acquired the plant as a comforting memento of her homeland, aiming to uplift her spirits. With the plant's eventual bloom, she anticipates a parallel flourishing within herself, equipping her with the readiness needed to face the impending test, thereby suggesting that inner growth can mirror external growth, strengthening her resolve.
1687	10558	4	2	"The author's concluding statement, ""When the geese come back… in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again,"" resonates with themes of renewal and persistence. This powerful declaration, positioned at the end, emphasizes the cyclical nature of life and the potential for personal rebirth. Observing the hibiscus, dormant through winter, preparing to bloom anew alongside the returning geese, inspires the narrator. The hibiscus serves as a tangible symbol of resilience. Just as the plant endures the harsh winter only to flourish again, the narrator vows to confront the challenge anew. The return of the geese and the budding hibiscus become markers, signifying not just the season, but also the recommitment to her goal. The narrator desires to embody the flower's indomitable spirit, its beauty, and its capacity to renew itself regardless of circumstance, suggesting a profound connection to the natural world and a determined spirit ready to face future challenges with renewed vigor."
1688	10559	4	2	The author concludes with Saeng's resolve to retake the test, emphasizing her resilience. Failure is not final; she will strive again in the spring, a time of renewal symbolized by melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus. The hibiscus, a significant motif, represents Saeng's own growth and adaptation. While her mother felt disappointment, she seemed to understand the comfort the plant offered Saeng. Missing the test was likely due to the challenges of adjusting to a new environment, far from home. The conclusion highlights Saeng's determination to overcome these obstacles, not just for her mother's pride, but for her own sense of accomplishment, showcasing her effort to adapt and succeed in the face of adversity.
1689	10560	4	2	The story's concluding paragraph likely emphasizes Saeng's failure and future opportunity for success on the test. This interpretation is supported by the detail that Saeng spent a significant amount of money, exceeding the cost of all vegetable seeds in the garden, suggesting the test held considerable importance. Therefore, the author likely concluded in this manner to highlight the cyclical nature of opportunity and Saeng's impending second chance.
1690	10561	4	2	Next winter, she intends to be fully prepared for planting, determined to improve upon her previous efforts.
1691	10562	4	2	"The author's descriptions serve to establish the winter setting, crucial for understanding the significance of the hibiscus. The flower's impending bloom contrasts with the cold, signaling a central theme. The migrating geese further reinforce the winter season, explaining their presence. Ultimately, these details support the story's title, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" emphasizing the unusual timing of the flower's bloom and solidifying the author's deliberate choice to highlight this winter phenomenon, which informs the narrative's core."
1692	10563	4	2	"*Critical*  The story ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes with Saeng promising to return for her driver's test when her hibiscus first buds in spring. This specific ending raises questions about the conditional nature of her return. What if the plant doesn't survive the winter? Would Saeng still feel obligated to take the test? The author's choice to end the story on this uncertain note invites the reader to contemplate the deeper meaning behind Saeng's commitment and the symbolic importance of the hibiscus. The ambiguity likely serves to create a sense of suspense, leaving the reader to ponder the resolution of Saeng's journey and the fate of her winter hibiscus, thus solidifying the story's thematic resonance."
1693	10564	4	2	"The story concludes with hope because @CAPS1 finds resilience in the hibiscus, promising success in her next trial. The time it takes for the flower to bloom becomes a period of personal growth, preparing her for the challenges ahead. As the narrative notes, ""Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world,"" suggesting that Saeng's happy upbringing, filled with love, is a source of strength (Ho). The hibiscus, in particular, acts as a powerful trigger, unlocking cherished memories. However, these memories are bittersweet. The passage reveals, ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her,"" indicating that confronting past sadness will ultimately fortify her (Ho). Beyond its visual impact, the hibiscus's texture also evokes poignant recollections. ""It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center – just as she had known it would feel,"" reminding Saeng of intimate moments like assisting her grandmother. These sensory details, intertwined with her past, empower Saeng. Therefore, the hibiscus serves as a catalyst for emotional and personal development, ensuring that Saeng's next attempt at the test will be met with newfound strength and resolve."
1694	10565	4	2	As winter's grip loosens and spring breathes new life into the landscape, a renewed sense of purpose stirs within her. The melting snow, a symbol of challenges overcome, reveals a path forward. This thaw signifies not an end, but a beginning, a chance to revisit the test she faced before. The narrative finds its resolution in the promise of spring; with the snow gone, she will take the test again, armed with experience and a resilient spirit, ready to confront the challenge anew.
1695	10566	4	2	Saeng's return is marked by a palpable sense of relief, a clear indication of her happiness at being back. The sentiment is further amplified by her expressed willingness to repeat the experience if circumstances demanded it. This paints a picture of resilience and perhaps even a hidden enjoyment amidst whatever challenges she faced. The relief she feels underscores the difficulties of her absence, contrasting sharply with her ready acceptance of a potential repeat, suggesting a complex emotional landscape where hardship is met with surprising fortitude. Her words create an image of someone who, despite the challenges, finds a certain strength and resolve within the experience itself. Thus, it is evident that Saeng's feelings are indicative of an experience she is glad to have completed, while also ready to repeat if necessary.
1696	10567	4	2	The story's conclusion seems intrinsically linked to the chill in the air, the author's final sentiments mirroring the external environment. I believe the author's intent is to convey that the letter was composed during a period of cold weather and that this cold directly influenced her decision to postpone retaking the test. The vivid imagery of springtime – melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus – serves as a symbolic counterpoint to the present cold, representing a future, more favorable time for academic endeavors. The author is explicitly stating she will postpone the test until Spring; that is when the weather warms up and she is ready to complete the test. Therefore, the conclusion of the story is directly related to the author's distaste for the cold.
1697	10568	4	2	"The author’s depiction of Saeng vowing to retake the test in spring, “when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” highlights the profound significance of this moment. Having sacrificed everything to immigrate, failure is not an option for her. The hibiscus hedge, a tangible link to her past life and her mother, represents more than just a plant; it is something ""she could hold on to."" The budding hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning, mirroring Saeng's own growth and adaptation to a new life, driving her determination to succeed. Thus, her vow is deeply rooted in her past and her hopes for the future."
1698	10569	4	2	The author concludes with this paragraph due to the potential for improved outcomes with future attempts, now informed by experience. Repeated endeavors offer the possibility of refining the process and increasing production. Should these efforts yield a surplus, the author envisions commercializing the product, suggesting a long-term commitment driven by potential profitability, thus explaining the author's optimism for future trials.
1699	10570	4	2	"The conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" resolves Saeng's internal conflict, highlighting her resilience. The winter season mirrors the challenges of adapting to a new country, much like the hibiscus itself. The mention of spring blossoms symbolizes Saeng's unwavering determination to overcome these hardships. Ultimately, the final paragraph suggests Saeng will succeed in her endeavors, emphasizing her enduring spirit and resolve to persevere. The ending underscores Saeng's fighting spirit."
1700	10571	4	2	The concluding paragraph reveals Saeng's future actions, hinting at whether she'll embrace school. Her reluctance stems from a longing for the snow to melt, the geese to return, and the winter hibiscus's vibrant bloom. Gardening, a practice more appealing than school, evokes powerful memories of her homeland. The sounds of eggs being beaten and oil sizzling, mingled with the bitter melon's aroma, all contribute to this connection. Specifically, Saeng's careful planting of the hibiscus, digging a hole in the vegetable patch, demonstrates her deep care for the garden and, by extension, her roots. This act of planting suggests a commitment to nurturing life and memory, perhaps foreshadowing a path diverging from traditional schooling but deeply rooted in her heritage and personal growth.
1701	10572	4	2	The story concludes with Saeng's vow to retake the test in spring, coinciding with the return of nature's cycles and the hibiscus's budding. This is because the author emphasizes the significance of nature, particularly the hibiscus plant, to Saeng. The text suggests Saeng believes the hibiscus aids her success, evidenced by her habit of rubbing its leaves when facing difficulties. Thus, the author illustrates the plant's role as a source of strength and resilience for Saeng in overcoming obstacles, solidifying the idea of nature as a valuable asset to Saeng.
1702	10573	4	2	Saeng, at the story's close, resolves to attempt the driver's test the following year. Her vow stems partly from a desire for self-validation, a need to demonstrate her ability to succeed. Furthermore, the act of purchasing and planting the flower, coupled with the subsequent reflections on her cherished memories of Vietnam, instilled in her a newfound confidence. This surge of assurance empowers her to actively pursue her aspirations, solidifying her determination to obtain her driver's license and move forward with purpose.
1703	10574	4	2	The author's inclusion of that statement functions as sarcasm, signaling the improbability of Saeng retaking the test. This can be inferred because the statement's intent is not literal. It's a form of indirect refusal, similar to responding to a request with an impossible condition. The author employs this to highlight the extremely low likelihood of Saeng taking the test again, communicating this sentiment more vividly than a direct denial. Therefore, the author uses sarcasm to effectively convey Saeng's reluctance.
1704	10575	4	2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's enduring resilience. Ho uses the imagery of the plant and geese to symbolize the ongoing nature of Saeng's life in the United States. The cyclical return of the geese and the Hibiscus's budding and flowering mirror Saeng's persistence as she prepares to retake her diving test, hopefully succeeding this time. Therefore, the paragraph serves not merely as a conclusion, but as a representation of new beginnings for the geese, the Hibiscus, and, most importantly, Saeng, showing her unwavering spirit.
1705	10576	4	2	Saeng's final internal monologue demonstrates her resilience and hope.

This concluding paragraph underscores the importance of patience and persistence in achieving goals, acknowledging that setbacks are a natural part of the process and that continued effort ultimately leads to success.
1706	10577	4	2	Saeng's spirits were low after failing her driving test. The concluding paragraph highlights a turning point; seeing the flowers sparked a realization. She'd become so consumed by @CAPS1 that she'd lost touch with her roots and the natural world she knew back home. This prompted a change in perspective. Rather than immediately retaking the test, Saeng decided to reconnect with nature and postpone her driving test until spring, choosing a slower, more mindful approach, which ultimately made her feel more at peace with her current situation.
1707	10578	4	2	"The concluding paragraph suggests the author's intent to convey Saeng's enduring hope for finding belonging and happiness. The hibiscus plant, symbolizing home and cherished memories with her grandmother, serves as a catalyst for her emotional readiness to embrace her new life, culminating in her decision to take the driving test when it blooms. Furthermore, the paragraph illustrates Saeng's gradual assimilation into her new environment, exemplified by her growing familiarity with her surroundings. The author writes, ""A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks dear andñyesñfamiliar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese."" These instances underscore Saeng's increasing acceptance of her situation and adaptation to her new lifestyle, indicating that the concluding paragraph serves to highlight Saeng's acculturation and acceptance."

More broadly, the ending underscores Saeng's resilient character, highlighting her determination to navigate the challenges of adapting to life in the United States, far from her original home. The quote, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before. had become... almost familiar,"" exemplifies this successful integration. Ultimately, the story's conclusion emphasizes Saeng's unwavering spirit and her capacity to overcome adversity, leaving the reader with a sense of optimism for her future endeavors."
1710	10581	4	2	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to suggest the protagonist's eventual adaptation to her new homeland by the following year.

1711	10582	4	2	"The author informs the reader of their intention to repeat the same process next year, after the show concludes, the geese return, and the weather warms sufficiently for the hibiscus to bud and bloom. The author, in @MONTH1, also concludes by emphasizing that this cyclical gardening activity is the chosen lifestyle of the ""little give,"" a pattern she will continue with new gardening endeavors until the following spring arrives."
1712	10584	4	2	Saeng ended the story with that paragraph to illustrate her recent ordeal and the possibility of recurrence. Should she fail the driving test again, she envisions utilizing the plants as a source of strength. She might actually pass @MONTH1. The special plants symbolize a newfound resilience and self-assurance, stemming from a connection to her childhood memories, suggesting a sense of comfort and empowerment that bolsters her confidence in facing future challenges.
1713	10585	4	2	The girl's affection for her grandmother is evident in their shared activities, particularly their gardening. The reader sees a bond forged through tending the earth. In contrast, her relationship with her mother is defined by a stricter, more controlling dynamic, though the mother's care is undeniable. This creates a tension between the nurturing comfort of the grandmother and the discipline imposed by her mother, highlighting differing forms of familial love and guidance.
1714	10586	4	2	The story's conclusion is profoundly eye-opening, revealing that even after @MONTH1's events, regardless of hardship and despair, improvement remains possible. Despite failing her test, navigating a new country, and grieving her grandmother's loss, Saeng resolved to persevere. Like relentless waves persistently returning to the shore, Saeng demonstrates a willingness to try again, a resilience we should all emulate, highlighting the enduring power of hope and perseverance in the face of adversity.
1715	10587	4	2	The final paragraph arrived like the last leaf falling, signaling closure. The narrative arc, once vibrant with possibility, had reached its natural conclusion. We had journeyed with the characters through their trials and triumphs, witnessed their growth and setbacks, and now, the curtain was falling on their story. The author, with a deft hand, brought the tale to a satisfying, albeit bittersweet, end. That final paragraph wasn't just a period; it was a transition. It marked the end of one chapter, one phase, one complete cycle. The season depicted within the story had run its course, the harvest gathered, and the fields lay fallow, awaiting the promise of spring. The characters stood at a threshold, ready or not, to face whatever the future held, separate from the confines of the tale we had just experienced. Therefore, that concluding paragraph, resonant with finality, served as a poignant reminder that every ending paves the way for a new beginning, a fresh start, and a brand new season in the grand tapestry of life.
1716	10588	4	2	Saeng's vow, uttered in the story's closing lines, foreshadows a renewed attempt at the test upon the hibiscus's budding.

The author intimates a future direction for Saeng, hinting at a successful endeavor once the flower blooms, revealing how external elements can profoundly influence and motivate individual determination.
1717	10589	4	2	Saeng’s disappointment at failing her driver’s test was compounded by a deep homesickness for Vietnam. As she walked, dejected, a splash of color caught her eye – a winter hibiscus, or *saebba*, a vibrant reminder of her homeland. She purchased the plant, a tangible piece of Vietnam in the United States, hoping to bridge the two disparate worlds of her life. The story culminates in a symbolic merging of these cultures. Saeng’s thoughts turn to the geese, now a familiar part of her adopted landscape, representing her growing comfort and adaptation to American life. The hibiscus, on the other hand, embodies her Vietnamese heritage, evoking cherished memories and providing solace. She decides that “when they come back” – the geese, symbolizing her integration – and when the hibiscus is budding, thriving in its new environment, she will attempt the test again. The hibiscus's growth mirrors her own journey; only when her connection to Vietnam remains strong, even as she establishes roots in American culture, will she feel ready to face the challenge, demonstrating that embracing both cultures is the key to her success.

She recalled the resilient Madagascar periwinkles, thriving in the unlikeliest of urban crevices. In essence, the author concludes with Saeng's readiness to seek out and nurture plants reminiscent of her home, a tangible connection to her past.

The author's deliberate inclusion of the budding hibiscus in the final paragraph symbolizes Saeng's evolving acceptance of her new environment. This symbolic rebirth mirrors Saeng’s renewed optimism regarding her future success on the driving test. Furthermore, the paragraph highlights Saeng’s growing connection with the Canadian landscape.
