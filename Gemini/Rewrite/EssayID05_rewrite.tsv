432	12258	5	2	We moved a lot when I was a kid. Each new house was just that: a house. Walls, a roof, bedrooms – all technically correct but utterly devoid of warmth. It wasn't until Aunt Carol and Uncle Ray took us in, after… well, after everything, that I understood the difference. Their place wasn't fancy. The paint was peeling in the kitchen, and the living room furniture was older than me. But it felt different. There were always smells of baking, laughter echoing through the halls, and a sense of belonging I’d never known before. Carol wasn’t my blood, nor Ray, but they became Mom and Dad in every way that mattered. They taught me about love, loyalty, and what it truly means to be a family. We weren’t connected by genetics, but by choice, by shared experiences, by unwavering support. Through them, I learned that family extends far beyond bloodlines. My childhood homes were merely buildings, but Carol and Ray gave me something more profound; they gave me a home, proving that a house is not the same as a home.
